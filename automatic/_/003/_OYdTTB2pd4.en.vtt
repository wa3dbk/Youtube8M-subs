lid<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.910> let<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:56.970> cook<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.270> rest<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.540> way

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
lid and let it cook the rest of the way

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.870 
lid and let it cook the rest of the way
on<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.960> grill<00:04:00.680> okay<00:04:01.680> why<00:04:02.130> why<00:04:02.460> pull<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.760> meat

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
on the grill okay why why pull the meat

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.940 
on the grill okay why why pull the meat
off<00:04:02.910> at<00:04:03.150> all<00:04:03.270> at<00:04:03.480> 160<00:04:04.140> degrees<00:04:04.440> when<00:04:04.680> it's<00:04:04.800> not

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
off at all at 160 degrees when it's not

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.430 
off at all at 160 degrees when it's not
done<00:04:05.190> it's<00:04:05.430> got<00:04:05.610> cooked<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:05.940> like<00:04:06.030> 190<00:04:06.990> to<00:04:07.080> 200

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
done it's got cooked I like 190 to 200

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.380 
done it's got cooked I like 190 to 200
degrees<00:04:07.680> well<00:04:08.460> the<00:04:08.550> reason<00:04:08.790> for<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.150> is<00:04:09.360> that

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
degrees well the reason for that is that

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.370 
degrees well the reason for that is that
the<00:04:09.690> meat<00:04:10.620> has<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:10.860> render<00:04:11.780> all<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:13.050> tough

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
the meat has to render all that tough

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.070 
the meat has to render all that tough
collagen<00:04:13.890> inside<00:04:14.250> its<00:04:14.430> tissues<00:04:15.150> until<00:04:15.540> liquid

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
collagen inside its tissues until liquid

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.380 
collagen inside its tissues until liquid
gelatin<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.910> that's<00:04:17.910> what<00:04:18.030> makes<00:04:18.209> the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
gelatin and that's what makes the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.570 
gelatin and that's what makes the
barbecue<00:04:18.870> taste<00:04:19.290> so<00:04:19.410> good<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.830> what<00:04:20.459> do<00:04:20.519> you

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
barbecue taste so good and what do you

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.460 
barbecue taste so good and what do you
do<00:04:20.850> at<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.000> point<00:04:21.330> is<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.260> want<00:04:22.410> to

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
do at that point is that you want to

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.590 
do at that point is that you want to
make<00:04:22.650> sure<00:04:23.000> that<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.150> don't<00:04:24.270> want<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.450> lose

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
make sure that you don't want to lose

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.810 
make sure that you don't want to lose
some<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.810> these<00:04:24.930> juices<00:04:25.250> because<00:04:26.250> always<00:04:26.520> the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
some of these juices because always the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.820 
some of these juices because always the
meat<00:04:26.970> might<00:04:27.120> dry<00:04:27.360> out<00:04:27.510> or<00:04:27.720> will<00:04:27.870> dry<00:04:28.080> out<00:04:28.110> so

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
meat might dry out or will dry out so

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.110 
meat might dry out or will dry out so
what<00:04:28.950> you<00:04:29.040> do<00:04:29.190> is<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.460> you<00:04:29.550> put<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:29.820> in<00:04:29.970> a

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
what you do is that you put it in a

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.290 
what you do is that you put it in a
Dutch<00:04:30.930> oven<00:04:31.080> in<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.350> rapid<00:04:31.620> boil<00:04:31.950> right<00:04:32.940> as<00:04:33.090> the

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
Dutch oven in a rapid boil right as the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.850 
Dutch oven in a rapid boil right as the
fat<00:04:33.600> starts<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.110> render<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.590> that's<00:04:34.740> that's

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
fat starts to render and that's that's

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.330 
fat starts to render and that's that's
about<00:04:35.280> 160<00:04:36.030> 170<00:04:36.600> degrees<00:04:37.320> in<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:37.680> range<00:04:37.890> and

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
about 160 170 degrees in that range and

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.310 
about 160 170 degrees in that range and
then<00:04:38.700> then<00:04:39.420> you'll<00:04:39.570> start<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.780> render<00:04:39.960> in<00:04:40.230> the

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
then then you'll start to render in the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.870 
then then you'll start to render in the
foil<00:04:40.590> or<00:04:40.830> in<00:04:40.920> the<00:04:41.010> Dutch<00:04:41.130> oven<00:04:41.280> all<00:04:41.580> that

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
foil or in the Dutch oven all that

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.550 
foil or in the Dutch oven all that
liquid<00:04:42.060> will<00:04:42.300> then<00:04:42.450> base<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.870> meat<00:04:43.050> keep<00:04:43.410> it

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
liquid will then base the meat keep it

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.530 
liquid will then base the meat keep it
moist<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:43.980> be<00:04:44.280> part<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.700> final<00:04:45.000> dish<00:04:45.180> so

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
moist and be part of the final dish so

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.890 
moist and be part of the final dish so
that's<00:04:45.720> why<00:04:45.840> we<00:04:45.960> do<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:47.540> it<00:04:48.540> meets<00:04:48.690> about

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
that's why we do that it meets about

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.540 
that's why we do that it meets about
ready<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:49.110> come<00:04:49.290> off<00:04:49.440> right<00:04:49.650> now<00:04:49.860> what<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.370> got

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
it's the little tough it's not tenderize

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.070 
it's the little tough it's not tenderize
yet<00:05:19.860> that's<00:05:20.730> that's<00:05:21.180> step<00:05:21.510> two<00:05:21.660> of<00:05:21.750> this<00:05:21.870> this

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
yet that's that's step two of this this

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.570 
yet that's that's step two of this this
first<00:05:22.350> half<00:05:22.680> of<00:05:22.800> cooking<00:05:23.010> was<00:05:23.130> really<00:05:23.340> just<00:05:23.430> to

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
first half of cooking was really just to

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.360 
first half of cooking was really just to
add<00:05:23.729> add<00:05:24.330> some<00:05:24.690> smoked<00:05:24.960> flavor<00:05:25.260> to<00:05:25.830> it<00:05:25.860> like<00:05:26.280> a

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
add add some smoked flavor to it like a

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.320 
add add some smoked flavor to it like a
brisket<00:05:29.120> okay<00:05:30.120> on<00:05:30.450> we<00:05:30.690> go<00:05:30.840> with<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.080> pot<00:05:32.330> right

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
brisket okay on we go with the pot right

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.120 
brisket okay on we go with the pot right
there<00:05:34.460> close<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.669> lid<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:36.620> let<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:37.800> go<00:05:38.100> for

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
there close the lid and let that go for

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.560 
there close the lid and let that go for
a<00:05:38.700> little<00:05:39.030> probably<00:05:39.330> one<00:05:39.660> more<00:05:39.690> hours<00:05:41.570> it's

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
a little probably one more hours it's

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.930 
a little probably one more hours it's
been<00:05:42.720> several<00:05:43.590> hours<00:05:43.740> probably<00:05:44.550> have<00:05:44.729> only

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
been several hours probably have only

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.860 
been several hours probably have only
five<00:05:45.330> since<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:45.780> started<00:05:46.020> this<00:05:46.229> project<00:05:46.470> I

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
five since I started this project I

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.780 
five since I started this project I
assume<00:05:48.870> that<00:05:49.680> my

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
assume that my
