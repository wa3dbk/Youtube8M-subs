what<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:23.909> thinking<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.360> Ariel<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
what I was thinking of Ariel all that

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.840 
what I was thinking of Ariel all that
came<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> mind<00:01:25.860> was<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.280> scene<00:01:26.490> when<00:01:26.670> she's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
came to mind was the scene when she's

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.580 
came to mind was the scene when she's
first<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> beach<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.930> Eric<00:01:28.409> after

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
first on the beach with like Eric after

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.469 
first on the beach with like Eric after
she<00:01:28.920> pulls<00:01:29.460> them<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.000> water<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
she pulls them out of the water and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.569 
she pulls them out of the water and
she's<00:01:30.780> singing<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.409> beautifully<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.159> pulled<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
actually blend it out with a brush in a

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:10.140 
actually blend it out with a brush in a
minute<00:04:08.040> these<00:04:09.040> have<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.220> relatively<00:04:09.819> quick

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
minute these have a relatively quick

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.819 
minute these have a relatively quick
setting<00:04:10.569> times<00:04:10.810> I'm<00:04:10.959> actually<00:04:11.109> just<00:04:11.440> going<00:04:11.680> to

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
setting times I'm actually just going to

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.599

blend<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.489> with<00:04:12.909> a<00:04:13.500> little<00:04:14.500> brush<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.069> I<00:04:15.400> think

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
blend it with a little brush and I think

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.219 
blend it with a little brush and I think
this<00:04:15.729> is<00:04:15.819> actually<00:04:15.970> just<00:04:16.359> like<00:04:16.539> a<00:04:16.599> Maybelline

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229

beautiful beautiful coral and it was

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.620 
beautiful beautiful coral and it was

today but I think that it's easily
doable<00:06:01.550> and<00:06:01.970> you<00:06:02.030> can<00:06:02.180> see<00:06:02.390> it's<00:06:02.660> just<00:06:02.750> a<00:06:03.050> coral

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
doable and you can see it's just a coral

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.070 
doable and you can see it's just a coral
with<00:06:03.710> a<00:06:03.740> good<00:06:04.070> bit<00:06:04.310> of<00:06:04.340> pink<00:06:04.640> to<00:06:04.880> it<00:06:05.030> so<00:06:05.270> I'm

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
with a good bit of pink to it so I'm

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:13.000

just going to spread that on lips and

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.350 
just going to spread that on lips and
