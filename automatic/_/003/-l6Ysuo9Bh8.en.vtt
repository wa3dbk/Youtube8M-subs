00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
this little spot that kind of I lost her

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.729 
this little spot that kind of I lost her
again<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.450> look<00:00:45.570> very<00:00:45.989> very<00:00:46.110> closely

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
again but if you look very very closely

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.639 
again but if you look very very closely
you<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.489> where<00:00:48.210> she's<00:00:49.140> having<00:00:49.379> these

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you can see where she's having these

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.430 
you can see where she's having these
spots<00:00:49.980> where<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.399> see<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> little

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
spots where you can see the little

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.350 
spots where you can see the little
yellow<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> danger<00:00:53.219> ping<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:54.030> distorted

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
yellow on the danger ping be distorted

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.229 
yellow on the danger ping be distorted
and<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> again<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.280> kind<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.609> lost<00:00:59.820> her<00:01:00.000> when<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and so again I kind of lost her when the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.510 
and so again I kind of lost her when the
base<00:01:00.420> exploded<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.289> then<00:01:01.649> was<00:01:02.039> able<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.309> find

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
base exploded but then was able to find

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.630 
base exploded but then was able to find
her<00:01:02.670> again<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.350> see<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
her again and see if you you can see the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.190 
her again and see if you you can see the
distortion<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.390> comes<00:01:06.600> from<00:01:06.780> those<00:01:06.900> pings

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
distortion that comes from those pings

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.870 
distortion that comes from those pings
and<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> best<00:01:08.280> example<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and this is the best example that I

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.280 
and this is the best example that I
could<00:01:09.000> find<00:01:09.330> because<00:01:09.689> she<00:01:09.750> decided<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.110> stand

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
could find because she decided to stand

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.080 
could find because she decided to stand
still<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:10.890> bit<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.000> at

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
still for a little bit you can see at

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.000 
still for a little bit you can see at
the<00:01:12.210> bottom<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> danger<00:01:13.080> ping<00:01:13.290> all<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the bottom of the danger ping all this

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.670 
the bottom of the danger ping all this
distortion<00:01:14.610> around<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.869> very<00:01:16.200> easy<00:01:16.409> for

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
distortion around it it's very easy for

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.840 
distortion around it it's very easy for
your<00:01:16.920> teammates<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.670> well

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
your teammates to see this as well

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.950 
your teammates to see this as well
because<00:01:17.970> normally<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> things<00:01:18.780> look<00:01:18.930> very

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
because normally the things look very

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.730 
because normally the things look very
crisp<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.549> by<00:01:21.210> doing<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.720> my<00:01:22.320> team<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
crisp and so by doing this my team and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.130 
crisp and so by doing this my team and
while<00:01:22.860> I'm<00:01:23.009> dead<00:01:23.280> I'm<00:01:23.610> able<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.939> contribute<00:01:24.450> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
while I'm dead I'm able to contribute to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.710 
while I'm dead I'm able to contribute to
my<00:01:25.290> team<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.670> feel<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> very

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
my team so I feel like this is a very

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.510 
my team so I feel like this is a very
useful<00:01:28.259> strategy<00:01:29.030> as<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.479> see<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:31.520> I

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
useful strategy as you can see I I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.090 
useful strategy as you can see I I
pinged<00:01:33.060> her<00:01:33.180> again<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.990> show<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.950> she<00:01:35.070> was

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
pinged her again to show that she was

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.760 
pinged her again to show that she was
still<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.490> my<00:01:36.150> team<00:01:36.420> got<00:01:36.689> vision<00:01:37.200> they<00:01:37.590> had

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
still there my team got vision they had

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.830 
still there my team got vision they had
a<00:01:37.799> good<00:01:38.040> idea<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:38.520> got<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:39.240> something<00:01:39.659> but

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
a good idea they got to do something but

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
a good idea they got to do something but
because<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.290> were<00:01:40.350> two<00:01:40.470> levels<00:01:40.619> behind<00:01:41.040> really

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
because we were two levels behind really

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.760 
because we were two levels behind really
hard<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.030> us<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.240> follow<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.200> was<00:01:43.320> 4<00:01:43.649> V

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
hard for us to follow up and it was 4 V

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.920 
hard for us to follow up and it was 4 V
5<00:01:44.009> 3<00:01:44.670> v<00:01:44.820> 5<00:01:45.259> if<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.710> would<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:46.950> all<00:01:47.040> been<00:01:47.070> up

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
5 3 v 5 if we would have all been up

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.139 
5 3 v 5 if we would have all been up
then<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.770> would<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.070> been<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.549> much<00:01:50.820> closer

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
then this would have been a much closer

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.670 
then this would have been a much closer
game<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.869> might<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.290> won<00:01:52.530> us<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
game like that might have won us the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.950 
game like that might have won us the
game<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.420> here's<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:54.720> thing<00:01:54.899> I
