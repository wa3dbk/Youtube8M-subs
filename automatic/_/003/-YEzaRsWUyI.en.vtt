against the armored targets decoys get
great<00:01:47.330> against<00:01:47.659> everything<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:48.799> is

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
great against everything and so is

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.070 
great against everything and so is
energy<00:01:49.429> drain<00:01:49.670> there's<00:01:50.270> a<00:01:50.390> talent<00:01:50.750> point<00:01:50.929> in

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
energy drain there's a talent point in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.889 
energy drain there's a talent point in
energy<00:01:51.470> drain<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:52.880> can<00:01:53.060> either<00:01:53.179> reduce

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
energy drain that you can either reduce

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.609 
energy drain that you can either reduce
the<00:01:54.049> cooldown<00:01:54.610> or<00:01:55.610> increase<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.479> areds<00:01:57.319> path

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
the cooldown or increase the areds path

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.649 
the cooldown or increase the areds path
fifty<00:01:58.490> percent<00:01:58.819> I<00:01:58.970> believe<00:01:59.209> one<00:01:59.420> hundred

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
fifty percent I believe one hundred

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.810 
fifty percent I believe one hundred
percent

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.910 

pop<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.090> check<00:02:03.210> them<00:02:03.360> out<00:02:03.420> later<00:02:03.480> but<00:02:03.920> one

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
pop and check them out later but one

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.940 
pop and check them out later but one
hundred<00:02:05.220> percent<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.760> it<00:02:06.020> it's<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.350> good<00:02:07.830> as

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
hundred percent so it it's as good as

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.800 
hundred percent so it it's as good as
over<00:02:08.070> charged<00:02:08.430> but<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.090> main<00:02:09.270> difference<00:02:09.300> is
