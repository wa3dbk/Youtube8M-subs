00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 I'm going to teach you how to make a mark today. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.560
 of rainbow 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.759
 besides the common ingredients to make 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.670
 a pasta 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.270
 You will need some 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.670
 food and also of plastic sachets is 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.789
 one plastic bag for each dye 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.400
 before making the rainbow part 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.019
 Let's do the pasta part. 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.029
 first I'll fill a pot until the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.480
 half with water and then put a 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.210
 bit of oil a pinch of salt and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.629
 half a bag of spaghetti that gives more 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.530
 or less for two people and now it's just 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.530
 take it here on fire 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.829
 the size of the herd 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.880
 the pole there 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.920
 You will know if the pasta is already in the 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.250
 point placing a small piece of a house 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.720
 mouth and seeing the texture and cattail 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.830
 the taste is already good 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.260
 in our case we can not let 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.880
 cook lots of pasta because otherwise he 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.909
 will be very impacted will change 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.159
 too since it is already good 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.570
 There you have to turn the fire and take away. 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.450
 excess water 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.950
 the next step is to take out the pasta 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.450
 when I have six dyes I have 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.610
 who split that amount of pasta 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 more or less in six parts put a 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.869
 car on the bottom of the sac 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.490
 and now the coolest part is 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.350
 hit a car for this I'll get 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.070
 some droplets of dye within the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.740
 spaghetti 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.990
 and then I'm kneading the pasta until the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.910
 dye if it is completely distributed 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.510
 when you do this on all the bags 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:01.620
 I let it rest for 15 minutes. 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.240
 the next step is to put a 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.130
 bit of water in here to take 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.620
 the excess of dye after we 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.740
 also takes water out and the penultimate 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.070
 thing to do is to mix an entire 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.070
 car 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.319
 The last step to this is 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.060
 delicious after all this 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.000
 colorful pasta 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.549
 It gives only a cold pasta is put 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:57.139
 a spoonful of butter carried 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:57.139
 microwave - smell is very good 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.020
 it's a walk too more recipes 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.620
 two days starts here you find yourself in a 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.620
 world manual 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.730
 one thing that I think could be 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.400
 improved this recipe that I missed one 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.099
 little was the best arvada could have 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.810
 pasta because the stronger colors do not 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.180
 to ruin things there the bad things 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.000
 weak then yellow noodles is over 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.280
