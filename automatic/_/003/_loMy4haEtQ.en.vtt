French white tip with gels and I'm gonna
use<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.660> practice<00:00:48.960> finger<00:00:49.590> what<00:00:50.340> you're

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
use this practice finger what you're

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.290 
use this practice finger what you're
gonna<00:00:50.640> need<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.750> white<00:00:52.610> gel<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.970> this<00:00:54.240> is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
gonna need is a white gel and this is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.720 
gonna need is a white gel and this is
one<00:00:54.570> from<00:00:54.930> IBD<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.650> it's<00:00:56.010> called<00:00:56.340> winter

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
one from IBD and it's called winter

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.210 
one from IBD and it's called winter
white<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:58.110> to<00:00:58.200> be<00:00:58.290> using<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.830> IBD

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
white I'm going to be using the IBD

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.510 
white I'm going to be using the IBD
clear<00:00:59.730> gel<00:01:00.150> and<00:01:00.739> as<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.890> guys<00:01:02.040> remember<00:01:02.340> I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
clear gel and as you guys remember I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.220 
clear gel and as you guys remember I
showed<00:01:02.580> you<00:01:02.820> there's<00:01:03.150> two<00:01:03.540> different<00:01:03.930> types

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
showed you there's two different types

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.800 
showed you there's two different types
of<00:01:04.500> clear<00:01:05.040> gels<00:01:05.370> one<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> Builder<00:01:06.600> gel

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
of clear gels one is the Builder gel

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.350 
of clear gels one is the Builder gel
which<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.200> thicker<00:01:07.530> viscosity<00:01:08.180> this<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
which is a thicker viscosity this is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.940 
which is a thicker viscosity this is
perfect<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:09.960> you're<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.380> starting<00:01:10.620> out

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
perfect if you're just starting out

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.700 
perfect if you're just starting out
working<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.550> gels<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.479> thicker<00:01:12.780> viscosity<00:01:13.020> is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
working on gels the thicker viscosity is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.650 
working on gels the thicker viscosity is
easier<00:01:14.130> because<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.700> allows<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.270> place

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
easier because it allows you to place

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.690 
easier because it allows you to place
the<00:01:15.900> gel<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.890> won't<00:01:17.130> run<00:01:17.310> into<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the gel and it won't run into the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.430 
the gel and it won't run into the
cuticles<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.540> gives<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.810> more<00:01:18.960> time<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
cuticles and it gives you more time to

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.600 
cuticles and it gives you more time to
work<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.670> nail<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.950> for<00:01:22.950> myself<00:01:23.130> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
work on the nail and for myself I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.460 
work on the nail and for myself I
actually<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:24.060> using<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.810> clear<00:01:25.050> gel<00:01:25.290> this

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
actually like using the clear gel this

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.219 
actually like using the clear gel this
is<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.770> thinner<00:01:26.190> viscosity<00:01:27.000> which<00:01:27.750> means<00:01:28.080> you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
is a thinner viscosity which means you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.380 
is a thinner viscosity which means you
don't<00:01:28.410> have<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.800> much<00:01:29.009> time<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> work<00:01:29.580> with<00:01:29.820> it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
don't have as much time to work with it

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.540 
don't have as much time to work with it
but<00:01:30.690> I<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:31.890> better<00:01:32.430> for

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
but I like it it's actually better for

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.800 
but I like it it's actually better for
me<00:01:32.910> I'm<00:01:33.090> more<00:01:33.119> used<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:35.330> this<00:01:36.330> is<00:01:36.390> what

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
me I'm more used to it and this is what

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.350 
me I'm more used to it and this is what
I<00:01:36.840> prefer<00:01:37.140> using<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.580> is<00:01:38.729> also<00:01:38.910> good<00:01:39.150> for

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
I prefer using and this is also good for

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.840 
I prefer using and this is also good for
refills<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:40.110> well<00:01:40.500> I'm<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.430> be<00:01:41.520> using
