little awkward instead of shifting gears

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.060 
little awkward instead of shifting gears
you<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.960> turn<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> knob<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.739> goes<00:00:58.890> between

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you just turn a knob and it goes between

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.490 
you just turn a knob and it goes between
reverse<00:00:59.699> or<00:00:59.910> forward<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> go<00:01:01.050> forward

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
reverse or forward this is to go forward

reverse or forward this is to go forward
this<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.550> into<00:01:02.940> reverse<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
this is to go into reverse and this

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.440 
this is to go into reverse and this
tells<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.900> bolts<00:01:07.320> amps<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:09.270> type

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
tells you bolts amps and then what type

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.940 
tells you bolts amps and then what type
of<00:01:09.479> drain<00:01:09.900> when<00:01:10.170> I'm<00:01:10.290> stepping<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> pedal

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950

this<00:01:11.369> will<00:01:11.580> crease<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.030> show<00:01:12.210> me<00:01:12.360> how<00:01:12.450> much

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
this will crease to show me how much

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.240 
this will crease to show me how much
power<00:01:12.840> I'm<00:01:12.960> taking<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> get<00:01:13.470> moving<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.979> this

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
power I'm taking to get moving and this

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.920 
power I'm taking to get moving and this
tells<00:01:14.490> me<00:01:14.580> how<00:01:14.670> much<00:01:14.850> battery<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.330> left<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
tells me how much battery is left and it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.520 
tells me how much battery is left and it
counts<00:01:16.049> down<00:01:16.380> until<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.710> get<00:01:16.770> close<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.220> empty

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
counts down until I get close to empty

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.149 
counts down until I get close to empty
it's<00:01:19.530> quick

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
it's quick

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
it's quick
makes<00:01:20.580> no<00:01:20.790> noise<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.210> makes<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.479> real

makes no noise it makes a real
high-pitched<00:01:21.869> scream<00:01:22.560> when<00:01:23.130> it's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
high-pitched scream when it's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.469 
high-pitched scream when it's
