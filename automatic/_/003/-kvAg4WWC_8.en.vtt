okay<00:00:04.140> this<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.620> Evans<00:00:04.920> Chris<00:00:05.310> well<00:00:05.810> what<00:00:06.810> I'm

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
okay this is Evans Chris well what I'm

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.690 
okay this is Evans Chris well what I'm
showing<00:00:07.230> here<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> program<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.370> have<00:00:08.670> not

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
showing here is a program I have not

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.749 
showing here is a program I have not
touched<00:00:09.179> for<00:00:09.690> 19<00:00:10.260> years<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:11.219> was<00:00:11.370> written<00:00:11.550> in

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
touched for 19 years it was written in

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.970 
touched for 19 years it was written in
turbo<00:00:12.179> Pascal<00:00:13.009> under<00:00:14.009> ms-dos<00:00:14.750> back<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:16.020> 1989

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
turbo Pascal under ms-dos back in 1989

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.400 
turbo Pascal under ms-dos back in 1989
and<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.090> messed<00:00:18.300> with<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.630> program<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.260> made

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
and I messed with the program and made

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.660 
and I messed with the program and made
some<00:00:19.619> changes<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.400> through<00:00:20.640> 91<00:00:22.430> it<00:00:23.430> turned

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
some changes to it through 91 it turned

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.330 
some changes to it through 91 it turned
into<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.000> digital<00:00:24.269> clock<00:00:24.949> that<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> would<00:00:26.189> leave

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
into a digital clock that I would leave

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.160 
into a digital clock that I would leave
running<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> screen<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.269> lot<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.900> wouldn't

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
running on the screen a lot I wouldn't

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.720 
running on the screen a lot I wouldn't
have<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.410> running<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.740> scoreboard<00:00:29.310> mode<00:00:29.519> like

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
have it running in scoreboard mode like

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.160 
have it running in scoreboard mode like
this<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.269> would<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.660> running<00:00:31.019> just

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
this I would have it running just

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.440 
this I would have it running just
displaying<00:00:31.590> hours<00:00:32.460> minutes<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.880> seconds<00:00:33.300> of

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
displaying hours minutes and seconds of

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.590 
displaying hours minutes and seconds of
the<00:00:33.540> time<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.610> what<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.059> an

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the time but what this is is an

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.369 
the time but what this is is an
emulation<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> scoreboard<00:00:38.870> that<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.050> had

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
emulation of the scoreboard that we had

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.010 
emulation of the scoreboard that we had
in<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.520> junior<00:00:41.850> high<00:00:41.879> school<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.510> attended

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
in the junior high school I attended

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.270 
in the junior high school I attended
Cedartown<00:00:43.649> junior<00:00:44.250> high<00:00:44.460> school<00:00:46.280> the

Cedartown junior high school the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.240 
Cedartown junior high school the
scoreboard<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.840> very<00:00:49.289> different<00:00:49.800> than<00:00:49.950> any

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
scoreboard is very different than any

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.830 
scoreboard is very different than any
I'd<00:00:51.149> ever<00:00:51.420> seen<00:00:53.000> you<00:00:54.000> notice<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.629> makes

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
I'd ever seen you notice that it makes

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.139 
I'd ever seen you notice that it makes
the<00:00:55.110> digits<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.829> very<00:00:56.190> different<00:00:56.730> way<00:00:56.879> than

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the digits in a very different way than

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.750 
the digits in a very different way than
most<00:00:57.180> scoreboards<00:00:58.250> notice<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.550> makes

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
most scoreboards notice that it makes

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.750 
most scoreboards notice that it makes
very<00:01:00.120> nice<00:01:00.480> curved<00:01:01.170> digits<00:01:02.039> although<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
very nice curved digits although the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.990 
very nice curved digits although the
dots<00:01:02.969> aren't<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.510> close<00:01:03.750> together<00:01:05.000> I'll

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
dots aren't that close together I'll

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.190 
dots aren't that close together I'll
zoom<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.450> here<00:01:07.460> in<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:09.000> program<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.630> purposely

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
zoom in here in this program I purposely

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.740 
zoom in here in this program I purposely
drew<00:01:10.920> circles<00:01:11.520> around<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.210> bulbs<00:01:12.570> that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
drew circles around the bulbs that

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
drew circles around the bulbs that
aren't<00:01:12.990> lit<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
aren't lit so that you can see the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.780 
aren't lit so that you can see the
entire<00:01:14.850> pattern

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.570 

and<00:01:22.480> there<00:01:22.690> are<00:01:22.780> two<00:01:22.900> bulbs<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.470> are<00:01:24.040> there

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
and there are two bulbs that are there

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.300 
and there are two bulbs that are there
that<00:01:24.850> aren't<00:01:25.060> being<00:01:25.180> used<00:01:25.890> when<00:01:26.890> I<00:01:26.920> wrote<00:01:27.160> this

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
that aren't being used when I wrote this

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.840 
that aren't being used when I wrote this
program<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.350> ones<00:01:29.560> digit<00:01:30.070> I<00:01:30.160> had<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.610> one

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
program in the ones digit I had the one

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.760 
program in the ones digit I had the one
drawn<00:01:31.270> in<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:31.570> middle<00:01:32.020> instead<00:01:32.290> of<00:01:32.620> on<00:01:32.740> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
drawn in the middle instead of on the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.600 
drawn in the middle instead of on the
left<00:01:33.330> but<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.510> scoreboard<00:01:35.020> in<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.890> gym<00:01:36.130> put

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
left but the scoreboard in the gym put

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.060 
left but the scoreboard in the gym put
it<00:01:36.700> on<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.970> left<00:01:37.180> so<00:01:37.540> I<00:01:37.600> changed<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.290> style<00:01:38.860> to

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
it on the left so I changed the style to

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.510 
it on the left so I changed the style to
make<00:01:39.190> it<00:01:39.250> just<00:01:39.610> like<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.090> scoreboard<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:42.430> if

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
make it just like the scoreboard so if

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.190 
make it just like the scoreboard so if
you<00:01:42.640> took<00:01:42.880> out<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.890> bulb<00:01:45.190> here<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:46.030> this<00:01:46.480> up

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
you took out this bulb here and this up

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.020 
you took out this bulb here and this up
here<00:01:47.770> you'd<00:01:48.010> have<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.370> exact<00:01:48.700> pattern

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.880 

note<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.720> tens<00:01:55.960> digit<00:01:56.440> is<00:01:56.500> different

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
note that the tens digit is different

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.390 
note that the tens digit is different
than<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:57.100> ones<00:01:57.280> digit<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.710> four<00:01:59.920> stuck

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
than the ones digit and the four stuck

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.120 
than the ones digit and the four stuck
out<00:02:00.580> on<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.850> left<00:02:01.150> on<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:02.110> tens<00:02:02.350> digit<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:03.010> on

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
out on the left on the tens digit and on

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.860 
out on the left on the tens digit and on
the<00:02:03.280> right<00:02:03.490> on<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.910> ones<00:02:04.120> digit<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:07.450> patterns

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
the right on the ones digit the patterns

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.630 
the right on the ones digit the patterns
are<00:02:08.020> significantly<00:02:08.679> different<00:02:08.800> even<00:02:09.429> though

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
are significantly different even though

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.130 
are significantly different even though
the<00:02:09.820> individual<00:02:10.270> digits<00:02:10.690> are<00:02:10.810> made<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.110> same

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
the individual digits are made the same

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.699 
the individual digits are made the same
way<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:13.120> stem<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.690> forum<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.320> tens<00:02:14.560> digit

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
way the stem of the forum the tens digit

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.110 
way the stem of the forum the tens digit
is<00:02:15.180> used<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.330> make<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.660> wand<00:02:16.930> whereas<00:02:17.620> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
is used to make the wand whereas the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.220 
is used to make the wand whereas the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.850 
reason I'm showing this in such detail
was<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.060> would<00:02:25.240> love<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.810> know<00:02:25.989> what<00:02:26.260> company

was made it was in a school that used to
be<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.930> high<00:02:35.800> school<00:02:36.570> before<00:02:38.370> integration<00:02:41.130> and

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
be a high school before integration and

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.120 
be a high school before integration and
of<00:02:42.400> course<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.850> scoreboard<00:02:43.360> only<00:02:43.690> had<00:02:44.130> one

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
of course the scoreboard only had one

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.690 
of course the scoreboard only had one
digit<00:02:45.489> four<00:02:45.670> minutes<00:02:46.030> into<00:02:46.360> four<00:02:46.600> seconds<00:02:47.700> and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
digit four minutes into four seconds and

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.180 
digit four minutes into four seconds and
instead<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.239> having<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.540> ten<00:02:49.780> digits<00:02:50.470> for<00:02:51.070> the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
instead of having a ten digits for the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.670 
instead of having a ten digits for the
minute<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:52.120> just<00:02:52.150> had<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.630> single<00:02:52.930> bulb<00:02:53.290> on<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
minute it just had a single bulb on the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.590 
minute it just had a single bulb on the
top<00:02:53.950> right<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.700> was<00:02:54.820> owned<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.180> indicate

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
top right that was owned to indicate

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.790 
top right that was owned to indicate
that<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:56.140> one<00:02:56.560> should<00:02:56.800> be<00:02:56.950> there<00:02:58.769> then<00:02:59.769> of

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
that a one should be there then of

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.150 
that a one should be there then of
course<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:00.280> had<00:03:00.400> home<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.880> visitor<00:03:01.300> scores<00:03:02.160> by

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
course it had home and visitor scores by

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.740 
course it had home and visitor scores by
the<00:03:03.220> way<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.489> clock<00:03:03.760> on<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.090> scoreboard<00:03:04.540> was

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
the way the clock on the scoreboard was

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.770 
the way the clock on the scoreboard was
in<00:03:04.930> red<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.910> home<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.090> visitor<00:03:07.510> score

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
in red and the home and visitor score

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.210 
in red and the home and visitor score
were<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.050> green<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:11.140> home<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:11.890> visitor

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
were in green and the home and visitor

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.729 
were in green and the home and visitor
scores<00:03:12.519> had<00:03:12.850> two<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.630> one<00:03:13.840> style<00:03:14.230> digits

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
scores had two of the one style digits

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.770 
scores had two of the one style digits
which<00:03:15.489> meant<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.850> digits<00:03:16.180> had<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.420> be<00:03:16.540> farther

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
which meant the digits had to be farther

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.720 
which meant the digits had to be farther
apart<00:03:17.019> because<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.709> four<00:03:17.890> stuck<00:03:18.220> out<00:03:18.400> on<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
apart because the four stuck out on the

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.780 
apart because the four stuck out on the
right<00:03:18.880> on<00:03:19.120> both<00:03:19.330> of<00:03:19.570> them
