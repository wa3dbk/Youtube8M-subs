the aw FS fair in Las Vegas and this

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.070 
the aw FS fair in Las Vegas and this
works<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.530> lot<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:05.030> other<00:01:06.030> CA<00:01:06.540> glues<00:01:07.049> that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
works a lot like other CA glues that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.230 
works a lot like other CA glues that
you've<00:01:07.530> tried<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> biggest<00:01:08.880> difference

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
you've tried but the biggest difference

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.620 
you've tried but the biggest difference
that<00:01:09.990> makes<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.409> specifically<00:01:11.630> more

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
that makes it specifically more

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.320 
that makes it specifically more
applicable<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.439> woodworking<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:15.119> it

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
applicable for woodworking is that it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.320 
applicable for woodworking is that it
has<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.590> longer<00:01:16.590> open<00:01:17.159> time<00:01:17.430> three<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.119> five

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
has a longer open time three to five

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.590 
has a longer open time three to five
minutes<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:20.490> much<00:01:20.729> easier<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.240> work<00:01:21.540> with

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
minutes so it's much easier to work with

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480 
minutes so it's much easier to work with
I'm<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.350> show<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.530> how<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.979> how<00:01:23.369> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
I'm going to show you how it how it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.310 
I'm going to show you how it how it
works<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.360> zoom<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.140> little

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
works I'm going to zoom in just a little

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.390 
works I'm going to zoom in just a little
bit<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:29.070> what<00:01:29.250> we're

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
bit here so that we can see what we're

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.270 
bit here so that we can see what we're
doing<00:01:31.280> ok<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.119> I'm<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.259> going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> apply<00:01:34.770> some

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
doing ok so I'm just going to apply some

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:44.020 
doing ok so I'm just going to apply some
to<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.180> stick<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:40.790> it<00:01:41.790> comes<00:01:42.090> out<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
to this stick here and it comes out to a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.999 
to this stick here and it comes out to a
little<00:01:45.030> thicker<00:01:45.299> consistency<00:01:45.619> it's<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.799> that

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
little thicker consistency it's not that

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.609 
little thicker consistency it's not that
watery<00:01:47.460> consistently<00:01:48.360> see<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.200> see<00:01:49.439> in

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
watery consistently see that you see in

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.620 
watery consistently see that you see in
normal<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.180> common<00:01:52.040> CA<00:01:53.040> glues<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.509> i'm

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
normal in the common CA glues and i'm

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.690 
normal in the common CA glues and i'm
just<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.079> clamp<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.009> together<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
just going to clamp that together and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.440 
just going to clamp that together and
hold<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.689> now<00:01:58.320> normally<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.450> superfast

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
hold it now normally with the superfast

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.730 
hold it now normally with the superfast
CA<00:02:01.079> glues<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:02.369> would<00:02:02.960> hold<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.170> for<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
CA glues you would hold it for just a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.440 
CA glues you would hold it for just a
little<00:02:04.890> bit<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.490> would<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.790> fine<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.390> is

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
little bit and it would be fine this is

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.570 
little bit and it would be fine this is
three<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.140> five<00:02:07.350> minutes<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.429> i'm

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
three to five minutes on this so i'm

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.630 
three to five minutes on this so i'm
going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.209> clamp<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.020> set<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.349> aside<00:02:10.640> now

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
going to clamp that and set it aside now

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.320 
going to clamp that and set it aside now
one<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.030> things<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.420> I've<00:02:12.720> found

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
one of the things that I've found

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.570 
one of the things that I've found
that<00:02:13.660> this<00:02:13.870> glue<00:02:14.140> works<00:02:14.350> really<00:02:14.680> well<00:02:14.860> in<00:02:16.470> is

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
that this glue works really well in is

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.090 
that this glue works really well in is
in<00:02:20.610> oily<00:02:21.660> glues<00:02:22.660> like<00:02:23.050> this<00:02:23.260> particular<00:02:23.800> glue

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
in oily glues like this particular glue

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.750 
in oily glues like this particular glue
here<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.610> mean<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:24.880> particular<00:02:25.390> wood<00:02:25.630> here<00:02:26.050> is

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
here I mean this particular wood here is

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.810 
here I mean this particular wood here is
IPE<00:02:27.760> which<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.300> Brazilian<00:02:28.960> hardwood<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.830> it

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
IPE which is a Brazilian hardwood and it

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.300 
IPE which is a Brazilian hardwood and it
is<00:02:31.180> very<00:02:32.070> difficult<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.460> glue<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:34.350> on<00:02:35.350> because

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
is very difficult to glue a on because

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.980 
is very difficult to glue a on because
it's<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:36.760> oily<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.450> i'm<00:02:37.960> going<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.890> try<00:02:39.990> the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
it's so oily and i'm going to try the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.940 
it's so oily and i'm going to try the
next<00:02:41.200> bond<00:02:41.620> on<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.570> clamp<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.810> together<00:02:44.080> and

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
next bond on it clamp that together and

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:53.640 
next bond on it clamp that together and
set<00:02:45.190> those<00:02:45.370> aside<00:02:47.100> now<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:52.380> zoom<00:02:53.380> out<00:02:53.590> a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
set those aside now the zoom out a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:03.810 
set those aside now the zoom out a
little<00:02:53.770> bit<00:02:54.100> here<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.990> glue<00:03:02.730> according<00:03:03.730> to

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
little bit here the glue according to

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.520 
little bit here the glue according to
manufacturer<00:03:04.540> reaches<00:03:04.990> its<00:03:05.320> full<00:03:06.060> strength

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
manufacturer reaches its full strength

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.670 
manufacturer reaches its full strength
after<00:03:08.530> caring<00:03:09.370> for<00:03:09.610> about<00:03:09.820> one<00:03:10.180> hour<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:11.020> so<00:03:11.650> I

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
after caring for about one hour and so I

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.350 
after caring for about one hour and so I
previously<00:03:12.400> glued<00:03:13.030> up<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.390> few<00:03:13.600> pieces<00:03:13.840> here<00:03:14.470> to

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
previously glued up a few pieces here to

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.100 
previously glued up a few pieces here to
give<00:03:16.360> that<00:03:16.600> a<00:03:16.630> try<00:03:18.000> here's<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.120> couple<00:03:19.870> of

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
give that a try here's a couple of

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.060 
give that a try here's a couple of
pieces<00:03:20.350> of<00:03:20.760> poplar<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.350> zoom<00:03:23.350> in<00:03:23.560> just<00:03:23.590> a

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
pieces of poplar and zoom in just a

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.840 
pieces of poplar and zoom in just a
little<00:03:24.220> bit<00:03:24.340> here<00:03:24.820> I<00:03:26.160> now<00:03:27.160> try<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.519> break

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
little bit here I now try and break

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.729 
little bit here I now try and break
these<00:03:28.120> apart<00:03:28.390> they've<00:03:28.959> been<00:03:29.140> sitting<00:03:29.500> for<00:03:29.680> a

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
these apart they've been sitting for a

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.550 
these apart they've been sitting for a
little<00:03:29.830> more<00:03:30.100> than<00:03:30.280> an<00:03:30.400> hour<00:03:31.230> it's<00:03:32.230> pretty

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
little more than an hour it's pretty

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.240 
little more than an hour it's pretty
hard<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.600> can<00:03:34.900> break<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.320> apart<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:35.890> you

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
hard but I can break it apart and you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.410 
hard but I can break it apart and you
will<00:03:36.430> see<00:03:36.820> I'm<00:03:37.630> going<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.900> zoom<00:03:37.930> in<00:03:38.320> even<00:03:38.470> more

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
will see I'm going to zoom in even more

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:47.280 
will see I'm going to zoom in even more
here

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.590 

you<00:03:48.290> can<00:03:48.500> see<00:03:48.770> that<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:49.040> wood<00:03:49.730> fibers<00:03:50.330> are

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
you can see that the wood fibers are

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.920 
you can see that the wood fibers are
broken<00:03:51.080> as<00:03:51.280> well<00:03:52.280> as<00:03:52.550> just<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.060> glue<00:03:53.300> bond<00:03:53.570> so

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
broken as well as just the glue bond so

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.180 
broken as well as just the glue bond so
that<00:03:54.080> was<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.290> really<00:03:54.650> solid<00:03:55.040> bond<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:57.620> let's

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
that was a really solid bond and let's

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.400 
that was a really solid bond and let's
try<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:58.850> with<00:03:59.150> some<00:03:59.690> of<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.900> others<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:01.310> is<00:04:01.580> a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
try it with some of the others this is a

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.430 
try it with some of the others this is a
couple<00:04:03.410> of<00:04:03.530> pieces<00:04:03.770> of<00:04:04.010> maple<00:04:04.610> here<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.540> we'll

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
couple of pieces of maple here and we'll

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.560 
couple of pieces of maple here and we'll
try<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:06.770> try<00:04:07.250> them<00:04:07.490> oh<00:04:08.230> wow<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.590> time<00:04:10.570> that's

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
try and try them oh wow that time that's

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.290 
try and try them oh wow that time that's
a<00:04:12.820> really<00:04:13.820> good<00:04:14.000> joint<00:04:14.330> there<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:17.060> can<00:04:17.270> see

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.300 
a really good joint there you can see

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.170 
a really good joint there you can see
that<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.930> all<00:04:18.080> splintered<00:04:18.860> in<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.610> wood<00:04:19.820> broke

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
that it all splintered in the wood broke

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.510 
that it all splintered in the wood broke
rather<00:04:20.630> than<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:23.120> bond<00:04:24.070> now<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.130> most

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
rather than the the bond now the most

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.770 
rather than the the bond now the most
challenging<00:04:26.380> one<00:04:28.090> another<00:04:29.090> couple<00:04:29.540> of<00:04:29.600> pieces

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
challenging one another couple of pieces

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:38.890 
challenging one another couple of pieces
of<00:04:29.990> ipe<00:04:30.500> that<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:30.880> put<00:04:31.880> together<00:04:36.310> again<00:04:37.810> it's<00:04:38.810> a

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
of ipe that I put together again it's a

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.370 
of ipe that I put together again it's a
little<00:04:39.110> harder<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.800> see<00:04:40.190> with<00:04:40.430> this<00:04:40.610> dark<00:04:41.000> wood

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
little harder to see with this dark wood

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.790 
little harder to see with this dark wood
but<00:04:42.700> we<00:04:43.700> zoom<00:04:43.970> in<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.240> little<00:04:44.480> bit<00:04:44.680> you'll<00:04:45.680> see

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
but we zoom in a little bit you'll see

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.820 
but we zoom in a little bit you'll see
that<00:04:46.160> it's<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.550> fibers<00:04:47.590> that<00:04:48.590> broke<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:50.830> not

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
that it's the fibers that broke and not

00:04:51.830 --> 00:05:05.810 
that it's the fibers that broke and not
just<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.340> glue<00:04:52.580> bond<00:04:53.290> so<00:04:55.090> pretty<00:04:56.090> interesting

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.060 

now<00:05:06.820> we've<00:05:07.090> been<00:05:07.240> talking<00:05:07.720> for<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.200> few<00:05:08.500> minutes

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
now we've been talking for a few minutes

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.500 
now we've been talking for a few minutes
I<00:05:10.020> don't<00:05:11.020> expect<00:05:11.440> that<00:05:12.340> these<00:05:12.520> pieces<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:13.390> we

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
I don't expect that these pieces that we

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.170 
I don't expect that these pieces that we
just<00:05:13.870> glued<00:05:14.260> are<00:05:14.860> going<00:05:15.160> to<00:05:15.220> hold<00:05:15.430> together<00:05:15.640> as

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
just glued are going to hold together as

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.480 
just glued are going to hold together as
well<00:05:16.680> but<00:05:18.570> it<00:05:19.570> doesn't<00:05:20.080> hurt<00:05:20.230> to<00:05:20.290> try<00:05:20.490> we're

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
well but it doesn't hurt to try we're

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.160 
well but it doesn't hurt to try we're
going<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:21.670> break<00:05:21.910> these<00:05:22.120> apart<00:05:22.330> too<00:05:22.780> and<00:05:23.020> see

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
going to break these apart too and see

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.140 
going to break these apart too and see
what<00:05:23.350> happens<00:05:23.770> these<00:05:23.950> have<00:05:24.130> only<00:05:24.280> been<00:05:24.520> going

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
what happens these have only been going

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.100 
what happens these have only been going
for<00:05:25.720> a<00:05:25.900> couple<00:05:26.290> of<00:05:26.350> minutes<00:05:27.270> it<00:05:28.270> broke<00:05:28.840> but

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
for a couple of minutes it broke but

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.370 
for a couple of minutes it broke but
it's<00:05:29.260> still<00:05:29.500> again<00:05:30.160> it's<00:05:31.110> breaking<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.200> wood

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
it's still again it's breaking the wood

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.240 
it's still again it's breaking the wood
fibers<00:05:33.930> not<00:05:34.930> quite<00:05:35.170> as<00:05:35.320> strong<00:05:35.650> and<00:05:35.950> then<00:05:36.070> with

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
fibers not quite as strong and then with

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.200 
fibers not quite as strong and then with
the<00:05:36.400> ipe<00:05:37.110> that<00:05:38.110> one<00:05:38.320> came<00:05:38.530> apart<00:05:38.980> and<00:05:39.280> that<00:05:39.460> was

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
the ipe that one came apart and that was

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.920 
the ipe that one came apart and that was
too<00:05:40.510> too<00:05:40.870> soon<00:05:41.460> but<00:05:42.460> again<00:05:42.580> that<00:05:43.030> going<00:05:43.840> to

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
too too soon but again that going to

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.140 
too too soon but again that going to
manufacture<00:05:44.650> your<00:05:44.860> spots<00:05:45.220> not<00:05:45.580> supposed<00:05:45.940> to

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
manufacture your spots not supposed to

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.990 
manufacture your spots not supposed to
reach<00:05:46.690> full<00:05:46.960> strength<00:05:47.320> for<00:05:47.560> an<00:05:47.650> hour<00:05:48.000> but

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
reach full strength for an hour but

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.150 
reach full strength for an hour but
that's<00:05:49.810> pretty<00:05:50.050> good<00:05:50.260> results<00:05:50.500> one<00:05:51.010> of<00:05:51.100> the

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.770 
that's pretty good results one of the
other<00:05:51.310> things<00:05:51.370> that<00:05:51.670> I<00:05:51.820> found<00:05:52.060> with<00:05:52.330> this<00:05:52.510> glue

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
other things that I found with this glue

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.080 
other things that I found with this glue
when<00:05:53.050> using<00:05:53.470> it<00:05:53.620> that<00:05:53.770> I<00:05:53.860> kind<00:05:54.100> of<00:05:54.160> like<00:05:54.370> and<00:05:54.730> I

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
when using it that I kind of like and I

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.150 
when using it that I kind of like and I
think<00:05:55.180> it<00:05:55.420> is<00:05:55.600> again<00:05:55.930> also<00:05:56.350> related<00:05:56.860> to<00:05:56.890> the

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
think it is again also related to the

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.120 
think it is again also related to the
longer<00:05:57.550> open<00:05:57.970> time<00:05:58.240> is<00:05:58.480> that<00:05:59.350> it<00:05:59.530> doesn't<00:05:59.890> seem

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
longer open time is that it doesn't seem

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
longer open time is that it doesn't seem
like<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.640> the<00:06:01.630> nozzle<00:06:02.140> clogs<00:06:02.560> up<00:06:02.890> as<00:06:03.100> well<00:06:03.820> and

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
like the the nozzle clogs up as well and

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.690 
like the the nozzle clogs up as well and
I'm<00:06:04.810> less<00:06:05.080> likely<00:06:05.110> to<00:06:05.770> stick<00:06:06.100> my<00:06:06.280> fingers

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
I'm less likely to stick my fingers

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.570 
I'm less likely to stick my fingers
together<00:06:06.940> with<00:06:07.540> it<00:06:07.720> as<00:06:08.230> I<00:06:08.710> am<00:06:08.860> with<00:06:09.040> other<00:06:09.220> CA
