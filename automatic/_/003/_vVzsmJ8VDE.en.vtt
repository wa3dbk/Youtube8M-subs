00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.120
 hello my name is even harmays and 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.240
 today i will teach you how to play game 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.560
 Buryatia guitar parsing will consist 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.800
 two parts to 1 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.230
 I'll figure out how to play the melody that 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.920
 just played in the second part 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:29.180
 just make out the accompaniment and for 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:31.729
 to sing this song so I begin 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.960
 slowly show you how to play each 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.930
 phrase you look if that 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.330
 rewind in the right moments to 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:48.550
 repeat over and over again so let's start with 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:51.800
 tune this version is my own 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.920
 picked up by ear so it can 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:59.899
 differ from any official there 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.350
 what are there well in general how is how 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.350
 picked up 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.920
 next phrase 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.510
 at 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.480
 so the next 3 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.590
 but 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.080
 and 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.680
 in fact, the accompaniment will be 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.840
 be built on the same chords that too 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.239
 that sounded only without in melody 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.959
 to make it easier for you to sing but if you 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.830
 You can also combine the melody on the guitar and 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.830
 performance then please 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.260
 you are 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
 sunny 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.509
 I opened a bunch here 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.870
 so we can play the whole song all the verses 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.190
 and in the end 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.490
 this is the first then on the third fret afterwards 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.730
 chord 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.730
 but 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.840
 and 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:23.850
 on the very first string 3 5 and about coffee 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.650
 thank you for your attention 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:39.860
 repeat rewind where you need 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.860
 and success
