00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.539 

so<00:01:09.320> what<00:01:09.530> makes<00:01:09.649> this<00:01:09.799> pedal<00:01:10.070> unique<00:01:10.310> Jimmy

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
so what makes this pedal unique Jimmy

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.429 
so what makes this pedal unique Jimmy
this<00:01:10.909> pedal<00:01:11.299> is<00:01:11.420> cool<00:01:11.659> because<00:01:11.780> it<00:01:12.079> does<00:01:12.259> a

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
this pedal is cool because it does a

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.660 
this pedal is cool because it does a
whole<00:01:12.710> bunch<00:01:13.009> of<00:01:13.159> different<00:01:13.460> things

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
whole bunch of different things

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.999 
whole bunch of different things
basically<00:01:14.000> what<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:14.630> knocked<00:01:15.259> over<00:01:15.530> pedal<00:01:15.829> does

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
basically what a knocked over pedal does

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.100 
basically what a knocked over pedal does
it's<00:01:16.219> going<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:16.399> add<00:01:16.659> an<00:01:17.659> octave<00:01:18.079> lower

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
it's going to add an octave lower

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.020 
it's going to add an octave lower
fundamental<00:01:18.950> note<00:01:19.130> below<00:01:19.429> the<00:01:19.700> note<00:01:19.850> you're

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
fundamental note below the note you're

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.850 
fundamental note below the note you're
playing<00:01:20.299> in<00:01:20.479> other<00:01:21.020> words<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.500> sounds<00:01:21.740> like<00:01:21.799> a

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
playing in other words it sounds like a

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.120 
playing in other words it sounds like a
lot<00:01:22.069> but<00:01:22.250> it's<00:01:22.399> not<00:01:22.579> say<00:01:23.149> you<00:01:23.210> got<00:01:23.420> this<00:01:23.600> note

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.559 

now<00:01:28.130> let's<00:01:28.369> add<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:28.759> deep<00:01:28.939> dive<00:01:29.209> and<00:01:29.450> hear

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.640 

and<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.480> can<00:01:39.600> hear<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> got<00:01:39.960> some<00:01:40.170> modulation

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650

going on but you can flip this

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.990 
going on but you can flip this
modulation<00:01:42.750> switch<00:01:43.260> and<00:01:43.560> give<00:01:44.520> yourself<00:01:44.640> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
modulation switch and give yourself a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.210 
modulation switch and give yourself a
whole<00:01:45.180> different<00:01:45.690> tonal<00:01:46.290> spectrum<00:01:46.860> check<00:01:47.100> it

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.490
