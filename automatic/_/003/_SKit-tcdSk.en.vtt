00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.889
 Hi girls 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.990
 so today I find you for 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.590
 make a get the look of caroline 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.679
 recipient 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.170
 so I was inspired by makeup 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.660
 that brings on this photo so it's 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.360
 I start with my anti-dark circles 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.590
 and then I continue with my background of 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.720
 dyed because as you know 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.200
 caroline catcher still has a theme 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.200
 parquet 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.370
 then I apply my brothers to 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.050
 chemistry capoo dreamer to carve my 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.840
 face because caroline catcher a 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.290
 face rather square while me that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.210
 reverse 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.120
 it is gross so will suddenly I put 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.570
 relief to all that I mark well too 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.570
 my jaw 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:12.840
 then I use the profit blush 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:16.650
 the landlord we pass to the eyes I mix 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.390
 lighthouse tools cole and abbeys kid of 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.729
 the range of rescue teams on board 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.070
 a pretty natural color on mam 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.680
 to the stones and then I draw a line 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.110
 with black out as you can see a 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.320
 but in a paper for his sister more 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.320
 law 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.080
 so here's the result it's a big 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.970
 eye liner line for a makeup 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.480
 rather discreet eyelids and then I 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.680
 missile use and I apply my 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.680
 mascara as usual 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.510
 and that's the result for the eyes 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.820
 then for the lips I apply the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.950
 lipstick from golden rose en 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.570

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.180

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.330
 the surface for it to be anyway 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.280
 enough to style I read everything and it's 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:42.480
