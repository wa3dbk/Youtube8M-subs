00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
of its own and I don't I can't recall if

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.270 
of its own and I don't I can't recall if
it<00:01:57.210> was<00:01:57.479> part<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.990> creepy<00:01:58.290> pasta<00:01:58.680> or<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:58.979> or<00:01:59.219> if

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
it was part of creepy pasta or not or if

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.749 
it was part of creepy pasta or not or if
it<00:02:00.030> was<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.869> guess<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.710> submission<00:02:02.130> that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
it was I guess a submission that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.120 
it was I guess a submission that
eventually<00:02:03.210> got<00:02:03.360> into<00:02:03.390> creepypasta<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:04.979> in

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
eventually got into creepypasta but in

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.920 
eventually got into creepypasta but in
any<00:02:05.310> case<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.759> whole<00:02:05.909> point<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.240> slender<00:02:06.659> man

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
any case the whole point was slender man

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.680 
any case the whole point was slender man
is<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.950> fabrication<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.679> urban<00:02:10.679> legend

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
is a fabrication is just a urban legend

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.440 
is a fabrication is just a urban legend
type<00:02:11.780> story<00:02:12.200> that's<00:02:12.710> made<00:02:13.190> up<00:02:13.430> that's<00:02:14.090> really

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
type story that's made up that's really

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.410 
type story that's made up that's really
cool<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.990> mean<00:02:15.170> no<00:02:15.320> doubt<00:02:15.530> it's<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:16.100> yeah<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
cool I mean no doubt it's it's yeah the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.930 
cool I mean no doubt it's it's yeah the
popularity<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.200> shows<00:02:18.440> how<00:02:19.220> well<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.760> was

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
popularity of it shows how well it was

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.060 
popularity of it shows how well it was
made<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.390> how<00:02:20.480> well<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.810> was<00:02:20.900> crafted<00:02:21.440> but

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
made and how well it was crafted but

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.530 
made and how well it was crafted but
unlike<00:02:22.400> some<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.760> other<00:02:22.820> cryptids<00:02:23.420> and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
unlike some of the other cryptids and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.200 
unlike some of the other cryptids and
monsters<00:02:23.870> I've<00:02:24.020> talked<00:02:24.230> about<00:02:24.440> here<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:26.030> one
