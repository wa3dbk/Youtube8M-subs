alleviate<00:02:11.910> any<00:02:12.150> pressure<00:02:12.690> points

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
alleviate any pressure points

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.070 
alleviate any pressure points
but<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.400> strap<00:02:14.700> should<00:02:15.000> sit<00:02:15.360> as<00:02:15.510> they<00:02:16.020> were

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
but the strap should sit as they were

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.770 
but the strap should sit as they were

I'm moving this seat quite quite

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.540 
I'm moving this seat quite quite
strongly<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.440> whole<00:02:55.590> car<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:55.890> actually

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
strongly and the whole car is actually

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.070 
strongly and the whole car is actually
moving<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.090> seed<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.360> not<00:02:57.750> that's

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
moving and the seed is not that's

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.920 
moving and the seed is not that's
exactly<00:02:58.860> what<00:02:59.040> we're<00:02:59.190> looking<00:02:59.580> for

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
exactly what we're looking for

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.750 
exactly what we're looking for
so<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:01.320> have<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.740> in<00:03:01.950> order<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.310> achieve<00:03:02.730> that

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
so we have to in order to achieve that

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.430 
so we have to in order to achieve that
we<00:03:03.480> have<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.930> get<00:03:04.080> our<00:03:04.320> whole<00:03:04.560> body<00:03:04.920> in<00:03:06.440> into

seat unlike a rear-facing seat we have a

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.840 
seat unlike a rear-facing seat we have a
tether<00:03:23.400> strap<00:03:23.840> this<00:03:24.840> must<00:03:25.290> be<00:03:25.590> attached<00:03:26.519> as

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
tether strap this must be attached as

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.270 
tether strap this must be attached as
well<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.840> will<00:03:28.110> be<00:03:28.320> behind<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.430> seat<00:03:29.700> and

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
well and it will be behind the seat and

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.100 
well and it will be behind the seat and
every<00:03:32.280> vehicle<00:03:32.489> is<00:03:32.820> different<00:03:33.030> some<00:03:33.600> are<00:03:33.630> what

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
every vehicle is different some are what

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.860 
every vehicle is different some are what
you<00:03:34.230> can<00:03:34.410> see<00:03:34.650> where<00:03:34.830> this<00:03:35.040> one<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.430> attached

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
you can see where this one is attached

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.509 
you can see where this one is attached
some<00:03:36.870> may<00:03:37.080> be<00:03:37.140> down<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.920> floor<00:03:37.950> if<00:03:38.370> you

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
some may be down on the floor if you

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.720 
some may be down on the floor if you
have<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.700> minivan<00:03:39.060> style<00:03:39.660> vehicle<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.730> this

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
have a minivan style vehicle and this

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.500 
have a minivan style vehicle and this
also<00:03:42.000> is<00:03:42.390> clipped<00:03:43.050> in<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.580> pulled<00:03:44.580> as<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.330> can

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
also is clipped in and pulled as you can

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.479 
also is clipped in and pulled as you can
see<00:03:45.720> how<00:03:45.900> tight<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.769> seat<00:03:47.040> is

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
see how tight it is the seat is

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.090 
see how tight it is the seat is
wrinkling<00:03:48.090> there<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:49.170> allows<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.890> top

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
wrinkling there and that allows the top

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.740 
wrinkling there and that allows the top
part<00:03:50.540> not<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.810> move<00:03:51.959> as<00:03:52.200> well<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:54.060> once<00:03:54.300> we<00:03:54.540> have

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
part not to move as well so once we have

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.979 
part not to move as well so once we have
all<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:55.140> this<00:03:55.290> in<00:03:55.560> place<00:03:55.800> we<00:03:56.420> give<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.450> tug<00:03:57.780> and

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
all of this in place we give a tug and

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.920 
all of this in place we give a tug and
make<00:03:58.140> sure<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.370> seat<00:03:59.610> does<00:04:00.420> not<00:04:00.630> move

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
make sure that the seat does not move

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.500 
make sure that the seat does not move
more<00:04:01.470> than<00:04:01.500> an<00:04:01.800> inch<00:04:01.980> from<00:04:02.280> either<00:04:02.489> side<00:04:02.670> but

more than an inch from either side but

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.560 
more than an inch from either side but
it<00:04:03.660> really<00:04:04.019> should<00:04:04.320> be<00:04:04.350> in<00:04:04.680> this<00:04:05.310> tight<00:04:05.730> the
