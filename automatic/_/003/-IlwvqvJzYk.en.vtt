00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.740 

okay<00:00:11.550> what<00:00:11.850> we're<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.240> now<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.570> put

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
okay what we're going to do now is put

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.369 
okay what we're going to do now is put
the<00:00:12.780> wiring<00:00:13.139> harness<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.620> car<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.370> a

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
the wiring harness on the car this is a

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.300 
the wiring harness on the car this is a
aftermarket<00:00:16.379> harness<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.860> put<00:00:17.189> together

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
aftermarket harness that I put together

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.370 
aftermarket harness that I put together
for<00:00:17.700> the<00:00:17.790> car<00:00:17.970> plugs<00:00:18.570> into<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.050> steering

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
for the car plugs into the steering

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.060 
for the car plugs into the steering
column<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:20.160> motor<00:00:20.779> has<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> electromotive<00:00:22.529> ECU

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
column the motor has a electromotive ECU

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.070 
column the motor has a electromotive ECU
on<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.640> already<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.150> we're<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:24.900> going<00:00:25.020> to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
on it already so we're just going to

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.890 
on it already so we're just going to
basically<00:00:25.439> lay<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.100> car<00:00:26.279> plug<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.730> in

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
basically lay it in the car plug it in

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.759 
basically lay it in the car plug it in
hopefully<00:00:27.900> start<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> car<00:00:30.289> two<00:00:31.289> ways<00:00:31.439> around

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
hopefully start the car two ways around

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.400 
hopefully start the car two ways around
this<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.430> run<00:00:32.930> down<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:35.160> center<00:00:35.430> tunnel

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
this we can run down the center tunnel

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.020 
this we can run down the center tunnel
or<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.559> write<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.890> down<00:00:40.820> what<00:00:41.820> would<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
or we write it down what would you

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.750 
or we write it down what would you
suggest<00:00:43.129> well<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.250> both<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.610> their

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
suggest well they both have their

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.100 
suggest well they both have their
drawbacks<00:00:44.940> yeah<00:00:47.629> it's<00:00:48.629> right<00:00:48.809> down<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
drawbacks yeah it's right down the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.540 
drawbacks yeah it's right down the
center<00:00:49.260> tile<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:50.190> you've<00:00:50.370> got<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
center tile then you've got a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430 
center tile then you've got a
disassembled<00:00:51.270> especially<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.079> carpet

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
disassembled especially if you carpet

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.350 
disassembled especially if you carpet
the<00:00:52.500> car<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.460> carpet<00:00:53.910> over<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.120> center

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the car the carpet over the center

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.330 
the car the carpet over the center
column<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> disassemble<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.160> that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
column you have to disassemble all that

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.020 
column you have to disassemble all that
and<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> side<00:00:58.699> you<00:00:59.699> can

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
and if you do it down the side you can

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.979 
and if you do it down the side you can
unbolt<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:01.140> side<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.710> car<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
unbolt on one side of the car and get to

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.529 
unbolt on one side of the car and get to
and<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.259> to<00:01:04.379> read<00:01:04.530> bluing<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.539> that's

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
and I have to read bluing just that's

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:08.389 
and I have to read bluing just that's
counterintuitive<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.440> it<00:01:07.530> makes<00:01:07.710> sense<00:01:07.920> okay

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
counterintuitive but it makes sense okay

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:23.300 
counterintuitive but it makes sense okay
let's<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.700> down<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> side

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:02:01.080 

and

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.830 

I<00:02:01.149> think<00:02:01.899> we<00:02:01.990> got<00:02:02.109> the<00:02:02.259> electrical<00:02:02.740> all<00:02:02.829> in<00:02:03.100> so

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
I think we got the electrical all in so

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.410 
I think we got the electrical all in so
one<00:02:05.020> more<00:02:05.200> quick<00:02:05.440> check<00:02:05.909> get<00:02:06.909> better<00:02:07.150> hooked

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
one more quick check get better hooked

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.380 
one more quick check get better hooked
up

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.020 

and<00:02:11.540> our<00:02:11.840> fuel<00:02:12.080> lines<00:02:12.260> are<00:02:12.410> good

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.190 

see<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.600> starts

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:32.160 

got<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.800> hold<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.210> clutch<00:02:23.210> interlock<00:02:23.810> switch

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:40.460 

you

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:51.860 

we<00:02:41.470> have<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.650> winner

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.930 

you
