up<00:00:29.419> for<00:00:29.540> two<00:00:29.689> dollars<00:00:29.840> I<00:00:30.200> don't<00:00:30.649> think<00:00:30.710> it's

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
up for two dollars I don't think it's

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.080 
up for two dollars I don't think it's
worth<00:00:31.040> that<00:00:31.250> much<00:00:31.369> actually<00:00:31.640> doesn't<00:00:32.059> look

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
too bad the silver on there she is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.890 
too bad the silver on there she is
pretty<00:00:34.460> clean<00:00:34.730> compared<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.720> a<00:00:35.750> lot<00:00:35.840> of

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
pretty clean compared to a lot of

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.080 
pretty clean compared to a lot of
knockoffs<00:00:36.320> that<00:00:36.440> I've<00:00:36.530> seen<00:00:36.740> in<00:00:37.070> in<00:00:37.490> recent

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
knockoffs that I've seen in in recent

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.660 
knockoffs that I've seen in in recent
times<00:00:38.300> I<00:00:38.570> did<00:00:39.470> pick<00:00:39.620> up<00:00:39.680> there's<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.430> few<00:00:40.610> of

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
times I did pick up there's a few of

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.400 
times I did pick up there's a few of
these<00:00:40.730> actually<00:00:41.150> and<00:00:41.390> I<00:00:41.630> did<00:00:41.780> pick<00:00:41.900> up<00:00:42.020> doubles

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
these actually and I did pick up doubles

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.730 
these actually and I did pick up doubles
which<00:00:42.620> I<00:00:42.740> did<00:00:42.890> send<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:43.340> Oerlikon<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.540> so<00:00:45.410> I

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
which I did send to Oerlikon and so I

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.760 
which I did send to Oerlikon and so I
did<00:00:46.070> have<00:00:46.190> this<00:00:46.280> for<00:00:46.520> a<00:00:46.550> long<00:00:46.910> time<00:00:46.970> and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
did have this for a long time and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
whooping it up and just taking a look at

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.180 
whooping it up and just taking a look at
it<00:00:50.500> then<00:00:51.500> going<00:00:51.710> through<00:00:51.800> a<00:00:51.829> lot<00:00:51.920> of<00:00:51.980> stuff

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190

so anyways I took this guy of the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.530 
so anyways I took this guy of the
package<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.500> this<00:01:24.890> guy<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.400> piece<00:01:25.880> of<00:01:26.210> crap

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540

the support for him to stand up pain
apps<00:01:34.580> are<00:01:34.820> not<00:01:34.940> too<00:01:35.060> bad<00:01:35.180> but<00:01:35.320> quality<00:01:36.320> isn't

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
apps are not too bad but quality isn't

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.820 
apps are not too bad but quality isn't
the<00:01:36.740> greatest<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.670> for<00:01:38.420> us<00:01:38.650> so<00:01:39.650> I<00:01:39.680> definitely
