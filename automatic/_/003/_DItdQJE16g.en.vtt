this bracket is completely adjustable so

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.880 
this bracket is completely adjustable so
if<00:01:33.179> you<00:01:33.299> wanted<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.659> change<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.200> throttle

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
if you wanted to change the throttle

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.669 
if you wanted to change the throttle
position<00:01:35.270> percentage<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.960> which<00:01:37.380> you

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
position percentage at which you

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.080 
position percentage at which you
disengage<00:01:38.250> power<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.560> switch<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.969> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
disengage power to this switch or to the

disengage power to this switch or to the
TCC<00:01:42.450> solenoid<00:01:43.109> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.829> change<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.429> can

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
TCC solenoid you can change this I can

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.399 
TCC solenoid you can change this I can
move<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.090> forward<00:01:45.299> or<00:01:45.719> I<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.990> move<00:01:46.109> it<00:01:46.289> back

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
move it forward or I can move it back

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.649 
move it forward or I can move it back
obviously<00:01:46.709> the<00:01:47.130> further<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.429> move<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.789> back<00:01:47.819> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
obviously the further I move it back the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.779 
obviously the further I move it back the
sooner<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.289> to<00:01:49.349> come<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.369> further

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
sooner it's going to come in the further

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.429 
sooner it's going to come in the further
I<00:01:50.880> move<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.240> forward<00:01:51.599> the<00:01:51.750> later<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.259> going

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
I move it forward the later it's going

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.589 
I move it forward the later it's going
to<00:01:52.500> come<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:53.149> relationship<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.179> that

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:54.599 
to come in in relationship to that

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:56.690 
to come in in relationship to that
throttle<00:01:54.810> angle<00:01:55.289> and<00:01:55.439> again<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> good

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
throttle angle and again this is a good

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.819 
throttle angle and again this is a good
indication<00:01:57.149> here<00:01:57.629> of<00:01:57.840> how<00:01:58.049> that's<00:01:58.289> doing<00:01:58.649> is

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
indication here of how that's doing is

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.959 
indication here of how that's doing is
taking<00:01:59.159> power<00:01:59.399> away<00:01:59.819> from<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.750> TCC<00:02:01.379> solenoid

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
taking power away from that TCC solenoid

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.069 
taking power away from that TCC solenoid
okay<00:02:02.969> ladies<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.299> gentlemen<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.929> of<00:02:03.959> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
okay ladies and gentlemen one of the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.559 
okay ladies and gentlemen one of the
things<00:02:04.289> you'll<00:02:04.500> notice<00:02:04.649> here<00:02:05.219> we<00:02:05.849> do<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.299> one

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
things you'll notice here we do have one

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.619 
things you'll notice here we do have one
small<00:02:06.780> hole<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.500> we<00:02:07.649> did<00:02:07.950> drill<00:02:08.340> into<00:02:09.269> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
small hole that we did drill into the

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:18.620 
small hole that we did drill into the
carburetor<00:02:09.899> linkage<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:12.950> attach<00:02:13.950> our<00:02:14.129> stud

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.610 

and<00:02:19.170> that's<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.710> neutral<00:02:20.070> point<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:21.110> for<00:02:22.110> our

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
and that's a neutral point here for our

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:34.720 
and that's a neutral point here for our
articulation

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.370 

it's<00:02:35.730> also<00:02:35.910> very<00:02:36.210> important<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.690> consider<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
it's also very important to consider the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.650 
it's also very important to consider the
position<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.520> our<00:02:38.670> relay<00:02:39.060> here<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.540> we've

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
position of our relay here that we've

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.570 
position of our relay here that we've
installed<00:02:39.960> with<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.500> we<00:02:40.980> didn't<00:02:41.250> want<00:02:41.400> this

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
installed with it we didn't want this

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.640 
installed with it we didn't want this
too<00:02:41.910> high<00:02:42.120> or<00:02:42.180> too<00:02:42.360> low<00:02:42.510> if<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:43.110> too<00:02:43.290> low<00:02:43.440> it's

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
too high or too low if it's too low it's

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.900 
too high or too low if it's too low it's
going<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.830> interfere<00:02:44.160> with<00:02:44.220> our<00:02:44.460> valve<00:02:44.640> cover

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
going to interfere with our valve cover

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.910 
going to interfere with our valve cover
you<00:02:45.420> see<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.780> we've<00:02:45.900> raised<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.350> quite<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> bit

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you see that we've raised it quite a bit

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.070 
you see that we've raised it quite a bit
and<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.520> have<00:02:47.760> another<00:02:48.210> bracket<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.930> we

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
and we have another bracket that we

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.110 
and we have another bracket that we
built<00:02:49.350> here<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:50.190> bracket<00:02:50.700> could<00:02:50.820> be<00:02:50.940> made

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
built here this bracket could be made

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.360 
built here this bracket could be made
very<00:02:51.330> easily<00:02:51.690> very<00:02:52.200> inexpensively<00:02:52.890> just<00:02:53.220> by

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
simple saw okay on our custom bracket

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.120 
simple saw okay on our custom bracket
what<00:03:00.360> you'll<00:03:00.510> notice<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.960> we<00:03:00.990> just<00:03:01.350> did<00:03:01.740> one

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
what you'll notice is we just did one

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.120 
what you'll notice is we just did one
small<00:03:02.490> slot<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.900> small<00:03:04.230> slot<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.800> just<00:03:05.010> an

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
small slot this small slot is just an

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.310 
small slot this small slot is just an
anchor<00:03:05.460> for<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.700> piece<00:03:05.970> we<00:03:06.660> drilled<00:03:06.960> one

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
anchor for the piece we drilled one

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.180 
anchor for the piece we drilled one
small<00:03:07.830> hole<00:03:08.330> here<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.410> course<00:03:10.440> we<00:03:10.770> bolted

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
small hole here and of course we bolted

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.130 
small hole here and of course we bolted
this<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.640> intake<00:03:11.970> manifold<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.020> we're

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
this to the intake manifold and we're

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.450 
this to the intake manifold and we're
going<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.290> demonstrate<00:03:13.470> how<00:03:13.800> that's<00:03:14.190> going<00:03:14.400> to

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
going to demonstrate how that's going to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.800 
going to demonstrate how that's going to
attach<00:03:14.700> on<00:03:14.940> there<00:03:15.120> now

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.260 

and<00:03:20.410> again<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.890> can<00:03:21.040> make<00:03:21.220> this<00:03:21.459> as<00:03:21.700> high<00:03:21.880> as

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
and again you can make this as high as

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.630 
and again you can make this as high as
low<00:03:22.810> as<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.319> would<00:03:23.410> like<00:03:23.590> again<00:03:24.100> something

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
low as you would like again something

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.309 
low as you would like again something
you<00:03:24.819> might<00:03:24.940> want<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.180> do<00:03:25.330> is<00:03:25.510> just<00:03:25.720> attach<00:03:26.110> a

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
you might want to do is just attach a

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.250 
you might want to do is just attach a
small<00:03:26.590> strap<00:03:27.040> from<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:27.970> front<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.140> back

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
small strap from the front to the back

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.350 
small strap from the front to the back
and<00:03:29.740> this<00:03:30.490> is<00:03:30.670> going<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.850> give<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.150> some

and this is going to give you some

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.210 
and this is going to give you some
additional<00:03:31.600> reinforcement<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.709> keep<00:03:32.920> that

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
additional reinforcement to keep that
