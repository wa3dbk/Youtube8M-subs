00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
which spawns in the main room

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.990 
which spawns in the main room
after<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.130> go<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.519> dig<00:00:26.849> around

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
after that you have to go and dig around

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.820 
after that you have to go and dig around
the<00:00:27.330> map<00:00:27.539> now<00:00:27.810> once<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.230> do<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.439> you'll<00:00:28.800> have

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
the map now once you do that you'll have

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.070 
the map now once you do that you'll have
to<00:00:29.099> dig<00:00:29.279> around<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.820> think<00:00:29.880> at<00:00:30.300> least<00:00:30.539> fifty<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
to dig around I think at least fifty to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.170 
to dig around I think at least fifty to
sixty<00:00:31.289> times<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> very<00:00:32.550> hard<00:00:32.880> thing<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
sixty times it is a very hard thing to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.000 
sixty times it is a very hard thing to
get<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> get<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.620> golden<00:00:34.860> shovel

get now what to get the golden shovel
basically<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.850> dig<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> lot<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.450> better

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
basically you can dig a lot of better

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.440 
basically you can dig a lot of better
stuff<00:00:37.079> like<00:00:37.380> more<00:00:37.680> máximos<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> more<00:00:38.969> zombie

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
didn't hurt my brain and yeah that's

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.480 
didn't hurt my brain and yeah that's
basically<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:24.570> what<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.320> does<00:01:25.590> I'm<00:01:25.979> hoping

basically it what this does I'm hoping

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.940 
basically it what this does I'm hoping
that<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:26.909> actually<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.600> more<00:01:27.799> sort<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
that they actually have more sort of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.760 
that they actually have more sort of
armory<00:01:29.579> parts<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.689> origins<00:01:31.259> because<00:01:31.560> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
armory parts in the origins because that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.609 
armory parts in the origins because that
would<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.130> amazing<00:01:32.700> I'm<00:01:33.420> looking<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.200> some

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619

apparently<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.119> someone<00:01:36.509> told<00:01:36.750> me<00:01:36.960> that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
apparently that someone told me that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.350 
apparently that someone told me that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
apparently you can run in the mud

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.630 
apparently you can run in the mud
without<00:01:40.049> having<00:01:40.530> any<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:41.009> these<00:01:41.220> sort<00:01:41.549> of
