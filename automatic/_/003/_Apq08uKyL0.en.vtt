find<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.159> was<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.579> bad<00:01:39.329> penny<00:01:39.840> wait<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:41.390> don't

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
find that was a bad penny wait I don't

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.830 
find that was a bad penny wait I don't
know<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:43.950> ounces<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> cross<00:01:45.390> and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
know and then ounces with a cross and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.969 
know and then ounces with a cross and
that<00:01:46.079> was<00:01:46.229> troy<00:01:46.710> ounces<00:01:47.840> so<00:01:48.840> that's<00:01:49.140> what's

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that was troy ounces so that's what's

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.160 
that was troy ounces so that's what's
that<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.520> guess<00:01:50.970> maybe<00:01:51.210> how<00:01:51.479> they<00:01:51.509> weigh<00:01:51.840> things

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that I guess maybe how they weigh things

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.039 
that I guess maybe how they weigh things
in<00:01:52.729> Troy<00:01:55.040> I'm<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.250> positive<00:01:56.509> well<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.020> a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
philosophical can you weigh the scale

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.260 
philosophical can you weigh the scale
now<00:02:23.370> Grammy<00:02:24.620> Club<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.830> too<00:02:26.010> much<00:02:26.160> more<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.490> now

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
you aren't going around you can they

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.790 
you aren't going around you can they
said<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.520> if<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.210> use<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.630> for<00:02:31.410> prolonged

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
said that if you use this for prolonged

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.010 
said that if you use this for prolonged
amounts<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.250> times<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.610> should<00:02:32.670> calibrate<00:02:33.510> it

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
amounts of times you should calibrate it

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.360 
amounts of times you should calibrate it
yeah<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.410> there's<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> whole<00:02:34.740> process<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.250> go

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
yeah and there's a whole process you go

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.800 
yeah and there's a whole process you go
through<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:36.210> have<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.540> something<00:02:36.780> that

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
through you have to have something that

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.110 
through you have to have something that
you<00:02:36.990> know<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> actual<00:02:38.040> weight<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.910> you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
you know the actual weight of and you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.640 
you know the actual weight of and you
put<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.480> there<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:39.960> calibrate<00:02:40.320> it

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
put it on there and you can calibrate it

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.040 
put it on there and you can calibrate it
make<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.670> go<00:02:41.760> back<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.030> zero<00:02:42.300> again<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.870> if<00:02:42.960> you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
make it go back to zero again so if you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.440 
make it go back to zero again so if you
actually<00:02:43.200> get<00:02:43.560> like<00:02:43.800> I<00:02:44.550> know<00:02:45.030> there<00:02:45.270> are<00:02:45.420> those

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
actually get like I know there are those

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.380 
actually get like I know there are those
little<00:02:45.990> weights<00:02:46.440> yes<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.700> know<00:02:47.820> specifically

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
little weights yes you know specifically

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.360 
little weights yes you know specifically
that's<00:02:48.630> like<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.290> know<00:02:49.320> 100<00:02:50.130> grams

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
that's like this is you know 100 grams

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.430 
that's like this is you know 100 grams
or<00:02:50.790> whatever<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.690> you'd<00:02:51.810> need<00:02:51.959> something<00:02:52.170> like

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
or whatever so you'd need something like

that in order to make sure that your

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.650 
that in order to make sure that your
with<00:02:54.360> circulations<00:02:55.080> order<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.890> club

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
bottomless is the bottom list gonna

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.500 
bottomless is the bottom list gonna
really<00:03:35.070> be<00:03:35.370> able<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.640> balance<00:03:35.820> well<00:03:36.209> on<00:03:36.360> it

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
really be able to balance well on it

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.090 
really be able to balance well on it
though<00:03:36.690> that's<00:03:37.320> what<00:03:37.440> I'm<00:03:37.560> gonna<00:03:37.650> see<00:03:37.890> what

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
though that's what I'm gonna see what

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.729 
though that's what I'm gonna see what
well<00:03:38.580> let's<00:03:38.610> say<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.540> isn't<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.050> much<00:03:40.110> if<00:03:40.500> you

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
well let's say it isn't so much if you

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.830 
well let's say it isn't so much if you
put<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:41.220> on<00:03:41.370> there<00:03:41.610> in<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.850> same<00:03:42.060> fashion

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
put it on there in the same fashion

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.550 
put it on there in the same fashion
both<00:03:43.290> times<00:03:43.730> let's<00:03:44.730> say<00:03:44.959> yeah<00:03:45.959> why<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.440> an

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
both times let's say yeah why is it an
