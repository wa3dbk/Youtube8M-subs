an example of that definitely wasted my

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.400 
an example of that definitely wasted my
time<00:03:18.400> doing<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:18.970> not<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.510> stage<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.049> would<00:03:20.260> ever

like<00:03:37.449> I<00:03:37.540> said<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.750> don't<00:03:37.840> know<00:03:37.959> if<00:03:38.049> I'm<00:03:38.139> gonna<00:03:38.260> do

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
like I said I don't know if I'm gonna do

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.110 
like I said I don't know if I'm gonna do
that<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:38.919> was<00:03:39.190> actually<00:03:39.459> pretty<00:03:39.609> tough<00:03:39.819> to<00:03:40.000> do

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
that it was actually pretty tough to do

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.129 
that it was actually pretty tough to do
but<00:03:41.729> post<00:03:42.729> them<00:03:42.819> below<00:03:42.849> I<00:03:43.060> mean<00:03:43.269> some<00:03:43.569> stages

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
but post them below I mean some stages

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.539 
but post them below I mean some stages
could<00:03:44.379> actually<00:03:44.500> be<00:03:44.769> pretty<00:03:44.979> easy<00:03:45.159> to

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
could actually be pretty easy to

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.509 
could actually be pretty easy to
recreate<00:03:46.049> like<00:03:47.049> in<00:03:47.199> like<00:03:47.349> Megaman<00:03:47.889> stages<00:03:48.370> and

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
recreate like in like Megaman stages and

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.860 
recreate like in like Megaman stages and
such<00:03:48.760> which<00:03:48.940> are<00:03:49.060> just<00:03:49.209> kind<00:03:49.359> of<00:03:49.419> basic

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
such which are just kind of basic

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.360 
such which are just kind of basic
layouts<00:03:50.799> of<00:03:50.949> platforms<00:03:51.549> so<00:03:51.669> I'm<00:03:51.819> it's<00:03:52.269> do<00:03:52.449> CPUs

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
layouts of platforms so I'm it's do CPUs

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.099 
layouts of platforms so I'm it's do CPUs
1<00:03:54.370> 2<00:03:54.579> 3<00:03:54.790> 4<00:03:55.120> I'm<00:03:55.299> just<00:03:55.419> gonna<00:03:55.510> do<00:03:55.690> four<00:03:55.930> before

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
1 2 3 4 I'm just gonna do four before

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.819 
1 2 3 4 I'm just gonna do four before
level<00:03:56.680> 9<00:03:56.889> of<00:03:57.190> course<00:03:57.519> because<00:03:57.849> they're<00:03:58.030> crazy

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
level 9 of course because they're crazy

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.180 
level 9 of course because they're crazy
absolutely<00:03:59.829> nuts

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
absolutely nuts

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.729 
absolutely nuts
reading<00:04:01.120> inputs<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.659> all<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.930> not<00:04:02.379> fair

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
reading inputs and all that not fair

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.390 
reading inputs and all that not fair
random<00:04:03.220> I<00:04:03.569> think<00:04:04.569> we<00:04:04.659> should<00:04:04.870> do<00:04:04.959> random

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
random I think we should do random

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.570 
random I think we should do random
random<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.459> always<00:04:06.669> best

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580

all right Bob on battlefield here are

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.380 
all right Bob on battlefield here are
the<00:04:13.069> other<00:04:13.220> custom<00:04:13.580> stages<00:04:13.849> if<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.150> haven't

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
the other custom stages if you haven't

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.940 
the other custom stages if you haven't
seen<00:04:14.599> my<00:04:14.810> custom<00:04:15.200> stage<00:04:15.349> videos<00:04:15.650> check<00:04:15.830> them

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
seen my custom stage videos check them

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.620 
seen my custom stage videos check them
out<00:04:16.040> if<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:16.400> like<00:04:16.609> its<00:04:16.880> custom<00:04:17.180> stages<00:04:17.419> you're

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
out if you like its custom stages you're

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.060 
out if you like its custom stages you're
watching<00:04:17.900> this<00:04:18.019> I'm<00:04:18.260> guessing<00:04:18.500> has<00:04:18.709> some<00:04:18.889> sort

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
watching this I'm guessing has some sort

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.600 
watching this I'm guessing has some sort
of<00:04:19.130> passing<00:04:19.519> interest<00:04:19.850> here<00:04:20.660> we<00:04:20.780> go<00:04:20.900> bomb<00:04:21.200> bomb

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
of passing interest here we go bomb bomb

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.290 
of passing interest here we go bomb bomb
battlefield<00:04:24.550> we've<00:04:25.550> seen<00:04:25.790> a<00:04:25.820> Jigglypuff

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
battlefield we've seen a Jigglypuff

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.290 
battlefield we've seen a Jigglypuff
Megaman<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:27.080> Yoshi<00:04:27.490> who<00:04:28.490> is<00:04:28.639> gonna<00:04:28.790> win<00:04:29.000> I'm

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
Megaman and a Yoshi who is gonna win I'm

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.230 
Megaman and a Yoshi who is gonna win I'm
not<00:04:29.540> sure<00:04:29.780> I'm<00:04:29.960> thinking<00:04:30.440> maybe<00:04:30.850> maybe<00:04:31.850> Yoshi

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
not sure I'm thinking maybe maybe Yoshi

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.440 
not sure I'm thinking maybe maybe Yoshi
I<00:04:32.600> don't<00:04:33.590> know<00:04:33.710> Yoshi's<00:04:34.700> got<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.000> kill<00:04:35.210> power

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
I don't know Yoshi's got the kill power

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.000 
I don't know Yoshi's got the kill power
that<00:04:35.600> these<00:04:35.810> characters<00:04:36.230> don't<00:04:36.500> really

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
that these characters don't really

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.180 
that these characters don't really
really<00:04:37.850> have<00:04:38.120> but<00:04:38.540> I<00:04:38.840> don't<00:04:39.650> know<00:04:39.770> I'm<00:04:39.860> not<00:04:40.010> too

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
really have but I don't know I'm not too

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.460 
really have but I don't know I'm not too
sure<00:04:40.450> haven't<00:04:41.450> seen<00:04:41.630> too<00:04:41.750> much<00:04:41.840> Jigglypuff

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
sure haven't seen too much Jigglypuff

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.600 
sure haven't seen too much Jigglypuff
especially<00:04:42.919> CPU<00:04:43.310> Jigglypuff<00:04:44.919> so<00:04:45.919> I<00:04:46.220> don't

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
especially CPU Jigglypuff so I don't

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.180 
especially CPU Jigglypuff so I don't
know<00:04:46.700> I<00:04:46.729> mean<00:04:47.030> lightweight<00:04:47.660> probably<00:04:48.440> not<00:04:49.160> a

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
know I mean lightweight probably not a

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.190 
know I mean lightweight probably not a
good<00:04:49.460> sign<00:04:49.729> I<00:04:49.760> think<00:04:50.000> this<00:04:50.479> is<00:04:50.600> probably<00:04:50.960> just

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
good sign I think this is probably just

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.020 
good sign I think this is probably just
gonna<00:04:51.260> come<00:04:51.560> down<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.770> who<00:04:52.070> gets<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.400> 1<00:04:52.669> kill

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
gonna come down to who gets a 1 kill

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.340 
gonna come down to who gets a 1 kill
because<00:04:53.150> this<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.450> just<00:04:53.660> a<00:04:53.750> two-minute<00:04:54.080> match

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
because this is just a two-minute match

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.350 
because this is just a two-minute match
didn't<00:04:55.010> want<00:04:55.160> this<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.430> go<00:04:55.550> on<00:04:55.729> forever<00:04:56.210> and

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
didn't want this to go on forever and

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.870 
didn't want this to go on forever and
waste<00:04:56.690> your<00:04:56.930> time<00:04:59.830> all<00:05:00.830> pretty<00:05:01.100> even<00:05:01.310> percent

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
waste your time all pretty even percent

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.250 
waste your time all pretty even percent
see<00:05:01.970> oh<00:05:02.000> she's<00:05:02.270> actually<00:05:02.450> looking<00:05:02.660> pretty<00:05:03.050> bad

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
see oh she's actually looking pretty bad

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.930 
see oh she's actually looking pretty bad
you<00:05:03.560> agree<00:05:03.680> talk<00:05:03.860> about<00:05:04.010> less<00:05:04.280> percent<00:05:04.700> but

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
you agree talk about less percent but

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.430 
you agree talk about less percent but
she's<00:05:05.180> lighter<00:05:05.450> that's<00:05:05.660> pretty<00:05:05.900> much<00:05:06.080> equal

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
she's lighter that's pretty much equal

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.070 
she's lighter that's pretty much equal
to<00:05:06.560> Yoshi's<00:05:06.919> percent<00:05:07.310> because<00:05:07.520> he<00:05:07.669> is<00:05:07.880> a<00:05:08.360> heavy

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
to Yoshi's percent because he is a heavy

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.640 
to Yoshi's percent because he is a heavy
and<00:05:09.880> not<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.060> heavy<00:05:11.240> but<00:05:11.540> definitely<00:05:12.050> pretty

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
and not that heavy but definitely pretty

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.320 
and not that heavy but definitely pretty
heavy<00:05:12.919> especially<00:05:13.130> considering<00:05:13.820> his<00:05:13.940> speed

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
heavy especially considering his speed

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.290 
heavy especially considering his speed
and<00:05:17.470> quickness<00:05:18.470> he's<00:05:18.979> very<00:05:19.220> fast<00:05:19.580> like<00:05:20.060> in

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
and quickness he's very fast like in

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.570 
and quickness he's very fast like in
terms<00:05:20.570> of<00:05:20.630> mobility<00:05:20.960> also<00:05:21.770> very<00:05:22.220> quick<00:05:22.460> in

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
terms of mobility also very quick in

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.260 
terms of mobility also very quick in
terms<00:05:22.760> of<00:05:22.820> attack<00:05:23.180> speed<00:05:23.600> so<00:05:24.820> I've<00:05:25.820> hidin<00:05:26.180> at

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
terms of attack speed so I've hidin at

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.300 
terms of attack speed so I've hidin at
the<00:05:26.390> top<00:05:26.600> going<00:05:26.930> on<00:05:27.080> to<00:05:27.229> the<00:05:27.320> island<00:05:27.500> in<00:05:27.830> the

the top going on to the island in the

the top going on to the island in the
middle<00:05:28.550> of<00:05:28.640> the<00:05:28.700> sky<00:05:29.260> that<00:05:30.260> Islands<00:05:30.740> saving

middle of the sky that Islands saving

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.670 
middle of the sky that Islands saving
Yoshi<00:05:32.090> right<00:05:32.450> there<00:05:32.750> megaman<00:05:32.990> just<00:05:33.470> kind<00:05:33.650> of

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
and the CPU can actually dodge them

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.190 
and the CPU can actually dodge them
pretty<00:05:46.520> well<00:05:46.789> because<00:05:47.060> they<00:05:47.510> can<00:05:47.960> power

three or four killers I guess now that
you<00:06:28.980> need<00:06:29.190> to<00:06:29.790> beat<00:06:30.000> him<00:06:30.030> but<00:06:30.270> do<00:06:30.420> group<00:06:30.570> of<00:06:30.720> it

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
you need to beat him but do group of it

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.800 
you need to beat him but do group of it
