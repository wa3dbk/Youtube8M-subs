the reason why this is perfectly safe to

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:03.349 
the reason why this is perfectly safe to
use<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.139> majestic<00:01:01.559> bird<00:01:01.979> like<00:01:02.219> Gigi<00:01:02.729> because

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
use on a majestic bird like Gigi because

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.560 
use on a majestic bird like Gigi because
if<00:01:03.719> she<00:01:03.899> jumps<00:01:04.260> off<00:01:04.500> his<00:01:05.339> equal<00:01:05.940> pressure<00:01:06.299> on

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
if she jumps off his equal pressure on

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.550 
if she jumps off his equal pressure on
each<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.530> her<00:01:07.680> legs<00:01:08.000> because<00:01:09.000> both<00:01:09.660> legs<00:01:10.020> stop

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
each of her legs because both legs stop

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.210 
each of her legs because both legs stop
the<00:01:10.770> same<00:01:11.010> time<00:01:11.370> when<00:01:11.940> she<00:01:12.120> jumps<00:01:12.480> off<00:01:12.600> my<00:01:12.870> hand

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
the same time when she jumps off my hand

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.190 
the same time when she jumps off my hand
this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.400> very<00:01:14.640> important<00:01:15.300> because<00:01:15.540> many

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
this is very important because many

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.590 
this is very important because many
people<00:01:16.440> will<00:01:16.650> put<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> leash<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.460> parrot<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
people will put a leash on a parrot that

people will put a leash on a parrot that
goes<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.590> leg<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.220> should<00:01:20.760> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
goes to just one leg and should the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.760 
goes to just one leg and should the
power<00:01:21.000> jump<00:01:21.390> off<00:01:21.570> that's<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.410> hurt<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
power jump off that's going to hurt it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.220 
power jump off that's going to hurt it
but<00:01:23.190> for<00:01:23.310> thousands<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.090> thousands<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.870> years

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
but for thousands and thousands of years

problem<00:02:06.510> that<00:02:06.540> we<00:02:06.750> had<00:02:06.960> people<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.740> many<00:02:08.129> many

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
problem that we had people for many many

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.410 
problem that we had people for many many
years<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.000> asked<00:02:09.330> me<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.259> devise<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:11.420> Jess

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
years of asked me can you devise a Jess

this on Harry it would be gone in 15

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.270 
this on Harry it would be gone in 15
minutes<00:02:24.569> because<00:02:24.660> he<00:02:24.810> chew<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.200> right<00:02:25.440> up<00:02:25.620> so

minutes because he chew it right up so

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.640 
minutes because he chew it right up so
we<00:02:26.489> went<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> drawing<00:02:27.330> board<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.410> is

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
we went to the drawing board and this is

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.160 
we went to the drawing board and this is
what<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:28.950> figured<00:02:29.220> out<00:02:29.660> good<00:02:30.660> old<00:02:30.840> drawing

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170

what we figured out good old drawing
board<00:02:31.489> Harry<00:02:32.489> here<00:02:32.910> has<00:02:33.120> figured<00:02:33.360> out<00:02:33.630> the

board Harry here has figured out the

best way to have just set up and a leash
set<00:02:36.780> up<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.080> your<00:02:37.769> pet<00:02:38.040> parrot<00:02:38.519> all<00:02:38.849> three<00:02:39.269> of

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
set up on your pet parrot all three of

set up on your pet parrot all three of
these<00:02:39.450> birds<00:02:39.750> do<00:02:40.200> not<00:02:40.230> have<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.739> wing

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920

feathers trim all three of these birds

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.839 
feathers trim all three of these birds
would<00:02:43.230> be<00:02:43.319> perfectly<00:02:43.739> safe<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.069> take<00:02:44.370> outside

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
would be perfectly safe to take outside

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.539 
would be perfectly safe to take outside
because<00:02:45.629> using<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.349> techniques<00:02:46.799> that<00:02:47.370> we've

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
because using the techniques that we've

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.460 
because using the techniques that we've
learned<00:02:47.580> through<00:02:48.000> thousands<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.870> years<00:02:48.930> of

learned through thousands of years of
falconry<00:02:50.190> we've<00:02:50.760> applied<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.420> parrots

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
falconry we've applied this to parrots

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.960 
falconry we've applied this to parrots
and<00:02:52.049> done<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.769> way<00:02:52.950> that's<00:02:53.430> perfectly

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
and done it in a way that's perfectly

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.670 
and done it in a way that's perfectly
safe<00:02:54.180> for<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.420> parrot<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.290> they<00:02:55.410> can't

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
safe for the parrot and that they can't

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.000 
safe for the parrot and that they can't
chew<00:02:56.069> up<00:02:56.250> or<00:02:56.819> chew<00:02:57.120> off<00:02:57.590> now<00:02:58.590> let's<00:02:58.860> take<00:02:58.980> a

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
chew up or chew off now let's take a

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.759 
chew up or chew off now let's take a
look<00:02:59.190> at<00:02:59.280> Marty<00:02:59.610> here<00:02:59.819> come<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.299> Marty<00:03:00.709> now<00:03:01.709> you

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
look at Marty here come on Marty now you

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.789 
look at Marty here come on Marty now you
see<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.910> jet<00:03:03.480> setup<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.079> same<00:03:04.319> way<00:03:04.590> that

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
see the jet setup is the same way that

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.110 
see the jet setup is the same way that
we<00:03:04.920> have<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.190> on<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.370> power<00:03:05.549> there's<00:03:05.940> one

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
we have it on the power there's one

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.870 
we have it on the power there's one
little<00:03:06.360> leash<00:03:06.569> coming<00:03:07.230> from<00:03:07.349> each<00:03:07.650> foot<00:03:07.980> going

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
little leash coming from each foot going

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.990 
little leash coming from each foot going
down<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.329> a<00:03:09.360> swivel<00:03:09.980> put<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> leash<00:03:11.280> attached<00:03:11.670> to

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
down to a swivel put a leash attached to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.600 
down to a swivel put a leash attached to
it<00:03:12.530> now<00:03:13.530> there's<00:03:13.769> two<00:03:13.950> different<00:03:13.980> ways<00:03:14.370> of

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
it now there's two different ways of

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.150 
it now there's two different ways of
putting<00:03:14.790> these<00:03:15.170> leashes<00:03:16.170> on<00:03:16.349> your<00:03:16.680> parents

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
putting these leashes on your parents

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.300 
putting these leashes on your parents
some<00:03:17.819> birds<00:03:18.060> will<00:03:18.209> have<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.810> band<00:03:19.560> on<00:03:19.859> it<00:03:20.069> that's

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
some birds will have a band on it that's

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.699 
some birds will have a band on it that's
already<00:03:20.670> put<00:03:21.359> on<00:03:21.510> by<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.690> breeder<00:03:22.079> and<00:03:22.380> if

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
already put on by the breeder and if

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.110 
already put on by the breeder and if
that's<00:03:22.889> the<00:03:23.069> case<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.459> can<00:03:23.549> just<00:03:23.609> hook<00:03:23.940> this

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
that's the case you can just hook this

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.280 
that's the case you can just hook this
very<00:03:24.989> very<00:03:25.200> non-toxic<00:03:25.799> safe<00:03:26.430> clip<00:03:27.239> right<00:03:27.810> onto

very very non-toxic safe clip right onto

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.660 
very very non-toxic safe clip right onto
the<00:03:28.380> bird's<00:03:28.590> leg<00:03:28.920> better<00:03:29.190> bird<00:03:29.459> that's

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
the bird's leg better bird that's

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.849 
the bird's leg better bird that's
wearing<00:03:30.239> apparently<00:03:31.139> she<00:03:31.200> doesn't<00:03:31.680> need<00:03:31.799> to

wearing apparently she doesn't need to

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.890 
wearing apparently she doesn't need to
have<00:03:32.130> its<00:03:32.310> wings<00:03:32.579> trimmed<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.150> means<00:03:33.720> that

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
have its wings trimmed that means that

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.039 
have its wings trimmed that means that
bird<00:03:34.109> can<00:03:34.350> fly<00:03:34.650> now<00:03:35.609> birds<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.299> fly<00:03:36.569> have

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
bird can fly now birds I can fly have

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.860 
bird can fly now birds I can fly have
less<00:03:37.380> incidents<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.250> feather<00:03:38.519> picking<00:03:38.870> birds

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
less incidents of feather picking birds

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.349 
less incidents of feather picking birds
that<00:03:40.109> can<00:03:40.319> fly<00:03:40.350> are<00:03:40.829> healthier<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.700> birds

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
that can fly are healthier and birds

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.809 
that can fly are healthier and birds
like<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.600> fly<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.560> look<00:03:43.950> better<00:03:44.250> look<00:03:44.639> I'm

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
like a fly just look better look I'm

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.759 
like a fly just look better look I'm
pretty<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.329> conyers<00:03:45.750> wings<00:03:46.019> look<00:03:46.319> he

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
pretty this conyers wings look he

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.650 
pretty this conyers wings look he
doesn't<00:03:46.950> have<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.280> have<00:03:47.430> his<00:03:47.549> wings<00:03:47.790> trim<00:03:48.150> so

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
doesn't have to have his wings trim so

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.740 
doesn't have to have his wings trim so
therefore<00:03:49.310> he<00:03:50.310> really<00:03:50.639> looks<00:03:50.850> like<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.060> bird<00:03:51.389> he

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
therefore he really looks like a bird he

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.180 
therefore he really looks like a bird he
doesn't<00:03:52.079> have<00:03:52.230> his<00:03:52.380> wings<00:03:52.620> brothers<00:03:52.950> trim

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
doesn't have his wings brothers trim

each snap that leads to the jess then

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.279 
each snap that leads to the jess then
there's<00:04:43.560> another<00:04:43.650> swivel<00:04:44.509> here<00:04:45.509> where<00:04:46.169> the
