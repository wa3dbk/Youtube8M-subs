where I'll just set up another head

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.649 
where I'll just set up another head
movement<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.850> time<00:01:48.090> we'll<00:01:48.330> use<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
movement but this time we'll use the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.289 
movement but this time we'll use the
right<00:01:48.899> here<00:01:49.289> to<00:01:49.409> movement<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.860> time<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:51.149> go

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
right here to movement this time so go

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.919 
right here to movement this time so go
back<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.539> camera<00:01:52.070> right<00:01:53.070> head<00:01:53.280> movement<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
back to camera right head movement and

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.310 
back to camera right head movement and
I'll<00:01:54.929> pick<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.320> decrease<00:01:56.280> volume<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.850> time

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
I'll pick the decrease volume this time

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:06.720 
I'll pick the decrease volume this time
so<00:01:58.320> let's<00:01:58.470> give<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.710> one<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.920> go
