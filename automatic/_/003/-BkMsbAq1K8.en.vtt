and the 7d and features and price but

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.940 
and the 7d and features and price but
basically<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.809> reason<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.770> was

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
basically the reason that I got it was

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.130 
basically the reason that I got it was
because<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.969> read<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> lot<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:45.960> good

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
because I read a lot of really good

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
reviews on the 60d and decided that if I

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.410 
reviews on the 60d and decided that if I
was<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> SLR<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.180> video
