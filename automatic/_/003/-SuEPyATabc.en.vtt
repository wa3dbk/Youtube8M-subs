00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.690
 Full battery recharge on 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.899
 vehicle gives us a driving range of 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.850
 up to 132 kilometers the system 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.040
 Battery recharge of chevrolet spark and

 users of the spark ev and from its 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.760
 phone to be able to visualize where they exist 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.220
 public recharge stations see if 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.410
 are available or not and see if there is 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.450
 a fee or not at the time of making your 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.000
 recharge the ways in which we can 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.100
 recharging this vehicle is through 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.370
 a 240 volt recharge station 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.650
 It would take approximately 7 hours 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.010
 there is the option of a super load 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.250
 in which it would take 80% to load 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.860
 of the battery in just 20 minutes the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.840
 Approximate cost to recharge is parker 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.049
 and completely is around 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.599
 64 pesos this means a saving of 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.840
 between 30 and 40 percent of what you 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.879
 It would cost a person to travel 132 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.159
 kilometers in a vehicle similar to 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.010
