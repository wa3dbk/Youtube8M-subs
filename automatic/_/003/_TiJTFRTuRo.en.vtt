reveal my caves or whatever actually
hang<00:03:49.290> on<00:03:49.379> I<00:03:49.470> leaving<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:49.859> here<00:03:50.040> now<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.819> can't

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
hang on I leaving it here now you can't

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.990 
hang on I leaving it here now you can't
see<00:03:53.359> and<00:03:54.359> now<00:03:54.540> I'll<00:03:54.720> show<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:55.730> stuff<00:03:56.730> without

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
see and now I'll show you stuff without

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.860 
see and now I'll show you stuff without
the<00:03:57.239> codes<00:03:57.470> okay<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.510> what's<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:02.720> hmm<00:04:03.720> I

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
the codes okay so what's this hmm I

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.009 
the codes okay so what's this hmm I
don't<00:04:04.769> know<00:04:04.919> what<00:04:05.069> that<00:04:05.099> is<00:04:05.250> anyway<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:06.959> you

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
don't know what that is anyway so you

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:13.430 
don't know what that is anyway so you
get<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:08.510> then<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.750> get<00:04:09.959> your<00:04:11.150> cards<00:04:12.440> for

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
get that then you get your cards for

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:26.680 
get that then you get your cards for
each<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.799> your<00:04:13.919> characters<00:04:19.310> ok<00:04:20.310> no

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.060 

that's<00:04:27.440> why<00:04:27.530> they<00:04:27.650> look<00:04:27.770> like<00:04:27.890> on<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.100> back

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
that's why they look like on the back

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.220 
that's why they look like on the back
and<00:04:31.070> yet<00:04:32.140> now<00:04:33.140> here's<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.710> code<00:04:33.890> thing<00:04:34.280> is<00:04:34.490> I

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
and yet now here's the code thing is I

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:42.210 
and yet now here's the code thing is I
just<00:04:36.230> pop<00:04:36.440> them<00:04:36.590> here<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.420> get<00:04:38.630> this

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.010 

which<00:04:43.220> I<00:04:43.370> seems<00:04:43.730> just<00:04:44.090> like<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.360> instructions

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.670 
right and yeah you place your figure on
somehow<00:06:37.650> as<00:06:38.650> if<00:06:38.710> by<00:06:39.130> magic<00:06:39.160> the<00:06:40.680> information

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
somehow as if by magic the information

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.620 
somehow as if by magic the information
is<00:06:41.830> red<00:06:42.040> so<00:06:42.280> I've<00:06:42.670> no<00:06:43.030> idea<00:06:43.150> how<00:06:43.300> that<00:06:43.480> works

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.630 
is red so I've no idea how that works

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.320 
is red so I've no idea how that works
and<00:06:43.980> i'll<00:06:44.980> try<00:06:45.190> and<00:06:45.370> a<00:06:45.430> review<00:06:45.610> on<00:06:45.910> this<00:06:46.060> game

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330
