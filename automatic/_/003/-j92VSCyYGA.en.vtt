00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
you like see that line jump and then

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.580 
you like see that line jump and then
when<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.540> gets<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.930> bottom<00:01:42.110> you'll<00:01:42.380> see

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
when it gets to the bottom you'll see

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.050 
when it gets to the bottom you'll see
the<00:01:42.710> line<00:01:42.920> kind<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.400> go<00:01:43.520> limp

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
the line kind of go limp

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
then you know it's time to start working

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.450 
then you know it's time to start working
it<00:01:46.460> but<00:01:47.050> most<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.140> time<00:01:48.260> especially<00:01:48.980> when<00:01:49.310> I'm

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460

going to let that jig go all the way to
the<00:01:52.400> bottom<00:01:52.580> now<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.450> fall<00:01:53.720> when<00:01:54.620> you<00:01:54.710> get

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
the bottom now in the fall when you get

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.590 
the bottom now in the fall when you get
a<00:01:54.890> lot<00:01:55.040> of<00:01:55.070> fish<00:01:55.370> up<00:01:55.640> on<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:55.910> surface<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.540> the

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
Sun Lakes feeding on shad there'll be

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.460 
Sun Lakes feeding on shad there'll be
underneath<00:01:59.030> boat<00:01:59.360> docks<00:01:59.630> they'll<00:01:59.930> be<00:02:00.050> on<00:02:00.200> tree

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
underneath boat docks they'll be on tree

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.620 
underneath boat docks they'll be on tree
tops<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.040> then<00:02:01.160> you<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.760> know<00:02:01.790> pitch<00:02:02.480> that
