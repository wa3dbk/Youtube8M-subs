00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.460
 last weekend was at the werner-soulbinder-hall in Apolda 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.750
 again local derby time announced in the handball women's league stood up 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.890
 the host HSV Apolda and the challenger from Weimar 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:19.150
 so would need here 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.900
 he masters the big local derby against the title champions and now guys 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.640
 Butter with the fish die how it looks 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.009
 he would be german championship title we are 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.270
 the always favorite at 9 o'clock the Belgians and as «Monstrum» 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.850
 the team will take on the role of favorite and we want 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.320
 more inmates die 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.360
 the hot weather profit 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.380
 That's what I'm expecting 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.770
 no false modesty at HSV Weimar 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.760
 who are mostly you want to win today or 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.159
 there good food 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.369
 It's a bit difficult because you'll have your own record and you'll just think about me 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:56.389
 that the start of this year maybe had a better team but 

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:57.950
 maybe even before 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.900
 the little Kubot 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.320
 But both teams did not really get involved in the first minutes 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.100
 no matter if untransformed litters like this one from Manila Planner 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.640
 or writer on the other side of Weimer Visier much he ran 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.860
 with the number 15 that were decisive points that is after 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.170
 four minutes still 0 0 stood 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.070
 but then took the defense of AV Hardt two times in a row 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.130
 Apolda under pressure and manage to play a majority 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.140
 scored two goalscorers to 2 0 for Weimar 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.600
 Ole's red card from HSV Weimar might be different 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.800
 have come off the bench in the ninth minute and meet Francisco Google 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800
 at this all world v li na 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.580
 H 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.900
 Referee decides rightly to protest 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 Coach Sebastian Barth is accordingly angry 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.320
 until the 8 8 guests could still keep up but Weimar was unlucky 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.229
 pursued here was Yvonne Beister beautifully unlocked meets but unfortunately 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.709
 Only the latte Apolda took advantage of this opportunity ushered in the counterattack 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.709
 Sandra Bullock ease in the gate submerged 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.879
 then Apolda's talents showed off their strengths like a band 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.229
 Freihof standard situation or even pulled through the circle their gates 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:28.519
 enlarged the lead of Apolda so it went with the 15 to 9 in the 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.519
 Half-time 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.749
 the second half six goals off the pace on the ground 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.699
 Weimar did not really know RP 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.309
 again it came to teething problems on both sides play and 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:49.459
 Mistakes were catastrophic again after four minutes not a single goal 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:55.119
 then a blaze of guests here a nice move initiated by 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:58.699
 the left wing play genius that left Jakob straight in the middle 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.699
 pushed and meets the connection only 17 percent 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.209
 but comforting miscarriages on autumn or striker cheerfully cheers 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.209
 The derby can not succeed 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.419
 the bath is also so slowly the winemaker coach 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.659
 lack Abspiele 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.469
 Apolda let nothing burn and played at times loose from here 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.469
 Sandra Pohl for the 27th to the 19th 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.419
 and as the best goal scorer with 8 goals Juliane Becker put in the end 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.809
 still a feast for the eyes 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:40.389
 from twelve meters she hits her mark in the last second 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:40.990
 final score 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.990
 28 10 20 for April 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.119
 Sebastian 28 20 has become quite clear 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.760
 I think that she was the target now, the weather has kept up very well 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.559
 under 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:57.899
 a, although he was able to do politics 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:59.209
 Howard 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.409
 for one reason or another, no longer forecasting that 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.739
 Concept that one had made further consistently pursued 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.439
 Percent pulled Havana learn from the defeats and proton that that 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.309
 out and therefore try against the smaller teams 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.749
 all of them are practically all against them 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.849
 win them all there but come here 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.359
 and 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.430
 maybe it was also normal that the Swiss made their sentences too 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.740
 always thinking that it will be very difficult for all of them 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.370
 Claim back 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.749
 was a deserved victory too 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:32.849
 but what was going on until he got kicked? 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.530
 since we certainly do not know if they are all above the clouds above the clouds 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.139
 Stand ground 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.389
 only played standball so that no fried cover like Weimar 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.060
 do not spoil then the mentioned time-out and at the end of the first half 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.560
 It was then also at the defense ensures that Ariane 6 should because 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.559
 postponed 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:54.159
 because one noticed also that two times from Obertraun has some deficits 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.110
 But what then implemented and then have the lead the place for luck dive 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.150
 stopped because it would be difficult that was clear to me from the beginning
