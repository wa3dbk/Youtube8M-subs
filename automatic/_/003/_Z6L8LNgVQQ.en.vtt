reason<00:02:10.979> why<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.160> makes<00:02:11.370> sense<00:02:11.459> for<00:02:11.640> them<00:02:11.819> to

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
reason why it makes sense for them to

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.830 
reason why it makes sense for them to
switch<00:02:12.150> over<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.510> get<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.690> bed<00:02:12.720> with

concertino<00:02:18.959> makes<00:02:19.200> sense<00:02:19.440> for<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.739> developer

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
concertino makes sense for a developer

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.400 
concertino makes sense for a developer
to<00:02:20.160> make<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.550> lead<00:02:20.790> development<00:02:21.330> game<00:02:21.630> on<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
to make the lead development game on the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.990 
to make the lead development game on the
more<00:02:22.590> powerful<00:02:22.860> console<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.580> then<00:02:23.670> poured<00:02:23.910> it

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
more powerful console and then poured it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.120 
more powerful console and then poured it
down<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.080> less<00:02:25.260> powerful<00:02:25.620> console<00:02:26.040> you

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
down to the less powerful console you

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.710 
down to the less powerful console you
know<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.280> PlayStation<00:02:26.760> 4<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.180> slightly<00:02:27.569> more

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
power from the xbox 360 it does have the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.040 
power from the xbox 360 it does have the
better<00:02:29.670> hardware<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.690> makes<00:02:30.959> sense

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
better hardware so that makes sense

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.930 
better hardware so that makes sense
there<00:02:31.410> now<00:02:31.590> also<00:02:32.370> if<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.459> guys<00:02:32.610> remember<00:02:32.730> a

1080p videos but anyway it's just it's
gonna<00:04:43.260> be<00:04:43.440> a<00:04:43.470> better<00:04:43.560> game<00:04:43.800> because<00:04:44.160> develop

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
gonna be a better game because develop

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.950 
gonna be a better game because develop
for<00:04:44.760> that<00:04:44.880> platform<00:04:45.150> when<00:04:45.510> it's<00:04:45.630> pulled<00:04:45.840> it

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
for that platform when it's pulled it

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.260 
for that platform when it's pulled it
over<00:04:46.080> it<00:04:46.380> loses<00:04:46.950> just<00:04:47.250> I<00:04:47.430> don't<00:04:47.820> even<00:04:48.030> know

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
over it loses just I don't even know

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.730 
over it loses just I don't even know
what<00:04:48.450> it<00:04:48.570> is<00:04:48.600> and<00:04:48.990> there's<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.200> bunch<00:04:49.350> of<00:04:49.470> texts

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
what it is and there's a bunch of texts

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.960 
what it is and there's a bunch of texts
Pacific's<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.280> stuff<00:04:50.430> I'm<00:04:50.550> not<00:04:50.670> going<00:04:50.820> to<00:04:50.880> get

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
Pacific's and stuff I'm not going to get

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.820 
Pacific's and stuff I'm not going to get
into<00:04:51.090> but<00:04:51.450> you<00:04:51.900> can<00:04:52.020> just<00:04:52.170> feel<00:04:52.350> it<00:04:52.410> like<00:04:52.680> I

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
into but you can just feel it like I

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.130 
into but you can just feel it like I
think<00:04:53.430> ghosts<00:04:53.730> feels<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.240> lot<00:04:54.390> better<00:04:54.600> on<00:04:54.720> xbox

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
think ghosts feels a lot better on xbox

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.570 
think ghosts feels a lot better on xbox
one<00:04:55.380> then<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.620> doesn't<00:04:55.770> playstation<00:04:56.370> 4

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
one then it doesn't playstation 4

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.940 
one then it doesn't playstation 4
because<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.360> was<00:04:57.450> developed<00:04:57.840> for<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.140> I<00:04:58.320> think

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
because it was developed for it I think

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.310 
because it was developed for it I think
ghosts<00:04:59.370> and<00:04:59.760> everything<00:05:00.750> else<00:05:00.900> before<00:05:01.080> it

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
ghosts and everything else before it

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.260 
ghosts and everything else before it
played<00:05:01.500> a<00:05:01.530> lot<00:05:01.800> better<00:05:01.830> on<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.220> xbox<00:05:02.550> 360<00:05:02.940> then

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
played a lot better on the xbox 360 then

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.530 
played a lot better on the xbox 360 then
on<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.420> ps3<00:05:04.100> because<00:05:05.100> it's<00:05:05.310> develop<00:05:05.610> for<00:05:05.790> it's

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
on the ps3 because it's develop for it's

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.600 
on the ps3 because it's develop for it's
just<00:05:06.750> it's<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:06.990> lot<00:05:07.020> smoother<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:07.920> plays<00:05:08.400> better

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
just it's a lot smoother it plays better

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.700 
just it's a lot smoother it plays better
it<00:05:08.820> feels<00:05:08.850> better<00:05:09.300> there's<00:05:10.200> a<00:05:10.260> lot<00:05:10.410> less

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
it feels better there's a lot less

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.830 
it feels better there's a lot less
latency<00:05:11.010> I<00:05:11.340> think<00:05:11.790> I<00:05:11.910> don't<00:05:12.270> know<00:05:12.330> it's<00:05:12.690> hard

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
latency I think I don't know it's hard

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.660 
latency I think I don't know it's hard
to<00:05:12.900> explain<00:05:13.110> but<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:13.920> is<00:05:14.040> better<00:05:14.220> because<00:05:14.460> it's

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
to explain but it is better because it's

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.970 
to explain but it is better because it's
made<00:05:14.820> for<00:05:14.970> that<00:05:15.120> console<00:05:15.540> obviously<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:16.860> one

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
made for that console obviously the one

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.950 
made for that console obviously the one
is<00:05:17.130> specifically<00:05:17.550> made<00:05:17.670> for<00:05:17.850> it's<00:05:18.690> gonna<00:05:18.810> be

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
is specifically made for it's gonna be

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.250 
is specifically made for it's gonna be
better<00:05:19.080> on<00:05:19.290> a<00:05:20.280> shoe<00:05:21.120> for<00:05:21.360> one<00:05:21.570> guy<00:05:21.780> and<00:05:22.110> then

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
better on a shoe for one guy and then

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:29.780
