sounds<00:01:46.740> better<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:48.060> very<00:01:48.210> strange<00:01:48.479> thing

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
sounds better it's a very strange thing

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.889 
sounds better it's a very strange thing
I<00:01:49.079> think<00:01:49.740> we've<00:01:49.890> become<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.720> used<00:01:51.720> to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
I think we've become so used to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.289 
I think we've become so used to
recording<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.790> separated<00:01:53.790> from<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.149> live

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
recording and so separated from the live

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.289 
recording and so separated from the live
performance<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:55.020> classical<00:01:55.710> music<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.969> I

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
performance of classical music that I

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.370 
performance of classical music that I
think<00:01:57.689> you're<00:01:57.780> not<00:01:57.899> prepared<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
think you're not prepared for the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.959 
think you're not prepared for the
strangeness<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.250> still<00:01:59.490> find<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.759> very

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
strangeness of it I still find a very

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.970 
strangeness of it I still find a very
odd<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.450> bit<00:02:00.600> embarrassing<00:02:00.750> even<00:02:01.290> when<00:02:01.560> you

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
odd and a bit embarrassing even when you

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.460 
odd and a bit embarrassing even when you
in<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.640> room<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.180> watching<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:04.110> know<00:02:04.230> live

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.830 
yeah it's not like something they've
avoided<00:04:55.950> and<00:04:56.400> they're<00:04:56.640> often<00:04:56.789> into<00:04:57.539> the<00:04:57.630> same

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
avoided and they're often into the same

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.350 
avoided and they're often into the same
records<00:04:58.200> anyway<00:04:58.380> yeah<00:04:58.919> yes<00:04:59.669> I<00:04:59.789> think<00:05:00.060> it's

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
records anyway yeah yes I think it's

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.090 
records anyway yeah yes I think it's
become<00:05:00.660> far<00:05:00.870> more<00:05:00.900> Universal<00:05:01.740> in<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.890> last

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
become far more Universal in the last

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.690 
become far more Universal in the last
like<00:05:02.280> 30<00:05:02.610> years<00:05:02.820> really<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:04.710> last<00:05:05.160> week<00:05:05.340> on<00:05:05.490> show

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.240 
play all four strings and it's it looks
bizarre<00:05:18.419> but<00:05:18.750> sounds<00:05:19.380> as<00:05:19.620> amazing<00:05:20.010> as<00:05:20.130> you

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
bizarre but sounds as amazing as you

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.730 
bizarre but sounds as amazing as you
going<00:05:20.810> it's<00:05:21.810> probably<00:05:21.990> not<00:05:22.260> difficult<00:05:22.470> enough

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
going it's probably not difficult enough

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.730 
going it's probably not difficult enough
at<00:05:23.190> the<00:05:23.340> moment<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.820> need<00:05:24.000> to

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
at the moment I need to

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.460 
at the moment I need to
always<00:05:24.919> kind<00:05:25.190> of<00:05:25.300> it's<00:05:26.300> very<00:05:26.479> egotistical<00:05:26.900> but

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
always kind of it's very egotistical but

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.050 
always kind of it's very egotistical but
I<00:05:27.530> figured<00:05:27.919> if<00:05:28.069> I<00:05:28.190> could<00:05:28.460> if<00:05:28.610> I<00:05:28.729> couldn't

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
I figured if I could if I couldn't

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.820 
I figured if I could if I couldn't
possibly<00:05:29.240> play<00:05:29.690> it<00:05:29.750> then<00:05:29.930> no<00:05:30.080> one<00:05:30.229> can<00:05:30.410> I<00:05:30.620> kind

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
possibly play it then no one can I kind

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.490 
possibly play it then no one can I kind
of<00:05:30.860> don't<00:05:31.009> quite<00:05:31.220> realize<00:05:31.400> how<00:05:31.990> what<00:05:32.990> amazing

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
of don't quite realize how what amazing

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.159 
of don't quite realize how what amazing
things<00:05:33.530> he<00:05:33.860> can<00:05:34.009> do<00:05:34.130> right<00:05:34.639> so<00:05:35.090> and<00:05:35.509> I'm

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
things he can do right so and I'm

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.439 
things he can do right so and I'm
worried<00:05:36.500> of<00:05:36.710> just<00:05:37.099> using<00:05:37.460> that<00:05:37.699> for<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:38.240> sake

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
worried of just using that for the sake

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:39.670 
worried of just using that for the sake
