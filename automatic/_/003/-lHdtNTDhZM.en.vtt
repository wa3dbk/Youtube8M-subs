00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.130
 be Baptists so much 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.060
 batista70phone friends let's see 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.720
 four covers for samsung galaxy s 4 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.000
 we have the first metal effect here and 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.269
 this is practically a foil 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 let's see laterally it's rigid 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.760
 let's go inside it 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.820
 let's see how stocking it absolutely 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.530
 well the keys remain uncovered therefore 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.510
 there is no problem of access 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.850
 the upper part and the lower part 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.340
 also they are discovered so we don't have 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.950
 problems to load it is not covered 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.510
 the microphone is not covered anything a 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.410
 back to this beautiful 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.120
 aluminum effect with metal effect like 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.860
 you see everything remains uncovered by 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.590
 excellent protection and is very solid 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.879
 now let's move on to the next let's go to 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.369
 take it off 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.520
 we do so i am without a game not 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:11.690
 I should have big problems for 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:15.319
 take it off the cover a little while ago 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.310
 patience here we have done here 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:20.060
 we have a clip for with the back 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.280
 transparent 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.229
 let's go and thread it from above to below it 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.170
 itself slips easily enough 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.110
 as you see behind it leaves intact 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.780
 let's say the beauty of the cover 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.039
 therefore it does not go to cover the writing 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.920
 samsung and the texture below 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.989
 leave enough space to thread the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.530
 micro usb with good protection 

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:47.509
 we also have a bit of top thread of 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.700
 consequently even if we were to 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.039
 so put the glass on the table not 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.619
 goes directly in contact with the 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.410
 surface but a raised minimum remains 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.780
 ok now let's go and take it off as you can see 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.289
 also to take them very simple here 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.720
 we have a perfect fit let's go to 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:11.450
 putting it inside this fits very well 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.110
 as you can see we have a white part here 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.630
 behind it remains opaque but does not go anyway 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.640
 to cover the writing still remains is 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.040
 always evident 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.210
 we have a good minimum protection 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.520
 of frontal elevation a little less respect 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.510
 to the player bumper but still a minimum 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:37.640
 protection gives the keys are covered 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.860
 but as you can see they are up then 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.080
 you can easily click go to 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.240
 turn on we don't unlock the button 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.870
 volume we are going to lower let's go to 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.930
 raise quietly without any 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.000
 no effort at all we take this off 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.610
 as you see very easy to put e 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.120
 to take away we go to see the last one 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.260
 which is one of the most appreciated and is 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.050
 an ultra slim 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.330
 this is the one that leaves unchanged 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.030
 practically the size of the display 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.170
 the thickness remains practically the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.290
 same avoids scratches we say it is 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.990
 the one that provides the least protection in 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.760
 In case of falls, however , it assures you 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.390
 to not 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.019
 practically preserves you say from the gods 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.900
 scratch 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.420
 as you can see then it is rigid ie 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.700
 stiff is rough as a result you have not 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.530
 not even the soap and soap effect 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.709
 which can give you the plastic is 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.659
 absolutely does not spoil the aesthetics 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.420
 of the terminal always remains however 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.970
 very nice and I tell you it is very thin 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.739
 therefore the weight is negligible we will talk 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.280
 not even a gram goes wrong 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.209
 absolutely to weigh down though if you 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.560
 liked them found in our shop 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.540
 www.pat.it 70 phone points 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.540
 a greeting from loris alias batista70 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:06.269
 battistuzzi is stretch 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.269
 I know in the sense in search
