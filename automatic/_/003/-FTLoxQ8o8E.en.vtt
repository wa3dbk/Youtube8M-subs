free-for-all map Victoria Lynn black ops
in<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.799> tutorial<00:00:05.009> I'll<00:00:05.520> be<00:00:05.700> going<00:00:06.000> over<00:00:06.150> how

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
in this tutorial I'll be going over how

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.020 
in this tutorial I'll be going over how
to<00:00:06.960> be<00:00:07.230> be<00:00:07.649> effective<00:00:08.160> while<00:00:08.370> using<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.760> sniper

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
to be be effective while using a sniper

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.120 
to be be effective while using a sniper
rifle<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.480> free-for-all<00:00:09.929> match<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.679> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
rifle in the free-for-all match on the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.640 
rifle in the free-for-all match on the
map<00:00:11.309> firing<00:00:11.940> range<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.900> tutorial<00:00:13.139> will<00:00:13.469> have

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
map firing range this tutorial will have

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.020 
map firing range this tutorial will have
two<00:00:13.860> parts<00:00:14.219> showing<00:00:14.700> two<00:00:15.000> different

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
two parts showing two different

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.599 
two parts showing two different
strategies<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.289> could<00:00:16.440> use<00:00:16.680> for

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
strategies that you could use for

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.609 
strategies that you could use for
sniping<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.420> map<00:00:18.869> firing<00:00:19.410> range<00:00:20.000> but<00:00:21.000> um

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
sniping in the map firing range but um

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.070 
sniping in the map firing range but um
yeah<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.650> as<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.400> as<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:24.150> spawn<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
yeah so as this as I spawn and the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.170 
yeah so as this as I spawn and the
spades<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.670> we're<00:00:26.670> not<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> really

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
spades in we're not going to really

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.700 
spades in we're not going to really
worry<00:00:27.449> about<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.779> black<00:00:27.990> part<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.470> map

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
worry about the black part of this map

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.030 
worry about the black part of this map
and<00:00:29.869> we're<00:00:30.869> really<00:00:31.199> going<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> focus<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
and we're really going to focus on the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.950 
and we're really going to focus on the
green<00:00:32.250> part<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:33.000> I've<00:00:33.120> circled<00:00:33.329> off<00:00:33.660> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
green part that I've circled off and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.660 
green part that I've circled off and
that<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.620> basically<00:00:34.980> where<00:00:35.280> we're<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.610> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
that is basically where we're going to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.000 
that is basically where we're going to
stay<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.450> whole<00:00:36.630> entire<00:00:36.780> match<00:00:37.170> we're<00:00:37.890> going

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
stay this whole entire match we're going

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.450 
stay this whole entire match we're going
to<00:00:38.070> stay<00:00:38.190> around<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:38.969> area<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
to stay around this at this area and

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.600 
to stay around this at this area and
this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.640> usually<00:00:42.410> people's<00:00:43.410> top<00:00:44.010> pick<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
this is usually people's top pick the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.000 
this is usually people's top pick the
place<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.059> go<00:00:45.210> anyways<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.829> probably

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
place to go anyways so you probably

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.590 
place to go anyways so you probably
already<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.460> lot<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> six<00:00:48.030> periods<00:00:48.390> in

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
already have a lot of six periods in

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.709 
already have a lot of six periods in
this<00:00:48.719> building<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.570> effective<00:00:51.570> way

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
this building but this is effective way

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.569 
this building but this is effective way
for<00:00:51.960> using<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> sniper<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:53.129> even<00:00:53.460> more

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
for using a sniper it's even more

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.529 
for using a sniper it's even more
effective<00:00:53.850> than<00:00:54.300> using<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.079> regular<00:00:55.350> gun<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.860> my

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
effective than using a regular gun in my

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.410 
effective than using a regular gun in my
my<00:00:57.539> opinion<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.890> anyways<00:00:59.219> there's<00:00:59.699> five<00:01:00.059> main

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
my opinion but anyways there's five main

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.819 
my opinion but anyways there's five main
spawns<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.930> need<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.170> worry<00:01:01.350> about<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
spawns you need to worry about and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.009 
spawns you need to worry about and
they're<00:01:02.640> checked<00:01:02.910> off<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> red<00:01:03.600> circles

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
they're checked off with the red circles

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.260 
they're checked off with the red circles
you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.890> physically<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.369> three<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.150> these

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you can physically see three of these

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.570 
you can physically see three of these
spawns<00:01:06.600> from<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> green<00:01:07.439> area<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.460> other

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
spawns from the green area and the other

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.760 
spawns from the green area and the other
two<00:01:08.820> spawns<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> higher<00:01:09.750> probability<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
two spawns have a higher probability of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.710 
two spawns have a higher probability of
the<00:01:10.890> enemy<00:01:11.159> running<00:01:11.549> towards<00:01:11.880> green<00:01:12.210> area<00:01:12.570> as

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the enemy running towards green area as

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.460 
the enemy running towards green area as
they've<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.970> now<00:01:14.970> some<00:01:15.750> tips<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.320> must

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
they've on now some tips that you must

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950 
they've on now some tips that you must
use<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.920> don't<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.700> afraid<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.299> jump<00:01:18.689> down<00:01:18.900> from

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
use is don't be afraid to jump down from

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.800 
use is don't be afraid to jump down from
the<00:01:19.259> building<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:20.790> did<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.570> get<00:01:21.659> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the building like I just did to get that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.960 
the building like I just did to get that
enemy<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.890> probably<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.400> effective<00:01:23.850> than

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
enemy it's probably more effective than

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.340 
enemy it's probably more effective than
staying<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.689> waiting<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.140> him

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
staying up there and waiting for him

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.520 
staying up there and waiting for him
since<00:01:25.770> he<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.939> rush<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.750> maybe

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
since he can kind of rush you and maybe

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.660 
since he can kind of rush you and maybe
get<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> lucky<00:01:29.130> knife<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.850> or<00:01:30.270> such<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:31.079> um

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
get a lucky knife on you or such but um

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.429 
get a lucky knife on you or such but um
also<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.360> need<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> cover<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
also you're going to need to cover the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
also you're going to need to cover the
this<00:01:34.770> way<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.189> I'm<00:01:35.310> shooting<00:01:35.520> at<00:01:35.729> right<00:01:35.909> now

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
this way that I'm shooting at right now

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.380 
this way that I'm shooting at right now
and<00:01:37.100> even<00:01:38.100> though<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.520> into<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> gray<00:01:39.030> area

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and even though it's into the gray area

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.030 
and even though it's into the gray area
you<00:01:39.689> can't<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.079> any<00:01:40.229> spawns<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> gray

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you can't see any spawns in the gray

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.219 
you can't see any spawns in the gray
area<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:42.060> should<00:01:42.240> also<00:01:42.390> keep<00:01:42.720> an<00:01:42.840> eye<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
area you should also keep an eye on the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.100 
area you should also keep an eye on the
on<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:43.979> gray<00:01:44.220> area<00:01:44.520> as<00:01:44.610> well<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:48.079> you<00:01:49.079> can

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
on the gray area as well so you can

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.020 
on the gray area as well so you can
physically<00:01:49.829> see<00:01:49.860> through<00:01:50.490> those<00:01:50.640> spawns

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
physically see through those spawns

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.020 
physically see through those spawns
which<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.750> probably<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> most<00:01:53.030> consistent

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
which is probably the most consistent

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.889 
which is probably the most consistent
way<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:55.560> getting<00:01:56.159> kills<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:57.329> guys<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.780> can

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
way of getting kills like guys you can

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.359 
way of getting kills like guys you can
see<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.500> spawn<00:01:59.009> rate<00:01:59.280> beside<00:01:59.719> the<00:02:01.369> toilet

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
see the spawn rate beside the toilet

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.500 
see the spawn rate beside the toilet
room

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
room

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.990 
room
in<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.050> top<00:02:04.260> right<00:02:04.530> left<00:02:05.160> corner<00:02:05.550> I<00:02:05.610> mean<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
in the top right left corner I mean is

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.570 
in the top right left corner I mean is
the<00:02:06.990> spawn<00:02:07.230> that<00:02:07.410> I<00:02:07.440> find<00:02:07.800> most<00:02:08.040> people<00:02:08.460> will

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the spawn that I find most people will

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.090 
the spawn that I find most people will
spawn<00:02:08.820> at<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.410> one<00:02:10.560> right<00:02:10.920> beside

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
spawn at that and the one right beside

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.640 
spawn at that and the one right beside
the<00:02:11.430> green<00:02:11.610> area<00:02:11.850> those<00:02:12.720> are<00:02:12.900> two<00:02:13.170> spawns<00:02:13.500> that

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the green area those are two spawns that

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.860 
the green area those are two spawns that
you<00:02:13.710> must<00:02:13.860> look<00:02:14.040> at<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.700> most<00:02:14.940> because<00:02:15.420> that's

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
you must look at the most because that's

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.690 
you must look at the most because that's
the<00:02:16.140> most<00:02:16.710> times<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.220> people<00:02:17.340> are<00:02:17.520> going<00:02:17.610> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
the most times that people are going to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.140 
the most times that people are going to
be<00:02:17.790> coming<00:02:17.820> through<00:02:18.180> there<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:19.970> that's<00:02:20.970> just

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
be coming through there and that's just

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.890 
be coming through there and that's just
like<00:02:21.870> that's<00:02:22.500> just<00:02:23.460> what<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.730> found<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.870> is

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
like that's just what I found so this is

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.270 
like that's just what I found so this is
I<00:02:25.230> have<00:02:25.380> never<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.650> haven't<00:02:26.040> like<00:02:26.250> really

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
I have never I haven't like really

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.400 
I have never I haven't like really
researched<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.180> guy's<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.200> just

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
researched this guy's this is just

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.560 
researched this guy's this is just
basically<00:02:28.800> my<00:02:29.580> knowledge<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.270> have<00:02:30.360> come

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
basically my knowledge that I have come

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.230 
basically my knowledge that I have come
across<00:02:30.600> while<00:02:31.110> doing<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.240> I've

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
across while doing this and I've

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.220 
across while doing this and I've
basically<00:02:33.630> did<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:35.040> um<00:02:35.460> it's<00:02:36.240> up<00:02:36.480> upper

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
basically did this this um it's up upper

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.860 
basically did this this um it's up upper
half<00:02:37.550> not<00:02:38.550> upper<00:02:38.790> half<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.210> uh<00:02:39.240> this

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
half not upper half but uh this

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.200 
half not upper half but uh this
bird's-eye<00:02:40.350> view<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.800> map<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.310> that's

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
bird's-eye view of the map and that's

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.930 
bird's-eye view of the map and that's
basically<00:02:42.450> how<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.930> figure<00:02:43.320> out<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> spawns<00:02:44.160> so

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
basically how I figure out the spawns so

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.150 
basically how I figure out the spawns so
you<00:02:45.750> guys<00:02:46.110> are<00:02:46.350> always<00:02:46.440> curious<00:02:46.710> about<00:02:46.920> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
you guys are always curious about the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.250 
you guys are always curious about the
sponsor<00:02:47.580> some<00:02:47.760> apps<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:48.330> going<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.020> the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
sponsor some apps just going to the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.430 
sponsor some apps just going to the
theater<00:02:50.160> mode<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.670> then<00:02:51.240> hit<00:02:51.480> triangle<00:02:52.080> twice

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
theater mode and then hit triangle twice

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.080 
theater mode and then hit triangle twice
I<00:02:52.620> believe<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.100> just<00:02:53.310> go<00:02:53.460> up<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.820> air<00:02:53.850> and

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
I believe and just go up in the air and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.500 
I believe and just go up in the air and
watched<00:02:54.480> your<00:02:54.780> map<00:02:54.930> match<00:02:55.350> over<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:57.480> can

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
watched your map match over and you can

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.930 
watched your map match over and you can
figure<00:02:57.750> out<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.870> spawns<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.380> way<00:02:58.880> but<00:02:59.880> uh

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
figure out the spawns that way but uh

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.420 
figure out the spawns that way but uh
yes<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.640> got<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.730> three<00:03:02.970> spawns<00:03:03.300> and

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
yes so you got the three spawns and

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.699 
yes so you got the three spawns and
those<00:03:05.430> two<00:03:05.640> other<00:03:05.820> spawns<00:03:06.150> at<00:03:06.360> Canyon<00:03:06.720> like

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
those two other spawns at Canyon like

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.699 
those two other spawns at Canyon like
the<00:03:07.980> enemies<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.459> come<00:03:08.610> from<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.560> that's<00:03:10.560> just

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
the enemies can come from so that's just

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.670 
the enemies can come from so that's just
a<00:03:11.010> little<00:03:11.190> little<00:03:11.940> tutorial<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:13.440> get<00:03:13.650> a

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
a little little tutorial you get a

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.070 
a little little tutorial you get a
response<00:03:14.370> because<00:03:14.970> that's<00:03:15.150> one<00:03:15.510> that's<00:03:15.840> like

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
response because that's one that's like

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.540 
response because that's one that's like
the<00:03:16.230> second<00:03:16.650> most<00:03:16.800> important<00:03:17.220> thing<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> little

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
the second most important thing a little

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.040 
the second most important thing a little
sniping<00:03:17.970> is<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.330> gotta<00:03:18.480> know<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.780> spawns

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
sniping is you gotta know the spawns

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.930 
sniping is you gotta know the spawns
because<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.190> pick<00:03:20.340> them<00:03:20.489> off<00:03:20.610> as<00:03:20.640> they

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
because you can pick them off as they

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.060 
because you can pick them off as they
spawn<00:03:21.180> sometimes<00:03:21.690> it's<00:03:22.470> happened<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.800> me<00:03:22.920> a

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
spawn sometimes it's happened to me a

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.340 
spawn sometimes it's happened to me a
couple<00:03:23.130> times<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:24.350> but<00:03:25.350> uh<00:03:25.880> yeah<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.350> you're

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
couple times to but uh yeah so you're

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.350 
couple times to but uh yeah so you're
going<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.530> want<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.800> cover<00:03:29.310> every<00:03:29.820> line<00:03:30.330> of

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
going to want to cover every line of

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.150 
going to want to cover every line of
sight<00:03:30.660> there<00:03:31.200> should<00:03:31.410> be<00:03:31.440> at<00:03:31.620> least<00:03:31.650> one

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
sight there should be at least one

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.120 
sight there should be at least one
person<00:03:32.720> coming<00:03:33.720> at<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.019> every<00:03:34.620> time<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:34.830> kill

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
person coming at you every time you kill

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.120 
person coming at you every time you kill
someone<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.200> be<00:03:37.200> looking<00:03:37.500> for<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.739> second

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
someone so be looking for the second

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.630 
someone so be looking for the second
person<00:03:38.250> well<00:03:38.880> killing<00:03:39.720> another<00:03:40.050> person<00:03:40.170> and

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
person well killing another person and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.860 
person well killing another person and
that's<00:03:41.640> important<00:03:42.530> but<00:03:43.640> yeah<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:44.910> at<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.239> this

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
that's important but yeah so at the this

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.310 
that's important but yeah so at the this
this<00:03:46.290> part<00:03:46.560> isn't<00:03:46.830> it<00:03:47.959> isn't<00:03:48.959> really

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
this part isn't it isn't really

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.100 
this part isn't it isn't really
irrelevant<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.970> strategy<00:03:51.540> since<00:03:51.840> I

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
irrelevant to the strategy since I

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.080 
irrelevant to the strategy since I
wanted<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:52.950> get<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.100> cool<00:03:53.340> gameplay<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.820> didn't

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
wanted to get a cool gameplay I didn't

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.490 
wanted to get a cool gameplay I didn't
really<00:03:54.209> realize<00:03:54.300> I<00:03:54.840> was<00:03:54.930> going<00:03:55.050> to<00:03:55.110> do<00:03:55.320> this
