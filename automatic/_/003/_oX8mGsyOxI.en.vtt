once<00:00:19.289> your<00:00:19.500> wine<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.859> completely<00:00:20.340> fermented

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
once your wine is completely fermented

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.810 
once your wine is completely fermented
you<00:00:21.390> need<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.689> figure<00:00:21.900> out<00:00:22.519> how<00:00:23.519> you're<00:00:23.699> going

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
you need to figure out how you're going

to<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> cork<00:00:24.390> into<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> bottle<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:26.090> find

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
to get the cork into the bottle I find

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.580 
to get the cork into the bottle I find
that<00:00:27.240> these<00:00:27.390> four<00:00:27.660> quarters<00:00:28.080> are<00:00:28.260> just<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
that these four quarters are just the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.279 
that these four quarters are just the
easiest<00:00:29.130> way<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.570> negative<00:00:31.050> thing

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
easiest way to do it the negative thing

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.170 
easiest way to do it the negative thing
is<00:00:31.500> they're<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> most<00:00:31.980> expensive<00:00:32.160> workers<00:00:33.030> we

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
is they're the most expensive workers we

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.319 
is they're the most expensive workers we
carry<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.680> go<00:00:34.940> we<00:00:35.940> carry<00:00:36.149> two

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

portuguese floor corker we also have one

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.069 
portuguese floor corker we also have one
from<00:00:40.680> Italy<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.700> don't<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.719> those<00:00:42.899> in

to talk about just traditional corking

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.090 
to talk about just traditional corking
this<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.760> like<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.210> said<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:01.170> Portuguese<00:01:01.859> floor

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
this is like I said a Portuguese floor

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.680 
this is like I said a Portuguese floor
cooker<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.059> show<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.300> real<00:01:03.449> quickly

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
cooker and I just show you real quickly

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.640 
cooker and I just show you real quickly
how<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> works<00:01:05.299> first<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.510> would<00:01:06.810> take<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
how it works first you would take the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.289 
how it works first you would take the
lever<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.960> open<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.439> all<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.590> way<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.299> then

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
lever and open it all the way up then

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.000 
lever and open it all the way up then
you<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.600> take<00:01:12.750> your<00:01:12.960> cork<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.770> guy

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
you would take your cork and this guy

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.530 
you would take your cork and this guy
will<00:01:14.159> fit<00:01:14.460> any<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> different<00:01:15.299> courts

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
will fit any of the different courts

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.130 
will fit any of the different courts
that<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.780> carry

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
that we carry

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.530 
that we carry
take<00:01:16.920> your<00:01:17.070> cork<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.000> make<00:01:18.270> sure<00:01:18.299> it's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
take your cork and make sure it's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.770 
take your cork and make sure it's
sanitized<00:01:19.070> drop<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.369> there<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:21.630> with

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
sanitized drop it in there and then with

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.010 
sanitized drop it in there and then with
this<00:01:21.960> guy<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.799> would<00:01:23.390> push<00:01:24.390> down<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
this guy here you would push down and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.850 
this guy here you would push down and
then<00:01:25.530> he<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.710> simply<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:28.020> would<00:01:28.229> Center<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
then he is simply you would Center the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
then he is simply you would Center the
bottle<00:01:29.250> inside<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.030> guide<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.630> up

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
bottle inside of this guide it up

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.069 
bottle inside of this guide it up
underneath<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:32.640> what<00:01:33.540> happens<00:01:33.930> is

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
underneath here and now what happens is

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.380 
underneath here and now what happens is
a<00:01:34.110> spring-loaded<00:01:34.770> bottom<00:01:35.400> allows<00:01:35.909> different

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
a spring-loaded bottom allows different

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.510 
a spring-loaded bottom allows different
lengths<00:01:37.049> or<00:01:37.200> different<00:01:37.619> size<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> bottles

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
lengths or different size of the bottles

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.130 
lengths or different size of the bottles
so<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.790> had<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> really<00:01:39.119> tall<00:01:39.479> bottle<00:01:39.930> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
so you had a really tall bottle you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
so you had a really tall bottle you
could<00:01:40.290> fit<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.400> even<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.700> really

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
could fit it in there or even a really

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.080 
could fit it in there or even a really
short<00:01:42.180> bottle<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.960> base<00:01:43.350> would<00:01:43.619> come<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:44.090> now

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
short bottle the base would come up now

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.910 
short bottle the base would come up now
as<00:01:45.270> soon<00:01:45.509> as<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.810> start<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.229> pull<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.649> lever

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
as soon as you start to pull the lever

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.480 
as soon as you start to pull the lever
forward<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:49.259> locks<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.890> base<00:01:50.100> into

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
forward like so it locks the base into

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.080 
forward like so it locks the base into
spot<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.780> when<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.070> cork<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.520> inserted

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
spot so that when the cork is inserted

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
spot so that when the cork is inserted
the<00:01:54.210> base<00:01:54.360> won't<00:01:54.659> drop<00:01:54.930> down<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.680> locks<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the base won't drop down so it locks the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.060 
the base won't drop down so it locks the
base<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.509> would<00:01:57.780> simply<00:01:58.070> immerse

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
base and then you would simply immerse

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.730 
base and then you would simply immerse
or<00:01:59.549> insert<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.329> cork<00:02:00.630> under<00:02:01.110> pressure<00:02:01.380> like

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
or insert the cork under pressure like

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.709 
or insert the cork under pressure like
so<00:02:02.460> into<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> bottle

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
so into the bottle

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.660 
so into the bottle
once<00:02:04.110> you're<00:02:04.320> done<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.860> take<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
once you're done you take it out and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.479 
once you're done you take it out and
remove<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.540> bottle<00:02:06.869> off<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.290> off<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:08.039> corker

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
remove the bottle off the off the corker

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.420 
remove the bottle off the off the corker
so<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> little<00:02:10.440> bit<00:02:10.560> about<00:02:10.800> how<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.099> use

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
so this is a little bit about how to use

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.560 
so this is a little bit about how to use
one<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.730> these<00:02:12.110> floor

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
one of these floor

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.170 
one of these floor
