00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:10.730
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:15.200
 we're making a new fall friday today 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:23.600
 along a notepad from vettel 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:26.119
 cheap shopping zettelhalter because I 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.500
 otherwise that's always there is these things 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.270
 where you open up you have this 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.980
 thin too thin little notes with 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:36.290
 it and personally I've got so full 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.350
 the whimsy I need then always what he 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.690
 I would be reasonable with that 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.190
 writes and most of all I have 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.410
 Of course, something thicker to 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.760
 example in the blog or has a newspaper 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.700
 But most of the time I do not have it close by 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.640
 I thought I would make me 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.190
 a shopping list from price sheet blog 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.360
 for my vfx and I have to say that 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.260
 I think I needed five minutes 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.659
 I did not use much but 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.409
 only the few things and one piece 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:13.670
 design paper printed on both sides in 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.350
 eight centimeters x 17 cm 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.749
 Of course you can do that later 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.429
 make bigger or wider depending on the 

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:22.369
 for what he wants to use that 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.109
 but I thought it would be quite 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.729
 practically if I continue on sony 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.709
 So sticking to the back of 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.079
 one further and then we need 

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:34.039
 These little notes are 7 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:37.099
 x 9 cm tall I have now off 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:41.470
 so fn copy paper conjured classes 

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:44.830
 I'm just there I believe 8 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.850
 I am completely out of a paper 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.480
 I think so 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:53.140
 yes and then we need one more 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:57.370
 hole pliers incidence leg and not to 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.220
 forget a ruler and trends who 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.660
 of course, no board at home now 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.610
 who can fly around can also do this 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.050
 open paper clips next to or like 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.340
 whatever the hot cleats call me 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.260
 the and now comes that is a paper 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.120
 tailor from tchibo I have that 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.190
 I bought it when I was with it 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.550
 script groups started and he 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.220
 has so many slips up there 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.110
 knife in it among other things this 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.640
 perforation thing that means when I'm there 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.800
 Now put the sheet in and I'll go with you 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.500
 this perforation think about have 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.510
 I get that weird line before then 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.000
 later cut off the paper 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.620
 who does not have such things at home now 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.720
 Can on a pizza cutter or something 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.120
 I take that with pizza cutter 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.380
 Tried it worked well 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.360
 not as good as the stink bomb 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.220
 but works with the pizza cutter 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.170
 that too and then came already 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.900
 We start to take this 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.330
 design paper to hand and put us that 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.709
 Once so long ago and then we measure 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.769
 from one side 4 cm and 4.5 cm 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.670
 and mark the whole thing with us 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.410
 little pencil's head and if we are 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.060
 we can do the same 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.180
 on the opposite side 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.730
 and then draw from little dots 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.730
 with our case at 2 if lines 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.239
 in connection we keep the whole thing once 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.159
 along our drawn lines 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.970
 and as you have now realized 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:40.549
 we have a small fish clearance 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.909
 we create it quite completely 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.099
 many can pack an departed in 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.310
 connection , we take our own 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.140
 cut price note for hand because 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.730
 they need a little preparation now 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.340
 and not the whole thing 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.200
 slipping I fix myself with a 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.730
 paper clip you can also do any 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.450
 other braces besides main thing they are 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:08.060
 somehow fastened together and then 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.609
 I draw a helper line that is 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.159
 from the top edge about 15 centimeters 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.319
 away that's almost my help line 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.940
 for the perforation because in connection 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.130
 I put the whole thing in my super 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.780
 Tailor and perforate both 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.050
 So you have to quasi if you that 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.699
 I got the pizza roller from 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.669
 both sides once over this line 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:31.669
 ruble like that and next I mark 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:34.699
 me left and right two points 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.880
 there is a hole confessed I have the 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:40.520
 about 0 5 centimeters from the edge 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.030
 Being away was easy for me 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.770
 so most practical and if you have the 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.159
 I have put the whole thing once 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.620
 tear down on these and mark me too 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.470
 the stanza again with a pencil 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.479
 holes and if I did that 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.909
 I fix or combine 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.360
 and I fix the whole thing with mine 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.360
 board 

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:13.319
 and once you get the boards through the 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.210
 You could also have dug holes 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:18.149
 already tear out your first leaflet 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.740
 because the whole thing is done super fast 

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:21.869
 as you said you can do that in one 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.219
 stow your paulo and then I would 

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:24.779
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:27.080
 when tinkering and until the next 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.080
 times
