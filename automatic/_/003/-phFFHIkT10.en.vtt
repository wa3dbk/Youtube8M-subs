00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
does this thing this thing doesn't have

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.940 
does this thing this thing doesn't have
cruise<00:01:00.520> control<00:01:00.550> doesn't<00:01:01.150> know<00:01:01.510> those<00:01:01.950> listen

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
economical but fairly economical for

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.090 
economical but fairly economical for
