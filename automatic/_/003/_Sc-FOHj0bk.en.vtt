you<00:01:35.400> might<00:01:35.579> want<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.759> disconnect<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> battery

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
you might want to disconnect the battery

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.429 
you might want to disconnect the battery
if<00:01:36.630> you're<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.900> stick<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> screwdriver

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
if you're going to stick a screwdriver

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.679 
if you're going to stick a screwdriver
under<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.210> pulls<00:01:39.420> right<00:01:39.509> up

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
under this one it just pulls right up

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.380 
under this one it just pulls right up
but<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.979> got<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.130> lot<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> bear<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.759> lot<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.240> bear

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
but it's got a lot of bear a lot of bear

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.450 
but it's got a lot of bear a lot of bear
wires<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:43.380> one<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.649> shorting<00:01:44.009> anything<00:01:44.310> out

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
wires the one be shorting anything out

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.850 
wires the one be shorting anything out
so<00:01:44.930> probably<00:01:45.930> good<00:01:46.079> idea<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> undo<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
so probably good idea to undo the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.200 
so probably good idea to undo the
battery<00:01:47.220> when<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.270> pry<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:50.149> yeah<00:01:51.149> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
battery when you pry that up yeah you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.290 
battery when you pry that up yeah you
just

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
just

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.120 
just
I<00:01:53.390> think<00:01:54.050> I've<00:01:54.110> showed<00:01:54.320> this<00:01:54.350> before<00:01:54.860> but<00:01:55.010> you

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
I think I've showed this before but you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.400 
I think I've showed this before but you
just<00:01:55.160> pull<00:01:55.520> these<00:01:55.640> back<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.180> just<00:01:56.780> pry<00:01:57.200> this

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
just pull these back and just pry this

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.080 
just pull these back and just pry this
one<00:01:57.560> up<00:01:59.350> all<00:02:00.350> right<00:02:00.590> I<00:02:00.620> got<00:02:00.860> that<00:02:01.040> all<00:02:01.940> the

there and some of them not on this one
this<00:02:58.970> is<00:02:59.120> pretty<00:02:59.300> based<00:02:59.570> model<00:03:00.970> but<00:03:01.970> if<00:03:02.570> you

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
this is pretty based model but if you

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.449 
this is pretty based model but if you
look<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.080> there<00:03:03.290> this<00:03:03.739> one's<00:03:03.980> already<00:03:04.160> gone

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
look in there this one's already gone

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.520 
look in there this one's already gone
but<00:03:04.760> if<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:04.940> look<00:03:05.090> in<00:03:05.209> there<00:03:05.390> there's<00:03:06.320> usually

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
but if you look in there there's usually

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.340 
but if you look in there there's usually
a<00:03:06.739> bolt<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:08.330> sits<00:03:08.630> right<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:08.930> there<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.080> 10

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
a bolt that sits right in there a 10

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.570 
a bolt that sits right in there a 10
millimeter<00:03:09.590> bolt<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.239> have<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.570> undo<00:03:11.900> that

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
millimeter bolt so you have to undo that

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.960 
millimeter bolt so you have to undo that
and<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:17.239> looks<00:03:17.510> like<00:03:17.780> there<00:03:18.020> is<00:03:18.050> bolt<00:03:18.970> straight

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
and it looks like there is bolt straight

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.220 
and it looks like there is bolt straight
back<00:03:20.239> as<00:03:20.540> well<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:23.450> then<00:03:23.750> we<00:03:23.870> should<00:03:23.930> be<00:03:24.110> able

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
back as well and then we should be able

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.330 
back as well and then we should be able
to<00:03:24.320> pull<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.620> door<00:03:24.770> off<00:03:27.010> alright<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.040> think<00:03:28.130> I

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
to pull the door off alright I think I

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.949 
to pull the door off alright I think I
got<00:03:28.520> all<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.760> bolts<00:03:29.060> out<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.720> I'm<00:03:29.810> going<00:03:29.930> to

clips on the door panel I'm just going

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.960 
clips on the door panel I'm just going
to<00:03:34.940> stick<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.180> under<00:03:35.450> here<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:37.160> feel<00:03:37.670> for<00:03:37.910> the

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
to stick it under here and feel for the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.790 
to stick it under here and feel for the
clips<00:03:38.300> and<00:03:38.600> then<00:03:38.870> get<00:03:39.080> around<00:03:39.260> them<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.620> pop

clips and then get around them and pop

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.710 
clips and then get around them and pop
them<00:03:41.290> you<00:03:42.290> can<00:03:42.560> do<00:03:42.770> this<00:03:42.950> with<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.160> screwdriver

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
them you can do this with a screwdriver

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.070 
them you can do this with a screwdriver
but<00:03:45.310> this<00:03:46.310> works<00:03:46.640> so<00:03:47.090> much<00:03:47.630> better<00:03:47.870> this

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
but this works so much better this

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.320 
but this works so much better this
little<00:03:48.350> tool<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.770> would<00:03:49.430> recommend<00:03:50.150> getting

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
little tool I would recommend getting

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.320 
little tool I would recommend getting
one<00:03:50.390> if<00:03:51.050> you<00:03:51.170> use<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.320> screwdriver<00:03:51.680> you're

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
one if you use a screwdriver you're

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.880 
one if you use a screwdriver you're
likely<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.450> actually<00:03:53.600> rip<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.140> clips<00:03:54.410> out<00:03:54.739> of

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
likely to actually rip the clips out of

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.070 
likely to actually rip the clips out of
the<00:03:54.950> back<00:03:55.130> of<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.400> panel<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:56.810> don't<00:03:56.959> want

the back of the panel and you don't want
to<00:03:57.140> do<00:03:57.230> that<00:03:57.380> so<00:03:57.709> get<00:03:58.610> this<00:03:58.790> screwdriver<00:03:59.180> and

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
to do that so get this screwdriver and

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.660 
to do that so get this screwdriver and
just<00:03:59.480> work<00:03:59.720> slowly

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
just work slowly

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.850 
just work slowly
