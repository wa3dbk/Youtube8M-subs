I'm still applying to seeing heat
training<00:01:39.780> principles<00:01:40.189> so<00:01:41.189> what<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.400> mean<00:01:41.670> by

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
training principles so what I mean by

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.620 
training principles so what I mean by
that<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:44.130> using<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.670> blow<00:01:44.909> dryer<00:01:45.299> on

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630

my<00:01:45.990> hair<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.590> put<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.520> high<00:01:47.729> heat<00:01:48.090> at<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> roots

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
my hair I put the high heat at the roots

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.260 
my hair I put the high heat at the roots
which<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.159> new<00:01:50.369> hair<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.060> never

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
which is the new hair so it's never

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.719 
which is the new hair so it's never
really<00:01:51.450> been<00:01:51.570> exposed<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.290> heat<00:01:52.500> before<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.189> put

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
really been exposed to heat before I put

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.789 
really been exposed to heat before I put
the<00:01:53.820> high<00:01:54.000> heat<00:01:54.270> at<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.659> roots<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.110> then<00:01:55.500> I

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the high heat at the roots and then I

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.040 
the high heat at the roots and then I
put<00:01:56.189> very<00:01:56.579> little<00:01:56.759> heat<00:01:57.420> or<00:01:57.899> cool<00:01:58.380> air<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:59.159> the

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
put very little heat or cool air on the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.740 
put very little heat or cool air on the
my<00:02:00.230> hair<00:02:00.470> really<00:02:01.040> from<00:02:01.280> about<00:02:01.550> halfway<00:02:02.150> down

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
my hair really from about halfway down

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.800 
my hair really from about halfway down
like<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:03.560> was<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.770> section<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.190> hair<00:02:04.600> i'll<00:02:05.600> be

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
like this was a section of hair i'll be

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.890 
like this was a section of hair i'll be
using<00:02:06.020> heat<00:02:06.320> high<00:02:06.770> heat<00:02:07.040> here<00:02:07.400> normal<00:02:08.390> heat<00:02:08.660> on

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:08.900 
using heat high heat here normal heat on

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.170 
using heat high heat here normal heat on
this<00:02:09.229> top<00:02:09.500> half<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.040> then<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:10.550> bottom<00:02:10.940> half

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
this top half and then the bottom half

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.380 
this top half and then the bottom half
here<00:02:11.750> i<00:02:11.900> would<00:02:12.320> be<00:02:12.560> using<00:02:12.770> either<00:02:13.040> cool<00:02:13.460> air<00:02:13.940> or

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
here i would be using either cool air or

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.560 
here i would be using either cool air or
just<00:02:15.350> no<00:02:15.740> heat<00:02:16.010> at<00:02:16.130> all<00:02:16.280> because<00:02:16.910> as<00:02:17.210> you<00:02:17.420> guys

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
just no heat at all because as you guys

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.120 
just no heat at all because as you guys
know<00:02:17.600> if<00:02:17.990> you<00:02:18.110> are<00:02:18.290> below<00:02:18.500> drying<00:02:18.770> your<00:02:18.890> hair

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
know if you are below drying your hair

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.090 
know if you are below drying your hair
the<00:02:19.820> hardest<00:02:20.240> part<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.600> dry<00:02:20.960> is<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.470> hair

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
the hardest part to dry is the hair

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.250 
the hardest part to dry is the hair
that's<00:02:22.340> up<00:02:22.610> here<00:02:22.910> by<00:02:23.090> our<00:02:23.240> scalp<00:02:23.600> that<00:02:24.050> takes

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
that's up here by our scalp that takes

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.170 
that's up here by our scalp that takes
the<00:02:24.380> longest<00:02:24.710> to<00:02:24.920> dry<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.700> actually<00:02:25.910> it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
the longest to dry so it actually it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.960 
the longest to dry so it actually it
makes<00:02:26.360> sense<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.990> use<00:02:27.320> high<00:02:27.680> heat<00:02:27.710> closer<00:02:28.700> to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
makes sense to use high heat closer to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.180 
makes sense to use high heat closer to
your<00:02:29.120> scalp<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.690> less<00:02:30.020> on<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.410> ends<00:02:30.800> anyway

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
your scalp and less on the ends anyway

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.070 
your scalp and less on the ends anyway
but<00:02:32.030> it's<00:02:32.150> also<00:02:32.330> going<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.720> be<00:02:32.870> sick

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
but it's also going to be sick

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.960 
but it's also going to be sick
preserving<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:34.220> health<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:34.730> your<00:02:34.910> hair

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
preserving the health of your hair

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.550 
preserving the health of your hair
you're<00:02:35.690> not<00:02:35.810> going<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:35.990> be<00:02:36.050> putting<00:02:36.230> as<00:02:36.380> much

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
you're not going to be putting as much

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.620 
you're not going to be putting as much
stress<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.130> heat<00:02:37.340> on<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.820> oldest<00:02:38.300> part<00:02:38.540> of

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
your hair which is the end if you're

your hair which is the end if you're
flat<00:02:40.190> ironing<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:41.120> same<00:02:41.360> principle<00:02:41.950> you're

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
flat ironing the same principle you're

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.560 
flat ironing the same principle you're
going<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.280> use<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.550> high<00:02:43.730> heat<00:02:44.060> at<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.360> roots

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
going to use the high heat at the roots

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.840 
going to use the high heat at the roots
where<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.930> new<00:02:45.110> hair<00:02:45.380> is<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:46.340> here's<00:02:46.610> never

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
really seen it before and then as you

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.120 
really seen it before and then as you
get<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.310> end<00:02:50.020> what<00:02:51.020> I<00:02:51.050> do<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.440> only<00:02:51.800> do

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
get to the end what I do is I only do

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.000 
get to the end what I do is I only do
one<00:02:52.280> pass<00:02:52.490> no<00:02:52.850> matter<00:02:52.910> how<00:02:53.360> frizzy<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.560> end<00:02:54.770> to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
one pass no matter how frizzy the end to

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.980 
one pass no matter how frizzy the end to
might<00:02:55.160> look<00:02:55.370> at<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.670> end<00:02:55.820> of<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:56.840> only

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
might look at the end of that it's only

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.500 
might look at the end of that it's only
one<00:02:57.320> pass<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.950> ends<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.370> my<00:02:58.400> hair<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:58.970> then

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
one pass on the ends of my hair and then

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.100 
one pass on the ends of my hair and then
I'll<00:02:59.810> do<00:03:00.020> as<00:03:00.170> many<00:03:00.320> as<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.650> want<00:03:00.680> at<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.190> top<00:03:01.430> and

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
I'll do as many as I want at the top and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.500 
I'll do as many as I want at the top and
probably<00:03:03.110> two<00:03:03.410> in<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.920> middle<00:03:04.220> but<00:03:04.760> from<00:03:05.150> like

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
probably two in the middle but from like

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.070 
probably two in the middle but from like
I<00:03:05.660> said<00:03:05.870> about<00:03:06.170> here<00:03:06.560> down<00:03:07.180> it's<00:03:08.180> one<00:03:08.510> pass<00:03:08.750> and

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
I said about here down it's one pass and

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.020 
I said about here down it's one pass and
whatever<00:03:09.709> happens<00:03:09.890> from<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.340> one<00:03:10.520> pass<00:03:10.730> is

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
whatever happens from that one pass is

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.560 
whatever happens from that one pass is
what<00:03:11.270> I'm<00:03:11.360> working<00:03:11.540> with<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:13.390> keeping<00:03:14.390> that<00:03:14.420> in

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
what I'm working with so keeping that in

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.410 
what I'm working with so keeping that in
mind<00:03:14.720> you're<00:03:15.500> going<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.550> absolutely<00:03:16.790> be

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
mind you're going to absolutely be

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.840 
mind you're going to absolutely be
preserving<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:18.260> health<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.620> your<00:03:18.770> hair

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
preserving the health of your hair

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.880 
preserving the health of your hair
you're<00:03:19.850> going<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.390> have<00:03:21.020> dry<00:03:21.380> hair<00:03:21.410> when

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
you're going to have dry hair when

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.760 
you're going to have dry hair when
you're<00:03:21.920> using<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.310> blow<00:03:22.520> dryer<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.770> you're

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
you're using the blow dryer and you're

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.470 
you're using the blow dryer and you're
also<00:03:25.190> if<00:03:25.580> you're<00:03:25.730> interested<00:03:26.150> in<00:03:26.330> actually

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
also if you're interested in actually

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.570 
also if you're interested in actually
changing<00:03:27.170> your<00:03:27.290> curl<00:03:27.500> pattern<00:03:27.890> you're<00:03:28.459> going

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
changing your curl pattern you're going

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.240 
changing your curl pattern you're going
to<00:03:28.670> see<00:03:28.760> results<00:03:29.090> from<00:03:29.209> that<00:03:29.270> as<00:03:29.540> well

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.590 

so<00:03:37.250> if<00:03:37.430> you're<00:03:37.550> doing<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:37.910> once<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.240> month<00:03:38.270> which

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
so if you're doing it once a month which

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.520 
so if you're doing it once a month which
would<00:03:38.780> be<00:03:38.870> my<00:03:38.990> recommendation<00:03:41.080> use<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.290> heat

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
would be my recommendation use the heat

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.610 
would be my recommendation use the heat
in<00:03:42.710> that<00:03:42.770> way<00:03:43.280> putting<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:45.050> majority<00:03:45.500> of<00:03:45.530> the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
in that way putting the majority of the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.940 
in that way putting the majority of the
heat<00:03:45.920> comes<00:03:46.190> out<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.060> then<00:03:47.540> hardly<00:03:48.080> any<00:03:48.320> at

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
heat comes out and then hardly any at

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.970 
heat comes out and then hardly any at
the<00:03:49.280> ends<00:03:49.730> so<00:03:49.910> just<00:03:50.510> like<00:03:50.660> slowly<00:03:51.260> decreasing

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
the ends so just like slowly decreasing
