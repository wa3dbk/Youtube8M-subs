00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.230
 how to find the portal to the 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:11.950
 world in derman as you will see this channel is 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:15.490
 again I'm starting so if you 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.249

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.769
 Like or subscribe I will go up 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:23.349
 tutorial videos or some 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:26.710
 Parkour samples things like that if you 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.509
 interesting, you know, well, we're going to 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.800
 start with this tutorial so 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.800
 first open in your minecraft 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.560
 well come in I 'm going to put it when 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.560
 they take out 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.490
 wait for them to enter 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:58.160
 good enters nothing 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.620
 whatever you are told, create your world 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.870
 I do not know in the world that he has playing and what 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.690
 tell them that this way of finding the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.630
 portal I think it's the only 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.550
 good is good for all the worlds I 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.320
 I'm going to do in a creative world but 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.260
 I want you to know that in uploading it in 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.910
 hardcore also works 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.480
 we take any name 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.480
 matter that 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.610
 also if they have some amount it would be more 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.409
 fast but I think that would not be so 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.420
 good how to play it 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.420
 if they are bums good yes but no 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.630
 we hope to explain the world 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.700
 I show you my sake skin 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.369
 Hello 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.360
 good if you do not want to know too 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.590
 how to do to put corner in 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.329
 minecraft leave a comment 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.460
 and it shows us a video to show you 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.859
 how are we going to do it first thing 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.229
 they need apart to find in the 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:12.910
 world is very easy what they would need 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.640
 it would be a peak depends on what I like 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.190
 peak diamond would be good a sword 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:25.000
 to to defeat the many that go 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:28.750
 to appear and good the basics would be 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.310
 the young man of herman that we separated his hoop 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:36.010
 to the hardcore the recommendable ones would be 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.700
 64 or a little more I do not know so good 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.700
 let's put it 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.170
 the basics is 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.480
 They threw a young sister 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.420
 and there he will indicate where they are 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.720
 it's pretty easy this sometimes has 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.280
 luck and they are very close to us sometimes 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.950
 they have to go far away that's the truth 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.140
 it does not matter because anyway 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.830
 they can do it if not if they do not have 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.150
 many eyes is to throw one and see that they can 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:11.439
 then they go down collect it 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.840
 picks up in the eye they go back up and they go 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.450
 pulling like that then good is like this every 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.829
 technique now I put myself to the video and 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.829
 I show you when I 'm excited 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.780
 well now I will show you we have arrived 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.660
 let's put this on the screen of landa 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:39.390
 if there is so much complication and all that 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.760
 as you will see now the gendelman eyes are going 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.380
 down, that is, they do not move forward 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.540
 so what you have to do is see 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.970
 pay attention to which parts the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.970
 They will fall like threw some few 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.810
 if they are fixed 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.069
 well where it falls will be a burden 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.389
 or here we will start 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.400
 end with a diamond peak I eat 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.310
 I'm creative, I'm going to do it like that 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.410
 no more 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.620
 you will see that it is easy not so much as 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.620
 It seems 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.169
 you have to be careful because sometimes 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.169
 there's lava down that complicates pretty 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:27.580
 since they lose all their equipment 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.940
 It is advisable to have the mold of 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.940
 mini map 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.270
 As you will see, this is the portal 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.730
 lenderman we have here they see that sometimes 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.860
 they can fall there and it will not be advisable 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.319
 it would be something ugly 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.919
 these are the ways I told you 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:49.069
 that they would be in danger are poisonous 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.879
 and I would recommend taking care of them what 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:55.370
 it would be better to kill them directly or 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:58.759
 throw a little aside I do not know that's not 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.650
 good thing what you have to do 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:03.650
 to activate them is to put the 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.419
 eyes with right click to put eyes 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.219
 on top of the stone that click on the 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.430
 stone with that and right having the eye 

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:12.700
 in your hand and it is getting good as 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.220
 will see or network 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.390
 as you will see now the 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.100
 portal 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.710
 and I would recommend them to enter 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.940
 portal the first thing would be to have a bow 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.460
 delighted better and many arrows without 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.620
 forget obsidian at least 64 for 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.950
 build a dragon shelter sell 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.550
 bad and good let's show how is the 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.550
 world of ender man 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.070
 castilla this would be criminal the bar 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.990
 of the dragon I do not know why it appeared here 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.270
 but they appear 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.430
 sometimes in crowded places other than 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.660
 they appreciate to the side and again they appear 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.320
 like me that I am completely in the 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.830
 nothing but basically the world of ander 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.430
 man is nothing 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.120
 there they see it that is the dragon ndr man those 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.320
 are the stones that regenerate it 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.830
 and well that would be all 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.420
 the recommendable ones I already told you is to have 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:19.200
 many stones and be careful with this because 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:22.950
 when they are bursting when the 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.450
 destroy explode and it would be a pain that 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.480
 I brought them down so much I had found a place 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:29.500
 next to 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.940
 well that's all I wanted to thank you 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.680
 for paying attention this video I hope 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.310
 that you liked it if you did not 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:39.640
 they understood or if it did not work they leave me a 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.289
 comment and I do what I can to 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.939
 show them so 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:48.509
 well if they need something they do not warn and what 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:48.509
 we know that's all
