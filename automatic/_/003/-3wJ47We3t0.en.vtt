00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
its head and down behind the gill it's

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.460 
its head and down behind the gill it's
actually<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> little<00:01:06.510> bone<00:01:06.750> structure<00:01:07.350> that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
actually a little bone structure that

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.890 
actually a little bone structure that
you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.650> follow<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.910> can<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.330> draw<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> line

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you can follow you can just draw a line

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.320 
you can follow you can just draw a line
there<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:11.010> come<00:01:11.280> down<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> tail<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
there and then come down to the tail and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.780 
there and then come down to the tail and
draw<00:01:12.690> another<00:01:12.990> line<00:01:13.080> by<00:01:13.950> drawing<00:01:14.310> those<00:01:14.520> two

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
draw another line by drawing those two

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.670 
draw another line by drawing those two
lines<00:01:15.090> you've<00:01:15.480> kind<00:01:15.690> of<00:01:15.780> created<00:01:16.260> your<00:01:16.380> point

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
lines you've kind of created your point

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.640 
lines you've kind of created your point
a<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.190> B<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.730> can<00:01:18.630> now<00:01:18.780> then<00:01:18.990> take<00:01:19.230> your<00:01:19.440> knife

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
a and B you can now then take your knife

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.770 
a and B you can now then take your knife
and<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.700> round<00:01:20.940> fish<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.450> would<00:01:21.540> come

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and if it's a round fish you would come

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.110 
and if it's a round fish you would come
up<00:01:21.960> from<00:01:22.440> actually<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.100> by<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.370> middle<00:01:23.700> fin

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
up from actually up by the middle fin

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.210 
up from actually up by the middle fin
which<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.540> kind<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.200> by<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.440> spine<00:01:25.920> on

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
which is kind of up like by the spine on

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.360 
which is kind of up like by the spine on
the<00:01:26.370> back<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> shark<00:01:27.420> fin<00:01:27.480> almost<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.560> run

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
the back like a shark fin almost and run

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.610 
the back like a shark fin almost and run
along<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.660> from<00:01:30.900> your<00:01:30.960> point<00:01:31.350> A<00:01:31.560> to

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
along there and go from your point A to

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.830 
along there and go from your point A to
B<00:01:31.800> if<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:32.910> dealing<00:01:33.240> with<00:01:33.270> something<00:01:33.690> like

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
B if you're dealing with something like

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.350 
B if you're dealing with something like
a<00:01:33.870> flounder<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:35.010> flatfish<00:01:35.550> you<00:01:36.180> could

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
a flounder or some flatfish you could

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.120 
a flounder or some flatfish you could
even<00:01:36.510> start<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.170> middle<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.740> fillet

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
even start in the middle of the fillet

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.370 
even start in the middle of the fillet
and<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.760> come<00:01:39.000> down<00:01:39.030> almost<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.900> splitting

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
and just come down almost like splitting

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
middle to the spine and then opening it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.540 
middle to the spine and then opening it
up<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> book<00:01:45.620> once<00:01:46.620> you<00:01:46.800> actually<00:01:47.310> are

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
up like a book once you actually are

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
always make sure that you use nice clean

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.270 
always make sure that you use nice clean
strokes<00:01:53.550> if<00:01:53.880> you're<00:01:54.390> doing<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.840> short<00:01:55.280> sawing

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
strokes if you're doing a short sawing

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.700 
strokes if you're doing a short sawing

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
motion you can really shred up the meat

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.530 
motion you can really shred up the meat
and<00:01:58.980> kind<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.250> lose<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.430> lot<00:01:59.730> of<00:01:59.820> product<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and kind of lose a lot of product the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.660 
and kind of lose a lot of product the
fillet<00:02:01.200> knife<00:02:01.470> or<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.830> boning<00:02:02.250> knife<00:02:02.430> is

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
actually a great tool for that because

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.250 
actually a great tool for that because
what<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.520> now<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.760> you<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.260> actually

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
what you can do now is you can actually

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.009 
what you can do now is you can actually
bend<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.399> knife<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.789> little<00:02:08.940> bit<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.450> use<00:02:09.780> it

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
bend the knife a little bit and use it

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.449 
bend the knife a little bit and use it
to<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.470> glide<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.340> teeth<00:02:11.580> across<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.510> bones

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
to just glide the teeth across the bones

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.510 
to just glide the teeth across the bones
literally<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:15.209> kind<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.749> release

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
literally just kind of like release

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.910 
literally just kind of like release
the<00:02:16.730> meat<00:02:16.940> off<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.750> off<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.080> bone<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:18.770> you

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
the meat off the off the bone so you

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.370 
the meat off the off the bone so you
don't<00:02:19.160> have<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.520> saw<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:20.420> nice<00:02:20.720> clean

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
don't have to saw just nice clean

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.190 
don't have to saw just nice clean
strokes<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:23.090> fillet<00:02:23.480> should<00:02:23.750> open<00:02:24.080> up

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
strokes and that fillet should open up

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.140 
strokes and that fillet should open up
for<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.710> so<00:02:25.040> once<00:02:25.310> your<00:02:25.520> fillet<00:02:25.820> has<00:02:25.940> been

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
for you so once your fillet has been

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.450 
for you so once your fillet has been
released<00:02:26.570> off<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.140> spine<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:28.100> can<00:02:28.250> actually

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
released off the spine you can actually

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.880 
released off the spine you can actually
take<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.510> knife<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.960> just<00:02:30.290> kind<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.530> clear

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890
