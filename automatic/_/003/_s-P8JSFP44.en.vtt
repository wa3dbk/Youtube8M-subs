00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.130
 hello good at all and still stay 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.900
 let's perform the last teaser in the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.030
 which is not only important what it says 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.270
 Dr. Salim but he is also 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.119
 the noise that is there at that time 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.760
 place in an operating room you see 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.130
 that person who will do that 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.780
 kind of lobotomy or do not know what and 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.820
 then that person is increasingly 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.980
 breathing faster you hear the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.890
 Breathing breath is heard 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.260
 perfectly and apart you hear a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.930
 machine in which that person is 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.329
 plugged in and the heartbeat of the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.910
 heart the typical noise of the machines 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.670
 of hospitals when you hear the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.620
 pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi more and more 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.140
 fast not good because that's what it 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.050
 listen here in this teaser then it 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.820
 is clearly seeing what they want 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.520
 do with this person you want to operate 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.530
 they want to do something to him but that is 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.390
 related to your brain logically 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.420
 because you see here perfectly in this 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.090
 teaser and apart the doctor salim says I'm 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.270
 optimistic about the projects that we are 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.250
 doing of course that consciousness 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.090
 of the human is 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.040
 that is, it is giving importance first 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.650
 to the optimism he has for the projects 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.640
 they are preparing them and then 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.450
 says that the consciousness of the human is 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.780
 fundamental 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.270
 I believe I attributed this to what it is 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.410
 fundamental because that human being 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.140
 the more awareness you have, the less you go 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.410
 to achieve with that person less 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.880
 manipulation they will not be able to get 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.509
 manipulate it so much those sounds that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.979
 here you remember mason was hard to 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.290
 control they said steinert dragovic and 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.560
 that I worked with the three when they were 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.770
 in that place in Moscow's pressure 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.020
 they were talking about him and they were saying 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.720
 that it was very difficult and that they had not 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.960
 seen an equal person never in any 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.750
 moment 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.300
 they would be talking here I would be talking 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.380
 Dr. Salim here something like 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.900
 that's talking about consciousness 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.510
 who knows and now let's start 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.970
 analyze the images one by one 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.130
 first we see here the eye of this eye of 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.310
 this person that is going to submit 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.020
 which are going to do those tests you see 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.120
 like he has his eyes lost because 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.700
 In the next image, you can see 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.710
 clearly she's not looking 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.830
 towards a fixed point it looks like it has 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.080
 that the lost look does not 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.690
 the city pupils have them contracted 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.700
 has them well are not dilated of 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.220
 soon in this image you can already see a blur 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.010
 which means it 's that blur that 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.320
 has in memory in the thought already 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.660
 is is not aware of what was 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.850
 happening not suddenly you see as it has 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.680
 clinging to the eye which means that 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.210
 is beginning to fall asleep this 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.830
 person 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.510
 or is dreaming thinking things about that in 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.620
 the next picture looks again this 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.320
 typical blur like you can not think 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.670
 clearly can not come to think what 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.510
 what is happening to you 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.100
 happening does not remind us of things well and 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.440
 here in the next image because I already 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.770
 see in the other time the x-ray is of 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.500
 the one of the brain so they are seeing in 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.209
 the x-ray before operating it is 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.610
 well are you seeing that brain your 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.470
 X - ray of your brain in the 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.420
 next picture we see good of this 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.910
 it seems like pornographic media because 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.170
 It looks like a penis but well this already 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.700
 we each have the 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.739
 I think I do not know what 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.460
 Fuck this is but it has to be a 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.250
 part d 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.990
 is the brain something for these people 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.820
 it is important but a little 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.450
 pornographic later in the next 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.180
 image is seen again the radiography of the 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.120
 brain of the head not of the skull or 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.000
 better said of the full skull and it looks 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.370
 the part of the jaw that this is very 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.250
 important because you already see in 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.380
 kowloon in the live I did yesterday those 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.200
 jaws that were on the shelves 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.590
 what would they be doing with this what 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.020
 importance would have to them is part 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.640
 of all that mystery then here it looks 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.910
 I wanted to take this out so that 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.490
 then for you to see it it looks like there 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.070
 a part of the brain there is a certain part 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.070
 there is that black part that you see that each 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.570
 it evolves more and it is becoming more 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.940
 big here you will see it in the 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.890
 next image as evolution and of 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.770
 soon it looks bigger and in the 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.050
 next as it looks already huge I do not know 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.670
 what will you mean if it is normal if it is not 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.010
 normal on that x-ray in that 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.740
 I have no idea the truth but it has 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.990
 like it has caught my attention and for 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.400
 I leave that here for you to see 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:09.120
 then in this next image I am 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.900
 very very curious and very significant here 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.870
 I'm seeing how 100% is already seen 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.840
 brain the inside of the brain looks from 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.150
 know your brains already seems like you already 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.150
 have opened that person's skull or 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.130
 You have already been able to look inside but you already 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.370
 go with color and all of which means 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.980
 that already if they are manipulating him if 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.380
 they are operating if they are doing that to him 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.690
 that we do not know yet for sure 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.480
 and that we will take time to know but 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.880
 what is manipulation mental manipulation 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.310
 of the skull here you see those people 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.830
 how are they working on this image 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.890
 The following is for again and and 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.440
 also clearly the focus of where 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.960
 is the operating room that I 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.750
 remember a little demo of why the 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.940
 of mold had two lights off and this 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.010
 it also has two lights off the 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.969
 glasses that we can not see it whole and not 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.949
 we know if 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.409
 It has an arrow shape like the modes 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.579
 Finger not believe it's certainly not 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.399
 but it has caught my attention and has 

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:13.829
 remembered that here we go perfectly 

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:16.709
 how are they doing in a transfusion 

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:18.689
 of blood is worth good what for me 

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:21.419
 it can be a blood transfusion worth 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:24.509
 because in the next image you see 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:27.269
 perfectly as suddenly you see everything 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:29.879
 red all reddish I think it makes 

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:32.279
 allusion to that to that that would be blood that 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:35.429
 they were doing in a transfusion and 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:39.689
 also agrees that at this moment 

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:42.749
 of the video is when it starts to sound that 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:45.299
 that heartbeat of the machine more 

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:47.699
 stronger faster and that person be 

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:49.649
 breathing faster 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.809
 which means that maybe 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:53.969
 that did not need quickly a 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:56.909
 blood transfusion because it could 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:07:00.329
 die or because the thing was coming out 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:01.679
 how they wanted who knows afterwards 

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:03.959
 in the next image you see this 

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:05.939
 person who opens the eye that has the eye 

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:07.950
 open which means that in that 

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:10.320
 moment that person 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.450
 wakes up although he is not aware for sure 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.910
 of what they are doing for sure 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:18.390
 no and then in the next image 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:20.670
 you see how the eye is closing and how 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.890
 He is beginning to fall asleep or be 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.740
 that you are not realizing what you 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.630
 is happening but if you do not have it, do not 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.750
 they are asleep at all because they want 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.910
 that this half awake already at the end 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:37.080
 because that closes the eye and here it would end 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:39.500
 all my friends this is amazing every 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.570
 they are taking out more clues more things 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.730
 every time the most interesting thing gets 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.860
 Well and I think I'm yes 

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.840
 doing a good analysis and nothing then 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.550
 I hope you like it and be attentive 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.610
 because here all the tips are in 

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:55.980
 my channel and all the black ops analysis 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:59.630
 3 is getting closer and closer to the aek 

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.630
 your videos and until the next video
