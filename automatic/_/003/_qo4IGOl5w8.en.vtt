to practice minigun you will need in the
pistol<00:02:19.970> another<00:02:20.970> star<00:02:21.330> which<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.660> really

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
pistol another star which is really

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.370 
pistol another star which is really
really<00:02:22.260> hard<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.650> get<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:23.390> block<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.870> fire<00:02:25.200> and

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
really hard to get a block of a fire and

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.730 
really hard to get a block of a fire and
five<00:02:25.920> blocks<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.400> iron<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.750> am<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.290> t-shape

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
five blocks of iron and I am a t-shape

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.880 
five blocks of iron and I am a t-shape
as<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.010> can<00:02:29.160> see<00:02:29.720> ok<00:02:30.720> now<00:02:31.410> let's<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:34.200> how

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
as you can see ok now let's of you how

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.320 
as you can see ok now let's of you how
this<00:02:35.400> works<00:02:37.040> ok<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.550> mini<00:02:38.760> guns<00:02:39.000> is

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
this works ok so the mini guns is

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.110 
this works ok so the mini guns is
basically<00:02:40.020> like<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.230> pistol<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.580> with<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
basically like the pistol but with the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.110 
basically like the pistol but with the
more<00:02:42.600> damage<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.740> guess<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.640> as<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.910> can<00:02:45.090> see

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
more damage I guess and as you can see

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.550 
more damage I guess and as you can see
and<00:02:45.450> its<00:02:45.930> accuracy<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:47.010> not<00:02:47.250> really<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:48.560> it's

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
and its accuracy is not really up it's

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.350 
and its accuracy is not really up it's
not<00:02:49.650> really<00:02:49.770> accurate<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.610> shouldn't<00:02:51.030> see<00:02:51.150> all
