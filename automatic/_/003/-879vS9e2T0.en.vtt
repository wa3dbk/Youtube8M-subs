00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
Infinity we really wanted to start to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.780 
Infinity we really wanted to start to
bring<00:01:17.900> sort<00:01:18.410> of<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.590> Spartan<00:01:18.950> technology<00:01:19.520> and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
very very deeply about and so we wanted

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.970 
very very deeply about and so we wanted
to<00:01:32.660> bring<00:01:32.900> a<00:01:33.050> lot<00:01:33.200> of<00:01:33.320> those<00:01:33.440> little<00:01:33.620> details

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
to bring a lot of those little details

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.910 
to bring a lot of those little details
into<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.880> design<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:36.050> console<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:36.860> the

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
into the design of the console and the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.010 
into the design of the console and the
controller<00:01:37.400> there's<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.270> high<00:01:38.540> polished

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
controller there's a high polished

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.660 
controller there's a high polished
surface<00:01:39.560> on<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.830> front<00:01:40.040> of<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.190> console<00:01:40.610> and

surface on the front of the console and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.460 
surface on the front of the console and
that<00:01:40.970> was<00:01:41.120> a<00:01:41.150> really<00:01:41.420> natural<00:01:41.600> place<00:01:42.080> for<00:01:42.110> us

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
that was a really natural place for us

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.520 
that was a really natural place for us
to<00:01:42.680> use<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.610> hex<00:01:43.840> pattern<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.080> find<00:01:45.350> in

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
to use the hex pattern that you find in

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.860 
to use the hex pattern that you find in
both<00:01:45.680> lock<00:01:45.980> and<00:01:46.280> Master<00:01:46.880> Chief's<00:01:47.090> visors<00:01:47.600> and

both lock and Master Chief's visors and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.720 
both lock and Master Chief's visors and
also<00:01:48.350> use<00:01:48.830> some<00:01:49.040> HUD<00:01:49.190> inspired

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
also use some HUD inspired
