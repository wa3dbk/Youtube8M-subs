here one of these are yours mine isn't
on<00:01:23.259> here<00:01:23.440> so<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:23.950> picked<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.610> same<00:01:24.880> factory<00:01:25.780> one

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
on here so I picked the same factory one

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.499 
on here so I picked the same factory one
mine<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:26.710> an<00:01:26.890> intercept<00:01:27.399> a<00:01:27.550> Samsung<00:01:28.000> intercept

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
mine is an intercept a Samsung intercept

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.580 
mine is an intercept a Samsung intercept
but<00:01:28.929> I<00:01:28.960> put<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.409> Samsung<00:01:30.119> Captivate<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:32.200> and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
but I put the Samsung Captivate so and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.069 
but I put the Samsung Captivate so and
it<00:01:33.070> does<00:01:33.280> work<00:01:33.549> just<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:34.570> same<00:01:34.720> all<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:34.960> have

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
it does work just the same all you have

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.210 
it does work just the same all you have
to<00:01:35.170> do<00:01:35.290> is<00:01:35.409> change<00:01:35.710> that<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:37.680> device<00:01:38.680> profile

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
to do is change that the device profile

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.310 
to do is change that the device profile
and<00:01:39.460> that's<00:01:39.880> all<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.180> have<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.540> do<00:01:40.689> is<00:01:40.930> to<00:01:41.170> make

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
and that's all you have to do is to make

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.179 
and that's all you have to do is to make
it<00:01:41.469> close<00:01:41.740> enough<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.070> your<00:01:42.729> actual<00:01:43.689> phone

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189

infrastructure<00:03:19.299> as<00:03:19.419> well<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:20.109> only<00:03:20.229> problem

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
infrastructure as well the only problem

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.640 
infrastructure as well the only problem
is<00:03:20.859> that<00:03:20.919> since<00:03:21.579> it's<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.910> beta<00:03:22.120> version

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
is that since it's the beta version

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.770 
is that since it's the beta version
whenever<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.769> try<00:03:23.979> to<00:03:24.040> turn<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.459> on<00:03:24.519> again

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
whenever you try to turn it on again

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.939 
whenever you try to turn it on again
you're<00:03:25.780> going<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.930> get<00:03:26.109> this<00:03:26.320> to<00:03:26.620> where<00:03:26.769> it's

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
you're going to get this to where it's

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:28.740 
you're going to get this to where it's
not<00:03:27.100> loading<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:27.669> it's<00:03:28.090> not<00:03:28.269> really<00:03:28.600> doing

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
not loading and it's not really doing

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.699 
not loading and it's not really doing
anything<00:03:30.150> usually<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.570> just<00:03:31.620> sits<00:03:32.620> there

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
anything usually it just sits there

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.590 
anything usually it just sits there
it'll<00:03:33.160> sit<00:03:33.340> there<00:03:33.459> for<00:03:33.669> a<00:03:33.699> very<00:03:33.910> long<00:03:34.120> time<00:03:34.150> and

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
it'll sit there for a very long time and

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.819 
it'll sit there for a very long time and
not<00:03:34.750> turn<00:03:35.019> on<00:03:35.169> at<00:03:35.440> all<00:03:36.359> I<00:03:37.359> think<00:03:38.049> this<00:03:38.350> is<00:03:38.590> due

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
not turn on at all I think this is due

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.759 
not turn on at all I think this is due
to<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:39.340> fact<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.669> you're<00:03:40.060> switching<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.500> it

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
to the fact that you're switching and it

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.680 
to the fact that you're switching and it
has<00:03:41.949> to<00:03:42.130> be<00:03:42.160> routed<00:03:42.579> by<00:03:42.699> the<00:03:42.729> way<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:43.449> have<00:03:43.660> to

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
has to be routed by the way you have to

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.930 
has to be routed by the way you have to
have<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.989> rooted<00:03:44.380> device<00:03:44.459> you're<00:03:45.459> switching

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
have a rooted device you're switching

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.140 
have a rooted device you're switching
the<00:03:46.299> Wi-Fi<00:03:46.870> backwards<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:48.190> by<00:03:48.850> doing<00:03:49.060> that

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
the Wi-Fi backwards and by doing that

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.719 
the Wi-Fi backwards and by doing that
you<00:03:49.419> you<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.560> practically<00:03:51.160> screw<00:03:51.489> up<00:03:51.579> your

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:51.729 
you you you practically screw up your

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.039 
you you you practically screw up your
phone<00:03:51.880> but<00:03:52.060> not<00:03:52.150> really<00:03:52.359> screw<00:03:52.720> it<00:03:52.810> up<00:03:52.900> you

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
phone but not really screw it up you

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.509 
phone but not really screw it up you
don't<00:03:53.169> break<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.590> or<00:03:53.680> anything<00:03:54.009> you're<00:03:54.489> just

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
don't break it or anything you're just

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.060 
don't break it or anything you're just
sending<00:03:55.449> out<00:03:55.690> Wi-Fi<00:03:56.109> instead<00:03:56.259> of<00:03:56.620> receiving

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
sending out Wi-Fi instead of receiving

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.800 
sending out Wi-Fi instead of receiving
it<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.430> your<00:03:57.880> phone<00:03:58.090> whenever<00:03:58.329> you<00:03:58.540> turn<00:03:58.690> that

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
it and your phone whenever you turn that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.810 
it and your phone whenever you turn that
off<00:03:58.870> it<00:03:59.169> flips<00:03:59.500> back<00:03:59.590> and<00:04:00.250> I'm<00:04:00.400> thinking<00:04:00.729> can

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
off it flips back and I'm thinking can

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.770 
off it flips back and I'm thinking can
go<00:04:01.030> flipping<00:04:01.660> back<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:01.840> forth<00:04:02.199> like<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.470> and

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
go flipping back and forth like that and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.749 
go flipping back and forth like that and
actually<00:04:04.780> still<00:04:05.169> work<00:04:05.500> see<00:04:05.919> it's<00:04:06.070> still<00:04:06.579> not

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:06.759 
actually still work see it's still not

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.580 
actually still work see it's still not
sending<00:04:07.150> out<00:04:07.329> and<00:04:07.660> it's<00:04:07.930> still<00:04:08.169> not<00:04:08.290> sending

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
sending out and it's still not sending

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.939 
sending out and it's still not sending
out<00:04:08.739> over<00:04:09.009> here<00:04:10.049> okay<00:04:11.049> so<00:04:11.109> now<00:04:11.350> that<00:04:11.380> I<00:04:11.590> got<00:04:11.799> my

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
out over here okay so now that I got my

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.249 
out over here okay so now that I got my
phone<00:04:12.549> restarted<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.389> everything<00:04:13.840> I'll<00:04:14.199> turn

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:14.259

she has flash on her phone so it should
just<00:04:51.940> load<00:04:52.720> right<00:04:52.930> up

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
it's not really all that slow to what I

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.300 
it's not really all that slow to what I
noticed<00:04:57.280> is<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:58.240> whenever<00:04:58.979> you're<00:04:59.979> running

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
noticed is that whenever you're running

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.430 
noticed is that whenever you're running
off<00:05:00.430> of<00:05:00.639> someone<00:05:00.970> else's<00:05:01.030> Wi-Fi<00:05:01.629> it's<00:05:01.870> usually

off of someone else's Wi-Fi it's usually

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.279 
off of someone else's Wi-Fi it's usually
not<00:05:02.889> the<00:05:03.310> fastest<00:05:04.060> that<00:05:04.240> you'd<00:05:04.419> want<00:05:04.870> it<00:05:04.990> to<00:05:05.139> be

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
not the fastest that you'd want it to be

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.680 
not the fastest that you'd want it to be
but<00:05:06.099> it's<00:05:06.280> not<00:05:06.430> slow<00:05:06.909> at<00:05:07.060> all<00:05:07.210> I<00:05:07.449> watched

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690

underneath there too if there it is

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.820 
underneath there too if there it is
let's<00:06:22.210> pause<00:06:22.389> that<00:06:22.629> and<00:06:22.779> then<00:06:23.379> in<00:06:23.560> the<00:06:23.650> middle

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
let's pause that and then in the middle

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.320 
let's pause that and then in the middle
it<00:06:24.009> shows<00:06:24.190> you<00:06:24.340> your<00:06:24.550> total<00:06:24.879> amount<00:06:25.150> of
