work<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:34.739> me<00:00:34.770> because<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.040> down<00:00:35.190> right

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
work out for me because I down right

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.600 
work out for me because I down right
here<00:00:36.410> dead<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.790> next<00:00:39.780> I'm<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.980> try<00:00:41.160> flat

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
here dead so next I'm going to try flat

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.080 
here dead so next I'm going to try flat
80<00:00:41.879> runes<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.780> run<00:00:42.960> often<00:00:43.350> 20<00:00:44.010> 190<00:00:44.730> again

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
80 runes which I run often 20 190 again

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.450 
80 runes which I run often 20 190 again
and<00:00:45.379> this<00:00:46.379> time<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.829> should<00:00:47.070> work<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
and this time it should work out a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.389 
and this time it should work out a
little<00:00:47.730> bit<00:00:47.940> better<00:00:48.149> mainly<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:50.010> ends

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
little bit better mainly because it ends

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.180 
little bit better mainly because it ends
up<00:00:50.520> four<00:00:51.030> minutes<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.539> 17<00:00:52.020> seconds<00:00:52.469> instead

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
up four minutes and 17 seconds instead

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.630 
up four minutes and 17 seconds instead
of<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> previous<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:54.030> 35<00:00:54.949> but<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.190> feel<00:00:56.610> like

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
of the previous for 35 but I feel like

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.689 
of the previous for 35 but I feel like
it's<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.059> too<00:00:57.480> slow<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:58.070> attack<00:00:59.070> style<00:00:59.340> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it's just too slow for attack style and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.670 
it's just too slow for attack style and
it's<00:01:00.300> more<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.719> how<00:01:01.020> much<00:01:01.140> health<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.559> you

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
it's more on how much health are you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.250 
it's more on how much health are you
left<00:01:01.890> over<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.570> finish<00:01:04.080> up

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
left over with because here I finish up

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.000 
left over with because here I finish up
pretty<00:01:04.860> quickly<00:01:05.930> but<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.080> don't<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.740> much

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
pretty quickly but I don't have much

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.219 
pretty quickly but I don't have much
health<00:01:08.250> left<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.390> always<00:01:09.630> use<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:09.990> pot

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
health left and I always use one pot

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.370 
health left and I always use one pot
instead<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.159> two<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.580> three<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:11.909> five<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.450> now

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
instead of two or three or five and now

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.630 
instead of two or three or five and now
you're<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:13.890> less<00:01:14.040> pots<00:01:14.310> anyway

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
you're going to have less pots anyway

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.510 
you're going to have less pots anyway
because<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.270> gold<00:01:15.750> costs<00:01:16.080> more<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:17.340> this

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
because the gold costs more so this

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.590 
because the gold costs more so this
third<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:18.200> tack<00:01:19.200> faster<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:20.040> damage<00:01:20.369> so

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
third one tack faster more damage so

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.899 
third one tack faster more damage so
41-percent<00:01:21.600> attack<00:01:21.990> speed<00:01:22.229> flat<00:01:22.470> runes<00:01:22.909> see

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
41-percent attack speed flat runes see

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.870 
41-percent attack speed flat runes see
how<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.150> works<00:01:24.240> out<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.920> it's<00:01:25.920> real<00:01:26.340> quick<00:01:26.610> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
how it works out and it's real quick I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.719 
how it works out and it's real quick I
sped<00:01:27.600> through<00:01:27.780> all<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> these<00:01:28.340> just<00:01:29.340> more<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
sped through all of these just more of a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.100 
sped through all of these just more of a
visual<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.210> see<00:01:30.329> how<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.540> works<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
visual and see how it works and the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.520 
visual and see how it works and the
health<00:01:31.670> it's<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.030> fast

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.190 

end<00:01:38.530> up<00:01:38.770> pretty<00:01:39.040> high<00:01:39.300> so<00:01:40.300> of<00:01:40.660> those<00:01:40.870> three

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
end up pretty high so of those three

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.440 
end up pretty high so of those three
kinds<00:01:41.470> of<00:01:41.650> builds<00:01:42.100> attack<00:01:42.850> speed<00:01:43.090> is<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.360> way

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
kinds of builds attack speed is the way

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.900 
kinds of builds attack speed is the way
to<00:01:43.510> go<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:43.960> then<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:44.590> decided<00:01:45.040> well<00:01:45.370> let's<00:01:45.400> see

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
to go and then I decided well let's see

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.330 
to go and then I decided well let's see
if<00:01:46.000> I<00:01:46.120> can<00:01:46.150> figure<00:01:46.480> out<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:47.050> same<00:01:47.680> attack

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
if I can figure out the same attack

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.690 
if I can figure out the same attack
speed<00:01:48.640> build<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:49.210> different<00:01:50.110> routes<00:01:50.320> so<00:01:51.160> the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
speed build and different routes so the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.219 
speed build and different routes so the
first<00:01:51.850> raw<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.240> did<00:01:52.420> was<00:01:52.570> already<00:01:52.840> there<00:01:52.960> and

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
first raw I did was already there and

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.250 
first raw I did was already there and
this<00:01:53.470> was<00:01:53.620> the<00:01:53.740> new<00:01:53.860> one<00:01:54.070> restart<00:01:55.060> blue<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:56.080> go

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
this was the new one restart blue you go

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.410 
this was the new one restart blue you go
right<00:01:56.590> white<00:01:57.190> right<00:01:57.760> I<00:01:57.970> don't<00:01:58.150> know<00:01:58.300> how<00:01:58.360> to

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
right white right I don't know how to

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.180 
right white right I don't know how to
pronounce<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:58.780> honestly<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.830> go<00:01:59.920> straight

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
pronounce that honestly you go straight

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.719 
pronounce that honestly you go straight
to<00:02:00.340> read<00:02:00.550> golems<00:02:01.240> race<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:02.050> wolves<00:02:05.670> before<00:02:06.670> we

up on the masteries next time give them

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.979 
up on the masteries next time give them
a<00:02:32.860> little<00:02:33.010> push<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:34.239> this<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.810> path

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
a little push and this is the path

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
the end of all this even though I kind

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.660 
the end of all this even though I kind
of<00:02:52.030> run<00:02:52.150> low<00:02:52.299> on<00:02:52.330> mana<00:02:52.660> hate<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.410> feeling<00:02:53.670> but

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
of run low on mana hate that feeling but

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.000 
of run low on mana hate that feeling but
they<00:02:55.360> all<00:02:55.540> end<00:02:55.750> up<00:02:55.870> at<00:02:56.019> four<00:02:56.350> minutes<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.830> 10

they all end up at four minutes and 10

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.660 
they all end up at four minutes and 10
seconds<00:02:57.459> exactly<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.590> it's<00:02:59.830> not<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.340> do<00:03:00.489> with

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
the time but with how much help so I

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.110 
the time but with how much help so I
think<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:05.320> best<00:03:05.500> thing<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.950> do<00:03:06.130> is<00:03:06.489> which<00:03:06.970> I'm

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
myself with no help I also recommend

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.720 
myself with no help I also recommend
getting<00:03:37.239> another<00:03:37.810> pok<00:03:38.200> or<00:03:38.470> so<00:03:38.680> usually<00:03:39.579> I<00:03:39.610> try

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
getting another pok or so usually I try

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.240 
getting another pok or so usually I try
and<00:03:40.060> rush<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.480> pickaxe<00:03:40.870> just<00:03:41.380> for<00:03:41.590> most<00:03:41.769> more

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
and rush the pickaxe just for most more

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.970 
and rush the pickaxe just for most more
damage<00:03:42.640> early<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.599> by<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.319> end<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:44.680> run

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
damage early and by the end of this run

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.910 
damage early and by the end of this run
you<00:03:45.370> almost<00:03:45.640> have<00:03:46.060> enough<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.540> pickaxe

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
you almost have enough of the pickaxe

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.870 
you almost have enough of the pickaxe
even<00:03:47.920> without<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.190> game

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
even without a game

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.370 
even without a game
so<00:03:49.090> maybe<00:03:49.240> one<00:03:49.510> or<00:03:49.630> two<00:03:49.660> more<00:03:49.900> camps<00:03:50.230> and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
so maybe one or two more camps and

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.110 
so maybe one or two more camps and
you're<00:03:50.470> set<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.680> go<00:03:50.830> but<00:03:51.550> you're<00:03:51.700> gonna<00:03:52.030> need

the extra health plots this round

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.490 
the extra health plots this round
