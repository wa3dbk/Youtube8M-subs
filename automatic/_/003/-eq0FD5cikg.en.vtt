00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.010
 we arrive 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.390
 the boxing 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.640
 in another moment alice went after her 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.480
 without ever considering exactly how it 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.480
 I could ride 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.870
 I think we are here 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:42.470
 The key was to find the son 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:42.470
 Ah here we go again 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:54.000
 even you do not solve 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.650
 so what happened the time and 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.729
 triggered the bleeding effect that 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.930
 you collapsed and went into fugue state 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.569
 so of course you left me at 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.020
 buses instead of do not know to make sure 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.250
 that was good 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.440
 you were in no danger 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.120
 In addition it seemed that time was 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.949
 communicating with you and I did not want 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.370
 risk interrupting the connection 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:22.500
 less until we knew what he wanted 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.310
 A sure son, and alright, I 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.270
 I understand 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:31.069
 I know what I'm looking for is a 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.210
 but they have no idea where they are 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.500
 I think that's why it caused the 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.729
 bleeding effect 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:42.440
 She used it on her father. 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.440
 she is talking to me 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.479
 right on that bridge while you were 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.489
 visiting Constantinople we arranged a 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.439
 software update for the bus 

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:56.499
 want to do the rapid tests for 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:58.659
 ensure that there are no serious problems 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:02.219
 What you need to do it runs 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.219
 walking to the marking 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:15.379
 ok 10 but we will try to climb in these 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.379
 objects 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.590
 pissed off the substrate 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.470
 this is a restriction are goals 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.500
 optional that increase the rate of 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.240
 sync ok 10/11 follow the 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.690
 instructions on the screen 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.690
 templar 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.120
 all you need to do is jump 

00:07:55.749 --> 00:08:00.619
 levels and sync are good 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.449
 now I think we can get the world 

00:08:00.619 --> 00:08:04.689
 It's time to find out what time 

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:04.689
 would you like
