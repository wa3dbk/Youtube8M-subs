really<00:01:23.090> gorg<00:01:24.090> last<00:01:24.330> three<00:01:24.799> would<00:01:25.799> be<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.340> new

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580

version<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.119> girl<00:01:27.299> glass<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.080> problem<00:01:28.409> that

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
version of girl glass the problem that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.350 
version of girl glass the problem that
would<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.189> label<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.759> big<00:01:29.939> here<00:01:30.119> so

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
would be at this label to be big here so

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.200 
would be at this label to be big here so
probably<00:01:30.659> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.020> more<00:01:31.490> vulnerable<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
probably going to be more vulnerable and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.929 
probably going to be more vulnerable and
in<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> middle<00:01:33.900> there<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:35.310> maybe<00:01:35.579> some<00:01:35.759> guys

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
in the middle there so maybe some guys

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.010 
in the middle there so maybe some guys
going<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> hammer<00:01:36.540> dropped<00:01:36.840> out

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
going to do a hammer dropped out

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.770 
going to do a hammer dropped out
something<00:01:37.439> then<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.790> impact<00:01:39.450> of

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
something then we can see the impact of

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.260 
something then we can see the impact of
that<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.470> probably<00:01:40.829> features<00:01:41.280> also<00:01:41.610> things

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
that it probably features also things

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.080 
that it probably features also things
like<00:01:43.009> android<00:01:44.009> 4.4<00:01:44.549> kitkat<00:01:45.259> as<00:01:46.460> we<00:01:47.460> see

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
like android 4.4 kitkat as we see

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.870 
like android 4.4 kitkat as we see
sometimes<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.920> know<00:01:50.130> i<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.399> see<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.700> has<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
sometimes you know i can see it has a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.660 
sometimes you know i can see it has a
letter<00:01:51.180> back<00:01:51.540> probably<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.470> removable<00:01:53.130> battery

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
letter back probably a removable battery

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.819 
letter back probably a removable battery
still<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:54.840> something<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.259> little<00:01:55.530> unique

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
still because something is little unique

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
still because something is little unique

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
glossy plastic Ashdale like that for my

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.229 
glossy plastic Ashdale like that for my
device<00:02:14.560> because<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:14.920> feels<00:02:15.069> like<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:16.090> not

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.500 
device that much I can't like you some
reason<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.840> then<00:02:23.260> we<00:02:23.440> do<00:02:23.590> have<00:02:23.950> an<00:02:24.360> also<00:02:25.360> this

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
reason and then we do have an also this

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.910 
reason and then we do have an also this
room<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.810> course<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.319> fingerprint<00:02:26.860> scanner

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
room of course of a fingerprint scanner

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.550 
room of course of a fingerprint scanner
instead<00:02:27.519> of<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.849> I<00:02:28.030> scanner<00:02:28.840> which<00:02:29.170> seems

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
instead of it is I scanner which seems

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.589 
instead of it is I scanner which seems
like<00:02:29.769> something<00:02:30.190> might<00:02:30.400> be<00:02:30.430> ditching<00:02:30.910> right

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
like something might be ditching right

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.780 
like something might be ditching right
now<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.049> just<00:02:32.799> go<00:02:33.040> with<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.340> fingerprint

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
now and just go with the fingerprint

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.729 
now and just go with the fingerprint
scanner<00:02:34.030> same<00:02:34.299> as<00:02:34.450> with<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.629> iphone<00:02:35.410> 5s

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
scanner same as with the iphone 5s

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.680 
scanner same as with the iphone 5s
doesn't<00:02:36.340> seem<00:02:36.489> like<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.879> would<00:02:37.000> feature<00:02:37.299> that

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
doesn't seem like it would feature that

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.570 
doesn't seem like it would feature that
down<00:02:38.349> here<00:02:38.860> but<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:39.190> would<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.400> pretty

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
down here but it would be pretty

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.400 
down here but it would be pretty
advocate<00:02:40.030> if<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.360> did<00:02:40.540> but<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.019> concert

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
advocate if it did but in this concert

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.020 
advocate if it did but in this concert
doesn't<00:02:41.739> seem<00:02:41.890> like<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.370> but<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.790> kind<00:02:43.000> of

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
doesn't seem like it that but I kind of

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.670 
doesn't seem like it that but I kind of
like<00:02:43.209> this<00:02:43.360> curve<00:02:43.780> here<00:02:43.810> or<00:02:44.170> something<00:02:44.500> in

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
like this curve here or something in

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.100 
like this curve here or something in
terms<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:45.040> this<00:02:45.190> sign<00:02:45.519> it<00:02:46.000> looks<00:02:46.209> super<00:02:46.569> super

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
terms of this sign it looks super super

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.130 
terms of this sign it looks super super
epic<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:48.610> lives<00:02:48.849> like<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.090> great<00:02:49.630> great

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
epic and it lives like a great great

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.319 
epic and it lives like a great great
looking<00:02:50.500> cause<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.829> care<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.280> if<00:02:51.579> you<00:02:52.120> make

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
looking cause of care so if you make

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.850 
looking cause of care so if you make
your<00:02:52.480> own<00:02:52.510> kind<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.870> concept<00:02:53.319> or<00:02:53.560> something

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
your own kind of concept or something

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.620 
your own kind of concept or something
like<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.040> then<00:02:54.459> that<00:02:55.150> would<00:02:55.299> definitely<00:02:55.420> be

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
like that then that would definitely be

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.539 
like that then that would definitely be
pretty<00:02:55.870> epic<00:02:55.989> too<00:02:56.410> if<00:02:56.590> it's<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.099> good<00:02:57.280> concept

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
pretty epic too if it's a good concept

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.759 
pretty epic too if it's a good concept
if<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.150> cute<00:02:58.450> check<00:02:59.049> it<00:02:59.170> out<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.319> little<00:02:59.650> bit
