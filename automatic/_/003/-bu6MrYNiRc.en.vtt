you<00:00:08.599> have<00:00:08.840> a<00:00:08.900> GM<00:00:09.379> car<00:00:09.440> with<00:00:10.010> a<00:00:10.040> 3.8<00:00:10.910> engine<00:00:11.450> it

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
you have a GM car with a 3.8 engine it

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.560 
you have a GM car with a 3.8 engine it
can<00:00:12.320> even<00:00:12.469> apply<00:00:12.799> to<00:00:12.950> other<00:00:13.370> engines<00:00:13.849> it's

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
can even apply to other engines it's

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.839 
can even apply to other engines it's
making<00:00:15.019> this<00:00:15.170> noise<00:00:15.500> first<00:00:16.430> I'm<00:00:16.610> going<00:00:16.759> to

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
making this noise first I'm going to

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.580 
making this noise first I'm going to
start<00:00:17.210> it<00:00:17.419> and<00:00:17.720> then<00:00:17.900> we're<00:00:18.050> going<00:00:18.200> to<00:00:18.230> rev<00:00:18.439> it

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
start it and then we're going to rev it

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:28.070 
start it and then we're going to rev it
up<00:00:18.650> for<00:00:19.009> you<00:00:19.189> and<00:00:19.400> listen<00:00:20.000> to<00:00:20.119> the<00:00:20.240> noise

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.880 

[Music]

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:57.290 

dependence<00:00:37.430> on<00:00:37.579> bad<00:00:38.649> up<00:00:39.649> a<00:00:39.739> little<00:00:39.890> bit

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:10.760 

get<00:00:58.300> off<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.690> RPM<00:00:59.200> come<00:00:59.770> back

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.490 

when<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:11.890> send<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.340> off

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.780 

so<00:01:18.500> sounds<00:01:18.860> like<00:01:18.890> there's<00:01:19.220> metal<00:01:19.580> banging

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
so sounds like there's metal banging

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.580 
so sounds like there's metal banging
around<00:01:20.299> almost<00:01:20.810> sounds<00:01:21.229> like<00:01:21.290> there's

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
around almost sounds like there's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.490 
around almost sounds like there's
bottles<00:01:22.070> in<00:01:22.310> there<00:01:22.689> now<00:01:23.689> keep<00:01:23.900> in<00:01:24.080> mind<00:01:24.290> this

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
bottles in there now keep in mind this

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.620 
bottles in there now keep in mind this
sound<00:01:24.860> can<00:01:25.159> sound<00:01:25.610> different<00:01:26.150> depending<00:01:26.540> upon

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
sound can sound different depending upon

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.170 
sound can sound different depending upon
the<00:01:26.960> stage<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.619> this<00:01:27.799> problem<00:01:28.340> let<00:01:28.909> me<00:01:28.940> show

you what to look for now in order to
find<00:01:32.690> this<00:01:32.840> problem<00:01:33.380> we<00:01:33.530> need<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.799> get<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.100> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
find this problem we need to get to the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.460 
find this problem we need to get to the
end<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.549> harmonic<00:01:35.030> balancer<00:01:35.080> which<00:01:36.080> is<00:01:36.259> up

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
end of the harmonic balancer which is up

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.320 
end of the harmonic balancer which is up
in<00:01:36.619> here<00:01:36.950> now<00:01:37.640> if<00:01:37.729> you're<00:01:37.880> actually<00:01:38.149> going<00:01:38.270> to

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
in here now if you're actually going to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.639 
in here now if you're actually going to
make<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.659> repair<00:01:39.049> you'll<00:01:39.320> have<00:01:39.500> better

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
make the repair you'll have better

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.200 
make the repair you'll have better
access<00:01:39.950> if<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:40.430> take<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.729> wheel<00:01:40.909> in<00:01:41.119> the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
access if you take the wheel in the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.450 
access if you take the wheel in the
inner<00:01:41.390> fender<00:01:41.810> guard<00:01:42.049> out<00:01:42.259> but<00:01:42.890> this<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.250> where

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
inner fender guard out but this is where

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.260 
inner fender guard out but this is where
we<00:01:43.610> need<00:01:43.759> to<00:01:43.909> be<00:01:44.030> working<00:01:44.420> up<00:01:44.659> in<00:01:44.840> here<00:01:46.270> now

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
we need to be working up in here now

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.059 
we need to be working up in here now
what<00:01:47.479> we're<00:01:47.630> looking<00:01:47.869> at<00:01:47.990> here<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.530> the

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
what we're looking at here is the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.889 
what we're looking at here is the
harmonic<00:01:49.909> balancer<00:01:49.940> on<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.569> end<00:01:50.690> of<00:01:50.810> the

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
harmonic balancer on the end of the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.840 
harmonic balancer on the end of the
crankshaft<00:01:51.200> now<00:01:52.100> if<00:01:52.190> you'll<00:01:52.340> notice<00:01:52.399> I've

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
crankshaft now if you'll notice I've

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.550 
crankshaft now if you'll notice I've
taken<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.330> belt<00:01:53.539> off<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.020> that's<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:54.319> that<00:01:54.350> I

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
taken the belt off and that's so that I

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.950 
taken the belt off and that's so that I
can<00:01:54.740> spin<00:01:55.039> this<00:01:55.190> with<00:01:55.399> my<00:01:55.580> hand<00:01:55.880> it's<00:01:56.720> still

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
can spin this with my hand it's still

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.139 
can spin this with my hand it's still
gonna<00:01:57.050> make<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.440> noise<00:01:57.649> of<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:57.950> belt<00:01:58.159> on<00:01:58.429> but

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
gonna make the noise of the belt on but

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.669 
gonna make the noise of the belt on but
I<00:01:59.210> can't<00:01:59.509> spin<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.960> with<00:02:00.050> my<00:02:00.229> hand

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
I can't spin it with my hand

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.160 
I can't spin it with my hand
now<00:02:01.520> this<00:02:01.729> bolt<00:02:02.000> right<00:02:02.090> here<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.810> actually

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
now this bolt right here is actually

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.630 
now this bolt right here is actually
attached<00:02:03.710> right<00:02:04.039> to<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.340> end<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.550> the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
attached right to the end of the

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.880 
attached right to the end of the
crankshaft<00:02:04.819> and<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:06.140> makes<00:02:06.409> this<00:02:06.619> whole<00:02:06.679> thing

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
crankshaft and it makes this whole thing

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.920 
crankshaft and it makes this whole thing
spin<00:02:08.470> now<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:09.709> part<00:02:10.039> is<00:02:10.690> bonded<00:02:11.690> through

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
spin now this part is bonded through

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.770 
spin now this part is bonded through
this<00:02:12.110> rubber<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.010> outer<00:02:13.160> part<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.540> when

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
this rubber to the outer part so when

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.930 
this rubber to the outer part so when
this<00:02:14.959> part<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.470> middle<00:02:15.620> turns<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.549> should<00:02:16.790> the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
this part the middle turns so should the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.900 
this part the middle turns so should the
outer<00:02:17.120> part<00:02:17.600> but<00:02:18.110> look<00:02:18.260> what<00:02:18.470> happens

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.759 

so<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.120> crankshaft<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.900> really<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.260> damper

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
so this crankshaft is really a damper

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.550 
so this crankshaft is really a damper
and<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.310> has<00:02:25.489> this<00:02:25.820> rubber<00:02:26.239> part<00:02:26.660> here<00:02:26.959> notice

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
and it has this rubber part here notice

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.860 
and it has this rubber part here notice
that<00:02:27.709> it's<00:02:28.070> bonded<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:28.850> steel<00:02:29.209> it's

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
that it's bonded to this steel it's

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.900 
that it's bonded to this steel it's
supposed<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.470> be<00:02:30.620> bonded<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.190> this<00:02:31.400> but<00:02:31.760> it's

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
supposed to be bonded to this but it's

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.140 
supposed to be bonded to this but it's
not<00:02:32.150> it's<00:02:33.140> broken<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:33.950> that's<00:02:34.730> where<00:02:34.970> we're

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
not it's broken so that's where we're

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.660 
not it's broken so that's where we're
getting<00:02:35.269> our<00:02:35.959> noise<00:02:38.829> so<00:02:39.829> really<00:02:40.160> what<00:02:40.370> we<00:02:40.489> need

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
getting our noise so really what we need

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.090 
getting our noise so really what we need
is<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.880> new<00:02:41.120> harmonic<00:02:41.930> dampener<00:02:42.380> or<00:02:42.650> harmonic

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
is a new harmonic dampener or harmonic

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.670 
is a new harmonic dampener or harmonic
balancer<00:02:43.820> and<00:02:44.320> that<00:02:45.320> just<00:02:45.560> fix<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.890> problem

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
balancer and that just fix the problem

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.140 
balancer and that just fix the problem
now<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.709> are<00:02:48.980> gonna<00:02:49.160> have<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.549> use<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.700> puller

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
now you are gonna have to use a puller

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.789 
now you are gonna have to use a puller
to<00:02:50.840> pull<00:02:51.109> this<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:52.850> far<00:02:53.150> off<00:02:53.299> as<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.410> can<00:02:54.590> see

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
to pull this that far off as you can see

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.280 
to pull this that far off as you can see
here<00:02:55.070> now

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.670 

this<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.500> our<00:02:59.709> problem<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:01.959> outer<00:03:02.319> ring

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
this is our problem so this outer ring

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.199 
this is our problem so this outer ring
and<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.040> inner<00:03:03.160> part<00:03:03.459> are<00:03:03.640> supposed<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.060> be

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
and the inner part are supposed to be

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.110 
and the inner part are supposed to be
bonded<00:03:04.660> together<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.290> they're<00:03:05.500> not<00:03:06.120> now

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
bonded together and they're not now

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.720 
bonded together and they're not now
what's<00:03:07.360> making<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.870> noise<00:03:08.340> we<00:03:09.340> would<00:03:09.519> turn

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
what's making the noise we would turn

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.300 
what's making the noise we would turn
this<00:03:09.879> over<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:11.769> can<00:03:11.830> see<00:03:12.129> this

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
this over you can see this

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.400 
this over you can see this
counterbalance<00:03:13.209> wait<00:03:14.819> hold<00:03:15.819> it<00:03:15.970> right<00:03:16.410> you

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
counterbalance wait hold it right you

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.119 
counterbalance wait hold it right you
can<00:03:17.560> see<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.830> hitting<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.610> teeth<00:03:18.849> in<00:03:19.090> here<00:03:20.129> so

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
can see it hitting the teeth in here so

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.600 
can see it hitting the teeth in here so
we've<00:03:21.310> got<00:03:21.340> this<00:03:21.670> counterbalance<00:03:22.599> weight<00:03:23.610> and

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
we've got this counterbalance weight and

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.940 
we've got this counterbalance weight and
that's<00:03:24.910> what's<00:03:25.180> happening<00:03:25.660> with<00:03:25.900> this<00:03:26.620> outer

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
that's what's happening with this outer

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.520 
that's what's happening with this outer
part<00:03:27.129> we're<00:03:27.730> bonded<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.480> inner<00:03:28.630> part<00:03:28.930> then

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
part we're bonded to the inner part then

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.280 
part we're bonded to the inner part then
it<00:03:29.680> would<00:03:29.799> move<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.720> but<00:03:31.720> since<00:03:32.019> the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
it would move like this but since the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.250 
it would move like this but since the
rubber<00:03:33.130> seal<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:33.730> broken<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.450> we're<00:03:35.110> moving

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
rubber seal is broken and we're moving

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.470 
rubber seal is broken and we're moving
like<00:03:35.620> this

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
like this

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.350 
like this
our<00:03:37.480> counterbalance<00:03:38.230> weight<00:03:39.000> now<00:03:40.000> let's<00:03:40.239> look

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
our counterbalance weight now let's look

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.619 
our counterbalance weight now let's look
at<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.660> new<00:03:40.810> one<00:03:42.000> now<00:03:43.000> here's<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.420> new<00:03:43.599> one

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
at the new one now here's the new one

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.930 
at the new one now here's the new one
we've<00:03:44.349> got<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.650> same<00:03:44.860> counterbalance<00:03:45.310> weight

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
we've got the same counterbalance weight

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.150 
we've got the same counterbalance weight
but<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.900> can<00:03:47.049> see<00:03:47.290> it's<00:03:47.470> since<00:03:47.980> they're

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
but you can see it's since they're

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.819 
but you can see it's since they're
bonded<00:03:48.610> together<00:03:48.870> we<00:03:49.870> don't<00:03:50.079> get<00:03:50.230> that<00:03:50.410> clunky

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
bonded together we don't get that clunky

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.369 
bonded together we don't get that clunky
noise<00:03:51.390> because<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.420> outer<00:03:52.780> ring<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:53.319> the

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
noise because the outer ring and the

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.530 
noise because the outer ring and the
inner<00:03:53.470> ring<00:03:53.560> are<00:03:53.890> bonded<00:03:54.370> with<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:55.000> rubber

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
inner ring are bonded with this rubber

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.089 
inner ring are bonded with this rubber
damper<00:03:57.930> now<00:03:58.930> they<00:03:59.079> make<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.319> special<00:03:59.890> puller

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
damper now they make a special puller

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.309 
damper now they make a special puller
for<00:04:00.220> this<00:04:00.609> but<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.180> can<00:04:01.299> do<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.840> with<00:04:01.989> just<00:04:02.200> a

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
for this but you can do it with just a

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.650 
for this but you can do it with just a
power<00:04:02.500> steering<00:04:02.829> for<00:04:03.420> because<00:04:04.420> there'll<00:04:04.630> be

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
power steering for because there'll be

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.870 
power steering for because there'll be
three<00:04:05.139> bolt<00:04:05.410> holes<00:04:05.709> that<00:04:06.040> go<00:04:06.190> through<00:04:06.519> here

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
three bolt holes that go through here

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.330 
three bolt holes that go through here
and<00:04:07.060> if<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:07.989> see<00:04:08.200> they<00:04:08.350> line<00:04:08.620> up<00:04:08.829> in<00:04:09.010> here<00:04:09.280> and

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
and if you see they line up in here and

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.610 
and if you see they line up in here and
there's<00:04:09.489> three<00:04:09.850> threaded<00:04:10.470> portions<00:04:11.470> that

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
there's three threaded portions that

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.190 
there's three threaded portions that
receive<00:04:12.010> those<00:04:12.329> so<00:04:13.329> basically<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:13.989> need

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
receive those so basically you need

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.830 
receive those so basically you need
three<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.829> right<00:04:14.980> size<00:04:15.310> poles<00:04:15.700> that<00:04:16.630> will

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
three of the right size poles that will

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.279 
three of the right size poles that will
go<00:04:17.019> in<00:04:17.260> here<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:18.389> they<00:04:19.389> actually<00:04:19.539> thread<00:04:20.079> into

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
go in here and they actually thread into

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.190 
go in here and they actually thread into
these<00:04:20.620> holes<00:04:20.950> on<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.400> inside<00:04:21.960> so<00:04:22.960> when<00:04:23.110> you

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
these holes on the inside so when you

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.390 
these holes on the inside so when you
screw<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.620> down<00:04:23.889> it<00:04:24.340> will<00:04:24.580> pull<00:04:24.789> it<00:04:24.940> out<00:04:25.120> now

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
screw this down it will pull it out now

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.370 
screw this down it will pull it out now
we're<00:04:27.400> just<00:04:27.550> reinstalled<00:04:28.240> with<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.080> regular

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
we're just reinstalled with the regular

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.070 
we're just reinstalled with the regular
crank<00:04:29.650> bolt<00:04:29.860> as<00:04:30.099> you<00:04:30.310> push<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:30.669> back<00:04:30.700> in<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:31.780> it

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
crank bolt as you push it back in but it

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.770 
crank bolt as you push it back in but it
does<00:04:32.260> come

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
does come

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.920 
does come
new<00:04:34.020> key<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.980> hold<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.280> in<00:04:35.430> place
