as<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> play<00:01:30.180> motivator<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.930> same<00:01:31.170> thing

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
as a play motivator but the same thing

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.080 
as a play motivator but the same thing
well<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.310> completely<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.729> same<00:01:32.909> thing

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
well it's not completely the same thing

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.819 
well it's not completely the same thing
Gators<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.630> honest<00:01:33.960> because<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.710> of

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
Gators to be honest because it's kind of

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.789 
Gators to be honest because it's kind of
between<00:01:35.040> EJ<00:01:36.000> Mart's<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.509> Pima<00:01:36.840> they<00:01:37.320> get<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
between EJ Mart's and Pima they get the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.410 
between EJ Mart's and Pima they get the
demeaning<00:01:38.250> option<00:01:38.579> everything<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.150> report

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
demeaning option everything can report

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.300 
demeaning option everything can report
people<00:01:39.780> are<00:01:39.869> normally<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.799> they<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.070> have

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
people are normally but they do have

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.370 
people are normally but they do have
direct<00:01:42.270> contact<00:01:42.659> which<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.930> guess<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.259> they

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
direct contact which I guess if they

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.319 
direct contact which I guess if they
need<00:01:43.530> anything<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.009> particular<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.729> they<00:01:45.149> also

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.219 
host some events almost like is some
kind<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.280> ability<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.240> spawn<00:01:51.509> some<00:01:51.750> NPCs
