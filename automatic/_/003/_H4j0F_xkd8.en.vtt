elephants that were in a conflict area

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.810 
elephants that were in a conflict area
into<00:00:06.330> an<00:00:06.450> area<00:00:06.720> which<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.049> more<00:00:07.290> safe

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
into an area which is more safe

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.910 
into an area which is more safe
area<00:00:09.570> which<00:00:09.750> they're<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.170> at<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> moment<00:00:10.769> is

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
area which they're in at the moment is

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.400

actually being farmed and also being
burned<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.459> charcoal<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.360> can<00:00:15.539> see<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
burned for charcoal you can see the

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.440 
burned for charcoal you can see the
various<00:00:16.139> charcoal<00:00:16.650> kilns<00:00:17.330> where<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
various charcoal kilns where the

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.409 
various charcoal kilns where the
elephants<00:00:18.869> are<00:00:19.020> now<00:00:19.910> their<00:00:20.910> behavior

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:21.419 
elephants are now their behavior

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.330 
elephants are now their behavior
bunching<00:00:21.900> together<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.470> because<00:00:22.860> they're

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
bunching together is because they're

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.109 
bunching together is because they're
feeling<00:00:23.700> insecure<00:00:25.340> as<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.490> start<00:00:26.760> pushing

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
feeling insecure as we start pushing

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.929 
feeling insecure as we start pushing
them<00:00:27.349> they<00:00:28.349> get<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.740> first<00:00:28.949> some<00:00:29.189> cheap<00:00:29.699> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
them they get to first some cheap and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.479 
them they get to first some cheap and
then<00:00:30.630> they<00:00:30.720> don't<00:00:30.869> want<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.259> cross<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:32.279> next

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
then they don't want to cross the next

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.780 
then they don't want to cross the next
open<00:00:32.910> area<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.239> front<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.570> them<00:00:34.489> this<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.640> what

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
open area in front of them this is what

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.910 
open area in front of them this is what
I<00:00:35.820> decided<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.449> actually<00:00:36.600> push<00:00:37.019> the<00:00:37.170> Sheep

causing<00:00:40.920> us<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.340> nuisance<00:00:42.270> I'm<00:00:42.809> trying<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.469> push

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
causing us a nuisance I'm trying to push

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.540 
causing us a nuisance I'm trying to push
the<00:00:43.739> elephants<00:00:45.770> cheap<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> smartest

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the elephants cheap and not the smartest

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.090 
the elephants cheap and not the smartest
animal<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.180> they<00:00:48.300> usually<00:00:48.480> clump<00:00:49.050> up<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.500> just

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
animal so they usually clump up and just

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.369 
animal so they usually clump up and just
stop<00:00:50.430> now<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:51.870> they're<00:00:52.020> looping

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
stop now you can see they're looping

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.639 
stop now you can see they're looping
back<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.629> elephants<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.140> also<00:00:55.440> loop

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
back and the elephants have also loop

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.709 
back and the elephants have also loop
back<00:00:56.629> they<00:00:57.629> lost<00:00:57.870> some<00:00:58.079> ground<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:59.719> again

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
back they lost some ground here again

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.080 
back they lost some ground here again
the<00:01:00.899> elephants<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:02.309> been<00:01:02.370> spooked<00:01:02.879> by<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the elephants have been spooked by the

the elephants have been spooked by the
sheep

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
sheep

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.690 
sheep
it<00:01:06.360> was<00:01:06.480> sometimes<00:01:06.930> necessary<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.650> dive<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.160> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it was sometimes necessary to dive in to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.810 
it was sometimes necessary to dive in to
get<00:01:08.850> them<00:01:09.030> moving<00:01:09.270> again

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.370 

you<00:01:12.820> can<00:01:13.000> also<00:01:13.150> see<00:01:13.479> where<00:01:13.869> we<00:01:13.990> want<00:01:14.200> them<00:01:14.320> to

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
you can also see where we want them to

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.280 
you can also see where we want them to
be<00:01:14.470> pushed<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:15.580> base<00:01:15.790> of<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.119> hill<00:01:16.299> on<00:01:16.540> the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
be pushed the base of the hill on the

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.010 
be pushed the base of the hill on the
horizon<00:01:18.000> took<00:01:19.000> us<00:01:19.150> some<00:01:19.270> time<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.659> get<00:01:19.810> there

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
horizon took us some time to get there

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:30.100 
horizon took us some time to get there
that<00:01:20.590> eventually<00:01:21.100> will<00:01:21.250> be<00:01:21.310> managed

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.500 

all<00:01:30.560> along<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.130> way<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.820> elephant's<00:01:32.270> kept

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
all along the way the elephant's kept

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.780 
all along the way the elephant's kept
running<00:01:32.810> into<00:01:32.870> obstacles<00:01:33.220> like<00:01:34.220> those<00:01:34.490> cows

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
running into obstacles like those cows

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.570 
running into obstacles like those cows
for<00:01:35.090> example

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
huge farming area the community was also
