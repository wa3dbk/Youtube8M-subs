this thing out so if you come over here
down<00:01:03.899> here<00:01:04.850> that<00:01:05.850> bolt<00:01:06.210> that's<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
down here that bolt that's one of the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.550 
down here that bolt that's one of the
bolts<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.189> need<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.580> get<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:10.290> that

bolts that you need to get to so that

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.880 
bolts that you need to get to so that
way<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:11.250> pull<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.580> off<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.869> second<00:01:13.590> bolt

way you can pull it off the second bolt

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.660 
way you can pull it off the second bolt
is<00:01:15.020> probably<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.530> dumbest<00:01:17.070> location

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
is probably in the dumbest location

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.380 
is probably in the dumbest location
known<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.060> man<00:01:18.409> but<00:01:19.460> if<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.580> come<00:01:20.820> down<00:01:21.060> over

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
known to man but if you come down over

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.200 
known to man but if you come down over
here<00:01:21.799> my<00:01:22.799> hand<00:01:23.100> down<00:01:23.400> that's<00:01:23.939> right

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
here my hand down that's right

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.730 
here my hand down that's right
underneath<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.740> if

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
underneath that's right here so if

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.010 
underneath that's right here so if
you're<00:01:28.950> gonna<00:01:29.100> replace<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.210> by<00:01:30.540> yourself

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.450 

the<00:01:53.250> tools<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.330> have<00:01:54.630> here<00:01:55.310> I'm<00:01:56.310> just

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the tools that I have here I'm just

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.280 
the tools that I have here I'm just
using<00:01:56.700> standard<00:01:57.689> socket<00:01:59.780> the<00:02:00.780> bolts<00:02:01.140> are<00:02:02.240> 14

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
using standard socket the bolts are 14

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.039 
using standard socket the bolts are 14
millimeter<00:02:04.290> all<00:02:05.280> right<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.549> kind<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:06.049> kind

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
millimeter all right it's kind of kind

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.830 
millimeter all right it's kind of kind
of<00:02:07.170> luring<00:02:07.619> me<00:02:07.830> get<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> better<00:02:08.520> shot<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:11.840> okay

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
of luring me get a better shot here okay

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.979 
of luring me get a better shot here okay
so<00:02:12.989> those<00:02:13.650> are<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.310> bolts<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.239> connect<00:02:15.660> to

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
so those are the bolts that connect to

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.500 
so those are the bolts that connect to
the<00:02:16.260> motor<00:02:16.440> itself<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.940> ones<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.239> come<00:02:18.420> on

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
the motor itself the ones that come on

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.270 
the motor itself the ones that come on
by<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.690> act<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.020> God<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:21.150> other<00:02:21.510> ones<00:02:21.900> here<00:02:22.830> to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
by the act of God the other ones here to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.229 
by the act of God the other ones here to
unscrew<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.090> connectors<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.080> stuff<00:02:26.239> from

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
unscrew the connectors and stuff from

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.410 
unscrew the connectors and stuff from
the<00:02:27.420> starter<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:29.190> size<00:02:29.459> they're<00:02:29.760> 13

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
the starter this size they're 13

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.550 
the starter this size they're 13
millimeter<00:02:32.630> weren't<00:02:33.630> too<00:02:33.750> bad<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.080> also<00:02:34.350> have

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
millimeter weren't too bad I also have

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.050 
millimeter weren't too bad I also have
to<00:02:34.650> get<00:02:34.769> an<00:02:34.920> adapter<00:02:35.069> for<00:02:35.430> my<00:02:35.519> wrench<00:02:35.730> as<00:02:35.910> well

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
to get an adapter for my wrench as well

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.809 
to get an adapter for my wrench as well
so<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.510> way<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:37.290> would<00:02:37.590> fit<00:02:38.190> properly<00:02:41.330> see<00:02:42.330> I

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
so that way it would fit properly see I

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.600 
so that way it would fit properly see I
also<00:02:44.819> have<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.360> six<00:02:46.290> inch<00:02:46.410> instant<00:02:46.799> extension<00:02:47.400> I

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
also have a six inch instant extension I

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.930 
also have a six inch instant extension I
would<00:02:48.330> probably<00:02:48.930> recommend<00:02:49.860> getting<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.700> 10

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
would probably recommend getting a 10

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.300 
would probably recommend getting a 10
inch<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.560> actually<00:02:52.560> have<00:02:52.799> somebody<00:02:53.069> coming

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
ride to the store right now yeah so far

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.350 
ride to the store right now yeah so far

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
like that the replacement starter that I

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.920 
like that the replacement starter that I
have<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:28.760> think<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.180> wrong<00:03:30.299> one<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.570> got<00:03:30.840> it

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
have I think is the wrong one I got it

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.860 
have I think is the wrong one I got it
from<00:03:31.079> Pep<00:03:31.320> Boys<00:03:31.350> but<00:03:32.220> as<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.790> can<00:03:32.970> see<00:03:33.299> on<00:03:33.660> this

one<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.709> connections

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
one the connections

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.800 
one the connections
there's<00:03:36.600> only<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.870> positive<00:03:37.440> on<00:03:38.340> this

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
cables that go in I don't know what the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.080 
cables that go in I don't know what the
third<00:03:48.300> one<00:03:48.330> is<00:03:49.970> so<00:03:52.310> that<00:03:53.310> is<00:03:53.520> what<00:03:53.670> I'm<00:03:53.820> going

to<00:03:54.150> be<00:03:54.270> trying<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.630> figure<00:03:55.530> out<00:03:55.920> here<00:03:56.340> cuz<00:03:56.580> this

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760

compression<00:04:21.780> which<00:04:22.019> is<00:04:22.230> fun<00:04:22.650> so<00:04:22.919> I<00:04:22.980> get<00:04:23.160> a

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
compression which is fun so I get a

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.850 
compression which is fun so I get a
really<00:04:23.720> up-and-down<00:04:24.720> idle<00:04:25.169> constantly<00:04:25.680> about

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
really up-and-down idle constantly about

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.240 
really up-and-down idle constantly about
two<00:04:26.330> three<00:04:27.330> grand<00:04:27.630> down<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.110> one<00:04:28.350> over<00:04:29.100> and

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
two three grand down to one over and

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.800 
two three grand down to one over and
over<00:04:29.400> again<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.790> never<00:04:29.940> goes<00:04:30.180> away<00:04:30.210> no<00:04:30.720> matter

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
over again and never goes away no matter

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.890 
over again and never goes away no matter
how<00:04:30.930> long<00:04:31.169> I<00:04:31.350> have<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.530> car<00:04:31.710> running<00:04:32.070> for<00:04:32.900> went

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
I get a whole lot of nothing it doesn't

I get a whole lot of nothing it doesn't
try<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.210> crank<00:04:42.510> over<00:04:42.750> it<00:04:43.590> doesn't<00:04:43.830> do<00:04:43.890> anything

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
try to crank over it doesn't do anything

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.409 
try to crank over it doesn't do anything
it<00:04:44.220> feels<00:04:44.460> kind<00:04:44.790> of<00:04:44.820> like<00:04:44.880> when<00:04:45.120> you<00:04:45.240> go<00:04:45.360> to

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
it feels kind of like when you go to

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.380 
it feels kind of like when you go to
start<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:45.930> it<00:04:46.110> feels<00:04:46.410> like<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.770> thud<00:04:47.340> almost

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.060 

so<00:04:51.390> yeah<00:04:51.630> you<00:04:51.690> everything<00:04:52.590> else<00:04:52.710> on<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:52.950> dash

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
so yeah you everything else on the dash

so yeah you everything else on the dash
lights<00:04:53.340> up<00:04:53.580> everything<00:04:54.060> else<00:04:54.210> is<00:04:54.360> good

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
lights up everything else is good

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.250 
lights up everything else is good
it's<00:04:55.020> just<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:57.030> doesn't<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.750> starter<00:04:58.050> went

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
it's just that doesn't the starter went

you so again a 13 millimeter socket a 14

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.909 
you so again a 13 millimeter socket a 14
millimeter<00:05:56.139> socket<00:05:56.620> a<00:05:56.889> 6<00:05:57.880> inch<00:05:58.120> or<00:05:58.389> 10<00:05:58.660> inch

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
millimeter socket a 6 inch or 10 inch

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.400 
millimeter socket a 6 inch or 10 inch
extension<00:06:00.630> make<00:06:01.630> sure<00:06:01.780> you<00:06:01.960> have<00:06:02.110> a<00:06:02.139> swivel

here so that way you can get to that

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:14.250 
here so that way you can get to that
really<00:06:06.910> mental<00:06:07.510> bolt<00:06:07.900> that's<00:06:08.169> underneath<00:06:13.260> it

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
really mental bolt that's underneath it

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.080 
really mental bolt that's underneath it
I<00:06:14.470> think<00:06:14.710> that's<00:06:14.889> all<00:06:15.039> I've<00:06:15.639> been<00:06:15.669> really

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.820 
I think that's all I've been really
needing<00:06:16.449> like<00:06:16.840> I<00:06:16.870> said<00:06:17.110> all<00:06:17.229> I<00:06:17.260> needs<00:06:17.500> a<00:06:17.620> full

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
needing like I said all I needs a full

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.189 
needing like I said all I needs a full
joint<00:06:18.100> I<00:06:18.280> should<00:06:18.460> be<00:06:18.580> able<00:06:18.669> to<00:06:18.789> get<00:06:18.970> it<00:06:19.150> get<00:06:20.080> it

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
joint I should be able to get it get it

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.659 
joint I should be able to get it get it
out<00:06:20.320> and<00:06:20.680> then<00:06:20.889> I<00:06:20.949> got<00:06:21.039> to<00:06:21.160> figure<00:06:21.400> out<00:06:21.520> the

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
out and then I got to figure out the

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.520 
out and then I got to figure out the
starter<00:06:22.090> situation<00:06:22.720> see<00:06:22.930> if<00:06:23.050> it's<00:06:23.199> the<00:06:23.350> right

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
starter situation see if it's the right

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.990 
starter situation see if it's the right
one<00:06:23.740> or<00:06:23.800> not<00:06:24.010> but<00:06:25.020> yeah<00:06:26.020> stay<00:06:26.680> tuned<00:06:27.070> and<00:06:27.400> we

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
one or not but yeah stay tuned and we

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.409 
one or not but yeah stay tuned and we
shall<00:06:28.990> have<00:06:29.289> it<00:06:29.650> all<00:06:30.400> put<00:06:30.639> back<00:06:30.699> together<00:06:31.000> here

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
shall have it all put back together here

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.810 
shall have it all put back together here
shortly
