00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:21.609
 some tips there how you can win is 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:23.980
 procrastination and also below the 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.960
 video I do a dollar activation and 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.669
 technician 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.519
 several people are already commenting on 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.910
 exploiting various means is so 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.370
 we feel the energy at last the whole process 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.440
 the floral and technical activation and 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.500
 today I'm going to make a second action type 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.870
 for you and it has to do with self-esteem 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.060
 low self-esteem and say business to 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.130
 low 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.340
 I can tell you that in 90% business and 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.400
 thought tima software low you value 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.260
 your work you not an end does not win 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.390
 lots of money when you have to play 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.370
 because you do not value the 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.980
 your product and this reflects on your 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.179
 product reflects in your work you have 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.039
 Low self-esteem and you will not 

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:08.439
 to be able to ask for an increase 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.939
 your boss that you also value the 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.030
 Work, do you stay in any job? 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.009
 that exhausting routine and the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.929
 things do not go do not go forward 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.020
 I know several holistic therapists. 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:23.200
 for example and charge 20 and 30 reais per 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.329
 a one-hour consultation and that goes a long way 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.069
 energy wears much everywhere 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:34.329
 I paint the energetic part, right? 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:39.549
 in the end it feels frustrated 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:41.409
 down already thinking about quitting right move 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.529
 with holistic therapy these things like this 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.389
 and it allows you to work any right to 

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:50.079
 Self-esteem is low, too. 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:53.249
 low income is falling all the 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:58.359
 believes that one of the first 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:02:01.719
 parts to overcome your self-esteem 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.369
 low are you have a goal a goal in 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.880
 first video you wake up in the morning 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.800
 with aiming for example 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.010
 civic is doing here I was already 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.010
 thinking of him as he would be and how I would be 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.010
 I'll deliver the best I can. 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.220
 some and this material low self esteem 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.700
 This has happened a lot with me too. 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.700
 for what helped me a lot was the floral 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.319
 I took and in whole 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.349
 The team values this very much 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.640
 feeling of frustration 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.909
 so I'm going to do a favor today 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.170
 only the team when its 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.269
 high self-esteem 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.140
 You have more courage, you have more. 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.239
 impact 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.180
 you have more stamina you have more 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.980
 objectivity and then you also get 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.900
 another message to the world and another 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.760
 message that people will make a 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.129
 floral and wants things for you 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.010
 with the combination that some crystals and 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.349
 technicians and some plants and herbs 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.569
 Also techniques never did a workshop 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.629
 about this then make that combination 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.720
 of citrus fruit for you with rosemary 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.819
 also with other florals and technicians 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.430
 what are the effects of these floral 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.159
 Doing for you, you can have dreams. 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.359
 where people are going to try to 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.970
 play down 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.590
 You'll feel bad, okay, and as you go 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.319
 of the time you take this 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.230
 floral it will intensifying goes 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.889
 increasingly strengthening this 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.319
 This your last time, then you can. 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.660
 return in the past in situations of 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.040
 memories and etc and such 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.530
 situations that happened in your childhood 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.569
 Your father and your mother sometimes went in your 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.959
 own work I can give 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:50.099
 example I have a friend who 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.590
 he works with the realtor and 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.680
 when he was a child his mother called 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.169
 his attention is very abruptly hit 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.709
 in front of other people too 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:05.669
 and that was very disruptive to the business 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.139
 it was a catch for him to grow up 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.329
 time he was very low 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.340
 we did some quantum gp jobs 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.040
 or we continue to clean up that whole situation 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.970
 and then his business started to walk 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.590
 forward 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.659
 he realized that he did not value the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.260
 His work, things were not going to 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.780
 front 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.320
 alckmin I'll do this with the florals 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.419
 crystals and technicians 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.900
 plants and herbs and 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.850
 technical 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.580
 So I'll ask you right now. 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.120

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.690
