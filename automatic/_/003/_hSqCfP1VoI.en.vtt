00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
drill bit than the square and then take

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.620 
drill bit than the square and then take
a<00:02:21.570> small<00:02:22.410> chisel<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:23.070> chisel<00:02:23.730> now<00:02:23.910> because

slightly larger than 1/4 by in 1/4 and

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.600 
slightly larger than 1/4 by in 1/4 and
then<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.090> want<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.470> whittle<00:02:58.470> them<00:02:58.590> down<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.489> be

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
then I want to whittle them down to be

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:14.250 
then I want to whittle them down to be
the<00:02:59.640> tapered<00:03:00.180> shape

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.059 

now<00:03:15.190> I'm<00:03:15.250> going<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.430> cut<00:03:15.640> these<00:03:15.790> two<00:03:16.090> lengths

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
now I'm going to cut these two lengths

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:31.710 
now I'm going to cut these two lengths
about<00:03:18.069> two<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.549> a<00:03:18.580> half<00:03:18.700> inches<00:03:19.120> long<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:31.690> now

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
about two and a half inches long so now

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.660 
about two and a half inches long so now
I'll<00:03:31.989> take<00:03:32.140> these<00:03:32.349> blanks<00:03:32.769> first<00:03:33.220> I'm<00:03:33.459> going

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
I'll take these blanks first I'm going

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.240 
I'll take these blanks first I'm going
to<00:03:33.790> shake<00:03:34.330> them<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.900> little<00:03:35.349> on<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.560> sander<00:03:36.040> and

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
to shake them a little on the sander and

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.570 
to shake them a little on the sander and
then<00:03:36.879> I'll<00:03:37.200> Whittle<00:03:38.200> them<00:03:38.379> down<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:39.160> they<00:03:39.310> fit

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
then I'll Whittle them down so they fit

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.789 
then I'll Whittle them down so they fit
I<00:03:39.610> have<00:03:39.849> to<00:03:40.000> make<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.180> peg<00:03:40.690> for<00:03:40.720> each<00:03:41.049> individual

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
I have to make a peg for each individual

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.220 
I have to make a peg for each individual
hole<00:03:42.099> they're<00:03:42.400> all<00:03:42.519> different<00:03:42.700> sizes<00:03:42.879> I<00:03:46.230> need

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
hole they're all different sizes I need

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.050 
hole they're all different sizes I need
to<00:03:47.319> take<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.530> little<00:03:47.950> more<00:03:48.160> off<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.670> top<00:03:48.879> of

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
to take a little more off the top of

00:03:49.060 --> 00:04:02.729 
to take a little more off the top of
this<00:03:49.120> one<00:04:00.930> all<00:04:01.930> right<00:04:02.049> so<00:04:02.109> now<00:04:02.349> I've<00:04:02.470> got<00:04:02.620> to

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
this one all right so now I've got to

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.190 
this one all right so now I've got to
drill<00:04:02.950> out<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:04.239> holes<00:04:04.480> where<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.959> broken

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
drill out the holes where the broken

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.890 
drill out the holes where the broken
pegs<00:04:05.650> are<00:04:05.920> trying<00:04:06.849> to<00:04:06.940> mark<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.239> center<00:04:07.629> here

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
pegs are trying to mark the center here

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.280 
pegs are trying to mark the center here
and<00:04:08.049> luckily<00:04:08.890> I<00:04:09.239> have<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.269> I<00:04:10.510> remembered<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.109> have

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
and luckily I have a I remembered I have

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.039 
and luckily I have a I remembered I have
a<00:04:11.319> tapered<00:04:11.980> bit<00:04:12.359> so<00:04:13.359> these<00:04:13.569> holes<00:04:13.810> will<00:04:14.019> be

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
a tapered bit so these holes will be

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:24.950 
a tapered bit so these holes will be
tapered<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.980> accept<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.519> tapered<00:04:16.320> pegs<00:04:23.340> and

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
tapered to accept the tapered pegs and

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.659 
tapered to accept the tapered pegs and
some<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.050> them<00:04:26.169> broke<00:04:26.410> off<00:04:26.620> you<00:04:27.070> know<00:04:27.190> above

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
some of them broke off you know above

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.619 
some of them broke off you know above
the<00:04:27.820> top<00:04:28.030> here<00:04:28.240> so<00:04:28.270> flush<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.780> lot

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.089 

all<00:04:34.629> right<00:04:34.839> now<00:04:35.020> I'm<00:04:35.139> ready<00:04:35.319> to<00:04:35.529> install<00:04:35.800> the

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
all right now I'm ready to install the

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.119 
all right now I'm ready to install the
back<00:04:36.360> each<00:04:37.360> one<00:04:37.659> of<00:04:37.749> these<00:04:37.839> pegs<00:04:38.169> I<00:04:38.499> sort<00:04:39.099> of

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:39.129 
back each one of these pegs I sort of

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:41.279 
back each one of these pegs I sort of
individually<00:04:39.849> made<00:04:40.419> for<00:04:40.629> each<00:04:40.689> holes<00:04:40.990> I've

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
individually made for each holes I've

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.739 
individually made for each holes I've
taped<00:04:41.559> them<00:04:41.800> where<00:04:41.979> they<00:04:42.159> belong<00:04:42.569> I'm<00:04:43.569> going

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:43.749 
taped them where they belong I'm going

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.269 
taped them where they belong I'm going
to<00:04:43.809> put<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:43.960> little<00:04:44.139> bit<00:04:44.259> of<00:04:44.379> glue<00:04:44.589> in<00:04:44.889> each<00:04:45.099> one

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:45.279 
to put a little bit of glue in each one

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:48.059 
to put a little bit of glue in each one
of<00:04:45.399> the<00:04:45.460> holes<00:04:45.669> I<00:04:45.909> drilled<00:04:46.379> that<00:04:47.379> will<00:04:47.889> hold

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
of the holes I drilled that will hold

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.409 
of the holes I drilled that will hold
the<00:04:48.249> peg<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.879> case

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
the peg to the case

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.719 
the peg to the case
the<00:04:49.990> back<00:04:50.229> does<00:04:50.499> itself<00:04:50.979> doesn't<00:04:51.279> need<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.610> be

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
the back does itself doesn't need to be

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:52.829 
the back does itself doesn't need to be
glued<00:04:51.849> to<00:04:52.059> the<00:04:52.149> pegs<00:04:52.419> because<00:04:52.659> they're

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:52.839 
glued to the pegs because they're

00:04:52.839 --> 00:05:27.570 
glued to the pegs because they're
wedge-shaped<00:05:25.830> then<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:26.949> next<00:05:27.219> step<00:05:27.399> will<00:05:27.520> be

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
wedge-shaped then the next step will be

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.449 
wedge-shaped then the next step will be
to<00:05:27.729> flush<00:05:28.689> these<00:05:28.959> off<00:05:29.259> and<00:05:29.559> put<00:05:30.219> a<00:05:30.249> little

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:30.459 
to flush these off and put a little

00:05:30.459 --> 00:06:07.020 
to flush these off and put a little
stain

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.940 

all<00:06:08.030> right<00:06:08.270> here<00:06:08.540> we<00:06:08.570> go<00:06:08.690> this<00:06:09.110> nice<00:06:09.350> Asian

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
all right here we go this nice Asian

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.610 
all right here we go this nice Asian
cabinet<00:06:10.730> I<00:06:10.910> think<00:06:11.690> that<00:06:11.900> customer<00:06:12.350> said<00:06:12.560> it

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
cabinet I think that customer said it

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.910 
cabinet I think that customer said it
was<00:06:12.710> Korean<00:06:13.160> I<00:06:13.370> believe<00:06:14.350> not<00:06:15.350> much<00:06:15.560> wrong<00:06:15.770> with

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
was Korean I believe not much wrong with

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.470 
was Korean I believe not much wrong with
it<00:06:16.010> except<00:06:16.340> that<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.520> back<00:06:16.730> was<00:06:17.000> coming<00:06:17.330> on

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
it except that the back was coming on

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.780 
it except that the back was coming on
and<00:06:18.280> I<00:06:20.050> discovered<00:06:21.050> that<00:06:21.950> the<00:06:22.100> back<00:06:22.280> was<00:06:22.520> held

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
and I discovered that the back was held

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.470 
and I discovered that the back was held
on<00:06:23.000> by<00:06:23.270> handmade<00:06:24.250> square<00:06:25.250> pegs<00:06:25.610> so<00:06:25.940> I<00:06:25.970> decided

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
on by handmade square pegs so I decided

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.660 
on by handmade square pegs so I decided
to<00:06:26.630> do<00:06:26.780> the<00:06:26.870> same<00:06:27.110> thing<00:06:27.320> I<00:06:27.500> made<00:06:28.010> the<00:06:28.190> page<00:06:28.370> so

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
to do the same thing I made the page so

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.850 
to do the same thing I made the page so
I<00:06:28.700> put<00:06:28.910> it<00:06:29.000> back<00:06:29.120> on<00:06:29.390> the<00:06:30.170> whole<00:06:30.350> time<00:06:30.620> I<00:06:30.650> was

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
I put it back on the whole time I was

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.850 
I put it back on the whole time I was
wondering<00:06:31.400> why<00:06:32.030> so<00:06:32.600> many<00:06:32.900> of<00:06:33.260> the<00:06:33.650> original

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
wondering why so many of the original

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.150 
wondering why so many of the original
pegs<00:06:34.450> broke<00:06:35.450> I<00:06:35.690> couldn't<00:06:36.140> understand<00:06:36.500> it<00:06:36.620> when

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
pegs broke I couldn't understand it when

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.130 
pegs broke I couldn't understand it when
I<00:06:37.190> went<00:06:37.400> to<00:06:37.490> put<00:06:37.640> it<00:06:37.670> back<00:06:37.910> on<00:06:38.180> I<00:06:38.210> realized<00:06:38.930> that

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
I went to put it back on I realized that

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.130 
I went to put it back on I realized that
the<00:06:39.260> back<00:06:39.470> and<00:06:39.770> shrunk<00:06:40.220> may<00:06:40.940> be<00:06:41.000> 3/16<00:06:41.960> of<00:06:42.050> an

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
the back and shrunk may be 3/16 of an

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.680 
the back and shrunk may be 3/16 of an
inch<00:06:42.320> I<00:06:42.670> couldn't<00:06:43.670> do<00:06:43.730> anything<00:06:43.910> about<00:06:44.060> that<00:06:44.420> I

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
inch I couldn't do anything about that I

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.410 
inch I couldn't do anything about that I
pegged<00:06:45.260> it<00:06:45.410> back<00:06:45.590> on<00:06:45.830> anyway<00:06:46.280> I'm<00:06:46.490> hoping<00:06:47.270> that

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
pegged it back on anyway I'm hoping that

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.880 
pegged it back on anyway I'm hoping that
the<00:06:47.540> shrinkage<00:06:47.900> was<00:06:48.050> just<00:06:48.200> a<00:06:48.320> one-time<00:06:48.530> event

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
the shrinkage was just a one-time event
