installed<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.830> honestly<00:00:23.039> feel<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.609> this

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
installed and I honestly feel that this

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.730 
installed and I honestly feel that this
is<00:00:23.880> better<00:00:24.240> than<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> latter<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.109> prime<00:00:25.470> but

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
is better than the latter on prime but

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.560 
is better than the latter on prime but
again<00:00:26.460> before<00:00:26.699> we<00:00:26.970> go<00:00:27.060> into<00:00:27.240> those<00:00:27.359> details

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
again before we go into those details

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.750 
again before we go into those details
it's<00:00:27.960> more<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.199> personal<00:00:28.619> choice<00:00:28.650> but<00:00:29.160> let's

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
it's more of a personal choice but let's

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.640 
it's more of a personal choice but let's
look<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> stat<00:00:30.449> comparisons<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:31.410> start

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
look at the stat comparisons to start

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.200 
look at the stat comparisons to start
things<00:00:31.890> off<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> Letran

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
things off but just like the Letran

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.090 
things off but just like the Letran

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
this is really what this weapon e

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.799 
this is really what this weapon e
because<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> good<00:01:02.430> multiplier<00:01:02.910> 2.5<00:01:03.600> and

now which is much more reliable than the

key advantage using the rate version is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.550 
key advantage using the rate version is
the<00:01:15.030> increase<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.689> fire<00:01:15.930> rate<00:01:16.110> has<00:01:16.229> gone<00:01:16.380> from

the increase to fire rate has gone from

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.469 
the increase to fire rate has gone from
a<00:01:16.650> four<00:01:16.860> point<00:01:17.100> two<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> five<00:01:17.909> point<00:01:18.210> four

a four point two up to a five point four

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.210 
a four point two up to a five point four
which<00:01:18.780> doesn't<00:01:19.229> sound<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.619> lot<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.070> when

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
which doesn't sound like a lot but when

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.649 
which doesn't sound like a lot but when
you're<00:01:20.340> using<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.640> shred<00:01:20.909> mod<00:01:21.119> for<00:01:21.270> example

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
you're using a shred mod for example

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.450 
you're using a shred mod for example
there's<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> definite<00:01:22.500> noticeable<00:01:23.009> difference

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
there's a definite noticeable difference

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.060 
there's a definite noticeable difference
and<00:01:23.670> it'll<00:01:24.150> offer<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.600> more<00:01:24.810> burst<00:01:25.140> dps<00:01:25.650> now

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and it'll offer you more burst dps now

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.780 
and it'll offer you more burst dps now
let's<00:01:26.220> talk<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:26.490> some<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
let's talk about some of the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.149 
let's talk about some of the
disadvantages<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.689> common<00:01:28.159> misconceptions

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
disadvantages and common misconceptions

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.560 
disadvantages and common misconceptions
about<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> weapon<00:01:30.119> because<00:01:30.299> I've<00:01:30.420> heard

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
about like the weapon because I've heard

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.789 
about like the weapon because I've heard
people<00:01:30.689> tell<00:01:31.020> me<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.320> they<00:01:31.470> feel<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
people tell me that they feel the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679 
people tell me that they feel the
accuracy<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.400> worse<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.060> version<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
accuracy is worse on this version or the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.300 
accuracy is worse on this version or the
recoil<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.259> worse<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:34.829> tell<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.130> that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
recoil is worse and I will tell you that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.550 
recoil is worse and I will tell you that
the<00:01:35.520> actually<00:01:36.000> recoil<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.600> exactly<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.350> same

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the actually recoil is exactly the same

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.859 
the actually recoil is exactly the same
imperative<00:01:38.369> Lee<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> prime<00:01:39.060> version<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
imperative Lee to the prime version the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
imperative Lee to the prime version the
difference<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> fire<00:01:41.100> right<00:01:41.250> because

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
difference is in the fire right because

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.069 
difference is in the fire right because
obviously<00:01:41.700> when<00:01:42.030> you're<00:01:42.119> rapid<00:01:42.570> firing<00:01:42.780> at

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
obviously when you're rapid firing at

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.230 
obviously when you're rapid firing at
its<00:01:43.259> maximum<00:01:43.530> capacity<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:44.640> recoils<00:01:45.060> gonna

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
its maximum capacity your recoils gonna

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.100 
its maximum capacity your recoils gonna
go<00:01:45.329> all<00:01:45.390> over<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> place<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.020> gonna

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
go all over the place and it's gonna

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.780 
go all over the place and it's gonna
make<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.409> harder<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.799> hit<00:01:47.009> those<00:01:47.159> longer<00:01:47.610> range

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
make it harder to hit those longer range

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.670 
make it harder to hit those longer range
shots<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.570> other<00:01:48.720> misconception<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.409> hear<00:01:49.590> is

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
shots the other misconception I hear is

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.319 
shots the other misconception I hear is
that<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.950> heavy<00:01:50.159> caliber<00:01:50.399> mod<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.850> not<00:01:51.060> viable

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
that the heavy caliber mod is not viable

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.330 
that the heavy caliber mod is not viable
on<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> Letran<00:01:52.170> weapons<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.710> general<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.250> in

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
on the Letran weapons in general and in

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.560 
on the Letran weapons in general and in
this<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.759> particular<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.450> just

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
this one in particular because it just

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.179 
this one in particular because it just
throws<00:01:54.930> off<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> accuracy<00:01:55.590> too<00:01:55.799> much<00:01:55.979> to

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
throws off the accuracy too much to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.740 
throws off the accuracy too much to
warrant<00:01:56.490> using<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.240> here's<00:01:57.420> my<00:01:57.509> argument

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
warrant using it but here's my argument

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.240 
warrant using it but here's my argument
and<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.320> mainly<00:01:58.590> based<00:01:59.009> off<00:01:59.219> my

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and this is mainly based off my

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.069 
and this is mainly based off my
playstyle<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.030> generally<00:02:00.630> I'm<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.960> between

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
playstyle but generally I'm in between

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.319 
playstyle but generally I'm in between
ten<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.649> twenty<00:02:02.040> five<00:02:02.189> meters<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.880> enemy

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
ten to twenty five meters of the enemy

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.240 
ten to twenty five meters of the enemy
and<00:02:03.540> when<00:02:04.079> you're<00:02:04.170> rapid<00:02:04.560> firing<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
and when you're rapid firing it like the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.889 
and when you're rapid firing it like the
way<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.399> do<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.719> make<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
way I do it's not going to make a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.139 
way I do it's not going to make a
significant<00:02:07.799> difference<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.459> terms<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> -

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
significant difference in terms of the -

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
significant difference in terms of the -
the<00:02:09.330> accuracy<00:02:09.989> because<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> recoil<00:02:11.160> on

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
the accuracy because of the recoil on

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.650 
the accuracy because of the recoil on
the<00:02:11.489> weapon<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:11.970> even<00:02:12.300> though<00:02:12.390> you're<00:02:12.540> trying

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
the weapon so even though you're trying

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.940 
the weapon so even though you're trying
to<00:02:12.810> headshot<00:02:13.260> without

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
to headshot without

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.290 
to headshot without
heavy<00:02:14.129> caliber<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.610> still<00:02:14.790> gonna<00:02:14.910> be<00:02:15.000> rather

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
heavy caliber is still gonna be rather

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.390 
heavy caliber is still gonna be rather
hard<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.750> do<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.440> still<00:02:16.709> generally

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
hard to do and you can still generally

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.650 
hard to do and you can still generally
hit<00:02:17.610> these<00:02:17.760> headshots<00:02:18.000> with<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.510> heavy

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
hit these headshots with the heavy

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.750 
hit these headshots with the heavy
caliber<00:02:18.900> mod<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:19.500> but<00:02:19.980> having<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.400> said<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
caliber mod on but having that said I

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.670 
caliber mod on but having that said I
feel<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.209> using<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.629> max<00:02:21.930> out<00:02:22.140> heavy<00:02:22.440> caliber

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
feel that using a max out heavy caliber

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.650 
feel that using a max out heavy caliber
is<00:02:23.010> too<00:02:23.370> much<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.760> an<00:02:23.849> accuracy<00:02:24.150> loss<00:02:24.450> but

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
is too much of an accuracy loss but

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.420 
is too much of an accuracy loss but
using<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.019> three<00:02:25.260> from<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.470> top<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:26.010> fine

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
using a three from the top is fine

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.070 
using a three from the top is fine
especially<00:02:26.849> for<00:02:27.150> my<00:02:27.269> playstyle<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.989> I

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
especially for my playstyle and I

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.570 
especially for my playstyle and I
honestly<00:02:28.530> feel<00:02:28.769> like<00:02:28.980> I've<00:02:29.099> said<00:02:29.310> many<00:02:29.430> times

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
honestly feel like I've said many times

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.610 
honestly feel like I've said many times
before<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.599> upside<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.140> get<00:02:31.440> from

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
before that the upside you get from

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.410 
before that the upside you get from
damage<00:02:32.040> for<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.280> heavy<00:02:32.430> caliber<00:02:32.670> far

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
damage for the heavy caliber far

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.120 
damage for the heavy caliber far
surpasses<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> downside<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:34.830> terms<00:02:35.010> of

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
surpasses the downside in terms of

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.160 
surpasses the downside in terms of
accuracy<00:02:35.400> especially<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.510> way<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.660> use<00:02:36.989> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
accuracy especially the way I use the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.990 
accuracy especially the way I use the
weapon<00:02:37.500> alright<00:02:37.890> guys<00:02:38.069> so<00:02:38.220> first<00:02:38.430> video<00:02:38.819> with

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
weapon alright guys so first video with

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.550 
weapon alright guys so first video with
the<00:02:39.090> new<00:02:39.239> modding<00:02:39.630> system<00:02:40.019> I'm<00:02:40.080> still<00:02:40.319> getting

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
the new modding system I'm still getting

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.900 
the new modding system I'm still getting
used<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.040> bit<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.220> think<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.459> main<00:02:41.670> thing

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
used to it a bit I think the main thing

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.339 
used to it a bit I think the main thing
for<00:02:41.940> me<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.299> going<00:02:42.569> left<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.930> right<00:02:42.989> now

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
for me is just going left to right now

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.289 
for me is just going left to right now
instead<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.680> up<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.129> down<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.879> do<00:02:45.060> feel

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
instead of up and down but I do feel

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.940 
instead of up and down but I do feel
like<00:02:45.330> it's<00:02:45.599> easier<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.049> navigate<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:46.739> sure

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
like it's easier to navigate for sure

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.020 
like it's easier to navigate for sure
especially<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.640> click<00:02:47.819> through

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
especially you can just click through

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.150 
especially you can just click through
these<00:02:48.120> uh<00:02:48.260> polarities<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.470> mods<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:49.860> want

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
these uh polarities of the mods you want

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.850 
these uh polarities of the mods you want
on<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:50.549> easier<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.090> way<00:02:51.410> but<00:02:52.410> yeah<00:02:52.500> anyways

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
on it's easier that way but yeah anyways

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.350 
on it's easier that way but yeah anyways
I'll<00:02:53.519> get<00:02:53.670> used<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.090> we'll<00:02:54.209> work

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
I'll get used to it and we'll work

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.819 
I'll get used to it and we'll work
through<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.690> just<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.049> same<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.500> first<00:02:55.709> thing

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
through it just the same the first thing

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:56.930 
through it just the same the first thing
I<00:02:55.860> want<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.040> show<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.220> though<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.610> like<00:02:56.760> now

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
I want to show you though is like now

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.850 
I want to show you though is like now
you<00:02:57.000> go<00:02:57.239> into<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.510> actions<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.200> do<00:02:58.620> swap

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
you go into the actions and do swap

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.900 
you go into the actions and do swap
layers<00:02:59.099> because<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.340> want<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.519> show<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.730> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
layers because I want to show you the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.509 
layers because I want to show you the
players<00:03:00.150> actually<00:03:00.510> put<00:03:00.720> on<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:02.160> weapon

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
players actually put on and this weapon

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.670 
players actually put on and this weapon
came<00:03:02.760> with<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> V<00:03:03.360> polarity<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:03.959> all<00:03:04.319> I<00:03:04.380> really

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
came with a V polarity so all I really

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.229 
came with a V polarity so all I really
have<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.010> do<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.220> just<00:03:05.340> add<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:05.640> three<00:03:05.880> more<00:03:06.000> V's

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
have to do is just add in three more V's

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.970 
have to do is just add in three more V's
now<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.810> for<00:03:07.019> this<00:03:07.110> three<00:03:07.410> form<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.799> build

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
now is it for this three form of build

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.500 
now is it for this three form of build
so<00:03:08.220> really<00:03:08.579> straightforward<00:03:08.849> when<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.299> comes

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
so really straightforward when it comes

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.199 
so really straightforward when it comes
to<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> polarization<00:03:10.530> now<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.940> first

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
to a polarization now the the first

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.819 
to a polarization now the the first
thing<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:13.110> got<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.290> consider<00:03:13.590> with<00:03:13.709> this

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
thing you got to consider with this

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.530 
thing you got to consider with this
build<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.280> it's<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.700> crit<00:03:14.970> build<00:03:15.209> first

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
build is that it's a crit build first

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.170 
build is that it's a crit build first
and<00:03:15.810> foremost<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:17.610> definitely<00:03:17.940> want<00:03:18.060> on<00:03:18.150> a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
and foremost so you definitely want on a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.059 
and foremost so you definitely want on a
maximum<00:03:18.630> point<00:03:18.810> strike<00:03:19.109> and<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.350> max<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:19.739> vital

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
maximum point strike and a max so vital

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.259 
maximum point strike and a max so vital
sense<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.489> point<00:03:20.700> strike<00:03:20.940> will<00:03:21.060> give<00:03:21.180> you

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
sense the point strike will give you

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.900 
sense the point strike will give you
150%<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.200> critical<00:03:22.530> chance<00:03:22.799> that<00:03:23.459> vital<00:03:23.730> sense

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
150% to critical chance that vital sense

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.610 
150% to critical chance that vital sense
will<00:03:24.030> give<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.180> 120%<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:25.139> crit<00:03:25.380> damage

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
will give you 120% to crit damage

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.559 
will give you 120% to crit damage
basically<00:03:26.549> it'll<00:03:26.670> put<00:03:26.790> your<00:03:26.910> critic<00:03:27.150> critical

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
basically it'll put your critic critical

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.000 
basically it'll put your critic critical
chance<00:03:27.720> up<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.019> sixty<00:03:28.350> two<00:03:28.530> point<00:03:28.829> five

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
chance up to sixty two point five

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.099 
chance up to sixty two point five
percent<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.730> your<00:03:30.060> multiplier<00:03:30.540> will<00:03:30.690> be<00:03:30.810> five

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
percent and your multiplier will be five

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.900 
percent and your multiplier will be five

after<00:03:45.299> that<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.660> do<00:03:45.780> have<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.079> three<00:03:46.410> from<00:03:46.560> the

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
after that I do have a three from the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.530 
after that I do have a three from the
top<00:03:46.920> heavy<00:03:47.190> caliber<00:03:47.459> for<00:03:47.819> two<00:03:48.000> reasons<00:03:48.420> the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
top heavy caliber for two reasons the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.660 
top heavy caliber for two reasons the
first<00:03:48.660> is<00:03:49.079> this<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.160> amount<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.459> Maca

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
first is this is the amount of Maca

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.129 
first is this is the amount of Maca
passing<00:03:51.060> points<00:03:51.299> I<00:03:51.329> have<00:03:51.450> left<00:03:51.630> over<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.049> it

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
passing points I have left over so it

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.690 
passing points I have left over so it
fit<00:03:52.319> perfectly<00:03:52.739> on<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:52.950> bill<00:03:53.130> but<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.370> main

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
fit perfectly on the bill but the main

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.930 
fit perfectly on the bill but the main
reason<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.389> that<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:55.109> tested<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:55.889> with<00:03:56.370> max

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
reason is that I tested this with max

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.460 
reason is that I tested this with max
out<00:03:57.120> heavy<00:03:57.329> caliber<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.840> felt<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.170> was<00:03:58.260> too

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
out heavy caliber and I felt it was too

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.280 
out heavy caliber and I felt it was too
much<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:58.859> a<00:03:58.920> deviation<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.700> accuracy<00:04:00.290> so

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
much of a deviation to the accuracy so

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.229 
much of a deviation to the accuracy so
although<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.620> can<00:04:02.099> run<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.670> it's<00:04:03.000> still

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
although you can run this it's still

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.819 
although you can run this it's still
viable<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.720> run<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:03.900> max<00:04:04.170> out<00:04:04.349> one<00:04:04.470> it'll<00:04:04.680> cost

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
viable to run a max out one it'll cost

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.460 
viable to run a max out one it'll cost
you<00:04:04.980> an<00:04:05.069> extra<00:04:05.190> forma<00:04:05.849> and<00:04:06.000> again<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.900> just<00:04:07.049> felt

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
you an extra forma and again I just felt

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.110 
you an extra forma and again I just felt
it<00:04:07.590> was<00:04:07.709> too<00:04:07.889> much<00:04:08.069> of<00:04:08.190> an<00:04:08.280> accuracy<00:04:08.579> loss<00:04:08.880> to

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
it was too much of an accuracy loss to

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.000 
it was too much of an accuracy loss to
warrant<00:04:09.480> really<00:04:09.660> using<00:04:10.079> it<00:04:10.169> unless<00:04:10.799> you're

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
warrant really using it unless you're

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.710 
warrant really using it unless you're
like<00:04:11.190> really<00:04:11.700> in<00:04:11.910> your<00:04:12.120> opponent's<00:04:12.569> face

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
like really in your opponent's face

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.530 
like really in your opponent's face
again<00:04:13.169> playstyle<00:04:13.709> choice<00:04:13.980> here<00:04:14.280> next<00:04:15.120> up<00:04:15.299> is

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
again playstyle choice here next up is

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.089 
again playstyle choice here next up is
split<00:04:15.870> chamber<00:04:16.049> this<00:04:16.440> basically<00:04:16.739> gives<00:04:16.919> you<00:04:17.039> a

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
split chamber this basically gives you a

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.039 
split chamber this basically gives you a
90%<00:04:17.760> chance<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:18.209> proc<00:04:18.389> an<00:04:18.510> additional<00:04:18.840> shot

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
90% chance to proc an additional shot

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.140 
90% chance to proc an additional shot
basically<00:04:19.829> doubles<00:04:20.220> your<00:04:20.340> damage<00:04:20.760> so<00:04:20.910> again

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
basically doubles your damage so again

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.690 
basically doubles your damage so again
absolute<00:04:21.630> staple<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.560> next<00:04:22.860> one<00:04:23.039> shred<00:04:23.400> which

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
absolute staple the next one shred which

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.250 
absolute staple the next one shred which
I<00:04:23.849> consider<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.390> staple<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.080> all

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
I consider a staple and all

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.740 
I consider a staple and all
semi-automatic<00:04:26.159> weapons<00:04:26.550> in<00:04:26.700> particular

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
semi-automatic weapons in particular

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.350 
semi-automatic weapons in particular
is<00:04:27.900> great<00:04:28.320> for<00:04:28.530> two<00:04:28.680> reasons<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.160> first<00:04:29.360> 30%

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
is great for two reasons the first 30%

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.050 
is great for two reasons the first 30%
additional<00:04:30.840> fire<00:04:31.080> rate<00:04:31.260> is<00:04:31.290> nice<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.940> know

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
additional fire rate is nice you know

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.400 
additional fire rate is nice you know
it's<00:04:33.210> just<00:04:33.270> it's<00:04:33.510> just<00:04:33.570> it<00:04:33.870> increases<00:04:34.380> your

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
it's just it's just it increases your

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.590 
it's just it's just it increases your
DPS<00:04:34.920> so<00:04:35.070> it's<00:04:35.190> nice<00:04:35.340> in<00:04:35.550> that<00:04:35.670> regard<00:04:36.090> but

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
DPS so it's nice in that regard but

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.980 
DPS so it's nice in that regard but
having<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.110> 1.2<00:04:37.800> meter<00:04:38.190> punch<00:04:38.640> Lu<00:04:38.850> is<00:04:39.060> also

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
having the 1.2 meter punch Lu is also

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.690 
having the 1.2 meter punch Lu is also
really<00:04:40.350> good<00:04:40.530> because<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:41.250> gives<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.580> the

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
really good because it gives you the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.610 
really good because it gives you the
possibility<00:04:42.270> of<00:04:42.300> killing<00:04:42.690> multiple<00:04:42.930> targets

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
possibility of killing multiple targets

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.710 
possibility of killing multiple targets
in<00:04:43.710> one<00:04:43.800> shot<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:44.850> although<00:04:45.240> we<00:04:45.390> can<00:04:45.510> get<00:04:45.630> away

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
in one shot and although we can get away

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.500 
in one shot and although we can get away
without<00:04:45.930> using<00:04:46.110> something<00:04:46.650> like<00:04:46.740> this<00:04:46.950> in

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
without using something like this in

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.430 
without using something like this in
basically<00:04:48.510> like<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.720> fully<00:04:48.960> automatic<00:04:49.290> weapon

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
basically like a fully automatic weapon

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.120 
basically like a fully automatic weapon
although<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:50.400> could<00:04:50.580> still<00:04:50.790> use<00:04:51.000> it<00:04:51.710> it's<00:04:52.710> you

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
although you could still use it it's you

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.710 
although you could still use it it's you
can<00:04:53.280> pretty<00:04:53.520> much<00:04:53.730> it<00:04:53.940> makes<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:54.390> a<00:04:54.480> lot<00:04:54.660> easier

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
can pretty much it makes it a lot easier

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.840 
can pretty much it makes it a lot easier
to<00:04:55.140> kill<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:55.770> guess<00:04:56.100> it<00:04:56.220> was<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.340> semi-automatic

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
to kill I guess it was a semi-automatic

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.610 
to kill I guess it was a semi-automatic
as<00:04:57.060> when<00:04:57.210> I'm<00:04:57.300> saying<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:57.810> overall<00:04:58.440> it<00:04:58.560> is

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
as when I'm saying so overall it is

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.350 
as when I'm saying so overall it is
really<00:04:58.980> good<00:04:59.100> mod<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.550> use<00:04:59.760> on<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.000> latter<00:05:00.180> on

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
really good mod to use on the latter on

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.940 
really good mod to use on the latter on
Prime<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:00.780> in<00:05:00.870> general<00:05:01.230> semi<00:05:01.530> automatics

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
Prime and in general semi automatics

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.500 
Prime and in general semi automatics
after<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:02.730> though<00:05:02.970> all<00:05:03.210> I'm<00:05:03.300> really<00:05:03.360> doing

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
after that though all I'm really doing

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.860 
after that though all I'm really doing
is<00:05:03.840> using<00:05:04.050> two<00:05:04.590> dual<00:05:05.040> added<00:05:05.490> elements<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.780> I'm

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
is using two dual added elements and I'm

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.930 
is using two dual added elements and I'm
just<00:05:07.050> switching<00:05:07.260> these<00:05:07.530> compared<00:05:08.100> basically

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
just switching these compared basically

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.130 
just switching these compared basically
what<00:05:09.120> it<00:05:09.210> whatever<00:05:09.419> I'm<00:05:09.600> going<00:05:09.750> up<00:05:09.900> against

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
what it whatever I'm going up against

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.450 
what it whatever I'm going up against
I'm<00:05:10.230> just<00:05:10.380> switching<00:05:10.590> in<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:11.310> right

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
I'm just switching in the the right

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.310 
I'm just switching in the the right
element<00:05:11.910> for<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.120> faction<00:05:12.600> now<00:05:13.020> I'm<00:05:13.110> using

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
element for the faction now I'm using

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.890 
element for the faction now I'm using
the<00:05:13.470> dual<00:05:13.710> static<00:05:14.280> mods<00:05:14.700> because<00:05:15.180> basically

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
the dual static mods because basically

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.300 
the dual static mods because basically
by<00:05:16.169> using<00:05:16.350> two<00:05:16.590> of<00:05:16.620> these<00:05:16.800> it'll<00:05:17.100> put<00:05:17.220> my

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
by using two of these it'll put my

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.790 
by using two of these it'll put my
status<00:05:17.640> up<00:05:17.790> to<00:05:17.910> a<00:05:18.080> 66.8%

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
status up to a 66.8%

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.220 
status up to a 66.8%
now<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.250> could<00:05:20.730> use<00:05:21.120> a<00:05:21.150> regular<00:05:21.570> element<00:05:22.110> and

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
now you could use a regular element and

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.510 
now you could use a regular element and
especially<00:05:22.830> if<00:05:22.890> you<00:05:22.950> don't<00:05:23.160> have<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.400> high

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
especially if you don't have the high

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.909 
especially if you don't have the high
voltage<00:05:23.910> in<00:05:24.090> particular<00:05:24.600> but<00:05:25.380> it<00:05:25.500> will<00:05:25.650> cost

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
voltage in particular but it will cost

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.070 
voltage in particular but it will cost
you<00:05:26.100> an<00:05:26.220> additional<00:05:26.280> form<00:05:27.090> up<00:05:27.300> basically<00:05:27.780> and

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
you an additional form up basically and

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.050 
you an additional form up basically and
it<00:05:28.740> will<00:05:28.919> increase<00:05:29.130> your<00:05:29.310> damage<00:05:29.370> a<00:05:29.700> bit<00:05:29.850> but<00:05:30.030> I

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
it will increase your damage a bit but I

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.790 
it will increase your damage a bit but I
did<00:05:30.300> feel<00:05:30.510> that<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:30.810> status<00:05:31.230> was<00:05:31.350> really<00:05:31.620> nice

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
did feel that the status was really nice

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.260 
did feel that the status was really nice
and<00:05:32.040> because<00:05:32.310> of<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.520> fire<00:05:32.790> rate<00:05:33.000> on<00:05:33.150> the

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
and because of the fire rate on the

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.180 
and because of the fire rate on the
weapon<00:05:33.600> that<00:05:34.140> also<00:05:34.410> will<00:05:34.650> increase<00:05:34.919> the

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
weapon that also will increase the

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.880 
weapon that also will increase the
probability<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.850> the<00:05:36.120> status<00:05:36.570> so<00:05:36.810> that's<00:05:37.710> why

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
probability of the status so that's why

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.080 
probability of the status so that's why
I'm<00:05:37.979> basically<00:05:38.220> running<00:05:38.520> these<00:05:38.729> but<00:05:39.000> the

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
I'm basically running these but the

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.390 
I'm basically running these but the
first<00:05:39.300> loto<00:05:39.570> here<00:05:39.900> is<00:05:39.990> for<00:05:40.169> config<00:05:40.530> a<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:40.979> I'm

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
first loto here is for config a and I'm

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.700 
first loto here is for config a and I'm
building<00:05:41.610> radiation<00:05:42.450> here<00:05:42.780> so<00:05:43.020> just<00:05:43.050> electric

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
building radiation here so just electric

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.250 
building radiation here so just electric
and<00:05:43.890> fire<00:05:44.160> and<00:05:44.460> why<00:05:45.060> I'm<00:05:45.419> building<00:05:45.600> radiation

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
and fire and why I'm building radiation

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.650 
and fire and why I'm building radiation
instead<00:05:47.160> of<00:05:47.250> like<00:05:47.400> viral<00:05:47.820> for<00:05:47.970> example<00:05:48.419> is

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
instead of like viral for example is

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.630 
instead of like viral for example is
basically<00:05:49.440> because<00:05:49.830> radiation<00:05:50.220> will<00:05:50.520> give

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
basically because radiation will give

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.210 
basically because radiation will give
you<00:05:50.760> 75<00:05:51.390> percent<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.080> alloyed<00:05:52.530> targets<00:05:53.070> so

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
you 75 percent to alloyed targets so

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.159 
you 75 percent to alloyed targets so
that'll<00:05:53.490> increase<00:05:53.729> your<00:05:54.060> damage<00:05:54.240> against

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
that'll increase your damage against

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.170 
that'll increase your damage against
like<00:05:55.800> the<00:05:55.919> Bombers<00:05:56.340> the<00:05:56.520> nape<00:05:56.700> armors<00:05:57.060> your

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
like the Bombers the nape armors your

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.909 
like the Bombers the nape armors your
viscera<00:05:57.510> is<00:05:57.540> basically<00:05:58.140> the<00:05:58.350> enemies<00:05:58.800> that

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
viscera is basically the enemies that

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.590 
viscera is basically the enemies that
will<00:05:59.070> be<00:05:59.220> most<00:05:59.550> likely<00:05:59.820> to<00:06:00.090> kill<00:06:00.360> you

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
will be most likely to kill you

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.810 
will be most likely to kill you
especially<00:06:01.020> in<00:06:01.410> a<00:06:01.710> high<00:06:01.890> leveled<00:06:02.250> survival

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
especially in a high leveled survival

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.000 
especially in a high leveled survival
mission<00:06:03.210> because<00:06:03.990> even<00:06:04.410> though<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:04.800> heavy

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
mission because even though the heavy

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.620 
mission because even though the heavy
gunners<00:06:05.250> are<00:06:05.460> ferrite<00:06:05.790> armored<00:06:06.210> they're

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
gunners are ferrite armored they're

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.630 
gunners are ferrite armored they're
lesser<00:06:07.200> of<00:06:07.380> a<00:06:07.830> threat<00:06:08.130> in<00:06:08.250> the<00:06:08.340> grenier

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
lesser of a threat in the grenier

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.000 
lesser of a threat in the grenier
faction<00:06:09.090> opposed<00:06:09.390> to<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.720> void<00:06:09.930> so<00:06:10.350> that's

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
faction opposed to the void so that's

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.490 
faction opposed to the void so that's
why<00:06:11.190> I<00:06:11.220> run<00:06:11.460> this<00:06:11.669> and<00:06:11.880> a<00:06:12.419> final<00:06:12.660> note<00:06:12.750> viral<00:06:13.380> in

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
why I run this and a final note viral in

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.170 
why I run this and a final note viral in
case<00:06:13.650> you're<00:06:13.800> wondering<00:06:13.890> that<00:06:14.130> does<00:06:14.550> not<00:06:14.820> act

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
case you're wondering that does not act

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.810 
case you're wondering that does not act
as<00:06:15.479> an<00:06:16.140> armor<00:06:16.620> ignoring<00:06:16.979> thing<00:06:17.220> you<00:06:17.370> will<00:06:17.640> get

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
as an armor ignoring thing you will get

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.580 
as an armor ignoring thing you will get
more<00:06:18.000> damage<00:06:18.240> against<00:06:18.690> these<00:06:19.080> specific

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
more damage against these specific

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.710 
more damage against these specific
target<00:06:19.919> with<00:06:20.130> radiation<00:06:20.760> and<00:06:21.000> poison<00:06:21.390> viral

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
target with radiation and poison viral

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.130 
target with radiation and poison viral
anyway<00:06:22.380> so<00:06:22.560> moving<00:06:22.950> on<00:06:23.070> to<00:06:23.510> corpus<00:06:24.510> now<00:06:24.660> the

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
anyway so moving on to corpus now the

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.840 
anyway so moving on to corpus now the
great<00:06:25.290> thing<00:06:25.320> about<00:06:25.500> corpus<00:06:26.070> is<00:06:26.280> we<00:06:26.550> got<00:06:26.669> these

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
great thing about corpus is we got these

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.030 
great thing about corpus is we got these
rime<00:06:27.180> rounds<00:06:27.600> so<00:06:27.720> you<00:06:27.780> can<00:06:27.960> viably<00:06:28.470> do<00:06:28.830> a

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
rime rounds so you can viably do a

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.850 
rime rounds so you can viably do a
status<00:06:29.820> build<00:06:30.090> still<00:06:30.510> with<00:06:30.720> just<00:06:30.990> two<00:06:31.380> mods<00:06:31.650> on

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
status build still with just two mods on

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.620 
status build still with just two mods on
here<00:06:31.890> so<00:06:32.190> all<00:06:32.460> I'm<00:06:32.550> doing<00:06:32.610> now<00:06:32.940> is<00:06:33.180> building

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
here so all I'm doing now is building

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.290 
here so all I'm doing now is building
magnetic<00:06:34.530> which<00:06:35.040> still<00:06:35.760> works<00:06:35.940> really<00:06:36.120> well

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
magnetic which still works really well

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.190 
magnetic which still works really well
you<00:06:36.510> have<00:06:36.690> a<00:06:36.720> pretty<00:06:36.960> good<00:06:37.160> approximate

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
you have a pretty good approximate

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.339 
you have a pretty good approximate
acquittals

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
acquittals

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:41.629 
acquittals
again<00:06:41.099> you<00:06:41.250> could

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
again you could

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.820 
again you could
if<00:06:41.849> you<00:06:41.969> wanted<00:06:42.270> to<00:06:42.419> add<00:06:42.599> in<00:06:42.749> another<00:06:43.080> forma<00:06:43.650> to

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
if you wanted to add in another forma to

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.219 
if you wanted to add in another forma to
run<00:06:44.159> just<00:06:44.370> pure<00:06:44.610> poison<00:06:45.150> but<00:06:45.389> this<00:06:45.960> has<00:06:46.110> been

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:46.229 
run just pure poison but this has been

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:48.200 
run just pure poison but this has been
working<00:06:46.439> for<00:06:46.740> me<00:06:46.860> fine<00:06:47.280> the<00:06:47.699> magnetic<00:06:48.090> so

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
working for me fine the magnetic so

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.309 
working for me fine the magnetic so
those<00:06:48.389> really<00:06:48.659> good<00:06:48.749> damage<00:06:49.020> against<00:06:49.199> their

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 
those really good damage against their

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.959 
those really good damage against their
shields<00:06:49.620> and<00:06:49.650> I<00:06:49.740> drop<00:06:50.009> any<00:06:50.249> corpus<00:06:50.729> on<00:06:50.879> the

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:50.969 
shields and I drop any corpus on the

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:54.290 
shields and I drop any corpus on the
starmap<00:06:51.210> no<00:06:51.689> problem<00:06:52.139> going<00:06:52.979> up<00:06:53.159> or<00:06:53.460> moving<00:06:54.150> on

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
starmap no problem going up or moving on

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.999 
starmap no problem going up or moving on
to<00:06:54.509> config<00:06:54.990> see<00:06:55.199> now<00:06:55.379> which<00:06:55.590> is<00:06:55.710> basically

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.009 
to config see now which is basically

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:58.700 
to config see now which is basically
your<00:06:56.219> void<00:06:56.669> and<00:06:56.969> infested<00:06:57.449> build<00:06:57.689> all<00:06:58.139> this<00:06:58.499> is

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
your void and infested build all this is

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.959 
your void and infested build all this is
basically<00:06:58.919> going<00:06:59.219> to<00:06:59.279> be<00:06:59.370> doing<00:06:59.550> is<00:06:59.759> building

00:06:59.959 --> 00:06:59.969 
basically going to be doing is building

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:01.850 
basically going to be doing is building
corrosive<00:07:00.719> now<00:07:00.900> so<00:07:01.139> corrosive<00:07:01.409> for<00:07:01.800> the

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
corrosive now so corrosive for the

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.649 
corrosive now so corrosive for the
infested<00:07:02.279> is<00:07:02.430> great<00:07:02.669> against<00:07:03.090> the<00:07:03.180> ancient

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:03.659 
infested is great against the ancient

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:05.149 
infested is great against the ancient
targets<00:07:03.990> which<00:07:04.139> are<00:07:04.289> the<00:07:04.439> biggest<00:07:04.650> problems

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:05.159 
targets which are the biggest problems

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:07.219 
targets which are the biggest problems
especially<00:07:05.849> those<00:07:05.999> healers<00:07:06.389> that<00:07:06.419> stack<00:07:06.960> a

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
especially those healers that stack a

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:09.200 
especially those healers that stack a
bunch<00:07:07.409> of<00:07:07.770> that<00:07:07.889> damage<00:07:08.310> reduction<00:07:08.520> on<00:07:08.819> all

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
bunch of that damage reduction on all

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.790 
bunch of that damage reduction on all
the<00:07:09.360> enemies<00:07:09.629> surrounding<00:07:10.050> it<00:07:10.139> and<00:07:10.289> in<00:07:10.680> the

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
the enemies surrounding it and in the

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.559 
the enemies surrounding it and in the
voids<00:07:11.009> is<00:07:11.279> mainly<00:07:11.639> for<00:07:11.999> the<00:07:12.120> heavy<00:07:12.300> gunners

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:12.569 
voids is mainly for the heavy gunners

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:14.450 
voids is mainly for the heavy gunners
which<00:07:12.900> are<00:07:13.139> the<00:07:13.259> biggest<00:07:13.469> problem<00:07:13.919> usually<00:07:14.129> in

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
which are the biggest problem usually in

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.610 
which are the biggest problem usually in
terms<00:07:14.939> of<00:07:15.120> tankiness<00:07:15.569> and<00:07:15.750> that's<00:07:16.259> it<00:07:16.409> for<00:07:16.529> the

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
terms of tankiness and that's it for the

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.469 
terms of tankiness and that's it for the
build<00:07:16.830> guys<00:07:17.009> so<00:07:17.189> I<00:07:17.250> hope<00:07:17.400> you<00:07:17.520> like<00:07:17.699> it<00:07:17.729> lots

build guys so I hope you like it lots

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:19.610 
build guys so I hope you like it lots

gonna be working really hard next up is
probably<00:07:21.180> gonna<00:07:21.419> be<00:07:21.509> Galaxian<00:07:22.229> or<00:07:22.500> I<00:07:22.529> don't

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.430
