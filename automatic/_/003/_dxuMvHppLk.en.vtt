00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
applied the shampoo to it it does have

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.420 
applied the shampoo to it it does have
it<00:01:19.170> has<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.220> sodium<00:01:20.700> laureth<00:01:21.500> but<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.710> the

it has the sodium laureth but that the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.960 
it has the sodium laureth but that the
sodium<00:01:23.909> laureth<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:25.619> plus<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.189> eight<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.640> guess

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
sodium laureth so plus in eight I guess

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
sodium laureth so plus in eight I guess
it's<00:01:27.150> pronounced<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:30.000> washed<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:30.750> hair<00:01:30.930> with

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
it's pronounced so I washed my hair with

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.859 
it's pronounced so I washed my hair with
it<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.619> first<00:01:31.890> wash<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.640> did<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.540> didn't

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
it the first wash that I did it didn't

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.319 
it the first wash that I did it didn't
really<00:01:34.020> lather<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.680> all<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.640> second<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.090> rinse

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
really lather at all the second I rinse

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.149 
really lather at all the second I rinse
it<00:01:36.479> out<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> second<00:01:37.200> time<00:01:37.229> around<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.950> did

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
it out the second time around it did

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.170 
it out the second time around it did
lather<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:40.400> when<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> rinsed<00:01:41.790> my<00:01:41.850> hair<00:01:42.150> out

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
lather and when I rinsed my hair out

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.410 
lather and when I rinsed my hair out
finally<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:43.229> didn't<00:01:43.680> make<00:01:44.640> my<00:01:44.790> hair<00:01:45.030> my<00:01:45.210> hair

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
finally it didn't make my hair my hair

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.469 
finally it didn't make my hair my hair
wasn't<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.840> soft<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:47.399> gave<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> totally

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
wasn't so soft it gave it like a totally

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.120 
wasn't so soft it gave it like a totally
different<00:01:48.869> feel<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.320> said<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.649> sulfate

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
different feel and it said it's sulfate

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.499 
different feel and it said it's sulfate
free<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:52.320> gave<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> hard<00:01:53.490> feel<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.360> it

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
free it gave it a like a hard feel to it

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.410 
free it gave it a like a hard feel to it
but<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:54.899> guessing<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.560> because<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> has

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
but I'm guessing it because it has

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.440 
but I'm guessing it because it has
whipped<00:01:57.420> egg<00:01:57.689> white<00:01:58.110> protein<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:59.579> it<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.270> maybe

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
whipped egg white protein in it so maybe

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.039 
whipped egg white protein in it so maybe
it<00:02:00.600> made<00:02:00.750> my<00:02:01.020> hair<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> little<00:02:01.409> bit<00:02:01.619> hard<00:02:02.000> well

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
it made my hair a little bit hard well

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.050 
it made my hair a little bit hard well
that's<00:02:04.049> my<00:02:04.259> review<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.189> shampoo<00:02:05.700> I

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
that's my review on the shampoo I

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
which I'm going to do right now I can

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.200 
which I'm going to do right now I can
maybe<00:02:11.550> do<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.819> while<00:02:12.030> I'm<00:02:12.150> sitting<00:02:12.450> down

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.270 
maybe do it while I'm sitting down
and<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.600> says<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:14.080> apply<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.500> conditioner<00:02:15.130> to
