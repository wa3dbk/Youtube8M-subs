00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.440
 rubric offscreen hello week 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.710
 was very difficult and complete event 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.260
 full of work and experimentation has accumulated 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.270
 huge amount of material that i 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.150
 I want to share with you soon 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.460
 first of all i decided to go deep into 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.529
 The history of the photo industry is not very 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.519
 interesting period 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.179
 sixties seventies eighties 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.940
 years sex drugs and rock and roll great 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.640
 names great photographers great models 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.550
 For example, I found such a model as jia 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.140
 Karanja is a young genius model 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.410
 which was one of the most 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.780
 sought after at the time 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.469
 Unfortunately she died at 26 years of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.180
 aids she was a lesbian addict 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.949
 the great story of her biography 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.379
 they even made a film about it 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.180
 called jia in it still played 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.579
 angelina jolie or jolie 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.739
 look at the beginning of your career 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.700
 please if you are interested since 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.369
 this movie gave a good start angela no 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.170
 well, when she just started on I 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.470
 keep experimenting 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.689
 mirrors with glass trying to create 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.210
 some space of smoke glass 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.060
 texture this all leads somehow 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.100
 incredible result I will definitely 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.710
 lay out my latest work 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.340
 soon in the portfolio as soon as i finish them 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.049
 processing is all very interesting to you 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.150
 show and want nothing from apt 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.840
 hide these little glasses are very 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.210
 cheap 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.310
 you can order them at any store 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.850
 your city in my opinion there is 40 rubles 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.500
 thing or 50 just a mirror is it real 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.630
 allows this to do something 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.360
 depth and add something like that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.850
 mystical in every photo trying 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.510
 somehow shape your style using 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.200
 it is these simple and improvised 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.050
 Cops then I switched to captcha van by 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.720
 to the advice of her beloved natali this is trout 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.120
 natalita trout is one of my idols 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.030
 since this girl is from argentina 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.990
 in one or two years became one of 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.110
 most popular 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.960
 retoucher afon all over the world she drives by 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.960
 the world gives her lessons she of course 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.970
 processes so photos that are not yet 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.790
 probably years 5 will have to kill to 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.190
 reach her level since it's high and 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.730
 re touching it ie must burn and 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.280
 very sophisticated and powerful tools 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.680
 processing is easy but just needed 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.620
 the eye needs sight to be seen well 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.020
 light and shade and need patience which 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.900
 me unfortunately not so much okay 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.210

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.900
