00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hi We're some of the awesome aliens and

Oregon<00:00:05.130> here<00:00:05.910> we're<00:00:06.120> going<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.299> demonstrate

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
Oregon here we're going to demonstrate

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.720 
Oregon here we're going to demonstrate
some<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:06.960> our<00:00:07.170> best<00:00:07.319> guesses<00:00:07.620> for<00:00:08.160> what's

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
some of our best guesses for what's

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.129 
some of our best guesses for what's
going<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.970> happen<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.450> table<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.900> how<00:00:10.080> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
going to happen on the table and how the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.560 
going to happen on the table and how the
obstacles<00:00:10.710> are<00:00:10.860> going<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.070> work<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:11.910> here<00:00:12.420> we

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
obstacles are going to work so here we

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.349 
obstacles are going to work so here we
go<00:00:15.770> all<00:00:16.770> right<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.730> found<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
go all right so we found that on the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.460 
go all right so we found that on the
table<00:00:18.510> there<00:00:18.779> are<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> lot<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.050> things<00:00:19.289> with

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
table there are a lot of things with

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.250 
table there are a lot of things with
silver<00:00:19.830> boobies<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.460> whole<00:00:21.029> lot<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.270> them<00:00:21.420> so

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
silver boobies a whole lot of them so

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.540 
silver boobies a whole lot of them so
we're<00:00:22.439> going<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.769> assume<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.039> we'll<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
we're going to assume that we'll have to

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.009 
we're going to assume that we'll have to
pick<00:00:23.699> those<00:00:23.820> up<00:00:23.880> at<00:00:24.210> some<00:00:24.510> time<00:00:24.660> or<00:00:24.900> another

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
pick those up at some time or another

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.769 
pick those up at some time or another
move<00:00:25.650> them<00:00:25.800> somewhere<00:00:25.920> else<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:27.090> found<00:00:27.359> that

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
move them somewhere else we found that

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.169 
move them somewhere else we found that
this<00:00:28.080> tree<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> power<00:00:28.859> line<00:00:29.160> one<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
this tree with the power line one of the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.780 
this tree with the power line one of the
branches<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.810> really<00:00:31.529> loose<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.130> can<00:00:32.369> fall<00:00:32.579> on

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
branches is really loose and can fall on

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.840 
branches is really loose and can fall on
the<00:00:33.030> very<00:00:33.270> wobbly<00:00:33.630> power<00:00:34.079> line<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.700> we're

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the very wobbly power line so we're

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.580 
the very wobbly power line so we're
assuming<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.600> there<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> chance<00:00:37.469> that

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
assuming that there is a chance that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.770 
assuming that there is a chance that
that<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.160> knocked<00:00:38.340> over<00:00:38.510> we've<00:00:39.510> noticed

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
that can be knocked over we've noticed

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.780 
that can be knocked over we've noticed
that<00:00:39.930> there<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.140> two<00:00:40.469> trucks<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.550> this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that there are two trucks they have this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.520 
that there are two trucks they have this
new<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.450> with<00:00:42.600> some<00:00:42.750> supplies<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.350> back

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
new one with some supplies in the back

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.060 
new one with some supplies in the back
and<00:00:43.800> an<00:00:44.190> ambulance<00:00:44.640> over<00:00:44.730> there<00:00:45.260> um<00:00:46.260> we're

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and an ambulance over there um we're

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.110 
and an ambulance over there um we're
sending<00:00:47.399> worried<00:00:47.550> they're<00:00:47.820> gonna<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.059> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
sending worried they're gonna have to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.340 
sending worried they're gonna have to
bring<00:00:48.270> those<00:00:48.360> back<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.660> base<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:49.050> move<00:00:49.230> them

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
bring those back to base or move them

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.200 
bring those back to base or move them
somewhere<00:00:49.530> else<00:00:49.890> since<00:00:50.520> I'm<00:00:50.670> not<00:00:50.789> sensing

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
somewhere else since I'm not sensing

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.959 
somewhere else since I'm not sensing
mounted<00:00:51.510> down<00:00:53.420> yes<00:00:54.770> um<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> little

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
mounted down yes um we have a little

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.580 
mounted down yes um we have a little
earthquake<00:00:57.239> house<00:00:57.629> over<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.079> which<00:00:58.320> it's

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
earthquake house over here which it's

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.959 
earthquake house over here which it's
hard<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:59.039> right<00:00:59.070> now<00:00:59.250> but<00:00:59.609> there's<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.820> red

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
hard to see right now but there's a red

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.639 
hard to see right now but there's a red
lever<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.420> one<00:01:00.600> side<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.020> when<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> live<00:01:01.530> that

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
lever on one side and when you live that

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.369 
lever on one side and when you live that
red<00:01:01.829> lever<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.760> house<00:01:02.940> gets<00:01:02.969> lifted<00:01:03.390> up<00:01:03.690> so

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
red lever the house gets lifted up so

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.500 
red lever the house gets lifted up so
we're<00:01:04.530> assuming<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:05.280> at<00:01:05.880> some<00:01:06.119> point<00:01:06.150> or

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
we're assuming that at some point or

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.899 
we're assuming that at some point or
another<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.110> lift<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> house

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
another you have to lift up the house

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.210 
another you have to lift up the house
the<00:01:08.909> motorcycle<00:01:09.450> girl<00:01:09.630> moves<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.320> we're<00:01:10.890> not

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the motorcycle girl moves and we're not

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.380 
the motorcycle girl moves and we're not
quite<00:01:11.490> sure<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:11.880> you're<00:01:11.970> gonna<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.299> do

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
quite sure what you're gonna have to do

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.890 
quite sure what you're gonna have to do
with<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.510> yet<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.950> come<00:01:14.100> around<00:01:14.220> here<00:01:17.900> we

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
with that yet if you come around here we

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.450 
with that yet if you come around here we
have<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.049> lot<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.290> different<00:01:19.860> kind<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
have a lot of different kind of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.460 
have a lot of different kind of
obstacles<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> table<00:01:21.869> they<00:01:22.140> will<00:01:22.320> be

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
obstacles on the table they will be

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.770 
obstacles on the table they will be
mounted<00:01:22.799> down<00:01:22.920> eventually<00:01:23.390> we<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> river

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
mounted down eventually we have a river

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.429 
mounted down eventually we have a river
we<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.680> forest<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.759> fallen<00:01:27.030> tree

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
we have a forest with the fallen tree

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.249 
we have a forest with the fallen tree
rooftop<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.280> rocky<00:01:29.790> wall<00:01:30.049> we're<00:01:31.049> assuming

rooftop and a rocky wall we're assuming
you're<00:01:31.590> either<00:01:31.710> gonna<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.159> roll<00:01:32.340> over

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
you're either gonna have to roll over

you're either gonna have to roll over
those<00:01:32.790> based<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> hint<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:33.960> given

assuming you might have to roll over
those<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.759> probably<00:01:45.240> our<00:01:45.509> team's

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
those this is probably our team's

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.240 
those this is probably our team's
favorite<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.460> airplane<00:01:49.070> it's<00:01:50.070> kind

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
favorite this is the airplane it's kind

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.760 
favorite this is the airplane it's kind
of<00:01:50.399> hard<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.790> right<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
of hard to see right now but we have a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.069 
of hard to see right now but we have a
little<00:01:52.950> airplane<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.670> we<00:01:54.630> rigged<00:01:54.810> up<00:01:54.930> this

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
little airplane and we rigged up this

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.539 
little airplane and we rigged up this
whole<00:01:55.259> mechanism<00:01:55.470> based<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:56.070> how<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.280> think

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
whole mechanism based on how we think

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.359 
whole mechanism based on how we think
it'll<00:01:56.759> go<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.200> hook<00:01:58.409> from<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> string<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
it'll go so the hook from the string and

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.280 
it'll go so the hook from the string and
the<00:02:00.180> string<00:02:00.420> thing<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.719> mounted<00:02:00.990> over<00:02:01.049> there

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the string thing is mounted over there

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.499 
the string thing is mounted over there
you<00:02:02.189> push<00:02:02.430> down<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.700> red<00:02:02.909> lever<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
you push down the red lever and the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.969 
you push down the red lever and the
blame<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:03.930> goes<00:02:04.170> down

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.980 

right<00:02:08.979> here<00:02:09.190> we<00:02:10.030> have<00:02:10.180> what<00:02:10.479> we're<00:02:10.660> going<00:02:10.899> to

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
right here we have what we're going to

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.770 
right here we have what we're going to
be<00:02:11.110> gone<00:02:11.260> let<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.190> insta<00:02:12.640> flood<00:02:12.850> 2000<00:02:13.570> and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
be gone let the insta flood 2000 and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.530 
be gone let the insta flood 2000 and
we're<00:02:14.710> not<00:02:14.770> quite<00:02:15.010> sure<00:02:15.040> how<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.790> works<00:02:16.180> but

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
we're not quite sure how this works but

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.110 
we're not quite sure how this works but
if<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.900> push<00:02:17.110> down<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.590> those<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.190> sends<00:02:18.970> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
if you push down on those it sends the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.040 
if you push down on those it sends the
floodwaters<00:02:19.690> going<00:02:20.760> alright<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:22.600> I'm<00:02:22.870> going

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
floodwaters going alright so I'm going

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.190 
floodwaters going alright so I'm going
to<00:02:23.110> come<00:02:23.230> around<00:02:23.350> here<00:02:24.660> ball<00:02:25.660> creeper<00:02:26.020> keeps

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
to come around here ball creeper keeps

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.440 
to come around here ball creeper keeps
pulling<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.590> table<00:02:26.920> um<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.150> one<00:02:28.330> will

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
pulling with the table um this one will

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.240 
pulling with the table um this one will
be<00:02:28.570> mounted<00:02:28.900> down<00:02:28.990> eventually<00:02:29.320> but<00:02:30.040> you'll

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
be mounted down eventually but you'll

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.340 
be mounted down eventually but you'll
push<00:02:30.520> here<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.330> raises<00:02:31.570> that<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.170> if<00:02:32.260> you

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
push here and it raises that but if you

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.470 
push here and it raises that but if you
push<00:02:32.530> too<00:02:32.560> far<00:02:32.740> it<00:02:33.190> falls<00:02:33.400> over<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:34.240> we're<00:02:34.360> not

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
push too far it falls over so we're not

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.030 
push too far it falls over so we're not
sure<00:02:34.750> that's<00:02:34.930> going<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.230> be<00:02:35.380> incorporated<00:02:35.560> in

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
sure that's going to be incorporated in

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.790 
sure that's going to be incorporated in
the<00:02:36.130> challenge<00:02:36.460> or<00:02:36.550> not<00:02:36.700> but<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:38.290> just<00:02:38.530> noticed

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
the challenge or not but we just noticed

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.260 
the challenge or not but we just noticed
that<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.220> our<00:02:39.460> exploration<00:02:40.620> over<00:02:41.620> here<00:02:42.270> we

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
that in our exploration over here we

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.780 
that in our exploration over here we
have<00:02:43.300> an<00:02:44.020> assortment<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:45.220> apartment

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
have an assortment of apartment

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.780 
have an assortment of apartment
buildings<00:02:45.820> or<00:02:46.300> towers<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:47.280> all<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.430> them<00:02:48.580> are

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
buildings or towers and all of them are

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.530 
buildings or towers and all of them are
very<00:02:49.060> unstable<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.670> we<00:02:51.730> are<00:02:51.820> assuming<00:02:52.030> somehow

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
very unstable so we are assuming somehow

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.940 
very unstable so we are assuming somehow
your<00:02:52.780> they're<00:02:52.959> gonna<00:02:53.080> have<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.290> move<00:02:53.470> them<00:02:53.650> or

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
your they're gonna have to move them or

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.390 
your they're gonna have to move them or
fix<00:02:54.310> um<00:02:54.550> uh<00:02:54.910> knock<00:02:55.300> them<00:02:55.480> over<00:02:55.600> right<00:02:56.130> here<00:02:57.130> we

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
fix um uh knock them over right here we

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.300 
fix um uh knock them over right here we
have<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.550> very<00:02:57.910> interesting<00:02:58.000> challenge<00:02:58.959> it's<00:02:59.830> a

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
have a very interesting challenge it's a

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.990 
have a very interesting challenge it's a
rainbow<00:03:00.790> dial<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.840> when<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:02.950> move<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.550> it

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
rainbow dial and when you move this it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.690 
rainbow dial and when you move this it
clicks<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.720> moves<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:06.250> white<00:03:06.430> arrow<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:09.310> it

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
clicks and moves the white arrow and it

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.520 
clicks and moves the white arrow and it
moves<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:10.000> very<00:03:10.150> slowly<00:03:10.390> we're<00:03:11.230> not<00:03:11.320> quite

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
moves it very slowly we're not quite

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
moves it very slowly we're not quite
sure<00:03:11.560> how<00:03:11.769> this<00:03:11.800> one's<00:03:12.100> going<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.310> work<00:03:12.400> though

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
sure how this one's going to work though

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.370 
sure how this one's going to work though
although<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.150> appears<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.540> be<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:14.140> challenge

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
although it appears to be the challenge

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.100 
although it appears to be the challenge
that<00:03:14.590> both<00:03:15.130> tables<00:03:15.430> can<00:03:15.730> access<00:03:16.120> doesn't

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
that both tables can access doesn't

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.170 
that both tables can access doesn't
matter<00:03:17.230> which<00:03:17.410> slumber<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:17.830> push<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:19.000> white

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
matter which slumber you push the white

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.110 
matter which slumber you push the white
arrow<00:03:19.360> still<00:03:19.720> moves<00:03:19.930> in<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.290> direction<00:03:20.350> so

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
arrow still moves in this direction so

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.979 
arrow still moves in this direction so
we're<00:03:22.120> not<00:03:22.209> quite<00:03:22.420> sure<00:03:22.450> how<00:03:22.690> that's<00:03:22.870> gonna

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
we're not quite sure how that's gonna

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.979 
we're not quite sure how that's gonna
work<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.730> that<00:03:25.090> was<00:03:25.150> our<00:03:25.299> best<00:03:25.510> guess<00:03:25.750> at

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
work it so that was our best guess at

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.360 
work it so that was our best guess at
what's<00:03:26.170> gonna<00:03:26.320> happen<00:03:26.650> on<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:26.860> table<00:03:27.250> I

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
what's gonna happen on the table I

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.740 
what's gonna happen on the table I
really<00:03:27.820> like<00:03:27.970> this<00:03:28.120> table<00:03:28.420> because<00:03:28.600> there's

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
really like this table because there's

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.410 
really like this table because there's
so<00:03:29.110> much<00:03:29.470> variety<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.310> things<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.180> we

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
so much variety and the things that we

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.449 
so much variety and the things that we
can<00:03:31.570> do<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.019> I'm<00:03:32.440> curious<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.980> see<00:03:33.130> how<00:03:33.250> these

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
can do and I'm curious to see how these

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.250 
can do and I'm curious to see how these
are<00:03:33.640> all<00:03:33.730> gonna<00:03:33.880> work<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.450> like<00:03:35.080> it<00:03:35.200> because

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
are all gonna work I like it because

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.150 
are all gonna work I like it because
there's<00:03:35.530> lots<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:35.799> things<00:03:35.980> going<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.959> I<00:03:38.860> like

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
there's lots of things going and I like

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.300 
there's lots of things going and I like
