a 60 gig hard drive and built which is

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.970 
a 60 gig hard drive and built which is
pretty<00:00:22.499> fantastic<00:00:24.079> um<00:00:25.079> pcs<00:00:25.470> come<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.890> all

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
pretty fantastic um pcs come in all

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.489 
pretty fantastic um pcs come in all
sorts<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.310> sizes<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.849> they<00:00:27.029> range<00:00:27.210> from<00:00:27.499> five

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
sorts of sizes and they range from five

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.249 
sorts of sizes and they range from five
inches<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.429> one<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.669> up<00:00:30.329> to<00:00:30.689> nine

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
inches like this one here up to nine

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.740 
inches like this one here up to nine
inches<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.949> screen<00:00:32.430> size<00:00:32.480> again<00:00:33.480> touch

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
inches in screen size again touch

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.490 
inches in screen size again touch
screens<00:00:34.370> so<00:00:35.370> basically<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:36.060> umpc<00:00:36.660> sort<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.290> fits

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
screens so basically a umpc sort of fits

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.900 
screens so basically a umpc sort of fits
in<00:00:37.620> between<00:00:37.740> a<00:00:37.980> tablet<00:00:38.400> pc<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.720> PDA<00:00:40.910> but

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
in between a tablet pc and a PDA but

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.320 
in between a tablet pc and a PDA but
compared<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> PDA<00:00:42.810> a<00:00:43.140> umpc<00:00:43.770> has<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.730> bigger

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
compared to a PDA a umpc has a bigger

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.770 
compared to a PDA a umpc has a bigger
screen<00:00:45.630> it<00:00:46.380> runs<00:00:46.770> microsoft<00:00:47.520> windows<00:00:47.780> it's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
screen it runs microsoft windows it's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.020 
screen it runs microsoft windows it's
far<00:00:49.290> more<00:00:49.350> powerful<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.310> it<00:00:50.520> has<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> lot<00:00:51.000> more

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
far more powerful and it has a lot more

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.240 
far more powerful and it has a lot more
storage<00:00:51.540> capacity

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.230 

so<00:00:58.820> when<00:00:59.030> would<00:00:59.180> you<00:00:59.330> use<00:00:59.360> a<00:00:59.990> umpc<00:01:00.700> well<00:01:01.700> you're

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
so when would you use a umpc well you're

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.060 
so when would you use a umpc well you're
using<00:01:02.480> your<00:01:02.720> pc<00:01:02.989> when<00:01:03.380> you<00:01:03.500> have<00:01:03.680> an<00:01:03.800> existing

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
using your pc when you have an existing

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.250 
using your pc when you have an existing
Windows<00:01:04.670> application<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:06.020> want<00:01:06.200> to

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
Windows application that you want to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.320 
Windows application that you want to
make<00:01:06.440> mobile<00:01:06.680> now<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.640> lot<00:01:07.850> of<00:01:07.910> people<00:01:08.120> have

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
make mobile now a lot of people have

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.480 
make mobile now a lot of people have
gone<00:01:08.510> down<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.870> path<00:01:08.900> of<00:01:09.320> PDAs<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.190> deploy

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
gone down the path of PDAs to deploy

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.030 
gone down the path of PDAs to deploy
mobile<00:01:10.729> applications<00:01:11.630> but<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.380> limitations

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
mobile applications but the limitations

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.370 
mobile applications but the limitations
of<00:01:13.190> PDAs<00:01:13.729> is<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.420> have<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.780> redevelop

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
of PDAs is that you have to redevelop

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.820 
of PDAs is that you have to redevelop
your<00:01:15.530> software<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.580> suit<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.210> PDA<00:01:17.830> in

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
your software to suit the PDA in

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.490 
your software to suit the PDA in
addition<00:01:19.369> to<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:20.110> bearing<00:01:21.110> in<00:01:21.170> mind<00:01:21.229> the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
addition to that bearing in mind the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.770 
addition to that bearing in mind the
size<00:01:21.860> of<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.160> PDA<00:01:22.520> they<00:01:22.820> normally<00:01:23.210> quite<00:01:23.450> small

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
size of a PDA they normally quite small

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.690 
size of a PDA they normally quite small
they're<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.380> little<00:01:24.560> bit<00:01:24.770> frustrating<00:01:25.369> to<00:01:25.490> use

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
they're a little bit frustrating to use

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.670 
they're a little bit frustrating to use
the<00:01:26.390> control<00:01:26.780> sets<00:01:27.080> that<00:01:27.260> you<00:01:27.350> have<00:01:27.530> available

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
the control sets that you have available

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.859 
the control sets that you have available
for<00:01:28.340> development<00:01:28.760> aren't<00:01:29.180> as<00:01:29.300> good<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:29.690> so

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
for development aren't as good and so

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.770 
for development aren't as good and so
forth<00:01:30.170> but<00:01:30.979> in<00:01:31.640> addition<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.450> development

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
forth but in addition to the development

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.630 
forth but in addition to the development
costs<00:01:33.200> people<00:01:33.710> sometimes<00:01:33.979> forget<00:01:34.280> the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
costs people sometimes forget the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.999 
costs people sometimes forget the
support<00:01:35.030> costs<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.110> retraining<00:01:36.530> costs

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
support costs and the retraining costs

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.219 
support costs and the retraining costs
as<00:01:37.100> well<00:01:37.390> basically<00:01:38.390> if<00:01:38.570> you're<00:01:38.690> deploying<00:01:39.020> in

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
as well basically if you're deploying in

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.590 
as well basically if you're deploying in
your<00:01:39.350> application<00:01:39.890> on<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.009> PDA<00:01:40.399> you<00:01:41.180> have<00:01:41.390> to

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
your application on a PDA you have to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.389 
your application on a PDA you have to
train<00:01:41.840> your<00:01:41.960> people<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.380> use<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:42.830> then<00:01:43.310> you

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
train your people to use it and then you

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.460 
train your people to use it and then you
have<00:01:43.550> to<00:01:43.700> support<00:01:44.030> them<00:01:44.240> in<00:01:44.360> using<00:01:44.720> it<00:01:44.869> but

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
have to support them in using it but

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.219 
have to support them in using it but
with<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.619> umpc<00:01:46.160> you<00:01:47.119> can<00:01:47.300> take<00:01:47.570> your<00:01:47.600> existing

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
with a umpc you can take your existing

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.660 
with a umpc you can take your existing
Windows<00:01:48.500> application<00:01:49.070> that<00:01:49.190> everybody<00:01:49.550> knows

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
Windows application that everybody knows

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.370 
Windows application that everybody knows
how<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.060> use<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:50.660> you're<00:01:50.930> already<00:01:51.080> supporting

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
how to use and you're already supporting

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.040 
how to use and you're already supporting
and<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:52.280> can<00:01:52.399> put<00:01:52.550> it<00:01:52.640> on<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:52.759> human<00:01:53.090> PC<00:01:53.810> and

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
and you can put it on a human PC and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.740 
and you can put it on a human PC and
there<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:54.770> go<00:01:54.950> you're<00:01:55.250> rolling<00:01:55.580> out<00:01:55.670> bovar

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.030 

so<00:02:01.640> you'd<00:02:02.640> also<00:02:02.820> use<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> umpc<00:02:03.960> where<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.800> need

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
so you'd also use a umpc where you need

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.220 
so you'd also use a umpc where you need
the<00:02:05.220> biggest<00:02:05.550> screen<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.270> need<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> extra

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
the biggest screen you need the extra

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.310 
the biggest screen you need the extra
processing<00:02:07.560> power<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:09.690> need<00:02:09.960> a<00:02:09.990> mobile

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
processing power and you need a mobile

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.120 
processing power and you need a mobile
pc<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:11.280> weighs<00:02:11.520> less<00:02:11.850> than<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.120> kilo<00:02:12.830> u<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:13.980> pc

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
pc that weighs less than a kilo u and pc
