pretty<00:02:37.270> good<00:02:37.480> okay<00:02:37.930> yeah<00:02:38.200> using<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.680> method

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
pretty good okay yeah using this method

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.740 
pretty good okay yeah using this method
and<00:02:39.310> can<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.760> use<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.030> method<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:40.450> learn

and can you use this method to learn

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.260 
and can you use this method to learn
other<00:02:40.960> languages<00:02:41.380> oh<00:02:41.740> by<00:02:42.580> all<00:02:42.610> means<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
other languages oh by all means the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.690 
other languages oh by all means the
formulation<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.050> this<00:02:44.470> method<00:02:44.890> is<00:02:45.070> to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
formulation of the this method is to

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.350 
formulation of the this method is to
reuse<00:02:46.270> students<00:02:47.200> knowledge<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:49.090> first

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
reuse students knowledge of the first

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.410 
reuse students knowledge of the first
language<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:50.440> learn<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.280> second<00:02:51.790> language<00:02:52.150> y

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
language to learn the second language y

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.550 
language to learn the second language y
x<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.350> y<00:02:53.880> can<00:02:54.880> be<00:02:54.910> any<00:02:55.300> language<00:02:55.720> so<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.290> can

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
x and y can be any language so you can

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.980 
x and y can be any language so you can
replace<00:02:57.360> Spanish<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.570> French<00:02:58.600> and<00:03:00.750> German<00:03:01.750> to
