00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.059 
most upset I think he really thought he
had<00:02:20.200> him<00:02:20.560> when<00:02:21.340> he<00:02:21.430> had<00:02:21.610> him<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.000> sleeper

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
had him when he had him in the sleeper

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.460 
had him when he had him in the sleeper
Bill<00:02:24.069> Court<00:02:24.489> maybe<00:02:25.360> took<00:02:25.630> his<00:02:25.810> time<00:02:26.049> raising

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
Bill Court maybe took his time raising

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.949 
Bill Court maybe took his time raising
that<00:02:26.709> arm<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.099> three<00:02:27.310> times<00:02:27.610> done<00:02:28.599> it<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.810> little

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
that arm to three times done it a little

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.330 
that arm to three times done it a little
quicker<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.440> may<00:02:29.560> have<00:02:29.680> dropped<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.099> third

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
quicker it may have dropped that third

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.220 
quicker it may have dropped that third
time<00:02:30.610> well<00:02:31.209> my<00:02:31.239> guess<00:02:31.599> is<00:02:31.630> what's<00:02:32.049> going

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
time well my guess is what's going

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.839 
time well my guess is what's going
through<00:02:32.349> a<00:02:32.709> pox<00:02:33.310> head

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
through a pox head

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.140 
through a pox head
besides<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.959> turnbuckle<00:02:35.549> is<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.760> fact<00:02:37.030> that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
besides that turnbuckle is the fact that

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.630 
besides that turnbuckle is the fact that
he<00:02:37.599> knows<00:02:37.810> Adam<00:02:38.500> revolvers<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.040> distance
