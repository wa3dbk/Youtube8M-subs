actually<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.590> push<00:03:06.750> somewhat<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.990> get

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
actually have to push somewhat to get

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.580 
actually have to push somewhat to get
the<00:03:08.350> number<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.690> know<00:03:10.810> be<00:03:11.050> put<00:03:11.470> on<00:03:11.560> the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
the number to to you know be put on the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.980 
the number to to you know be put on the
screen<00:03:11.920> but<00:03:12.850> it's<00:03:13.150> not<00:03:13.330> it's<00:03:13.450> not<00:03:13.540> too<00:03:13.840> bad

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
screen but it's not it's not too bad

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.090 
screen but it's not it's not too bad
it's<00:03:14.230> it's<00:03:14.500> not<00:03:14.680> like<00:03:14.770> you<00:03:14.860> have<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> like

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
it's it's not like you have to like

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.430 
it's it's not like you have to like
really<00:03:15.700> jab<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.300> more<00:03:16.540> just<00:03:16.720> like<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.930> slight

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
really jab it more just like a slight

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.370 
really jab it more just like a slight
pressure<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.610> it's<00:03:19.120> pretty<00:03:19.270> cool<00:03:20.459> um<00:03:22.230> then<00:03:23.230> I

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
pressure so it's pretty cool um then I

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.510 
pressure so it's pretty cool um then I
guess<00:03:23.530> let<00:03:23.709> me<00:03:23.740> show<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.040> internet<00:03:24.340> will

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
guess let me show you the internet will

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.320 
guess let me show you the internet will
quick<00:03:28.769> it's<00:03:29.769> going<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.040> be<00:03:30.130> 18<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.880> media

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
quick it's going to be 18 to the media

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.710 
quick it's going to be 18 to the media
in<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.480> internet<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:36.040> has<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.030> menu<00:03:37.360> buttons

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
in the internet it has the menu buttons

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.360 
in the internet it has the menu buttons
down<00:03:37.870> here<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.680> can<00:03:38.769> see<00:03:38.920> it's<00:03:39.040> not<00:03:39.100> too

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
down here and you can see it's not too

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.460 
down here and you can see it's not too
slow<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.910> a<00:03:41.519> startup<00:03:42.519> time<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.290> once<00:03:44.290> you're

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
slow of a startup time and once you're

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.160 
slow of a startup time and once you're
in<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.769> browser<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.580> can<00:03:45.610> kind<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:45.970> just<00:03:46.170> use

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
in the browser you can kind of just use

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.420 
in the browser you can kind of just use
your<00:03:47.290> finger<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.560> go<00:03:48.010> up<00:03:48.070> and<00:03:48.220> down<00:03:48.370> and

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
your finger to go up and down and

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.820 
your finger to go up and down and
navigate<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.239> different<00:03:49.600> links<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.470> whatnot

navigate the different links and whatnot

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.509 
navigate the different links and whatnot
and<00:03:52.049> then<00:03:53.049> also<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.830> can<00:03:54.040> actually<00:03:54.160> change

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
and then also you can actually change

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.289

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.940 
different colors I guess uh you know
resolution<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:47.890> whatnot<00:04:48.220> so<00:04:49.500> it's<00:04:50.500> pretty

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
resolution and whatnot so it's pretty

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.250 
resolution and whatnot so it's pretty
cool<00:04:51.220> it's<00:04:51.730> a<00:04:51.790> two<00:04:51.940> point<00:04:52.150> O<00:04:52.270> megapixel<00:04:52.930> camera

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
cool it's a two point O megapixel camera

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.250 
cool it's a two point O megapixel camera
so<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:53.740> takes<00:04:54.610> pretty<00:04:55.090> decent<00:04:55.600> decent

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
so it takes pretty decent decent

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.570 
so it takes pretty decent decent
pictures<00:04:57.450> and<00:05:00.300> that's<00:05:01.300> about<00:05:01.420> it<00:05:01.570> for<00:05:02.430> for<00:05:03.430> you
