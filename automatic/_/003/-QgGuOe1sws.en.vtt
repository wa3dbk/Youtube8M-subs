this<00:06:11.060> baby<00:06:11.240> works<00:06:11.800> so<00:06:12.800> you<00:06:13.250> just<00:06:13.370> take<00:06:13.520> a

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
this baby works so you just take a

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.890 
this baby works so you just take a
strand<00:06:13.880> of<00:06:14.000> your<00:06:14.090> hair<00:06:14.150> however<00:06:14.450> thick<00:06:14.780> you

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
strand of your hair however thick you

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.150 
strand of your hair however thick you
decide<00:06:15.200> it<00:06:15.790> sucks<00:06:16.790> up<00:06:16.940> the<00:06:17.090> curl<00:06:17.800> you<00:06:18.800> wait<00:06:18.950> for

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
decide it sucks up the curl you wait for

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.610 
decide it sucks up the curl you wait for
the<00:06:19.190> three<00:06:19.490> beeps<00:06:19.760> or<00:06:20.030> four<00:06:20.930> beeps<00:06:21.110> i<00:06:21.320> forget

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
the three beeps or four beeps i forget

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.610 
the three beeps or four beeps i forget
so<00:06:22.070> that's<00:06:22.250> one<00:06:22.490> two<00:06:22.820> three<00:06:24.400> four<00:06:25.400> five<00:06:26.620> I

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
so that's one two three four five I

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.430 
so that's one two three four five I
guess<00:06:27.800> and<00:06:28.930> it's<00:06:29.930> ready

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
guess and it's ready

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.180 
guess and it's ready
that's<00:06:32.440> how<00:06:32.560> you<00:06:32.620> do<00:06:32.860> it<00:06:33.040> so<00:06:33.760> miracurl<00:06:34.570> and

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
that's how you do it so miracurl and

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.700
