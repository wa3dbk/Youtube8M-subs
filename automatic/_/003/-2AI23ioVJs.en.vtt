 so let's open it for 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.800
 open it because we open it from above 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.100
 has a sticker here that would have to 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.870
 have cut before but on a kaffir 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.280
 let's see if we get the cleavage here 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.280
 is and we take it out fast 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.520
 and it appears that it gives 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.000
 yes yes yes yes the victory is our very 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.209
 well when opening we bring this out towards 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.920
 up this sideways this towards 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.980
 up also fuck because he does not have things 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.709
 and we are going to take out all the content about 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.000
 the bed as you can see is not left 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.130
 absolutely nothing the box 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.319
 in fact you can see my fingers through 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.770
 her 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.810
 and we are going to open this 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.870
 to see how we position this so that 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.040
 do not miss detail 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.860
 very well 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.670
 this is all that this includes 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.500
 plastic that is useless 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.940
 the mouse 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.870
 what are we going to do to make it look good 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.950
 puts world of warcraft this has the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.950
 metallic acid style 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.730
 the plastic yes but it looks metallic 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:16.380
 this is super smooth as if it were 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.440
 gomÃ  the truth very soft 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.590
 the buttons have an easy touch 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.170
 besides that it has a lot of buttons 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.420
 here you press everything everywhere by 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.690
 low so you can see the design 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:34.340
 and the truth is that it is really great to 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.590
 see if you can fix the size 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:43.300
 compared to my hand is big of 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:46.389
 cojones let's see if I can bring good 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.860
 there you have it, the box was included 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:52.880
 Well, this is a little bag or what 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.480
 want to call 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:00.160
 I imagine that inside look what is this 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.160
 includes a sticker of steel series 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.560
 the quick guide that fast has what 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.010
 that I have as a necromancer because 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.560
 my mother the quick guide says 43 hours 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.620
 Quick guide and 100 sword 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.330
 and then professional gaming steelseries 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.810
 It was good where they try to sell you already 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.060
 all of your products these people do not 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.290
 settle for selling you a mouse on 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.810
 price is 64 with 90 in amazon + shipping 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.950
 I caught sending 24 hours because it 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.450
 I wanted to have today 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:40.270
 and good and this is all the rope 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:43.450
 what I like also with the mouse 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:47.110
 previous is that the cable is not cable if 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:50.380
 it is not very much stronger rope and 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:54.220
 nothing has a pound of country 14 buttons 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:57.220
 programmable and the touch and appearance 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.220
 awesome and you're done this is all 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.750
 we will connect if you want to see 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.240
 if it lights up if first before 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.800
 configure anything and we can throw a 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.699
 glance 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.699
 Quick 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.720
 let's go always carry the ropes and 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.980
 after these it costs me a life and 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.730
 half 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.730
 give him 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.580
 it seems that it is released 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.610
 and now to see if we are going to test 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.950
 the resistance of the cable pulling and 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.449
 pulling to break it 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.789
 very well we are going to connect it here 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:37.300
 of course it is connected by usb no no 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:39.880
 I think there is a lack of saying yes yes yes yes 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.190
 that lights up like this 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.840
 look look look at the colors of death 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.910
 is that I'm going to lower the pressure of 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.590
 all 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:52.750
 Come on come on come on let's go down 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.380
 now look look at how it lights up 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:59.230
 this than what majesty that beauty 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:02.710
