like<00:06:25.100> some<00:06:25.370> plant<00:06:25.730> and<00:06:26.000> that<00:06:26.540> basically

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
like some plant and that basically

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.910 
like some plant and that basically
concludes<00:06:27.830> to<00:06:28.040> the<00:06:28.190> set<00:06:28.490> up<00:06:28.640> just<00:06:29.920> three

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
concludes to the set up just three

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.040 
concludes to the set up just three
capping<00:06:31.340> nothing<00:06:31.670> too<00:06:31.910> big<00:06:32.180> there's<00:06:32.570> my<00:06:32.810> set
