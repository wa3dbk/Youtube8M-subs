another image with the locks on now what

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.940 
another image with the locks on now what
that<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.840> animation<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.860> when

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that is is it's the animation for when

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.740 
that is is it's the animation for when
you<00:00:50.070> wiggle<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> locks<00:00:50.730> or<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.629> know

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
you wiggle the locks or you know

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.049 
you wiggle the locks or you know
basically<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.340> how<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> describe<00:00:53.940> this

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
basically it's on how to describe this

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.549 
basically it's on how to describe this
but<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.020> locks

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
but it's the locks

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.350 
but it's the locks
it's<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.129> screen<00:00:56.370> before<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> locks<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.329> I

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it's the screen before the locks go on I

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.490 
it's the screen before the locks go on I
know<00:00:57.600> how<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> describe<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.050> perfectly<00:00:58.410> but

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
know how to describe it perfectly but

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.389 
know how to describe it perfectly but
basically<00:00:59.120> if<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.359> wasn't<00:01:00.690> there<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.399> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
basically if that wasn't there the the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.830 
basically if that wasn't there the the
box<00:01:02.609> wouldn't<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.910> able<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> wiggle<00:01:03.270> basically

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
box wouldn't be able to wiggle basically

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.690 
box wouldn't be able to wiggle basically
and<00:01:03.930> stuff<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.799> kind<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and stuff like that so it's kind of it's

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.120 
and stuff like that so it's kind of it's
that<00:01:05.909> thing<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.240> before<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.560> animation

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that thing that's before the animation

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.980 
that thing that's before the animation
just<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.939> has<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.450> there<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.840> that

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
just so that it has to be there so that

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.420 
just so that it has to be there so that
it<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.229> actually<00:01:10.260> animate<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.310> know

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
it can actually animate and you know

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.219 
it can actually animate and you know
kind<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> wiggle<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> lock<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:12.450> whatever<00:01:12.659> so

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
kind of wiggle the lock or whatever so

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
kind of wiggle the lock or whatever so
that's<00:01:13.590> not<00:01:13.890> an<00:01:14.189> actual<00:01:14.549> image<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.420> box

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that's not an actual image of the box

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.260 
that's not an actual image of the box
being<00:01:16.380> opened<00:01:16.799> that's<00:01:17.159> not<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.670> box<00:01:17.850> unlock

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
being opened that's not the box unlock

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.910 
being opened that's not the box unlock
it's<00:01:18.540> not<00:01:18.689> anything<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.799> just

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
it's not anything like that it's just

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.070 
it's not anything like that it's just
simply<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.390> know<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> picture<00:01:21.900> before

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
simply the you know the picture before

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.890 
simply the you know the picture before
the<00:01:22.500> box<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:23.759> know<00:01:23.790> has<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> locks<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.720> so

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the box you know has the locks on it so

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
the box you know has the locks on it so
for<00:01:25.409> everyone<00:01:25.680> sending<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.159> me<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.549> not

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
for everyone sending that to me it's not

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.730 
for everyone sending that to me it's not
an<00:01:27.030> actual<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:27.960> open<00:01:28.229> box<00:01:28.439> chain<00:01:28.619> like

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
an actual you know open box chain like

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.620 
an actual you know open box chain like
that<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.100> still<00:01:29.369> sealed<00:01:29.640> guys<00:01:29.909> we've<00:01:30.360> looked

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that it's still sealed guys we've looked

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.850 
that it's still sealed guys we've looked
all<00:01:30.810> through<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.049> game<00:01:31.170> files<00:01:31.350> they've

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
all through the game files they've

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.039 
all through the game files they've
actually<00:01:32.310> checked<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.850> coding<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.840> box

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
actually checked the coding for the box

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.929 
actually checked the coding for the box
and<00:01:34.320> they<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.369> shown<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.759> there's

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
and they have shown that there's

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.390 
and they have shown that there's
absolutely<00:01:36.509> no<00:01:36.900> way<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.590> opening<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.979> box<00:01:38.159> in

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
absolutely no way of opening the box in

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.249 
absolutely no way of opening the box in
its<00:01:38.549> current<00:01:38.729> state<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.780> means<00:01:40.049> is

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
its current state so what that means is

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.679

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
you think what do you guys think is

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.069 
you think what do you guys think is
inside<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> box<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.869> linked

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
inside the box is it going to be linked

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.959 
inside the box is it going to be linked
in<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.290> DLC<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.829> personally<00:02:02.670> think<00:02:02.820> this

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
in with the DLC I personally think this

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.399 
in with the DLC I personally think this
thing<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.329> linked<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.750> with<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> DLC<00:02:04.170> whatever

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
thing is linked in with the DLC whatever

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.959 
thing is linked in with the DLC whatever
it<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.560> because<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.009> said<00:02:05.219> it's<00:02:05.820> not

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
it is because like I said it's not

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:06.950 
it is because like I said it's not
possible<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> open<00:02:06.540> it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960
