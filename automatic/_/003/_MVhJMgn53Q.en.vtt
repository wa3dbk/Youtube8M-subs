 hello guys and welcome back to cavani di 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.150
 aaron manager 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.410
 today we are back in the kitchen era 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.000
 a manager wanted to show you 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.309
 quickly which are the sources of 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.570
 my favorite carbohydrates I consume 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.689
 regularly every week 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.060
 Let's start with American sweet potatoes 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.279
 these are the ones in yellow paste past 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.789
 orange but also like those a 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.289
 this so-called iamm white paste 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.080
 they are an excellent source of carbohydrates 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.690
 also really simple and fast from 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.690
 cook between potatoes are about 8 10 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.220
 800 minutes of microwave and let's say when 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.649
 I have no time to cook rice yes 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.489
 they lend very well as an excellent source of 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.899
 carbohydrates both as a pre-post but also 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.960
 as a source of carbohydrates for the 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.879
 brand you here is the inevitable rice in 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.649
 different forms this is basmati rice 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.660
 which I usually eat in post workout 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.629
 with a fruit this is always the case 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:07.420
 rice flakes that eats the place of 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.869
 of the vein with 200 milliliters of milk 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.700
 of almonds or coconut milk and these 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.700
 instead they are the mythical gallette that 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.740
 you also know these well that I eat 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.509
 usually on off days with salads 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.940
 to give an idea of ​​carbohydrates and 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.640
 amount of carbohydrates without 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.679
 to go crazy I usually eat 80 g 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.440
 of rice that correspond approximately 60 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:33.819
 grams of carbohydrates equivalent lim 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.319
 potatoes are 250 g of cooked potatoes 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:39.640
 regarding the rice flakes 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:42.429
 they are always 80 grams and then for the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.229
 biscuits you know well that they are 56 grams 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.080
 of carbohydrates per cock so you do 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.159
 I like potatoes 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.630
 especially at lunch because 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.479
 I like to experiment with spices 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.609
 so they are great with cumin 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.500
 coriander but above all with rosemary 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.159
 and a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.159
 olive 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.049
 then here we have the quinoa of which I have 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.299
 talked a lot even though you never know this is 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.979
 a pseudo-cereal therefore gluten-free 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.289
 belongs to the spinach family 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.569
 I particularly like the taste 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.660
 nutty very different from the taste if 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.000
 you want bland rice as well 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.950
 amaranth another cereal without 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.299
 gluten that has a very strong taste and 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.870
 decided that it goes very well with 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:26.180
 carrot type onion vegetables or even 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.640
 garlic and then finally the ultimate source of 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.040
 carbohydrates my favorite is undecided between 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.640
 blueberries or pineapple and I chose pineapple 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.069
 which I thank a lot in post workout and 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.930
 it is also excellent for improving the 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.560
 protein digestibility 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.989
 so this is my top five 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.870
 five sources of carbohydrates for wounds 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.000
 let me know what your e 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.209

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.209
