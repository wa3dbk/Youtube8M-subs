for about a year I don't think the

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.400 
for about a year I don't think the

software is needed actually I realize

software is needed actually I realize
now<00:00:23.650> that<00:00:23.679> all<00:00:24.130> I<00:00:24.160> need<00:00:24.400> is<00:00:24.550> something<00:00:24.880> to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
now that all I need is something to

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.120 
now that all I need is something to

indicate how well my watches are running
the<00:00:28.089> software<00:00:28.599> and<00:00:28.750> a<00:00:28.779> lot<00:00:28.900> of<00:00:28.929> the<00:00:29.080> other

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.429 
the software and a lot of the other
features<00:00:29.710> are<00:00:30.009> superfluous<00:00:30.640> for<00:00:31.089> me<00:00:31.259> all<00:00:32.259> I

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
features are superfluous for me all I

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.510 
features are superfluous for me all I
need<00:00:32.619> is<00:00:32.739> something<00:00:32.950> that<00:00:33.129> shows<00:00:33.280> me<00:00:33.489> the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
need is something that shows me the

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.520 
need is something that shows me the
actual<00:00:33.760> beats<00:00:34.120> per<00:00:34.329> hour<00:00:34.450> and<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.170> balance

actual beats per hour and the balance
wheel<00:00:35.710> amplitude<00:00:36.309> and<00:00:36.460> error<00:00:36.700> these<00:00:37.570> are<00:00:37.780> the

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
wheel amplitude and error these are the

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.900 
wheel amplitude and error these are the
only<00:00:38.020> things<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.530> rank<00:00:38.739> amateur<00:00:38.980> like<00:00:39.430> me<00:00:39.489> can

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
only things a rank amateur like me can

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.049 
only things a rank amateur like me can
mess<00:00:40.120> with<00:00:40.149> anyway<00:00:41.340> turn<00:00:42.340> on<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.579> timer<00:00:42.850> and

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
mess with anyway turn on the timer and

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.459 
mess with anyway turn on the timer and
one<00:00:43.149> of<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.329> quirky<00:00:43.690> features<00:00:43.840> is<00:00:44.230> you<00:00:44.350> have

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
one of the quirky features is you have

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.380 
one of the quirky features is you have
to<00:00:44.559> adjust<00:00:44.649> the<00:00:44.980> volume<00:00:45.370> dial<00:00:45.640> but<00:00:46.030> there's<00:00:46.239> no

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
to adjust the volume dial but there's no

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.959 
to adjust the volume dial but there's no
real<00:00:46.570> indication<00:00:46.840> of<00:00:47.320> what's<00:00:47.500> best<00:00:47.770> it<00:00:48.760> makes

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
real indication of what's best it makes

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.020 
real indication of what's best it makes
a<00:00:49.090> big<00:00:49.270> difference<00:00:49.600> in<00:00:49.719> the<00:00:49.809> readings<00:00:50.199> however

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
a big difference in the readings however

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.250 
a big difference in the readings however
the<00:00:52.030> first<00:00:52.269> thing<00:00:52.510> is<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.840> get<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.079> rate

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
the first thing is to get the rate

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.700 
the first thing is to get the rate
running<00:00:53.590> correctly<00:00:54.010> this<00:00:54.760> is<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.090> mole<00:00:55.269> nija

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
running correctly this is the mole nija

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.410 
running correctly this is the mole nija
3603<00:00:56.710> movements<00:00:57.550> so<00:00:57.699> it<00:00:57.789> should<00:00:58.000> run<00:00:58.210> at<00:00:58.390> a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
3603 movements so it should run at a

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.590 
3603 movements so it should run at a
theoretical<00:00:59.019> 18,000<00:00:59.920> beats<00:01:00.070> per<00:01:00.280> hour<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
theoretical 18,000 beats per hour the

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.240 
theoretical 18,000 beats per hour the
timer<00:01:01.870> usually<00:01:02.320> figures<00:01:02.649> out<00:01:02.859> the<00:01:03.070> rate

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
timer usually figures out the rate

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.999 
timer usually figures out the rate
correctly<00:01:03.910> beat<00:01:04.900> rates<00:01:05.170> are<00:01:05.379> fairly<00:01:05.680> standard

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
correctly beat rates are fairly standard

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.719 
correctly beat rates are fairly standard
in<00:01:06.400> watches<00:01:06.880> I<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:08.680> turn<00:01:08.860> on<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.130> sound<00:01:09.430> and

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
in watches I can turn on the sound and

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.070 
in watches I can turn on the sound and
some<00:01:09.850> other<00:01:10.000> functions<00:01:10.509> that<00:01:10.570> I<00:01:10.720> don't<00:01:10.930> really

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
some other functions that I don't really

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.710 
some other functions that I don't really
use<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.610> you<00:01:12.729> can<00:01:12.850> see<00:01:13.000> this<00:01:13.150> is<00:01:13.330> running<00:01:13.630> at

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
use so you can see this is running at

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.660 
use so you can see this is running at
about<00:01:13.780> eighteen<00:01:14.350> thousand<00:01:14.890> four<00:01:15.220> beats<00:01:15.460> per

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
about eighteen thousand four beats per

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.090 
about eighteen thousand four beats per
hour<00:01:15.880> which<00:01:16.329> is<00:01:16.479> pretty<00:01:16.540> close<00:01:16.840> actually<00:01:17.229> four

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
hour which is pretty close actually four

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.730 
hour which is pretty close actually four
beats<00:01:18.340> per<00:01:18.549> hour<00:01:18.640> over<00:01:19.030> 24<00:01:19.450> hours<00:01:19.780> is<00:01:19.960> only<00:01:20.140> 96

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
beats per hour over 24 hours is only 96

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.880 
beats per hour over 24 hours is only 96
beats<00:01:21.009> per<00:01:21.220> hour<00:01:21.340> difference<00:01:21.880> in<00:01:22.060> theory<00:01:22.890> you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
beats per hour difference in theory you

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.100 
beats per hour difference in theory you
can<00:01:24.040> see<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:24.340> this<00:01:24.490> has<00:01:24.670> about<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:25.110> 5.5

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
can see that this has about a 5.5

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.980 
can see that this has about a 5.5
millisecond<00:01:26.860> beater<00:01:27.070> which<00:01:28.060> seems<00:01:28.360> good

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
millisecond beater which seems good

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.960 
millisecond beater which seems good
I<00:01:29.020> usually<00:01:29.530> try<00:01:29.799> to<00:01:29.860> get<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.159> around<00:01:30.250> point<00:01:30.759> 1

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
I usually try to get it around point 1

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.800 
I usually try to get it around point 1
to<00:01:31.119> 0.5<00:01:31.630> if<00:01:31.930> possible<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:34.240> software<00:01:34.630> on<00:01:34.720> the

to 0.5 if possible the software on the
screen<00:01:35.110> doesn't<00:01:35.439> show<00:01:35.710> up<00:01:35.829> very<00:01:36.009> well<00:01:36.250> due<00:01:36.520> to

screen doesn't show up very well due to

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.730 
screen doesn't show up very well due to
the<00:01:36.759> video<00:01:37.000> camera<00:01:37.509> but<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.259> first<00:01:38.470> thing<00:01:38.649> you

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
the video camera but the first thing you

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.100 
the video camera but the first thing you
want<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:38.979> do<00:01:39.100> is<00:01:39.250> set<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.460> rate<00:01:39.790> I've<00:01:40.750> spent<00:01:41.079> a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
want to do is set the rate I've spent a

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.780 
want to do is set the rate I've spent a
lot<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.350> time<00:01:41.680> trying<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.159> get<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.399> software

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
lot of time trying to get the software

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.910 
lot of time trying to get the software
running<00:01:42.939> correctly<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:43.689> it<00:01:44.200> finally<00:01:44.469> gave<00:01:44.649> up

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
running correctly and it finally gave up

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.830 
running correctly and it finally gave up
it<00:01:45.250> just<00:01:45.460> seems<00:01:45.700> very<00:01:45.820> inconsistent<00:01:46.479> and

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
it just seems very inconsistent and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.389 
it just seems very inconsistent and
rarely<00:01:47.049> matches<00:01:47.590> what's<00:01:47.799> showing<00:01:48.040> me<00:01:48.250> on<00:01:48.280> the

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
rarely matches what's showing me on the

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.700 
rarely matches what's showing me on the
timer<00:01:48.820> so<00:01:49.719> I'm<00:01:49.840> not<00:01:49.960> sure<00:01:50.020> if<00:01:50.290> something<00:01:50.619> is

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
timer so I'm not sure if something is

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.139 
timer so I'm not sure if something is
wrong<00:01:50.890> with<00:01:51.070> my<00:01:51.280> understanding<00:01:51.939> or<00:01:52.119> the

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
wrong with my understanding or the

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.200 
wrong with my understanding or the
software<00:01:52.750> or<00:01:53.079> probably<00:01:53.680> both

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
software or probably both

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.670 
software or probably both
when<00:01:55.210> I<00:01:55.240> finally<00:01:55.600> ditched<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:56.079> software<00:01:56.560> and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
when I finally ditched the software and

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.929 
when I finally ditched the software and
just<00:01:56.829> started<00:01:57.100> looking<00:01:57.369> at<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.549> beats<00:01:57.729> per

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
just started looking at the beats per

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.060 
just started looking at the beats per
hour<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.509> error<00:01:58.780> rates<00:01:59.049> on<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.320> timer<00:01:59.590> itself

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
hour and error rates on the timer itself

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.690 
hour and error rates on the timer itself
I<00:02:00.340> got<00:02:00.759> much<00:02:00.969> better<00:02:01.149> results<00:02:01.719> much<00:02:01.930> quicker

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I got much better results much quicker

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.490 
I got much better results much quicker
the<00:02:03.700> software<00:02:04.149> basically<00:02:04.450> only<00:02:05.020> gives<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.469> a

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
the software basically only gives you a

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.230 
the software basically only gives you a
visual<00:02:06.039> look<00:02:06.280> at<00:02:06.490> what's<00:02:06.670> happening<00:02:07.060> on<00:02:07.210> a

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
visual look at what's happening on a

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.300 
visual look at what's happening on a
timer<00:02:07.570> but<00:02:08.470> actually<00:02:08.770> I<00:02:08.800> don't<00:02:08.890> find<00:02:09.220> that

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
timer but actually I don't find that

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.300 
timer but actually I don't find that
very<00:02:09.430> useful<00:02:10.320> by<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.410> way<00:02:11.530> if<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.740> can't<00:02:12.040> get

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
very useful by the way if you can't get

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.920 
very useful by the way if you can't get
these<00:02:12.520> less<00:02:12.790> expensive<00:02:13.300> watches

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
these less expensive watches

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.470 
these less expensive watches
better<00:02:14.260> with<00:02:14.500> just<00:02:14.769> a<00:02:14.859> timer<00:02:15.129> then<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.180> have

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
better with just a timer then you have

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.360 
better with just a timer then you have
probably<00:02:17.019> had<00:02:17.200> more<00:02:17.349> problems<00:02:17.590> related<00:02:18.340> to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
probably had more problems related to

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.610 
probably had more problems related to
servicing<00:02:19.120> lubrication<00:02:20.049> and<00:02:20.230> other<00:02:20.409> issues

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
servicing lubrication and other issues

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.420 
servicing lubrication and other issues
that<00:02:20.920> need<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.459> good<00:02:21.579> watchmakers<00:02:22.329> attention

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
that need a good watchmakers attention

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.949 
that need a good watchmakers attention
you<00:02:24.430> can<00:02:24.579> also<00:02:24.700> show<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.030> amplitude<00:02:25.659> with<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
you can also show the amplitude with the

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.959 
you can also show the amplitude with the
software<00:02:26.439> and<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.709> few<00:02:26.950> other<00:02:27.099> features<00:02:27.370> and

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
software and a few other features and

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.880 
software and a few other features and
you<00:02:28.030> can<00:02:28.060> run<00:02:28.329> it<00:02:28.420> like<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.599> paper<00:02:28.870> tape<00:02:29.170> but

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
you can run it like a paper tape but

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.410 
you can run it like a paper tape but
that<00:02:30.099> doesn't<00:02:30.430> do<00:02:30.549> much<00:02:30.730> funny<00:02:31.030> either

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
that doesn't do much funny either

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.479 
that doesn't do much funny either
okay<00:02:32.230> it's<00:02:32.379> interesting<00:02:32.889> but<00:02:33.189> for<00:02:33.219> my

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
okay it's interesting but for my

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.500 
okay it's interesting but for my
purposes<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.090> really<00:02:34.629> doesn't<00:02:34.900> tell<00:02:35.019> me<00:02:35.079> much

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
purposes it really doesn't tell me much

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.569 
purposes it really doesn't tell me much
again<00:02:37.510> back<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.019> timer<00:02:38.230> itself<00:02:38.650> really

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
again back to the timer itself really

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.369 
again back to the timer itself really
all<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.730> want<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.180> do<00:02:40.299> is<00:02:40.510> look<00:02:40.659> at<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.930> rate<00:02:41.139> and

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
all I want to do is look at the rate and

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.589 
all I want to do is look at the rate and
the<00:02:41.439> error<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.670> can<00:02:42.819> see<00:02:43.000> as<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.209> change<00:02:43.510> the

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
the error you can see as I change the

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.179 
the error you can see as I change the
position<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.409> watch<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.889> the<00:02:45.010> error

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
position of the watch that the error

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.729 
position of the watch that the error
changes<00:02:45.790> also<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:47.109> rate<00:02:47.290> changes

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
changes also and the rate changes

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.860 
changes also and the rate changes
slightly<00:02:47.950> but<00:02:48.790> actually<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.239> watch<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.720> in

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
slightly but actually this watch is in

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.550 
slightly but actually this watch is in
pretty<00:02:50.049> good<00:02:50.139> shape

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
pretty good shape

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.390 
pretty good shape
of<00:02:51.310> course<00:02:51.549> I<00:02:51.669> timed<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.120> previously<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:54.250> can

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
of course I timed it previously you can

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.009 
of course I timed it previously you can
move<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.730> watch<00:02:54.909> to<00:02:55.180> different<00:02:55.510> positions

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
move the watch to different positions

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.929 
move the watch to different positions
and<00:02:56.260> try<00:02:56.409> to<00:02:56.530> get<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.859> best<00:02:57.099> compromise<00:02:57.489> in

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
and try to get the best compromise in

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.759 
and try to get the best compromise in
all<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.180> different<00:02:58.480> positions<00:02:58.769> but

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
all the different positions but

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.679 
all the different positions but
understand<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.459> is<00:03:00.609> not<00:03:00.790> cost<00:03:01.180> timing
