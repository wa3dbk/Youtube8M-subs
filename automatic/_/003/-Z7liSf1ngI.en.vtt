so I've cleaned off the old gasket with

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.850 
so I've cleaned off the old gasket with
a<00:03:33.280> wire<00:03:33.610> wheel<00:03:34.020> which<00:03:35.020> is<00:03:35.200> just<00:03:35.440> fine

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
a wire wheel which is just fine

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.199 
a wire wheel which is just fine
I've<00:03:35.950> between<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.310> old<00:03:36.430> gasket<00:03:36.730> off<00:03:37.060> the

I've between the old gasket off the
surface<00:03:37.570> over<00:03:37.810> here<00:03:37.890> now<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:39.570> lot<00:03:40.570> of<00:03:40.690> water

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
surface over here now a lot of water

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.550 
surface over here now a lot of water
pumps<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.290> gasket<00:03:41.680> goes<00:03:41.709> on<00:03:42.070> one<00:03:42.670> way<00:03:42.850> only

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
pumps the gasket goes on one way only

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.890 
pumps the gasket goes on one way only
and<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:45.280> got<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.489> find<00:03:45.670> out<00:03:45.850> which<00:03:46.000> way<00:03:46.239> that

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
and you got to find out which way that

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.990 
and you got to find out which way that
is<00:03:47.519> so<00:03:48.519> you<00:03:48.760> spin<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.480> like<00:03:49.780> this<00:03:50.489> so<00:03:51.489> all<00:03:51.730> the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
is so you spin it like this so all the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.040 
is so you spin it like this so all the
holes<00:03:52.209> line<00:03:52.510> up<00:03:54.600> sometimes<00:03:55.600> you<00:03:55.720> may<00:03:55.840> have<00:03:55.989> to

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
holes line up sometimes you may have to

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.080 
holes line up sometimes you may have to
flip<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.590> gasket<00:03:57.010> around<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.910> other<00:03:58.030> side

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
flip the gasket around to the other side

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.390 
flip the gasket around to the other side
you<00:04:01.090> know

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
you know

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.490 
you know
figure<00:04:02.060> it<00:04:02.150> out<00:04:02.510> there<00:04:02.720> we<00:04:02.840> go<00:04:02.989> now<00:04:03.200> they<00:04:03.379> all

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
figure it out there we go now they all

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.710 
figure it out there we go now they all
lined<00:04:03.709> up<00:04:04.120> so<00:04:05.349> lift<00:04:06.349> it<00:04:06.530> off<00:04:06.650> straight<00:04:07.629> set<00:04:08.629> it

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
lined up so lift it off straight set it

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.899 
lined up so lift it off straight set it
right<00:04:08.900> beside<00:04:09.049> it<00:04:09.459> I'll<00:04:10.459> show<00:04:10.670> you<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.790> nice

it around the edge of the water pump it
doesn't<00:04:29.210> have<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.510> be<00:04:29.660> 100%<00:04:30.820> perfect<00:04:34.570> because

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
doesn't have to be 100% perfect because

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
just to hold the gasket not to actually

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.390 
just to hold the gasket not to actually
seal<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.200> obviously<00:04:49.380> helped<00:04:49.860> do<00:04:49.980> that<00:04:50.010> too

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
seal it it obviously helped do that too
