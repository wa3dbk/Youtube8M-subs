to<00:00:15.030> be<00:00:15.120> talking<00:00:15.299> about<00:00:15.540> batteries<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.560> i<00:00:16.710> just

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
to be talking about batteries and i just

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.950 
to be talking about batteries and i just
found<00:00:17.250> out<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.550> only<00:00:17.850> seventy<00:00:18.480> percent<00:00:18.690> of

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
found out that only seventy percent of

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.230 
found out that only seventy percent of
batteries<00:00:19.350> only<00:00:19.529> last<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:20.160> years<00:00:20.430> that's

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
batteries only last for years that's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.029 
batteries only last for years that's
correct<00:00:21.510> even<00:00:22.050> though<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.289> warranty<00:00:22.710> item<00:00:22.920> is

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
correct even though the warranty item is

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.320 
correct even though the warranty item is
so<00:00:23.160> much<00:00:23.279> longer<00:00:23.670> than<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.789> but<00:00:24.269> they

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
so much longer than that but they

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.550 
so much longer than that but they
typically<00:00:24.720> don't<00:00:24.810> make<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.170> there's<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> lot<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
typically don't make it there's a lot of

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.109 
typically don't make it there's a lot of
things<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:25.949> cause<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> problem<00:00:26.849> with<00:00:27.060> the

we look at this battery here this one

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.030 
we look at this battery here this one
here<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.930> already<00:01:10.350> showing<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.799> tell-tale

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
here is already showing the tell-tale

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.120 
here is already showing the tell-tale
signs<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> problem<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:13.979> see

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
signs that we have a problem we can see

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.440 
signs that we have a problem we can see
the<00:01:14.250> corrosion<00:01:14.580> forming<00:01:15.119> around<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the corrosion forming around the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.539 
the corrosion forming around the
terminals<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.680> battery<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> don't

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
terminals and this battery here I don't

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.760 
terminals and this battery here I don't
know<00:01:17.610> how<00:01:17.729> old<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:19.290> probably

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
know how old it is but it's probably

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.560 
know how old it is but it's probably
needs<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.430> looked<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.420> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
needs to have you looked at to have it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.870 
needs to have you looked at to have it
taken<00:01:21.750> care<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.049> what<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.130> will<00:01:23.250> use<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.700> some

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
taken care of what we will use is some
