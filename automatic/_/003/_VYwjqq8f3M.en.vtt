 approximately 20 thousand inhabitants 17 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.760
 years of history but there is no 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.570
 many years ago 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.769
 all started by the North Americans going 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.449
 against the wind without a handkerchief without a document 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.449
 I'm not nearly 10 in June 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.150
 the sun if it is part in crimes passed also 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.580
 guerrillas ricard our history in the 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.190
 truth it begins there in the year 1927 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.100
 when the northern businessman 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.160
 american henry ford is looking forward to 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.830
 their own plantation to be 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.900
 Amazon comes here to this region of 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.210
 valley of the tapajos and begins to put ford 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:39.640
 we've been here for about seven 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.710
 hours of boat travel is and solves 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.330
 implement this project here in the amazon 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.920
 however the project costs did not work out 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.450
 thus due to several factors 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.950
 so in the year 32 he solves it 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.260
 search for another area and can 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.790
 find belterra nearest to 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.470
 santarém 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.150
 other factors were also 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.070
 to enable them to choose 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.530
 really this place here where he gave 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.200
 continuity in the planting project 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.850
 rubber plantations from the year 1934 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.460
 it is noteworthy that our date of 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.350
 our anniversary here is 41 is 34 to 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.770
 date he can do four r 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.239
 can make the exchange the exchange of 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.650
 part of the area that he got 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.840
 initially with dylan jack was a 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.150
 million hectares with 281 thousand and 500 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.680
 hectares here then there begins the story 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.739
 Belterra in the year 34 and we can 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.970
 say so it was a yes for a lot 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.700
 people actually do people who do 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.980
 research on the subject was in the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.120
 something totally different at the time. 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.860
 amazon 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.410
 thing that had never been seen you 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.610
 have an idea the hospital that was founded 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.620
 here at retirement 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.750
 although he did not come to visit the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.040
 project or had in Brazil then 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.510
 worry about tropical diseases 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.590
 He was very afraid then. 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.540
 hospital when he founded the hospital 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.730
 took up land and was very worried about 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.110
 the health of his employees who 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.420
 send two united states 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.430
 he founded the hospital here with what 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.209
 there was better technology in that 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.709
 time 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.140
 to get an idea the hospital of 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.989
 belterra becomes even reference 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.030
 in Latin America, ie people from 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.400
 many countries here around Brazil 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.670
 here looking for land bell to do 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.160
 treatment and without actually speaking 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.580
 our nationals in general, nor people who 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.170
 came 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.490
 the southeast even that today we have 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.560
 in Europe where it has the best technology 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.210
 in terms of health in Brazil 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.250
 these people came to the beautiful land 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.690
 to make your treatment 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:38.730
 then it is in 1934 project in belterra vai 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:42.610
 until 1945 when the son of dr forró 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.530
 resolves to close the activities here in 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.860
 belterra or reasons were diverse 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.620
 also then from 45 1995 we can 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.780
 say that it was an era however 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.000
 for the history of belterra because 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.650
 was the time of decay when 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.150
 the Americans left here really was 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.220
 a time of decay that my land 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.940
 suffered everything that was done to 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.070
 try to save right this great project 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.900
 here that was spent by him by the 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.000
 Americans in about 20 million 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.640
 dollars at the time was all for water 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.200
 below the project was placed in the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.580
 federal government through the ministry of 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.519
 agriculture was not the government of the 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.169
 state in the year 1995 to create a municipality 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.030
 maybe even if we had 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.450
 talking today the concept of 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.750
 memory in my land cmb who calls him 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.390
 created for this purpose was created 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.740
 by the previous government Spanish government 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.810
 created the municipal mayor she also gives 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.419
 continuity in this work then the 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:49.390
 As of 2010, the municipal government 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.010
 the memory center with the aim of 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.570
 try to make the rescue and this is our 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.410
 work research and job work 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.190
 hard 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.350
 at least in history and material not 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.900
 only of belterra but of all 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.400
 Rubber exploration project in 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.860
 tapajós valley 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.750
 So we're here in the center of 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.330
 memory for the purpose of chatting 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.890
 with people and explain and try 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.990
 academic assistant 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.030
 This is our great job here at 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.940
 memory center looks the curiosity is 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.030
 very large compared to what was 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.880
 really the project created by a 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.930
 foreigner for retirement in the 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.510
 amazon 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.990
 so this has been our great 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.860
 attractive people have been making 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.680
 bidding on 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.240
 often for this purpose. 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.219
 of trying to know what was really 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.460
 occurs with the leaves there are reasons 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.469
 they brought the Americans to capel 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.879
 land again to my land trafford 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.819
 where it all began 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:50.439
 and it is one of the invisible attractions that 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.530
 people can see here my land is the 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:55.240
 historical center the built houses 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:58.120
 here my suit and are part of the center 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.060
 were all built with the 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.740
 models of some houses that were 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.060
 built in by 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:10.750
 united states on the skin his company is 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:14.560
 It's very much in the United States. 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.840
 then he will often build on 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.050
 state at the time in those 30 years 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.599
 several villages then it begins to 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.860
 build there in the United States 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:26.349
 municipality a small town in a 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.870
 small village called alberta 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:32.080
 it uses the same architecture as there 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.659
 of these dance alberta houses if the 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.060
 alberta village it uses the same 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:40.089
 architecture here in the village houses 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.370
 with a difference 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:44.199
 the houses there because of the cold it 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.610
 had sand put down but that 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.669
 belterra was not necessary 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.589
 but there is the architectural model is the same 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:51.789
 This is our invitation to the 

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:53.409
 people actually come and visit 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:55.990
 belterra look for a memory center 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:57.580
 politics will power without exchanging ideas is 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.190
 like I said we are here 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.719
 just for this to do is take 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.719
 this information including the material that 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:06.699
 we have there in videos on file 

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:08.469
 photo we are available
