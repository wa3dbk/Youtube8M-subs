00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.790
 today the channel how are we going to 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.219
 prepare a meringue ice cream 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.320
 I tell them that it's ice cream is of origin 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.139
 Spanish and it is one of the most 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.940
 rich we can enjoy for a taste 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.980
 authentic 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.110
 so let's see what we are going to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.880
 use some very basic ingredients and 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.290
 very simple but we will be able to 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.369
 enjoy one of the best ice cream 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:32.580
 milk 3 egg whites and grated lemon 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.830
 cinnamon and sugar with these ingredients 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.410
 let's proceed to the recipe 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.890
 we turn where we are going to create the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.300
 egg white to the point of snow and the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.739
 we let that meanwhile go 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.600
 doing we dump the milk in a saucepan and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.600
 we put the fire to the maximum 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.469
 next we will also look for the 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.469
 sugar 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.170
 the cinnamon stick and also the rabida 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.170
 lemon 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.560
 with a wooden or wooden spoon 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.170
 we are moving slowly until 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.080
 start boiling 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.640
 once it has made the first boil 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.440
 we can put out the fire and remove it 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.780
 of the heat source 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.640
 we have cast it in order to eliminate 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.040
 the remains of the lemon and also the 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.450
 cinnamon and this product we are going to pass 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.189
 cool it 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.079
 for this we are going to use a bowl a 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.970
 little bigger with cold water and with a 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.950
 little ice 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.650
 So with this simple system 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.260
 in a few minutes we will get that 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.290
 our meringue is cold and 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.020
 we have here the clear ones on the verge of snow 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.720
 then let's mix the placed and 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.400
 we will move it until we get them mixed 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.400
 the maximum possible 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.330
 the smell comes to me and I can 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.670
 to say that it is delicious 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.040
 since we have it cold in our 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.030
 refrigerator we are going to dump our 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.030
 our content 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.920
 and here we'll leave it for 10 to 20 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.030
 minutes until the ice cream has been made 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.030
 a meringue type 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.819
 better said creamy type 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.480
 and in a few minutes it will start to go up 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.940
 frozen 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.940
 or rather ice cream 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.000
 Here we are seeing that we have it 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.000
 point 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.780
 we take it out we take it out and we're going to 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.490
 use a tupper where we look 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.190
 our side 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.340
 and then we will pass it to 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.920
 freezer and let it mature as 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.050
 minimum a couple of hours or even all the 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.970
 night and here we will see the result 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.030
 final we have put him because he has 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.710
 cinnamon powder above to the present 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.710
 the ingredients and see you soon
