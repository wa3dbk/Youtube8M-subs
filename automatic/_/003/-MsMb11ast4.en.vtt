before we do actually can I just say I
don't<00:00:18.420> know<00:00:18.600> why<00:00:18.810> all<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.500> galaxy<00:00:19.920> s4<00:00:20.400> phones

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
don't know why all the galaxy s4 phones

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.480 
don't know why all the galaxy s4 phones
are<00:00:21.000> not<00:00:21.119> active<00:00:21.689> or<00:00:21.960> rugged<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.619> some<00:00:22.890> way<00:00:23.070> I

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
are not active or rugged in some way I

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.040 
are not active or rugged in some way I
don't<00:00:23.760> know<00:00:24.119> why<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.420> need<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.720> different

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
don't know why you need a different

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.839 
don't know why you need a different
version<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.830> phone<00:00:26.010> that's<00:00:26.250> more<00:00:26.490> dust

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
version of a phone that's more dust

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.120 
version of a phone that's more dust
proof<00:00:27.180> drop<00:00:27.570> true<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.050> waterproof<00:00:28.529> since

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
proof drop true for waterproof since

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.490 
proof drop true for waterproof since
it's<00:00:29.429> been<00:00:29.609> my<00:00:29.789> experience<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.359> all<00:00:31.109> phones

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
it's been my experience that all phones

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.560 
it's been my experience that all phones
could<00:00:31.859> benefit<00:00:32.219> from<00:00:32.279> being<00:00:32.669> dustproof<00:00:33.239> drop

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
could benefit from being dustproof drop

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.470 
could benefit from being dustproof drop
proof<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.989> waterproof<00:00:34.250> nevertheless<00:00:35.480> just

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
proof and waterproof nevertheless just

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.080 
proof and waterproof nevertheless just
gets<00:00:36.780> by<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.200> slightly<00:00:37.530> different<00:00:37.800> version<00:00:38.160> if

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
gets by a slightly different version if

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.000 
gets by a slightly different version if
you<00:00:39.239> want<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.719> stand<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:40.829> everyday

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
you want it to stand up to your everyday

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.700 
you want it to stand up to your everyday
life<00:00:41.960> rant<00:00:42.960> over<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.989> know<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.320> packaging

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
life rant over you know this packaging

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.270 
life rant over you know this packaging
right<00:00:46.920> yeah<00:00:47.719> I'm<00:00:48.719> kind<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:48.989> over<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:50.360> there<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
right yeah I'm kind of over it there is

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.970 
right yeah I'm kind of over it there is
quad-core<00:00:53.280> CPU<00:00:54.440> etc<00:00:55.440> etc<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.940> box<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.980> now

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
quad-core CPU etc etc the box here now

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.290 
quad-core CPU etc etc the box here now
even<00:00:59.489> though<00:00:59.670> it's<00:00:59.940> slightly<00:01:00.149> more

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
even though it's slightly more

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.569 
even though it's slightly more
ruggedized<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.140> actually<00:01:01.469> doesn't<00:01:01.649> feel<00:01:02.219> much

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
ruggedized it actually doesn't feel much

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.119 
ruggedized it actually doesn't feel much
larger<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.690> heavier<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:04.170> are<00:01:04.320> some<00:01:04.739> slight

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
larger and heavier there are some slight

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.590 
larger and heavier there are some slight
physical<00:01:05.640> differences<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.240> we'll<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
physical differences that we'll get to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600 
physical differences that we'll get to
in<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> little<00:01:06.780> bit<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:08.100> basically<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
in a little bit but it's basically the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.770 
in a little bit but it's basically the
same<00:01:08.760> sleek<00:01:09.390> thin<00:01:09.960> design<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.979> regular<00:01:11.310> s4

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
same sleek thin design as the regular s4

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.600 
same sleek thin design as the regular s4
or<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> s4<00:01:13.229> mini<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:13.650> whichever<00:01:13.920> s4<00:01:14.430> you

been<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.180> lot<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> different<00:01:37.140> tests<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
been a lot of different tests of the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.499 
been a lot of different tests of the
waterproofness<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.000> camera<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.420> we

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
waterproofness of this camera and we

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.929 
waterproofness of this camera and we
will<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.720> course<00:01:39.750> connect<00:01:40.259> our<00:01:40.409> own

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
will of course connect our own

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.480 
will of course connect our own
but<00:01:41.939> spoiler<00:01:42.469> sounds<00:01:43.469> like<00:01:43.649> although<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.369> can

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
but spoiler sounds like although it can

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.969 
but spoiler sounds like although it can
take<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> splash<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.710> dunking<00:01:46.710> might<00:01:46.859> be

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
take a splash a dunking might be

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.950 
take a splash a dunking might be
slightly<00:01:47.250> more<00:01:47.460> questionable<00:01:50.689> okay<00:01:51.689> soft

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
slightly more questionable okay soft

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.419 
slightly more questionable okay soft
slightly<00:01:52.289> different<00:01:52.860> design<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
slightly different design and then you

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:54.620 
slightly different design and then you
can<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.939> there's<00:01:54.119> sort<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
can see that there's sort of like a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.609 
can see that there's sort of like a
rubberized<00:01:56.149> steel<00:01:57.149> all<00:01:57.840> around<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.289> inside

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
rubberized steel all around the inside

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.580 
rubberized steel all around the inside
of<00:01:58.679> that<00:01:58.890> back<00:01:59.069> case<00:01:59.340> there<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:01.020> looks<00:02:01.380> a

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
of that back case there it looks a

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.309 
of that back case there it looks a
little<00:02:01.679> tougher<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.340> inside<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:09.049> will<00:02:10.049> say

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
little tougher on the inside I will say

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.839 
little tougher on the inside I will say
that<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:10.979> those<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.340> who<00:02:11.459> complain<00:02:11.819> that

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
that for those of you who complain that

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.699 
that for those of you who complain that
the<00:02:12.209> expo<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.810> Galaxy<00:02:13.170> line<00:02:13.200> are<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> little

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
liked the kind of brushed aluminum look

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.440 
liked the kind of brushed aluminum look
of<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.069> compared<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.579> something<00:02:44.850> like<00:02:44.970> now

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450
