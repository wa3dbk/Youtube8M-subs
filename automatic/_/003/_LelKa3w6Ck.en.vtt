00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
or PSP you have a piece constructed of

or PSP you have a piece constructed of
four<00:00:37.530> different<00:00:37.710> shapes<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.640> fall<00:00:39.000> down<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
four different shapes that fall down I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.270 
four different shapes that fall down I
mean<00:00:40.079> there's<00:00:40.230> actually<00:00:40.530> only<00:00:40.559> two<00:00:40.890> kinds<00:00:41.100> of

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
mean there's actually only two kinds of

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.920 
mean there's actually only two kinds of
shapes<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:41.969> got<00:00:42.120> four<00:00:42.450> little<00:00:42.690> blocks

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
shapes but it's got four little blocks

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.540 
shapes but it's got four little blocks
there<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.010> objective<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.360> match

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
there and the objective is to match

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.060 
there and the objective is to match
squares<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.660> single<00:00:49.050> shape<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
squares of a single shape so you have to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.060 
squares of a single shape so you have to
have<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> two<00:00:50.550> by<00:00:50.760> two<00:00:50.789> shape<00:00:54.739> controls<00:00:55.739> take<00:00:55.980> me

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
have a two by two shape controls take me

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:05.009 
have a two by two shape controls take me
a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.280> while<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:56.789> used<00:00:57.030> to

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.080 

you<00:01:05.619> can<00:01:05.770> rotate<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.399> piece<00:01:06.789> in<00:01:06.939> either

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
you can rotate the piece in either

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.870 
you can rotate the piece in either
direction<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:08.500> we<00:01:08.619> go<00:01:08.799> you<00:01:09.520> can<00:01:09.640> drop<00:01:09.820> it

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
direction there we go you can drop it

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.389 
direction there we go you can drop it
straight<00:01:10.149> down<00:01:10.390> when<00:01:10.659> you're<00:01:10.810> ready<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:12.369> we

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
straight down when you're ready here we

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:13.740 
straight down when you're ready here we
go<00:01:12.490> I'm<00:01:12.789> going<00:01:12.909> to<00:01:13.000> drop<00:01:13.149> this<00:01:13.329> straight<00:01:13.570> down

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
go I'm going to drop this straight down

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.740 
go I'm going to drop this straight down
and<00:01:14.229> now<00:01:14.860> when<00:01:15.039> this<00:01:15.159> line<00:01:15.429> goes<00:01:15.880> past<00:01:16.179> it<00:01:16.450> it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
and now when this line goes past it it

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.630 
and now when this line goes past it it
will<00:01:17.140> clear<00:01:17.409> it<00:01:17.560> so<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.890> more<00:01:18.069> things<00:01:18.310> you<00:01:18.429> can

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
will clear it so the more things you can

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.709 
will clear it so the more things you can
have<00:01:19.140> built<00:01:20.729> when<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:21.880> line<00:01:22.090> comes<00:01:22.420> through

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
have built when that line comes through

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.800 
have built when that line comes through
the<00:01:23.590> more<00:01:23.950> points<00:01:24.250> you'll<00:01:24.429> get<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:25.689> the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
the more points you'll get for the

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.240 
the more points you'll get for the
matches

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.160 

I<00:01:32.340> think<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> controls<00:01:33.510> could<00:01:33.750> use<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> little

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
I think the controls could use a little

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.900 
I think the controls could use a little
bit<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.410> improvement<00:01:34.620> you<00:01:35.370> know<00:01:35.490> I'd<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.790> to

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
bit of improvement you know I'd like to

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.520 
bit of improvement you know I'd like to
have<00:01:36.030> more<00:01:36.210> room<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:37.080> which<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.320> actually

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
have more room with which to actually

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
have more room with which to actually
press<00:01:38.190> left<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.700> right<00:01:40.880> but<00:01:41.880> they're<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.210> as

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
press left and right but they're not as

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.690 
press left and right but they're not as
big<00:01:42.660> a<00:01:42.690> deal<00:01:42.780> as<00:01:43.020> I'm<00:01:43.560> making<00:01:43.770> them<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.610> be

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
big a deal as I'm making them out to be

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.780 
big a deal as I'm making them out to be
in<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.940> video<00:01:45.979> it's<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.340> little<00:01:47.490> awkward

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
in this video it's just a little awkward

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.330 
in this video it's just a little awkward
to<00:01:49.280> play<00:01:50.280> from<00:01:50.490> behind<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.850> camera<00:01:55.100> there<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.220> go

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
to play from behind a camera there we go

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
to play from behind a camera there we go
so<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.550> have<00:01:56.640> made<00:01:56.760> an<00:01:56.880> interesting<00:01:57.060> little

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
so you have made an interesting little

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.719 
so you have made an interesting little
shape<00:01:57.660> there<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.890> got<00:01:59.070> me<00:01:59.100> more<00:01:59.369> points

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
shape there and that got me more points

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.120 
shape there and that got me more points
you<00:02:02.810> got<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.960> tempo<00:02:04.380> meter<00:02:04.590> thing<00:02:04.890> down<00:02:05.100> here

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
you got this tempo meter thing down here

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.190 
you got this tempo meter thing down here
if<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.970> drop<00:02:06.210> things<00:02:06.420> right<00:02:06.840> when<00:02:06.990> those

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
if you drop things right when those

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.120 
if you drop things right when those
lines<00:02:08.130> hit<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> bottom<00:02:09.290> that<00:02:10.290> charges<00:02:10.950> up

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
lines hit the bottom that charges up

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.780 
lines hit the bottom that charges up
your<00:02:11.780> special<00:02:12.860> items<00:02:13.860> up<00:02:14.040> here<00:02:14.220> let's<00:02:14.430> use<00:02:14.580> one

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
switch ok now this item lets me place

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.000 
switch ok now this item lets me place
the<00:02:22.820> shape<00:02:23.820> at<00:02:24.060> my<00:02:24.239> leisure<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.680> wherever<00:02:25.860> I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the shape at my leisure just wherever I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.210 
the shape at my leisure just wherever I
want<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:27.030> then<00:02:27.150> ran<00:02:28.110> press<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.890> drop<00:02:29.100> it

just charge up over time the more useful
ones<00:02:35.190> they<00:02:35.430> require<00:02:36.060> more<00:02:37.019> matches<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.830> charge

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
ones they require more matches to charge

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.729 
ones they require more matches to charge
up<00:02:40.820> you<00:02:41.820> can<00:02:41.970> see<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.390> next<00:02:42.780> few<00:02:43.080> pieces<00:02:43.500> that
