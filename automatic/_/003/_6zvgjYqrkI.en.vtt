00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 what contradictory images that are 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.640
 coming to the Arab world 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.309
 yesterday between these last 48 hours party 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.230
 impressive in the cairo in the square 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.330
 tahrir some say as more than 2 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.309
 millions of people in all egypt the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.680
 people went out into the streets and on the other 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.500
 repression side in Libya some agencies 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.150
 internationals say more than 80 dead 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.730
 repression in yemen repression in bahrain 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.189
 today manifestation prohibited in Algeria 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.099
 with repression tomorrow a call to 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.289
 demonstrations in morocco there are many 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.710
 movements and in cairo two million 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.149
 of people celebrating but also 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.920
 reminding the military junta that he did 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.350
 promises and that you have to fulfill them 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.550
 which as it is is a celebration but 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.460
 it's also somehow pressure 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.690
 social that seems fundamental to me 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.460
 that there is no motion, do not miss that 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.440
 it is important a step step towards the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.059
 democracy has been left egypt if that 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.180
 revolutionary fervor that is clear that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.739
 continues maybe now the focus of the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.559
 large media outlets are not 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.439
 posts in egypt because the tahrir square 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.489
 it is not taken as it was for 18 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.920
 days 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.149
 It is clear that what you said about 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.189
 fact there are claims of 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.600
 workers an interesting aspect that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.460
 it was mentioned maybe pretty little 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.710
 Regarding how important were the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.080
 takings of factories by the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.759
 workers especially the industry 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.860
 textile that are also continuing with 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.799
 the claims like everyone is 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.390
 encourage no more interesting risk is 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.399
 who thought asking for the resignation of 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.110
 prime minister who is the uncle of the king and 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.270
 now the end of the monarchy is activated 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.700
 that I decide to ask with much 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.860
 mobilization a lot of repression obviously 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.560
 we are seeing as an answer and the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.630
 question is whether how many of these 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.069
 monarchies or governments are seen in 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.080
 situation of instability versus 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.730
 these from egyptian background 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.510
 obviously 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.220
 very very close and everyone also with the 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.870
 expectations may have change 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.760
 politician look I think the answer 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.280
 is in what happened in first in tunisia 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.640
 they all said tunis is a case 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.550
 exceptional middle class be educated very 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.770
 near europe a lot of contact the level 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.570
 university higher in the rest is not going 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.170
 to happen after it happened in egypt 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.580
 which is also the most important country I 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.500
 I think everyone is afraid that it happens to them 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.000
 and they do not know where and they do not know how it goes 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.800
 to finish not and do not know how we have 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.300
 because the realities are very 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.130
 different the claim is to lower 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.720
 in they are different that they will be able to arabia 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.760
 Saudi Arabia, there may be Morocco 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.140
 there may be in Algeria but to me 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.410
 judgment the fundamentals that lost 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.270
 fear that fear that was to come out to 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.920
 the streets in almost every country 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.050
 Arabs and that in the unconscious 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.340
 collective figured you can not get out 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.350
 because repression can not speak 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.230
 because this is so you can not criticize 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.350
 because you are imprisoned now once you 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.940
 those doors open those gates and the 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.620
 people start going out to protest at 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.150
 claiming it seems to me that it does not have 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.459
 limits now it's interesting to note 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.670
 also the confusion, let's say, of the USA 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.290
 and from europe 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.849
 United States of America very worried 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.799
 for ugly queen there sits on the 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.599
 fifth army fleet that dominates 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.939
 the whole region the whole area of the gulf 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.459
 fundamental Persian strategy 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.079
 American military and also Djibouti 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.670
 in Djibouti there are places that 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.500
 practically they exist because there are 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.760
 military bases let's say there are the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.010
 Americans who are the foundations 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.079
 they live quietly because they walk around 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.750
 the city that is to say are the very small 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.190
 that are practically living because 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.109
 there are bases and then this 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.299
 destabilization really is very 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.040
 dangerous if one imagines besides the 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.290
 bewilderment in the face of this interrelation 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.970
 among the popular mobilizations is 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.799
 this contagion effect that is actually 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.720
 more than a contagious effect because it is 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.139
 get involved also in what happens 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.519
 to the other within the Arab world and 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.620
 react this as Pedro said 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.750
 losing the iaj there's an element that to 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.519
 my judgment is going to be important if it happens 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.440
 still did not happen 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.420
 the Palestinians did not take to the streets 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.120
 against the Israeli occupation of 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.489
 peaceful way imitating what happened in 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.560
 Tunisia and in Egypt because a lot of talk 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.650
 of authoritarian regimes and 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.299
 repressive that are 20 30 40 years ago 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.439
 Israel occupies West Bank the fringe of 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:08.150
 Gaza 43 years ago and the Palestinians 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.829
 they demand independence that they do not give yesterday 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.110
 Security Council 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.220
 again wanted to leave with the resolution 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.019
 against the expansion of the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.500
 Israeli settlements 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.000
 America vetoed it and this for me is a 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.060
 catalyst element importer that of 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.729
 15 countries that make up the council or 14 a 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.740
 please this request was endorsed by 130 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.389
 countries the only country that veto us 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.030
 states with the veto power that has 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.280
 but it is already a very strong signal because 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.100
 and the Palestinians said they are going to 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.330
 review what will be the way to 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.280
 the peace agreement 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.320
 they are like strengthening us and they are going to be 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.789
 united states and thousands of Palestinians 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.440
 they put on the street in front of the tanks 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.360
 Israelis and Israeli tanks pass 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.050
 above them 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.479
 the problem with peace problems inside 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.750
 of this complex program that is the 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.750
 world
