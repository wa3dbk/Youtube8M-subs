00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.469
 hello how good are we today 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.050
 present the box par excellence of the 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.090
 superior musicality overwhelms rust 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.620
 It has different measures but I think 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.200
 that the most widespread was most used in 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.730
 the 1800 the same cent is also a 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.550
 a very good answer the two half 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.909
 mine but I think the 1800 is the most 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.919
 used by all I have in this case 22 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:24.800
 they sing like I have tiles here but 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.720
 all are 2,800 different models and 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.179
 the 2000 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.859
 let's try this house first you will 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.280
 finished plan white and possibly that 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.210
 is painted and this girl who is 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.510
 mounted is an oar 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.420
 forgiveness in strike and patch by turner 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.030
 from below is a ballester so in games 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.489
 wii a patch at least infinite is 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.219
 very consolidated hand brighter than 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.710
 more serious a serious response and in 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.360
 against we are with the bright sound 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.610
 the machine that we have used is thrown away 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.739
 tip of the iphone so that rivals very 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.449
 well on the patch and Slavic that 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.449
 also very very rooms on the boxes 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.090
 because let 's say it 's much more more 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.490
 thought in gear 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.200
 prepare much better when you are more thought 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.490
 and it gives a much sharper touch to make 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.490
 finite finite double finite 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.729
 you can open the box then the drumsticks 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.760
 the josue we use, let's say 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.230
 all so poor and we're going to try on 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:58.310
 the box that such a response has been a 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.310
 little more serious do not you repair 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.500
 but it also goes very well of course 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.530
 let's try to study classics 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.360
 more acute 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.349
 evidently this box with been that so 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.890
 serious to do paquetazos is 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.890
 spectacular 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.920
 and with little pressure we see 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.659
 this box that also particularly me 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.659
 fascinates I love 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.400
 and we also have my house 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.660
 partner in this case I take it 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.320
 also very nice personalized 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.150
 with double patch or stroke the number 3 of 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.630
 rowing is a patch of a layer of 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.660
 millimeters 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.020
 and it has a spectacular response to 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.360
 regular is very easy is very thought and 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.560
 it gives a much sharper sound than the other 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.560
 my partner's patch 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:41.000
 front of the different answers already 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.740
 Lorraine as more food 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.450
 to make double finite finitude and flame 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.450
 the attention then stands out a lot 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.590
 they have some very powerful very thin is 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.810
 a patch that I did not know and it would be my 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.800
 partner and the truth that impressive 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.800
 we will see another demo 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.459
 but josÃ© sharp 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.189
 closed with different foam 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.440
 we go to the trianas that appear 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.580
 and model that my partner uses a lot 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.360
 it is a model reported in buying 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.669
 in tobarra more short with the tip 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.469
 completely round that we get 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.770
 congratulated that it is because it has double 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:12.219
 infinity as it takes off very fast is very 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.219
 easy regular 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:35.169
 the box is also a one-tone rate 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:37.629
 more serious but this patch gives a tone 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:41.349
 serious and at the same time finished with this 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:45.719
 patch and we have the other option very 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:45.719
 good also the claw of 1800 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.330
 let's try all these drumsticks 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.880
 now it 's a spectacular bass drumstick 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.490
 my point of view lacked nothing in the middle 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.370
 traumatic center a short curtain but 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.610
 but good to be fully ready 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.560
 round 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.509
 I like it much more than let's say 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.509
 classic that we have I think all 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.250
 we find more stretched is very easy to 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.479
 bounce 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.009
 good guys I think with this video and 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.080
 especially people who have doubts 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.120
 what patch we put on there are many more 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.879
 patches of course, of course, but 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.789
 I only have this rod here I have 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:32.150
 another box in which he used I have 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.069
 lost couple of rod easy to lose 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.680
 time 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:40.460
 there is also the box, let's say in your 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:46.479
 normal color version 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:49.729
 and well I hope the patch 800 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:52.220
 we will march from oil layer to a 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:55.370
 layer or two layers can be mounted 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.800
 accounting of the oil patch like my 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:02.720
 partner or let's just say up 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.120
 the shake by numbers in different 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.919
 measurements 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.100
 well it's likely if it's me and then 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.100
 Thank you
