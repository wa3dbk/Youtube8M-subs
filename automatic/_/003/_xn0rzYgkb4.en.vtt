character<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.609> hoping<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:26.939> something<00:00:27.240> a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
character I was hoping for something a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.669 
character I was hoping for something a
little<00:00:27.510> bit<00:00:27.689> more<00:00:27.810> interesting<00:00:28.109> regarding

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 
little bit more interesting regarding

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.140 
little bit more interesting regarding
the<00:00:28.740> story<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.279> i<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.519> maybe<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:30.029> could

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the story so i was like maybe it could

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.849 
the story so i was like maybe it could
be<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.420> or<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.230> ultimately<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.800> was

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
be this or that but ultimately it was

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.770 
be this or that but ultimately it was
just<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.160> creative<00:00:32.340> character<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.180> i<00:00:33.600> guess

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
just a creative character and i guess

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.240 
just a creative character and i guess
it's<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.080> within<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> story<00:00:34.680> now<00:00:34.860> it's

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
it's going within the story now it's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.860 
it's going within the story now it's
kind<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.550> funny<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:35.970> if<00:00:36.330> you<00:00:36.449> watch<00:00:36.629> my

Dragon Ball fighters are cool but I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.889 
Dragon Ball fighters are cool but I

something set up as an MMORPG with the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.150 
something set up as an MMORPG with the
graphics<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.050> has<00:01:01.199> maybe<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.710> tweak<00:01:01.949> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160

ultimately they're not doing that but

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
ultimately they're not doing that but
they<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.539> stripping<00:01:07.070> concepts<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.250> ideas

in the Dragon Ball universe so that's in
here<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.060> well<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.450> another<00:01:24.690> thing<00:01:24.959> was<00:01:25.170> in

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
races at this particular point because

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.160 
races at this particular point because
it<00:01:29.250> will<00:01:29.429> set<00:01:29.670> way<00:01:29.880> distance<00:01:30.509> into<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.929> future

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
it will set way distance into the future

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.529 
it will set way distance into the future
and<00:01:31.500> there<00:01:31.800> was<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.130> margin<00:01:32.880> race<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539

namekian race and the human race and
that's<00:01:36.509> what<00:01:36.810> seemingly<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.500> game<00:01:37.709> is<00:01:37.830> going

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that's what seemingly this game is going

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.740 
that's what seemingly this game is going
to<00:01:38.039> be<00:01:38.099> implementing<00:01:38.789> as<00:01:38.940> well<00:01:39.209> because<00:01:39.599> in

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
I'm curious if it's going to implement

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.130 
I'm curious if it's going to implement
other<00:01:53.399> aspects<00:01:54.179> as<00:01:54.270> well<00:01:54.300> like<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> humans

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
after you train a certain point they can

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.580 
after you train a certain point they can
go<00:01:56.940> super<00:01:57.360> saiyan<00:01:57.539> it's<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:57.959> there's<00:01:58.319> a<00:01:58.410> lot

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
go super saiyan it's like there's a lot

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.779 
go super saiyan it's like there's a lot
of<00:01:58.619> interesting<00:01:59.130> things<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.429> they<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.550> do

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
of interesting things that they can do

of interesting things that they can do
and<00:01:59.970> while<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.239> still<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.450> little<00:02:00.630> bit

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
and while it's still a little bit

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.300 
and while it's still a little bit

excited and then pretty disappointed

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.200

with<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.950> character<00:02:17.280> customization

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
with the character customization

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.300 
with the character customization
it<00:02:18.330> was<00:02:18.480> very<00:02:18.510> stripped<00:02:19.080> down<00:02:19.230> there<00:02:19.680> was<00:02:19.830> very

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
it was very stripped down there was very

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.950 
it was very stripped down there was very
minimal<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.850> could<00:02:21.000> do<00:02:21.150> with<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.660> one<00:02:21.870> I'm

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960

character customization I hope they put
a<00:02:26.700> lot<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:26.970> time<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.570> effort<00:02:27.750> into<00:02:28.080> this

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320
