dirty on it's got full battery Wow I
like<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:36.450> okay<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.860> I'm<00:02:39.519> usually<00:02:39.730> iPhone<00:02:40.180> 5<00:02:40.420> so

I<00:02:40.930> think<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:42.070> usually<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:43.030> problems<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:43.630> the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
I think that usually the problems on the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.150 
I think that usually the problems on the
side<00:02:43.959> button<00:02:44.350> it's<00:02:44.590> actually<00:02:44.890> on<00:02:44.980> this<00:02:45.100> side

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
side button it's actually on this side

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.470 
side button it's actually on this side
so<00:02:45.489> it's<00:02:45.580> gonna<00:02:45.730> take<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.940> while<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.120> get<00:02:46.420> used

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
so it's gonna take a while to get used

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.330 
so it's gonna take a while to get used
to<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.350> actually<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:47.769> very<00:02:48.010> good
