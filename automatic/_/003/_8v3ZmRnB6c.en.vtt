00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.599
 I finally can sign my vi 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.599
 I put my Tina mother 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.599
 no 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.149
 wise welcome to n read me and i am 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.329
 always niche hd and today I'm here after 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.610
 a small sketch to show you a case 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.550
 really exclusive i think this is 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.920
 the first Italian review of this 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.610
 case or at least of this aversion today 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.220
 we see the big bang fandom micro on the right in 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.649
 nvidia edition in fact you see 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.590
 that this that has a peculiarity that is 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.869
 it is plastered with logos of the house 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.470
 manufacturer of video cards of course 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.450
 we really have an exclusive look because 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.240
 you can't find this look in 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.009
 no other cayce bitfenix and nvidia 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.770
 have renewed this collaboration 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.590
 that in past years he had seen point 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.110
 bitfenix produce a version of the pro 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.259
 dc developed but this year 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.479
 nvidia has decided to adopt the fandom 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.159
 as reference houses 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.530
 obviously this case is of size 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.619
 really very small what that is 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.860
 possible that increases the chances of 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.739
 use both as a console as a PC gamer 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.030
 both as a PC able to beat the 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:58.140
 console because obviously with the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.300
 small size and can be put 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.800
 this computer maybe in the room rather 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.959
 that above his desk in fact 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.510
 because it weighs little and is of size 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.370
 very small 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.040
 but no more talk and we look at that 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.440
 which is the real that if you see that beyond 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.140
 that to printed logos we find some 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.630
 beautiful of the beautiful scalps where exactly 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.580
 we have the logo or the g force 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.710
 video card manufacturer 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.540
 obviously this kaiser nom is not 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.970
 I advise everyone because more cards 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.550
 competition video and useless 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.730
 in this case, however, if you are a fan 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.260
 envy I advise you to take it 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.600
 into consideration because it really is a 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.550
 case that allows a note with the 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.890
 ATIES micro motherboard allows 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.480
 install up to a video card slide 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.490
 so if you can put two 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.010
 geforce in s alive 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.870
 beyond all this is a kers who has 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.910
 truly a million possibilities 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.100
 because it allows you to create your own 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.040
 inside liquid cooling systems 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.290
 and obviously cooling systems 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.910
 air because thanks precisely to the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.940
 reflow the excellent air enterprises that 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.290
 we find is really very easy 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.000
 install or are the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.209
 temperatures inside are very 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.040
 good here before talking about those 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.480
 which are all pro I would like to tell you the only one 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.550
 against me I am not a great lover 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.920
 of micro atx and hicks motherboards 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.270
 because obviously and making one 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.860
 micro atx motherboard and hicks 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.350
 using a micro atx and motherboard 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.840
 hicks in a house so small you say 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.640
 that there is a bit of cable management 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.680
 this does not mean that it cannot be done but 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.920
 you have to be a little more careful and a little 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.200
 more precise in doing so then see that 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.600
 in the right bulkhead we find these 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.470
 really beautiful scalps with this logo 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.660
 where there is written ready nvidia geforce 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.330
 gtx which is the name of the cards 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.910
 gaming video produces 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.490
 nvidia as I told you before this 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.540
 kayser offers really good qualities 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.830
 excellent performance in terms of ventilation 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.820
 inside the cabinet precisely because 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.230
 thanks to this this 240mm hole 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.950
 because it allows you to install 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.390
 also with 240 mm radiators in the air 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.150
 inside the case it really is 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.640
 exceptional above all the system that 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.250
 allows the exchange between hot air and 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.530
 cold air is really good in the 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.700
 the lower part we find the position 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.920
 to insert a 230 mm fan 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.530
 therefore a nice wind lot that allows 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.110
 to draw in fresh air from the bottom e 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.000
 then throw it inside the face 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.060
 obviously everything is protected by a 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.610
 large filter that allows you to hold back 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.280
 to bring in the area but hold on 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.470
 the dust thing that is very good because 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.200
 maybe in a system that comes 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.940
 placed in the living room on the desk 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.620
 change and clean all computers 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.960
 sometimes it's a bit of a shake instead 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.880
 thanks to the filter you can not do it 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.300
 this thing or at least not do it too many 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.220
 times 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.650
 as regards the panel instead 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.040
 front you see that in this finish 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.140
 matte black beige black that makes it 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.700
 It seems really soft to the touch 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.460
 feeling is very good 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.750
 plus I must say that those that 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.840
 I can what the can be 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.680
 feedback from fingerprints is not gods 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.230
 worse 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.450
 obviously being built in anyway 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.210
 aluminum you see above all in his 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.130
 inside you can see some fingerprints though 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.560
 obviously guys of themes a case that 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.630
 in fact it is not subject to this type of 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.370
 problem, however, obviously in the part 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.919
 frontal precisely where we find the mash 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.410
 dull black this problem does not occur 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.840
 proposes because precisely the matte black 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.820
 almost makes the fingerprints invisible 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.160
 as regards instead the 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.169
 boys availability of this gates 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.020
 well indiscretion you will find everything 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.400
 I really thank very much next Italy and in 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.640
 b of Italy for having given me the 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.979
 possibility to show you this cage e 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.870
 obviously this houses and since to me 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.910
 they showed the kids next is 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.220
 available only there 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.030
 description you will find both links to 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.530
 configurations that they already implement 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.690
 pre-installed is the possibility of 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.840
 buy it individually then buy 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.640
 only the houses and then they built some 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.780
 you for the facts vox I remind you that 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.660
 this case is really a case of one 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.030
 cabinet that supports micro atx of hicks 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.980
 then you can make a sli 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:22.660
 video cards you see that in this case 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:24.790
 the computer is pushed by a gtx 760 between 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.920
 you will soon see that we now see that 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.530
 this games behaves very well and is 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.620
 very useful for the lanparty indeed I 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.740
 I used it in the black hole that is 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.750
 next lan in lan party room 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.640
 via procaccini in Milan this salt 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.780
 really cool because it's possible 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.970
 rent it to create lan party e 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.740
 above all it is illuminated by uv lamps 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.470
 which really makes the atmosphere 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:55.240
 very beautiful and very bad of course 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:58.450
 every computer in the black hole is pushed e 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.250
 run by a geforce gtx thing 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.010
 which allows you to run even 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:05.110
 latest games to the fullest in the details 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.730
 guys, I invite you if you do 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.350

 description because you will find them really 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.500
 all the information you have 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.080
 need 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.240
 obviously this houses as I told you 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.850
 first sold both separately and 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.500
 configurations already installed in 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.150
 description however you will find everything 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.800
 you will also find my facebook page
