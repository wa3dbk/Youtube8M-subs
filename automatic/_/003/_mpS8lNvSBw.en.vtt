00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:14.969
 Let's lighten the skin and make it an attractive photo 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.969
 Thank you in advance for your suit 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.350
 ben 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.440
 Let's finish it to an attractive portrait 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.970
 Duplicate the background layer 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.160
 Drag it 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:36.670
 On a new nerve or create button 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:43.390
 Drag and make a copy If you want to slightly blur the layer above 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:48.670
 I think this picture is clearly seen around, so slightly blur around this 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:51.910
 I think I want to highlight the middle person a little 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.790
 From the filter Bokashi 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.950
 Bokashi chooses thin 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:04.059
 I will move the window for a moment 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:09.909
 If you drag this slider that was on the photo 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:17.590
 You can see that it blurs a little 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:22.670
 It's a bit unnatural, so it 's a little bit blurred behind the photo 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.580
 Please refer to the adjustment to the numerical value of about say just be nice 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.760
 Yes 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.930
 People will be blurred together, but this time I do not mind 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:39.320
 If it is ok, keep pressing the ok button as it is 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:40.670
 The upper layer is completely covered and the lower layer is not covered with candy 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.430
 It has become 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:53.300
 Switch the display of the layer for a moment and check 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:56.280
 Next , erase the part of the person of the layer which has been changed to the layer below with the eraser. 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.700
 I think that I want to display it 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:06.119
 Select Tool Eraser Tool 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:11.069
 If you set this too large to fit the size of the person 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.200
 I will erase according to the shape of the person a little 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:20.959
 Here too 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.959
 There are tints and pressure, so check this and let's operate 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.500
 I firmly trace the place I do not want to bokashi 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.130
 Yes, hide the layer below this little bit of what it looks like 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.580
 When 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.470
 It is supposed not to come 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.150
 Yes there is a place I want to show clearly here a little more 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.250
 like 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.460
 A little 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.460
 Move and adjust the pen 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.610
 View and check the layers below 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:04.050
 The original picture is in this form 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:08.280
 By blurring and putting up a house this time while the surroundings are clearly seen 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.640
 The person is outstanding and finished in an attractive photo 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.290
 Then I want to adjust the brightness 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.860
 Select Brightness Contrast from the Adjustment Layer 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:24.060
 Brightness 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.060
 Also leave a little raised contrast to raise a little 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:33.330
 It is a bit of adjustment now more much attractive photos in this 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.790
 The 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:47.180
 It was lightened overall and the skin was clean 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.180
 Please try to challenge everyone too
