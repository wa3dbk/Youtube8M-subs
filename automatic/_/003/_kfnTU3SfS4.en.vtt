00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.719
 hello in one of the corners of san miguel de lillo 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.360
 voices of experts coming out these days criticizing the state of 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.519
 conservation of this building that its amount and heritage of humanity 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:20.710
 and the truth is that there are things in this building that are not very normal is a 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.810
 rule 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.020
 lion rights that grow in the lives of a building with more than eleven centuries of 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.610
 history the museum street and plants gives an idea of ​​the enormous humidity that 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.609
 support the walls 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.220
 besides the plants not only pretend the somber side of the buttresses 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.070
 sunnier we also find some opportunistic species that with 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.010
 its roots put at risk pieces of great value 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.000
 my if outside and humidity inside the situation is even worse since many 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.390
 windows lacking protection are open and when it rains the water roll 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.740
 through the inner walls 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.870
 To finish off the problem, it should be noted that the rainy days 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.870
 formed a large puddle the entrance of san miguel de lillo 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.780
 in the building belongs to the catholic church within the responsibility 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.870
 of its protection must also be added and its corresponding measure 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.400
 principality of asturias and the city council of oviedo it should not be noted that the 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.490
 Counselor of culture mercedes álvarez 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.259
 although the elaboration of a pre-Romanesque plan has been done recently but within 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.549
 the lengths that obliged bureaucratic procedures must be remembered that 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.520
 It must be sent to the Ministry of Culture to have financing 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.520
 so the thing seems like it will go for long 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.970
 in San Miguel de Lillo was built around 342 AD by King Ramiro 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.310
 first in the monte naranco have oviedo 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.960
 and forming a whole with the palace of the same king 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.320
 lazio that was later transformed into the church of Santa María del 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.120
 naranco 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.470
 San Miguel was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.820
 and its vicinity of treating the Oscar-winning actors Penélope Cruz and

 javier bardem two visitors with a lot of glamor but who are not the only ones already 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.560
 that the two buildings of the naranco receive thousands of visits per year visits 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.180
 that are not free since the Catholic church owns the buildings 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.970
 charge a religious entrance 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.329
 never better said with visiting the 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.069
 We hope that in the case of San Miguel de Lillo they do not want to charge us for the future 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.769
 for visiting some ruins and that the promised plan of the pre-Romanesque 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.949
 sanctity as soon as possible and with the financing that a whole
