00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.730
 gas of the line to which the model is whose 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.849
 200 the cud 200 model like all the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.010
 other models of the line which weber 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.080
 they have a brazier and a lid 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.780
 made of cast iron of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.350
 aluminum this fusion guaranteed 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.000
 five years specifically q2 percent 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.940
 and barbecue that lends itself well to being 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.530
 leaning on any support that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.180
 maybe you can have it on the terrace or in 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.910
 garden for which a table a floor 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.640
 something alternatively if you don't have it 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.390
 of this support plan you can 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.350
 use the cart you see below 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.030
 specially designed weber trolley 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.609
 to support everyone barbecue outlines the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.100
 shopping cart is an optional as I already have 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.170
 said and innovating videos I will show you 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.979
 specifically what is made up as 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 it works by going back to the barbecue, notice that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.229
 it also has two floors of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.820
 lateral support and the structure these 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.009
 two floors are made of plastic 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.689
 thermo-hardened and are fixed to the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.780
 structure of the park that realized in 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.689
 fiberglass braided fiber 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.280
 glass is a particularly material 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.920
 very strong but at the same time resistant 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.479
 time give a lot of lightness bubka o 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.850
 precisely to be able to move it 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.860
 easily we go to see in the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.740
 detail of what makes up the beautiful 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.170
 model cud 200 by opening the cover 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.760
 we immediately notice the cooking grill there 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.130
 cooking area grill 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.130
 a cooking surface of 55 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.440
 centimeters on the width and 39 on the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.320
 depth you live the grill is 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.350
 made of cast iron enamelled steel 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.010
 and under the daughter notice the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.670
 burner stainless steel burner a 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.070
 gas 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.619
 the burner has a power of 3 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.899
 kilowatt and a half so in a very good 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.510
 power to perform good 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:18.240
 grilled below the brazier 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.650
 notice that hole from that hole come 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.170
 all fats and subjects evacuated 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.910
 cooking that will be collected from that 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.570
 aluminum trays you see below 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.920
 the aluminum tray 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.390
 you can once finished grilling 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.950
 extrapolates easily by pulling out 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.500
 this step that contains it 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.670
 and you can go and replace it or a 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.340
 wash it to avoid replacing there 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.540
 of every barbecue what I recommend 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.390
 and what I recommend to all my parents 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.080
 customers is to put in the early evening 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.300
 cook a little water in the bowl 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.220
 water will prevent grease from sticking 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.080
 on the walls so you won't have the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.269
 need to replace it every time but 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.590
 simply date a flush e 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.840
 then put it back in its place 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.820
 that pan the Latin vico also 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.430
 avoid making the gas a lot of smoke 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.530
 gas burner is switched on via 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.220
 epileptic piezoelectric activates 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.840
 through this button we hear see 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.390
 if I can spark myself e 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.990
 button note that you press it 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.430
 action was in line, there it was 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.670
 spark gas open to turn on the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.970
 burner the burner you go to 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.880
 manage with this knob with the 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.890
 which you can go from a minimum to a 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.340
 maximum power passing through the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.880
 intermediate powers is obvious that 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.350
 every dish needs his 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.590
 cooking temperature here is precisely 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.020
 you can manage them with the knob 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.720
 bar lico will come complete with tubes in 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.440
 rubber and regulator to live in 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.690
 cylinder 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.880
 all you have to do is live in them, you will be ready immediately 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:10.220
 to cook the two floors in 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.640
 plastic as I told you before they present 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.620
 each floor two hooks these two hooks 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.780
 allow him to be able to hang i 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.100
 your cooking tools such as 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.169
 the gripper could be a spatula 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.510
 the fork in such a way as to have 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.180
 always everything in order at your fingertips 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.919
 while you are cooking and not losing 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.870
 time 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.530
 once you have finished cooking 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.830
 if when you go to put away the barbecue 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.590
 to avoid cluttering up too much space 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.520
 you have the opportunity to close the two 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.250
 tops close the lid 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.010
 notice how the barbecue takes on 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.560
 very small size 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.410
