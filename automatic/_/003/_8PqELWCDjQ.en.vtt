00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.320
 there 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.640
 the line plant or flax 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.610
 called is one of the oldest 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.930
 crops of the world 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.390
 Basically, there are no high levels 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.520
 claims to the climate also the soil 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.140
 Claims are not that high 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.840
 that he can thrive everywhere 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.479
 the story is around 5000 years old 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.040
 their use by humans 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.390
 on the one hand, the phase became linen 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.009
 On the other hand, the linseed is woven into oil 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.750
 the white of the linen was at that time 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.950
 symbol of the light and the divine 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.229
 purity Kleinböhl and slow are 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.380
 old well-known home remedies for human and 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.380
 animal 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.970
 who became wonderfully blue-flowering leyen 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.400
 until shortly after the second world war, too 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.840
 continuously grown with us and he 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.840
 is going on a renaissance again today 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.400
 the sowing starts already in the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.770
 may for this purpose the seeder 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.770
 filled with linseed and set 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.190
 then the amount to be seen becomes accurate 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.069
 Checked after the flowering time in early July 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.730
 Layman's capsules form in which themselves 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.319
 the mature flaxseed is located 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.620
 In the past, the linseed became by hand 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.510
 seeded and harvested as well 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.980
 the ripe plant with the hand out of the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.980
 torn floor and then 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.660
 dried around the capsules of the laity 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.120
 It was necessary to separate them 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.470
 an iron rake the so-called 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.110
 riff pulled 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.239
 the remaining capsules from the lay bushes 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.590
 were additionally with a flail 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.200
 taken from 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.600
 As you saw it came to clean in a plaster 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.090
 müller and then press 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.100
 Further processing of the phase 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.769
 took place by means of various brecht 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.739
 and hesse equipment until the game finished 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:05.709
 thread from the spun thread was 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:07.390
 on looms the linen fabric today 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.130
 however, will suffer with the most modern 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.130
 equipment gently harvested 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.790
 best known roots and now applause 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:31.580
 on the Rhine 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.560
 and there is the slow one 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.659
 Find oldest ones in Austria at the end 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.319
 we in haslach with the first 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:41.870
 documentary mention and 1350 where next 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.400
 grain also processed flaxseed 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.420
 were 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.870
 At that time, the mill became one 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.739
 Waterwheel operated since 1932 with a 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.049
 own hydroelectric power station in this mill 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:59.569
 The machines for the scales will be pressed 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:01.519
 controlled by transmission of the 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.519
 Flaxseed comes first in one 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.739
 Drying system is cleaned over it 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.959
 and by means of an automatic test 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:14.120
 knife on its purity quality 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:16.549
 checked over a pretty one could see 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.299
 to so-called roll chair where he 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.299
 is squeezed 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.250
 before roasting is by hot water 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:40.090
 added and the rest of the process takes 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:41.950
 About 25 minutes with the filling of the prez 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.710
 then the actual cylinder starts 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.460
 Pressing a hydraulic cylinder 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.470
 Press oil from the lonely the usual 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.750
 remained press petn used to 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:58.050
 feeding to animals an alternative 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.720
 the real pressure is cold pressure 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.490
 in this press process remain the 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.770
 essential omega-3 fatty acids 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.850
 fully received 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.430
 originally the cold pressing took place 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.030
 with a hand-driven feel 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.760
 Press 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.220
 A wooden wheel drives a steel 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.340
 pushes against a spindle to the motor 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.440
 and thereby the oil is squeezing out today 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.060
 the cold pressing also takes place 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.850
 a spindle press with lattice 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.370
 electric drive during the pressing process 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:31.169
 itself, the oil heats up 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.169
 maximum 30 degrees celsius 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.999
 through a filter system is the linseed oil 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.629
 cleaned and immediately in bottles 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.629
 bottled 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:50.630
 if you are now manufacturing in 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:52.100
 other areas will be considered 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.710
 heinz squeezing as much as possible 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.780
 Quantity brought out with high 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.830
 Temperatures and gate of this structure 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.150
 or this food in his 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.100
 Originality very impaired 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.460
 because you have a cold press like her 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.650
 when 3 0 cashed use or 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.570
 that the farmers can do then you can 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.240
 assume that it is natural 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.130
 as possible is unfortunately this contains 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.980
 essential unsaturated 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.170
 omega-3 fatty acids in the cistern in the 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.560
 Contrast this with the cheap 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.540
 refined oils and hydrogenated fats 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.290
 the latter in transform which ours 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.480
 cells and thereby damage our organs 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:35.540
 Lionel also works preventively 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.910
 against high cholesterol as well 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.290
 many metabolic diseases it 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.300
 supports the metabolism in this 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.940
 regard that it is these cells 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.250
 improved continuity and in this 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.810
 Think almost as a universal remedy 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.810
 or food
