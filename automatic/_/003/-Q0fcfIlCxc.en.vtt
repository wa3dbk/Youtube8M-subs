bag your jacket anything like that it's

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.610 
bag your jacket anything like that it's
really<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.050> weigh<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:01.379> I

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
really not going to weigh it down I

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.130 
really not going to weigh it down I
think<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.890> weighs<00:01:02.010> maybe<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.670> half<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> pound<00:01:03.239> but

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
think it weighs maybe a half a pound but

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.840 
think it weighs maybe a half a pound but
let's<00:01:04.920> check<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.220> out<00:01:05.280> compared<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> some<00:01:05.820> of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
let's check it out compared to some of

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.010 
let's check it out compared to some of
the<00:01:05.939> other<00:01:06.000> solutions<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.990> there

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the other solutions that are out there

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.530 
the other solutions that are out there
now<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.670> pretty<00:01:08.850> big<00:01:09.090> we

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
now as you can see this is pretty big we

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690 
now as you can see this is pretty big we
got<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> richard<00:01:10.049> solo<00:01:10.320> 1800<00:01:11.070> which<00:01:11.520> is

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
got the richard solo 1800 which is

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.820 
got the richard solo 1800 which is
smaller<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> smaller<00:01:13.020> device<00:01:13.350> you're

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
smaller but with a smaller device you're

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.770 
smaller but with a smaller device you're
going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.100> get<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:14.790> much<00:01:14.939> power<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
going to get not as much power so you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.149 
going to get not as much power so you
got<00:01:15.930> eighteen<00:01:16.200> hundred<00:01:16.470> milliamps<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.040> this

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
got eighteen hundred milliamps with this

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.749 
got eighteen hundred milliamps with this
excellent<00:01:17.939> product<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.450> use<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.720> constantly

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
excellent product and use it constantly

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.460 
excellent product and use it constantly
so<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> different<00:01:21.360> application<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
so it's just a different application the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.080 
so it's just a different application the
only<00:01:22.680> thing<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> richard<00:01:23.220> solo<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.700> good<00:01:23.850> for

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
only thing the richard solo is good for

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.359 
only thing the richard solo is good for

corner<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:20.010> now<00:03:20.040> if<00:03:20.850> i<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:21.060> plug<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:21.630> in

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
corner and now if i can plug this in

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.360 
corner and now if i can plug this in
we'll<00:03:22.350> see<00:03:22.500> if<00:03:22.530> we<00:03:22.650> can<00:03:22.799> charge<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.160> flip

video<00:03:23.549> as<00:03:23.910> well<00:03:23.970> i<00:03:24.480> think<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.560> know<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.739> using

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
video as well i think you know to using

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.380 
video as well i think you know to using
a<00:03:26.190> device<00:03:26.340> like<00:03:26.489> this<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.940> might<00:03:27.030> be<00:03:27.150> better<00:03:27.299> to

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
a device like this it might be better to

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
a device like this it might be better to
get<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.600> USB<00:03:28.230> extension<00:03:28.709> cable<00:03:28.890> but<00:03:30.320> there<00:03:31.320> we

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
get a USB extension cable but there we

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.190 
get a USB extension cable but there we
go<00:03:31.760> yep<00:03:32.760> popped<00:03:33.269> in<00:03:33.420> there<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:33.840> look<00:03:33.959> at<00:03:34.049> that

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
go yep popped in there and look at that

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.050 
go yep popped in there and look at that
that's<00:03:34.380> charging<00:03:34.890> as<00:03:35.010> well<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.910> know<00:03:36.030> a

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
that's charging as well so you know a

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.340 
that's charging as well so you know a
configuration<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:36.840> this<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.200> probably

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
configuration like this you probably

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.710 
configuration like this you probably
just<00:03:37.799> want<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.070> lay<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.220> down<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:39.330> i<00:03:39.570> can

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
just want to lay that down and i can

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.539 
just want to lay that down and i can
charge<00:03:39.930> both<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.440> those<00:03:40.530> devices<00:03:40.890> in<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.340> car

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549

yesterday<00:04:52.639> on<00:04:52.940> December<00:04:53.330> 14th<00:04:53.750> but<00:04:54.380> as<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:55.070> said

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
yesterday on December 14th but as I said

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.650 
yesterday on December 14th but as I said

dollars<00:04:57.139> is<00:04:57.310> you<00:04:58.310> know<00:04:58.430> it's<00:04:58.610> a<00:04:58.699> lot<00:04:58.850> of<00:04:58.880> money

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030

but I think it's a good value for

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.409 
but I think it's a good value for
something<00:05:00.889> like<00:05:01.039> this<00:05:01.100> I<00:05:01.550> will<00:05:02.210> put<00:05:02.389> it
