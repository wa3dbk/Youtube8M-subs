its<00:00:25.119> the<00:00:25.329> zero<00:00:25.689> point<00:00:25.930> four<00:00:26.169> point<00:00:26.230> three<00:00:26.500> and

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
its the zero point four point three and

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.499 
its the zero point four point three and
it's<00:00:27.759> a<00:00:27.880> big<00:00:28.029> update<00:00:28.270> not<00:00:29.259> so<00:00:29.470> much<00:00:29.680> in<00:00:29.949> the

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
it's a big update not so much in the

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.750 
it's a big update not so much in the
visual<00:00:31.509> updates<00:00:31.960> but<00:00:32.230> all<00:00:32.769> mechanics<00:00:33.550> and<00:00:33.699> the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
visual updates but all mechanics and the

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.090 
visual updates but all mechanics and the
games<00:00:33.940> were<00:00:34.120> updated<00:00:34.750> and<00:00:34.960> that<00:00:35.620> video<00:00:35.949> will

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
games were updated and that video will

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.310 
games were updated and that video will
be<00:00:36.159> about<00:00:36.339> the<00:00:36.780> talking<00:00:37.780> a<00:00:37.870> little<00:00:37.960> bit<00:00:38.110> about

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
be about the talking a little bit about

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.530 
be about the talking a little bit about
it<00:00:38.379> in<00:00:38.650> there<00:00:38.829> I'll<00:00:39.100> show<00:00:39.550> you<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:39.790> user<00:00:40.030> in

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
it in there I'll show you the user in

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.600 
it in there I'll show you the user in
the<00:00:40.960> art<00:00:41.379> department<00:00:41.920> zone<00:00:42.100> where<00:00:42.489> they

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
the art department zone where they

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.970 
the art department zone where they
change<00:00:42.850> taking<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.269> game<00:00:43.470> gameplay<00:00:44.470> changes

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
change taking the game gameplay changes

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.859 
change taking the game gameplay changes
so<00:00:45.820> and<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.829> begin<00:00:48.269> I'll<00:00:49.269> going<00:00:49.540> back<00:00:49.689> to<00:00:49.809> the

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:49.869 
so and to begin I'll going back to the

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:53.160 
so and to begin I'll going back to the
mountain<00:00:50.019> as<00:00:50.350> always<00:00:50.710> hey<00:00:51.220> I'm<00:00:52.000> I<00:00:52.540> think<00:00:53.049> they

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
mountain as always hey I'm I think they

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.619 
mountain as always hey I'm I think they
should<00:00:53.350> do<00:00:53.470> an<00:00:53.589> access<00:00:54.010> like<00:00:54.330> closer<00:00:55.330> to<00:00:55.510> this

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
should do an access like closer to this

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.479 
should do an access like closer to this
side<00:00:55.689> of<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.049> time<00:00:56.229> even<00:00:56.890> if<00:00:57.189> this<00:00:57.339> one<00:00:57.460> is

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
side of the time even if this one is

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.179 
side of the time even if this one is
good<00:00:57.729> but<00:00:57.879> should<00:00:58.510> do<00:00:58.659> a<00:00:58.689> spawn<00:00:59.619> point<00:00:59.920> in<00:01:00.070> the

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:00.189 
good but should do a spawn point in the

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:04.350 
good but should do a spawn point in the
cheerless<00:01:00.519> over<00:01:00.760> there<00:01:00.939> so<00:01:01.769> to<00:01:02.769> begin<00:01:02.949> and<00:01:03.360> the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
cheerless over there so to begin and the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.520 
cheerless over there so to begin and the
our<00:01:04.479> departments<00:01:05.080> i'm<00:01:05.170> going<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.379> show<00:01:05.500> you

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
our departments i'm going to show you

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.140 
our departments i'm going to show you
they<00:01:05.770> they<00:01:05.950> changed<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.340> bit<00:01:06.490> in<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.000> back

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
they they changed a bit in the back

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.760 
they they changed a bit in the back
there<00:01:07.390> but<00:01:08.040> otherwise<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:11.200> all<00:01:11.500> the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
there but otherwise that's all the

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.360 
there but otherwise that's all the
physics<00:01:12.310> there<00:01:12.520> was<00:01:12.640> a<00:01:12.670> bunch<00:01:13.060> of<00:01:13.180> the

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
physics there was a bunch of the

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.990 
physics there was a bunch of the
of<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.990> bug<00:01:15.990> fixes<00:01:16.620> for<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:17.040> physics<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
of the bug fixes for the physics of the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.870 
of the bug fixes for the physics of the
game<00:01:18.180> so

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
game so

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.100 
game so
heels<00:01:20.479> or<00:01:21.020> my<00:01:21.170> gun<00:01:21.469> in<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.619> crash<00:01:21.979> oh<00:01:22.399> yeah<00:01:23.299> on

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
heels or my gun in the crash oh yeah on

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.899 
heels or my gun in the crash oh yeah on
a<00:01:24.310> bunch<00:01:25.310> of<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:26.110> freaking<00:01:27.430> adjustments<00:01:28.430> for

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
a bunch of the freaking adjustments for

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.389 
a bunch of the freaking adjustments for
the<00:01:29.060> physics<00:01:29.420> but<00:01:29.960> I<00:01:30.200> won't<00:01:30.470> stop<00:01:30.740> talking<00:01:31.220> I

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
the physics but I won't stop talking I

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.539 
the physics but I won't stop talking I
was<00:01:31.880> talking<00:01:32.299> about<00:01:32.649> kind<00:01:33.649> of<00:01:33.770> course<00:01:34.070> the

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
was talking about kind of course the

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.590 
was talking about kind of course the
yeah<00:01:35.270> they<00:01:36.259> picked<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.939> landings<00:01:37.939> when<00:01:38.509> you

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
yeah they picked the landings when you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.100 
yeah they picked the landings when you
wear<00:01:38.920> when<00:01:39.920> he<00:01:40.039> went<00:01:40.280> with<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.060> ways<00:01:41.509> it's

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
wear when he went with the ways it's

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.620 
wear when he went with the ways it's
better

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.679 

like<00:01:45.049> that<00:01:45.369> they<00:01:46.369> fix<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.880> crashes<00:01:47.360> some

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
like that they fix the crashes some

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.010 
like that they fix the crashes some
crashes<00:01:48.259> again<00:01:48.890> bc<00:01:49.729> native<00:01:50.240> executive

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
crashes again bc native executive

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.550 
crashes again bc native executive
whatever<00:01:51.560> yeah<00:01:52.430> some<00:01:52.700> crashes<00:01:53.060> were<00:01:53.810> famous

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
whatever yeah some crashes were famous

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.679 
whatever yeah some crashes were famous
weird<00:01:54.799> they<00:01:55.430> tried<00:01:55.850> fixing<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:56.390> look<00:01:56.600> at

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
weird they tried fixing that look at

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:57.670 
weird they tried fixing that look at
number

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
number

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.520 
number
so<00:01:58.460> as<00:01:59.180> you<00:01:59.240> can<00:01:59.570> see<00:01:59.780> if<00:01:59.870> I<00:01:59.960> don't<00:02:00.140> crash<00:02:00.350> right

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
so as you can see if I don't crash right

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.150 
so as you can see if I don't crash right
now<00:02:00.680> good<00:02:01.280> job<00:02:01.430> oh<00:02:01.610> my<00:02:01.910> god<00:02:02.180> so<00:02:02.720> as<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:03.560> can<00:02:03.890> see

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
now good job oh my god so as you can see

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.639 
now good job oh my god so as you can see
and<00:02:05.140> this<00:02:06.140> region<00:02:06.860> change<00:02:07.330> so<00:02:08.330> yeah<00:02:08.539> that<00:02:09.080> word

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
and this region change so yeah that word

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.470 
and this region change so yeah that word
is<00:02:09.860> or<00:02:09.979> whatever<00:02:10.580> it's<00:02:10.970> not<00:02:11.120> written<00:02:11.330> to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
is or whatever it's not written to

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.030 
is or whatever it's not written to
fashion<00:02:11.960> thing<00:02:12.110> for<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.350> preacher<00:02:12.740> change

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
fashion thing for the preacher change

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.500 
fashion thing for the preacher change
the<00:02:13.700> trees<00:02:14.030> emplacement<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.580> yeah<00:02:16.580> there's

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the trees emplacement and yeah there's

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.280 
the trees emplacement and yeah there's
more<00:02:17.720> trees<00:02:17.990> now<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:20.240> they<00:02:20.930> say<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
more trees now and that they say the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.320 
more trees now and that they say the
game<00:02:21.320> plan<00:02:21.800> change<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.580> don't<00:02:22.790> see<00:02:23.120> anything

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
game plan change I don't see anything

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.880 
game plan change I don't see anything
soil<00:02:24.190> Wow<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.610> think<00:02:25.700> it's<00:02:26.030> more<00:02:26.180> like<00:02:26.890> art

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
soil Wow so I think it's more like art

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.640 
soil Wow so I think it's more like art
and<00:02:28.160> about<00:02:28.850> maybe<00:02:29.840> like<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.260> game<00:02:30.410> playing

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
and about maybe like the game playing

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.290 
and about maybe like the game playing
proof<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.160> see<00:02:31.400> this<00:02:31.580> wasn't<00:02:32.180> there

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
proof so you see this wasn't there

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.150 
proof so you see this wasn't there
before<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:33.320> there<00:02:33.530> weren't<00:02:33.650> any<00:02:33.860> bridges

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
before and there weren't any bridges

rocks everywhere as you can see and if

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:06.610 
rocks everywhere as you can see and if
you<00:06:05.000> continue<00:06:05.180> they<00:06:05.599> they<00:06:05.840> added<00:06:06.259> some<00:06:06.469> stuff

I think like this at night would mounts
I<00:06:14.360> think<00:06:14.689> this<00:06:14.959> wasn't<00:06:15.229> there<00:06:15.469> before<00:06:15.589> so<00:06:16.399> yeah

the little stuff like this little
details<00:06:21.529> that<00:06:21.649> make<00:06:21.919> the<00:06:22.039> game<00:06:22.219> quite<00:06:22.849> awesome

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
details that make the game quite awesome

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.829 
details that make the game quite awesome
so<00:06:24.800> it's<00:06:25.789> pretty<00:06:25.969> nice<00:06:26.149> to<00:06:26.330> see<00:06:26.479> the<00:06:26.599> date
