00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
bit more spray the idea is to work

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.020

slightly asymmetrical you're going to
work<00:01:28.150> a<00:01:28.180> bit<00:01:28.390> flatter<00:01:28.690> obviously<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.710> do<00:01:29.830> that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
work a bit flatter obviously to do that

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.010 
work a bit flatter obviously to do that
the<00:01:30.100> part<00:01:30.370> in<00:01:30.580> both<00:01:30.760> sides<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.750> then<00:01:31.870> just
