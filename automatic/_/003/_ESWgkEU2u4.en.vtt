00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 our such I like it because this is 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.970
 to actually apply applied between the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.610
 Ã¡nimas for bedding paint 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.740
 that we have before loyal easy we are a 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.480
 very quickly apply the existence and 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.699
 Now let's explain this for fast 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.789
 get over it good let's go look good 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.630
 how divine while selling the clothes of 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.630
 bed is everything 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:37.890
 we are going to press everything from sheep to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:40.379
 sleep more good you know the first thing that you 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.930
 you have to put is this product that 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.760
 schlitter maybe that I let him hate and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.370
 soccer is glued 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.010
 this is the secret of the full stencil 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.770
 all the stencil of the glitter tag what 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.350
 positioned on the fabric what crushes look 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.960
 remains stuck on everything is good 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.539
 stuck in all the pieces that I 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.239
 there are little cuts that are open and I'm going 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.089
 to start painting on the canvas I'm going to 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.390
 take a bristle brush 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.090
 a little white acrylic I'm going to 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.070
 download always remember that you have to 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.969
 download on a napkin to not 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.630
 take the surplus and in a circular 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:23.420
 I'm going to start painting look how fast 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.119
 why because I have a base 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.920
 quite dark, although it is clear 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.289
 green but it's a pretty dark base 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.719
 but I have to make them stand out the 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.850
 colors that's why I 'm first giving 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.069
 a white base and also the base of the 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.520
 the sheet have as well is mounted 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:42.649
 so much I have a thermos for down and a 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.810
 absorbent paper this is very important 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.849
 because because I'm using a 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.369
 paint that can be transferred to the 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:51.770
 another side look how fast you're going like that 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.429
 painting everything he sees hits and not only I'm going to 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.869
 use the stencil of the side draft 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.819
 inside but I will also use the 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.129
 side dayz force and look I start to 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.860
 paint in and correction cost 

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:06.140
 because because they always ask us 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.450
 they like the format as it is cut 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.110
 the stencil and I'm going to use it 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.280
 as if 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.140
 I start inside because I do not want to 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.030
 with an excessive load or that I stayed 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.560
 a ray I want it to be well vanished 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.420
 you see 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.410
 it looks perfect in addition the brush of 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.860
 lock and the time for the stack is not 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.040
 20 china here I already have the white base 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.980
 finished like that I'm going to take another brush 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.540
 we always use tecos brushes never 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.210
 we're going to moisten them and I'm going to start 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.630
 paint first to start painting 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.010
 I'm going to take the pink color look at what 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.340
 well that stands out I'm going to take the legs 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.980
 and the face 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.860
 look how fast it is done 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.519
 I'm going to take another brush, I'm going to take a 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.360
 brown I will download and I will go 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.360
 by the fences 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.980
 it moves see what I'm doing 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.440
 strength because although it's a soft fabric 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.330
 but if it has a porosity if I 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.310
 I did not have it well subject this 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.739
 would begin to move and now we're going to 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.549
 do something special to the sheep we are going to 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:25.010
 put a 3-d paste if I'm going to take 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.200
 a spatula always ask us how 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.970
 it is very easy to take the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.980
 spatula and put a little amount 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.500
 also because I'm in some sheets 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.829
 a child and then now to bother in the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.060
 face when it's not the skin 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.859
 starting untidily because 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.970
 because I want to show as if it were the 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.910
 wool 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.910
 the lanita of ovejita always there 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.580
 little lambs are so tender so tender the 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.360
 grave above taking care not to 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.210
 encroach 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.260
 and so look I 'll show you how it arrives 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.180
 until now I will always lift 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.040
 lifted up and helped me with the 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.730
 hands this is another thing that I 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.980
 asks how do I always raise 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.260
 up and carefully because here I have the 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.209
 3-d pasta that is fresh 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.730
 this is important once you paint 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.160
 an Indian miracle that remains up 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.140
 being fresh pasta 3-d not 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.350
 they let it dry and so they are going to wash in the 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.540
 stay the good thing is also to give you the 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.070
 last details because one accepted the 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.160
 step by step but then what has 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.060
 grace is always in thanks to give 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.490
 detail when the stencil and 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.610
 it can be done with different 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.250
 things you can float up until the 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:51.390
 dry brush you can use the line was 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.390
 dot ink you can use 3d pasta 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.020
 well let's go to the details 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.820
 well now let's start doing the 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.840
 details I will moisten the brush with 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.150
 water I'm going to take an angular brush 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.860
 I only charge the tip and download the 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.900
 paddle to one side and to the other 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.390
 remember to download very well so I 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.190
 it looks good but I choose the float if not 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.110
 I will have a very structured line 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.120
 or go up there of what they see 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.640
 Look how easy and easy 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.980
 could float up the pasta 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.590
 3d that there is no problem 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:30.030
 another detail I can do is 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:33.070
 if you want with white and a brush lainer 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:37.350
 I'm going to do with more I'm going to start 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:41.260
 decorate once you can play here the legs 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.330
 or decorate the cloud outside and so I go 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.820
 doing all the details for the 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.520
 Pets can make your eyes 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.540
 the mouth the numbers of the travelers 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.540
 All the details 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:28.030
 on the wall in the ceiling 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:28.030
