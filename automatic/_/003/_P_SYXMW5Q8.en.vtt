on some kill streaks but the challenging

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.970 
on some kill streaks but the challenging
aspect<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.110> where<00:00:34.290> things<00:00:34.680> get<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
aspect of this and where things get a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.670 
aspect of this and where things get a
little<00:00:35.250> bit<00:00:35.460> interesting<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
little bit interesting is that I have to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.760 
little bit interesting is that I have to
use<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.250> single<00:00:39.000> fire<00:00:39.239> mode<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.620> all

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
use it in single fire mode and in all

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.260 
use it in single fire mode and in all
honesty<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> actually<00:00:41.460> tried<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.030> out<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
process of trying to get gameplay for it

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.770 
process of trying to get gameplay for it
I<00:00:46.350> rage<00:00:47.100> quit<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.730> almost<00:00:48.059> every<00:00:48.420> match<00:00:48.570> I

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
move on to a different challenge but at

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.549 
move on to a different challenge but at
this<00:00:56.640> time<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.090> decided<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.809> bite<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.289> bullet

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
this time I decided to bite the bullet

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.529 
this time I decided to bite the bullet
and<00:00:58.739> give<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.039> another<00:00:59.129> go<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.789> while<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.390> was

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and give it another go and while it was

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.900 
and give it another go and while it was
still<00:01:00.870> an<00:01:01.620> absolute<00:01:01.770> nightmare<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.699> try<00:01:02.850> to

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
still an absolute nightmare to try to

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.490 
still an absolute nightmare to try to
kill<00:01:03.180> anyone<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.690> setup<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.199> was

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
kill anyone with this setup I was

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.320 
kill anyone with this setup I was
finally<00:01:04.739> able<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.670> least<00:01:05.700> some

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
finally able to get at least some

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.030 
finally able to get at least some
interesting<00:01:06.780> gameplay<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:07.920> you're

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
interesting gameplay and so if you're

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.910 
interesting gameplay and so if you're
not<00:01:08.159> aware<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.820> pp19<00:01:09.479> has<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
not aware the pp19 has I think the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.429 
not aware the pp19 has I think the
lowest<00:01:11.220> damage<00:01:11.610> model<00:01:12.119> out<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.540> any<00:01:12.810> weapon<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
lowest damage model out of any weapon in

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.710 
lowest damage model out of any weapon in
battlefield<00:01:13.770> 3<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.220> only<00:01:14.340> does<00:01:14.549> 16<00:01:15.360> points<00:01:15.659> 7

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
battlefield 3 it only does 16 points 7

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.899 
battlefield 3 it only does 16 points 7
damage<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.439> close<00:01:16.500> like<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.250> its<00:01:17.430> highest

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
damage up close like that's its highest

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.640 
damage up close like that's its highest
damage<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.020> anyone<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
damage it's going to do to anyone and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.030 
damage it's going to do to anyone and
then<00:01:20.070> its<00:01:20.189> long-range<00:01:20.759> killing<00:01:21.270> potential<00:01:21.689> is

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
then its long-range killing potential is

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.399 
then its long-range killing potential is
12.5<00:01:23.040> damage<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.060> shot<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
12.5 damage a shot and so it is going to

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.580 
12.5 damage a shot and so it is going to
take<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> minimum<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.790> six<00:01:27.509> shots<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.290> drop

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
take you a minimum of six shots to drop

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.649 
take you a minimum of six shots to drop
someone<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.820> last<00:01:30.030> challenge<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.540> I

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
someone and the last challenge that I

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.590 
someone and the last challenge that I
did<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.259> ran<00:01:31.470> around<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.250> mp443<00:01:33.119> and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
did is I ran around with the mp443 and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.840 
did is I ran around with the mp443 and
while<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.960> loved<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.290> weapon<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> pistol

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
while I loved that weapon it is a pistol

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.240 
while I loved that weapon it is a pistol
and<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.630> only<00:01:36.780> takes<00:01:37.079> four<00:01:37.530> shots<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.070> drop

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and it only takes four shots that drop

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.950 
and it only takes four shots that drop
someone<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.670> close<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.360> I'm<00:01:39.479> basically<00:01:39.600> going

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
someone up close so I'm basically going

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.370 
someone up close so I'm basically going
from<00:01:40.170> four<00:01:40.380> shots<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:41.310> six<00:01:42.150> shots<00:01:42.600> minimum<00:01:43.290> I

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
from four shots to six shots minimum I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.870 
from four shots to six shots minimum I
mean<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:43.740> nice<00:01:43.979> whenever<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.520> would<00:01:44.640> come

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
mean it was nice whenever I would come

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.730 
mean it was nice whenever I would come
across<00:01:44.970> someone<00:01:45.509> who<00:01:45.540> already<00:01:46.140> had<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> bunch

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
across someone who already had a bunch

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.080 
across someone who already had a bunch
of<00:01:46.860> damage<00:01:47.070> done<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.520> him<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:47.970> was

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
of damage done to him and then it was

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.310 
of damage done to him and then it was
able<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.390> take<00:01:48.570> them<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.200> bit

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
able to take them out a little bit

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.380 
able to take them out a little bit
quicker<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.220> could<00:01:50.579> not<00:01:50.759> believe<00:01:50.909> that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
quicker but I could not believe that

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.090 
quicker but I could not believe that
this<00:01:51.689> was<00:01:52.049> more<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.590> headache<00:01:52.799> than

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
this was more of a headache than

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.690 
this was more of a headache than
actually<00:01:53.640> using<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.360> secondary<00:01:55.350> gun<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.460> one

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
actually using a secondary gun the one

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.940 
actually using a secondary gun the one
nice<00:01:57.240> aspect<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.200> guess<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> it

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
nice aspect of this I guess is that it

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.920 
nice aspect of this I guess is that it
does<00:01:59.189> have<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.850> lot<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.210> rounds<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.750> its

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
does have a lot of rounds in its

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.109 
does have a lot of rounds in its
magazine<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.469> gonna<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.770> 55<00:02:02.490> bullets<00:02:02.939> at

magazine it's gonna have 55 bullets at

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
I will assume that I will be just about

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.690 
I will assume that I will be just about
to<00:02:26.960> kill<00:02:27.170> them<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.470> then<00:02:27.890> as<00:02:28.070> they<00:02:28.340> finally

to kill them and then as they finally

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.090 
to kill them and then as they finally
realize<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.750> they're<00:02:29.930> slowly<00:02:30.290> being

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
realize that they're slowly being

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.460 
realize that they're slowly being
whittled<00:02:31.730> down<00:02:31.940> by<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.570> bunch<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.050> rocks<00:02:33.260> being

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
whittled down by a bunch of rocks being

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.440 
whittled down by a bunch of rocks being
thrown<00:02:33.560> at<00:02:33.830> their<00:02:33.920> face<00:02:34.100> they<00:02:34.610> will<00:02:34.940> decide<00:02:35.300> to

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
thrown at their face they will decide to

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.780 
thrown at their face they will decide to
go<00:02:35.540> behind<00:02:35.870> cover<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.320> then<00:02:36.680> regenerate<00:02:37.400> some

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
go behind cover and then regenerate some

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.160 
go behind cover and then regenerate some
health<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.480> can't<00:02:38.690> tell<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:38.960> how<00:02:39.110> many

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
health and I can't tell you how many

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.290 
health and I can't tell you how many
times<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.860> died<00:02:40.160> because<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.670> would<00:02:41.090> get<00:02:41.180> the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
times I died because I would get the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.150 
times I died because I would get the
drop<00:02:41.510> on<00:02:41.690> someone<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.350> it'd<00:02:42.590> be<00:02:42.680> kind<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:42.980> like

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
drop on someone and it'd be kind of like

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.890 
drop on someone and it'd be kind of like
medium<00:02:43.490> to<00:02:43.610> long<00:02:43.790> range<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.270> would<00:02:44.450> begin<00:02:44.840> to

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
medium to long range I would begin to

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.540 
medium to long range I would begin to
start<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.470> pump<00:02:45.650> them<00:02:45.860> full<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:46.250> bullets

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
start to pump them full of bullets

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.220 
start to pump them full of bullets
literally<00:02:47.120> pumping<00:02:47.510> them<00:02:47.660> full<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.870> bullets

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
literally pumping them full of bullets

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.560 
literally pumping them full of bullets
like<00:02:48.380> six<00:02:48.890> seven<00:02:49.250> rounds<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.730> was<00:02:49.820> ridiculous

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
like six seven rounds it was ridiculous

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.210 
like six seven rounds it was ridiculous
they<00:02:51.020> would<00:02:51.170> finally<00:02:51.560> realize<00:02:51.920> that<00:02:51.950> they

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
they would finally realize that they

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.770 
they would finally realize that they
were<00:02:52.280> being<00:02:52.490> taken<00:02:52.880> out<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.210> then<00:02:53.330> get<00:02:53.510> behind

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
were being taken out and then get behind

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.690 
were being taken out and then get behind
cover<00:02:53.990> regenerate<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.100> health<00:02:55.280> quickly

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
cover regenerate that health quickly

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.850 
cover regenerate that health quickly
then<00:02:56.030> peak<00:02:56.690> out<00:02:56.870> again<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.410> then<00:02:57.500> just<00:02:57.680> blow

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
then peak out again and then just blow

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.830 
then peak out again and then just blow
my<00:02:58.040> face<00:02:58.250> off<00:02:58.490> simply<00:02:58.790> because<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.150> just<00:02:59.450> do<00:02:59.690> not

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
my face off simply because I just do not

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.020 
my face off simply because I just do not
have<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.290> firepower<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.950> compete<00:03:01.910> with

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
have the firepower to compete with

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.120 
have the firepower to compete with
someone<00:03:02.240> who's<00:03:02.450> using<00:03:02.660> in<00:03:02.870> m16a3<00:03:03.500> or<00:03:03.830> really

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
someone who's using in m16a3 or really

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.730 
someone who's using in m16a3 or really
any<00:03:04.430> other<00:03:04.820> weapon<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:05.990> it<00:03:06.110> was<00:03:06.200> nice<00:03:06.380> that

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
any other weapon and so it was nice that

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.040 
any other weapon and so it was nice that
I<00:03:06.770> had<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.400> many<00:03:07.610> rounds<00:03:08.120> but<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.510> all<00:03:08.660> honesty

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
I had so many rounds but in all honesty

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.240 
I had so many rounds but in all honesty
it's<00:03:09.200> like<00:03:09.320> it<00:03:09.440> really<00:03:09.650> didn't<00:03:10.130> matter

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
it's like it really didn't matter

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.820 
it's like it really didn't matter
because<00:03:10.610> even<00:03:11.240> if<00:03:11.330> I<00:03:11.480> would<00:03:12.200> get<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.500> drop<00:03:12.710> on

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
because even if I would get the drop on

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.350 
because even if I would get the drop on
someone<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.340> at<00:03:13.490> least<00:03:13.640> if<00:03:13.850> they<00:03:13.970> were<00:03:14.030> kind

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
someone and at least if they were kind

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.480 
someone and at least if they were kind
of<00:03:14.480> smart<00:03:14.810> they<00:03:15.500> would<00:03:15.620> still<00:03:15.920> continue<00:03:16.460> to

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
of smart they would still continue to

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.630 
of smart they would still continue to
just<00:03:17.330> destroy<00:03:17.750> me<00:03:17.990> another<00:03:18.890> kind<00:03:19.490> of

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
just destroy me another kind of

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.430 
just destroy me another kind of
redeeming<00:03:20.090> quality<00:03:20.480> of<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.810> weapon<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.290> that

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
redeeming quality of the weapon is that

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.920 
redeeming quality of the weapon is that
it<00:03:21.530> does<00:03:21.680> have<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:22.340> very<00:03:23.030> fast<00:03:23.390> rounds<00:03:23.810> per

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
it does have a very fast rounds per

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.710 
it does have a very fast rounds per
minute<00:03:24.020> and<00:03:24.200> has<00:03:24.380> an<00:03:24.500> RPM<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:24.950> 900<00:03:25.790> but<00:03:26.450> in<00:03:26.600> all

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
minute and has an RPM of 900 but in all

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.720 
minute and has an RPM of 900 but in all
honesty<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.200> could<00:03:27.590> think<00:03:27.950> I'm<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.459> greatest

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
honesty I could think I'm the greatest

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.520 
honesty I could think I'm the greatest
battlefield<00:03:29.360> or<00:03:29.510> out<00:03:29.660> there<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.380> my

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
battlefield or out there and that my

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.350 
battlefield or out there and that my
trigger<00:03:30.890> finger<00:03:30.980> is<00:03:31.280> top<00:03:31.730> notch<00:03:31.940> but<00:03:32.209> there

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
trigger finger is top notch but there

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.420 
trigger finger is top notch but there
was<00:03:32.480> no<00:03:32.660> way<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.260> I'm<00:03:33.709> gonna<00:03:33.860> be<00:03:34.070> able<00:03:34.250> to

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
was no way that I'm gonna be able to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.160 
was no way that I'm gonna be able to
take<00:03:34.670> advantage<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.270> that<00:03:35.510> 900

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
take advantage of that 900

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.390 
take advantage of that 900
rounds-per-minute<00:03:36.440> mean<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:37.070> literally

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
rounds-per-minute mean you literally

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.640 
rounds-per-minute mean you literally
need<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:37.760> be<00:03:38.060> in<00:03:38.180> full<00:03:38.360> auto<00:03:38.570> mode<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:39.320> get<00:03:39.500> the

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
need to be in full auto mode to get the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.130 
need to be in full auto mode to get the
full<00:03:39.920> extent<00:03:40.520> out<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.880> this<00:03:41.000> weapon<00:03:41.240> and<00:03:41.630> so

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
full extent out of this weapon and so

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.860 
full extent out of this weapon and so
even<00:03:42.500> though<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.890> was<00:03:43.130> nice<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.940> have<00:03:44.120> that<00:03:44.330> rpm

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
even though it was nice to have that rpm

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.380 
even though it was nice to have that rpm
at<00:03:45.050> my<00:03:45.170> disposal<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.890> if<00:03:45.950> I<00:03:46.070> was<00:03:46.310> really<00:03:47.150> fast

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
at my disposal and if I was really fast

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.930 
at my disposal and if I was really fast
with<00:03:47.570> my<00:03:47.690> trigger<00:03:47.989> finger<00:03:48.080> I<00:03:48.560> could<00:03:49.280> get<00:03:49.700> some

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
with my trigger finger I could get some

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.640 
with my trigger finger I could get some
use<00:03:50.090> out<00:03:50.300> of<00:03:50.360> it<00:03:50.600> but<00:03:50.810> more<00:03:50.930> often<00:03:51.140> than<00:03:51.350> not<00:03:51.410> it

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
use out of it but more often than not it

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.470 
use out of it but more often than not it
was<00:03:51.739> just<00:03:51.890> kind<00:03:52.070> of<00:03:52.100> like<00:03:52.280> I'm<00:03:52.520> not<00:03:52.970> that<00:03:53.239> good

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
was just kind of like I'm not that good

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.990 
was just kind of like I'm not that good
even<00:03:53.780> if<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:54.080> think<00:03:54.140> I<00:03:54.560> am<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.010> it<00:03:55.700> was<00:03:55.730> just

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
even if I think I am and it was just

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.960 
even if I think I am and it was just
kind<00:03:56.180> of<00:03:56.390> a<00:03:56.660> wasted<00:03:57.140> stack<00:03:57.500> so<00:03:58.070> my<00:03:58.730> thought

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
kind of a wasted stack so my thought

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.670 
kind of a wasted stack so my thought
process<00:03:59.330> behind<00:03:59.450> this<00:03:59.750> was<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:00.350> I<00:04:00.380> knew<00:04:00.650> I

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
process behind this was that I knew I

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.830 
process behind this was that I knew I
needed<00:04:00.860> to<00:04:01.070> play<00:04:01.220> up<00:04:01.430> close<00:04:01.700> I<00:04:01.940> did<00:04:02.450> try<00:04:02.780> to

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
needed to play up close I did try to

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.229 
needed to play up close I did try to
play<00:04:03.080> on<00:04:03.350> larger<00:04:03.950> Maps<00:04:04.160> like<00:04:04.400> Caspian<00:04:04.940> border

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
play on larger Maps like Caspian border

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.120 
play on larger Maps like Caspian border
and<00:04:05.420> kargh<00:04:05.720> Island<00:04:06.110> just<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.410> see<00:04:06.590> if<00:04:06.709> I<00:04:06.830> can<00:04:07.010> do

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
and kargh Island just to see if I can do

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.370 
and kargh Island just to see if I can do
it<00:04:07.160> but<00:04:07.760> as<00:04:07.880> you<00:04:07.910> guys<00:04:08.090> can<00:04:08.270> imagine<00:04:08.360> I<00:04:08.930> wasn't

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
it but as you guys can imagine I wasn't

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.870 
it but as you guys can imagine I wasn't
all<00:04:09.470> that<00:04:09.500> successful<00:04:09.800> with<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.400> I<00:04:10.520> wasn't

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
all that successful with it I wasn't

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.670 
all that successful with it I wasn't
able<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.120> get<00:04:11.209> a<00:04:11.239> kill<00:04:11.480> here<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:11.900> there<00:04:12.110> but<00:04:12.560> it

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
able to get a kill here and there but it

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.650 
able to get a kill here and there but it
ultimately<00:04:12.800> just<00:04:13.520> resulted<00:04:14.120> in<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.300> whole<00:04:14.450> lot

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
ultimately just resulted in a whole lot

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.020 
ultimately just resulted in a whole lot
of<00:04:14.750> frustration<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:15.920> stuck<00:04:16.430> with<00:04:16.609> Team

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
of frustration and so I stuck with Team

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.270 
of frustration and so I stuck with Team
Deathmatch<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.660> stuck<00:04:17.959> with<00:04:18.169> maps<00:04:18.410> that<00:04:18.739> had<00:04:18.980> a

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
Deathmatch I stuck with maps that had a

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.650 
Deathmatch I stuck with maps that had a
lot<00:04:19.520> of<00:04:19.760> cover<00:04:20.000> so<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.270> I<00:04:20.359> could<00:04:20.510> take

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
lot of cover so that I could take

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.330 
lot of cover so that I could take
advantage<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:21.260> that<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.590> try<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.799> flank<00:04:22.130> my

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
advantage of that to try to flank my

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.340 
advantage of that to try to flank my
enemies<00:04:22.729> and<00:04:22.910> kind<00:04:23.390> of<00:04:23.479> close<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.020> gap<00:04:24.200> on

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
enemies and kind of close the gap on

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.800 
enemies and kind of close the gap on
them<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:24.890> the<00:04:25.250> aftermath<00:04:25.729> DLC<00:04:26.180> was<00:04:26.390> also

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
them and so the aftermath DLC was also

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.170 
them and so the aftermath DLC was also
great<00:04:27.020> but<00:04:27.560> ultimately<00:04:28.250> just<00:04:28.610> came<00:04:28.790> down<00:04:29.030> to

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
great but ultimately just came down to

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.360 
great but ultimately just came down to
me<00:04:29.300> trying<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.990> flank<00:04:30.230> my<00:04:30.440> enemy<00:04:30.800> as<00:04:30.980> well<00:04:31.040> as

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
me trying to flank my enemy as well as

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.490 
me trying to flank my enemy as well as
possible<00:04:31.820> try<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.060> catch<00:04:32.270> them<00:04:32.480> off-guard<00:04:32.660> try

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
possible try to catch them off-guard try

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.230 
possible try to catch them off-guard try
to<00:04:33.560> close<00:04:33.919> the<00:04:33.950> gap<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:34.550> I'm<00:04:34.610> not<00:04:34.820> working<00:04:35.210> with

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
to close the gap so I'm not working with

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.870 
to close the gap so I'm not working with
twelve<00:04:35.780> damaged<00:04:36.169> a<00:04:36.260> shot<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:36.740> then<00:04:37.520> just<00:04:37.730> kind

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
twelve damaged a shot and then just kind

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.280 
twelve damaged a shot and then just kind
of<00:04:37.910> crossing<00:04:38.300> my<00:04:38.389> fingers<00:04:38.419> hoping<00:04:38.930> that<00:04:39.260> I

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
of crossing my fingers hoping that I

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.720 
of crossing my fingers hoping that I
maybe<00:04:39.500> get<00:04:39.770> a<00:04:39.800> couple<00:04:40.010> of<00:04:40.190> head<00:04:40.310> shots<00:04:40.550> in

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
maybe get a couple of head shots in

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.340 
maybe get a couple of head shots in
there<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.180> get<00:04:41.270> a<00:04:41.330> little<00:04:41.750> bit<00:04:41.930> of<00:04:42.020> that<00:04:42.110> head

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
there to get a little bit of that head

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.800 
there to get a little bit of that head
shot<00:04:42.590> multiplier<00:04:43.100> and<00:04:43.460> hope<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:44.540> maybe

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
shot multiplier and hope that maybe

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.659 
shot multiplier and hope that maybe
they're<00:04:45.050> not<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.320> best<00:04:45.470> shot<00:04:45.710> as<00:04:45.860> well<00:04:46.010> so

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
they're not the best shot as well so

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.940 
they're not the best shot as well so
this<00:04:46.850> was<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.300> very<00:04:47.360> difficult<00:04:48.080> challenge<00:04:48.889> and

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
this was a very difficult challenge and

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.370 
this was a very difficult challenge and
it<00:04:49.100> wasn't<00:04:49.280> easy<00:04:49.580> going<00:04:50.120> on<00:04:50.270> any<00:04:50.570> sort<00:04:50.930> of<00:04:51.139> kill

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
it wasn't easy going on any sort of kill

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.560 
it wasn't easy going on any sort of kill
streak<00:04:51.650> so<00:04:51.889> well<00:04:52.430> done<00:04:52.669> with<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.000> suggestion

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
streak so well done with the suggestion

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.200 
streak so well done with the suggestion
I<00:04:53.750> would<00:04:54.050> not<00:04:54.200> recommend<00:04:54.530> ever<00:04:55.400> trying<00:04:55.880> this<00:04:56.060> I

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
I would not recommend ever trying this I

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.520 
I would not recommend ever trying this I
don't<00:04:56.360> even<00:04:56.450> know<00:04:56.660> why<00:04:56.900> there<00:04:57.350> is<00:04:57.500> a

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
don't even know why there is a

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.670 
don't even know why there is a
single-shot<00:04:58.490> mode<00:04:58.820> for<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.570> pp19<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.500> just

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
single-shot mode for the pp19 it just

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.800 
single-shot mode for the pp19 it just
seems<00:05:00.860> ridiculous<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.700> I<00:05:01.940> have<00:05:02.060> no<00:05:02.270> idea<00:05:02.300> why

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
seems ridiculous and I have no idea why

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.360 
seems ridiculous and I have no idea why
anyone<00:05:03.080> would<00:05:03.560> want<00:05:03.740> to<00:05:03.800> use<00:05:04.070> it
