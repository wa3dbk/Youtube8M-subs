flight testing the airplane has shown
plenty<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.370> power<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.849> takeoff<00:00:12.300> but<00:00:12.960> how<00:00:13.200> would

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
plenty of power on takeoff but how would

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.320 
plenty of power on takeoff but how would
it<00:00:13.410> handle<00:00:13.740> all<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.190> energy<00:00:14.580> if<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.089> had<00:00:15.210> to

suddenly stop in the emergency event

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.400 
suddenly stop in the emergency event
that<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.420> make<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> rejected<00:00:19.109> takeoff

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
that we have to make a rejected takeoff

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.689 
that we have to make a rejected takeoff
at<00:00:19.650> these<00:00:19.800> heavy<00:00:20.130> weights

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
at these heavy weights

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.160 
at these heavy weights
it<00:00:21.000> takes<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.330> long<00:00:21.480> distance<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
it takes a long distance for the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.540 
it takes a long distance for the
airplane<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.560> stop<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.039> just<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.460> your

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
airplane to stop it's just like in your

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.189 
airplane to stop it's just like in your
car<00:00:23.760> cap<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.330> court<00:00:24.510> bonding<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.050> Boeing

tests<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.769> evaluation<00:00:26.400> team<00:00:26.609> are<00:00:26.880> about<00:00:27.180> to

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
tests and evaluation team are about to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.089 
tests and evaluation team are about to
put<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> airplane<00:00:28.109> through<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> ultimate

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
put the airplane through the ultimate

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.930 
put the airplane through the ultimate
rejected<00:00:29.699> takeoff<00:00:30.090> or<00:00:30.420> RTO<00:00:31.489> first<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.730> crew

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
rejected takeoff or RTO first the crew

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.569 
rejected takeoff or RTO first the crew
installs<00:00:33.180> instead<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.809> 100%<00:00:34.380> worn-out<00:00:35.219> brakes

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
installs instead of 100% worn-out brakes

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.850 
installs instead of 100% worn-out brakes
so<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.480> down<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> studs<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.469> if<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> ever

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
so it's down to the studs so if you ever

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.900 
so it's down to the studs so if you ever
have<00:00:38.040> your<00:00:38.160> own<00:00:38.280> brakes<00:00:38.489> they've<00:00:38.670> got<00:00:38.879> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
have your own brakes they've got a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.310 
have your own brakes they've got a
machine<00:00:39.329> down<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:39.989> there's<00:00:40.170> this

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
machine down and so there's this

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.250 
machine down and so there's this
basically<00:00:40.800> no<00:00:41.070> material<00:00:41.579> left<00:00:42.260> technicians

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
basically no material left technicians

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.350 
basically no material left technicians
also<00:00:43.530> fuel<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> airplane<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.760> maximum

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
also fuel the airplane up to maximum

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.910 
also fuel the airplane up to maximum
