00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.520
 Hello Nita In the kitchen you are welcome. 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.660
 Today we are going to make, tamarind sour sweet chutney 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.420
 Tamarind Sour Sweet Chutneys 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.700

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.080
 This will surely double the taste of your breakfast, such as 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.600
 You can add it to Kachori, Samosa, Crispy, 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.980
 Yogurt can serve with bigger and more. 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.660
 It is very easy to make and it soon becomes. 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.600
 So let's see the tamarind sour to make sweet sauce. 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.340
 What things do we need? 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.200
 To make tamarind chutney we need 100 gram tamarind, 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.580
 We have taken 100 grams of jaggery here 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.920
 If you do not have good at home 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.180
 You can also use sugar instead of good 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.820
 And if you prefer to eat more sweet then you 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.140
 Instead of 100 grams jaggery, you can also use 200 grams of jaggery. 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.820
 Then we need, 1/4 teaspoon - red chilli powder, 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.100
 1/4 teaspoon - Saundh, 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.900
 1/4 teaspoon - roasted cumin powder 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.300
 If you want to make nourishment and roasted cumin powder in the house 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.440
 So you can watch both of these videos of mine. 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.760
 Then we need 1/4 teaspoon - whole coriander 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.000
 If you do not have whole coriander, 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.240
 So you do not take it, this is optional. 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.180
 1/4 teaspoon - black salt, 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 Plain salt according to taste 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.020
 And as per the water required 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.160
 We have turned on the gas. 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.760
 On that we will keep a single embroidery and pour one cup of water in it. 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.060
 When the water gets hot then we will put tamarind in it. 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.960
 Now our water has become hot, 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.480
 Now we will put tamarind in water 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.160
 We will slow down the gas and cover tamarind, 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.960
 For about 2 to 3 minutes or until our tamarind fails to soften 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.060
 After about 3 minutes we will see, our tamarind becomes soft 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.200
 And its pulp is also gone. 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.040
 If you feel less water while boiling tamarind, 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.520
 You can increase the amount of water in it 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.800
 And in the meantime it is also to run a couple times. 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.440
 By which our tamarind does not stick to the bottom. 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.860
 The tummy has left anus (pulp) therefore 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.600
 Now we will stop the gas and let it cool down. 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.400
 Now our tamarind anal (pulp) has become cold. 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.500
 Now we will filter it with the help of sieve. 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.260
 If you do not want to make tamarind pulp in the house. 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.200
 So you can buy it from the market also. 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.780
 This grocery store will be easily available to you 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.780
 Now we are ready to make this tamarind pulp. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.140
 Now we will put it in the embroidery on the current gas, and 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.000
 Insert it well. If you put a piece of jaggery into it. 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.680
 So it melts easily here. 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.220
 Until now our jaggars do not melt 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.080
 Until then we will continue to run and cook it. 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.620
 If you find a chutney car then you 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.760
 Add a little more water to it 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.640
 Our good has melted. Now we will shut the gas 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.320
 And put all the spices in it like 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.380
 Red pepper powder, 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.500
 Dry Ginger Powder 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.200
 Roasted cumin powder, 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.140
 Whole coriander, 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.140
 Black Salt 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.920
 And plain salt 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.500
 And get everyone together well. 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.780
 Now let us cool it down. 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.280
 Our chutney is ready. 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.760
 After cooling, we will take it out in a vessel. 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.980
 Now this is our tamarind chutney. 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.800
 Now you put it in a glass air-tight burney 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.700
 Kept in the fridge and its 15 days 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.080
 Lift up with hot hot breakfast. 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.680
 Now you also make it and share your experience with me.
