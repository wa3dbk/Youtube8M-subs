00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
I mean the two basic commands that the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
I mean the two basic commands that the
gorilla<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.790> use<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.299> mean<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.439> realistic<00:01:20.090> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
gorilla can use I mean so realistic the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
farting I don't know if this can kill

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.109 
farting I don't know if this can kill
them<00:01:35.780> this<00:01:36.780> could<00:01:37.020> kill<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.470> humans<00:01:37.909> but<00:01:38.909> I
