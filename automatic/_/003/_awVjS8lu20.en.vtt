00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.466
- HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT TODAY,

00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.700
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.666
YOU KNOW HOW IT'S ANNOYING

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.300
WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT THEIR DREAMS?

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.733
I MEAN, HONESTLY.

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.600
YOU KNOW, LIKE, PEOPLE TELL YOU
ABOUT THEIR DREAMS,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.833
AND IT'S BORING.

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.733
IT'S TEDIOUS AND NOT FUN,

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.733
UNLESS THEY'RE MINE.

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.533
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.533
IN THE OLD NOGGIN.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.000
THIS IS WHAT I WAS DREAMING.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.366
LAST NIGHT I HAD A DREAM,
IT WAS THE DAY OF THE OSCARS,

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:25.500
AND I HAD DONE NOTHING AT ALL
TO PREPARE FOR THEM,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.700
SO THE GOOD NEWS IS,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.466
I'M NOT STRESSED ABOUT
THE OSCARS AT ALL.

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.466
THAT'S GOOD.

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.466
BUT IT WAS A SCARY DREAM,

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.166
BECAUSE IT FELT REAL, YOU KNOW?

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.066
AND 'CAUSE ALL THE BIG STARS
WERE OUT IN THE AUDITORIUM,

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.766
AND THEY'RE WAITING
FOR THE CEREMONY TO START,

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.366
AND I'M ALL DRESSED UP.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.100
I HAVE MY GRILLS IN MY TEETH.
MY HAIR'S IN A FRENCH TWIST.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.266
SO REAL.

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.500
AND--'CAUSE PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,
THEY--

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.933
PEOPLE DREAM ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
WORK AND STRESS

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.166
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.866
HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE
HAVE WORK STRESS DREAMS?

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.600
YEAH?
YEAH?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.933
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE SEXY DREAMS
ABOUT COWORKERS?

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:59.400
[laughter]

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.000
THAT'S NOT RELATED.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.833
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHAT KIND
OF AUDIENCE I'M DEALING WITH.

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:05.533
APPARENTLY WORK STRESS DREAMS
ARE COMMON.

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.933
I READ THAT 57% OF PEOPLE
HAVE NIGHTMARES

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.366
ABOUT THEIR JOBS,

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.233
AND PEOPLE DREAM
THAT THEY'RE, YOU KNOW,

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:12.433
LATE FOR IMPORTANT MEETINGS

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:14.200
OR THEIR COMPUTER FILES
HAVE DISAPPEARED

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.033
OR THEY SHOW UP TO WORK NAKED.

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:18.133
ANY DREAMT THAT?
ANYONE?

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.166
YEAH?

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.400
I'VE NEVER HAD THAT DREAM,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.866
BUT ONE TIME I DID SHOW UP
TO WORK NAKED,

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.766
BUT IT WAS THE '70s,
SO IT MADE SENSE.

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.033
I SOLD 400 VACUUM CLEANERS
THAT DAY.

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:29.500
THAT'S...

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.800
DID VERY WELL.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.666
I THINK IT'S FASCINATING
HOW OUR BRAINS WORK,

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.000
BECAUSE I DID NOT EVEN KNOW
I WAS STRESSED ABOUT THE OSCARS,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
BUT MY SUBCONSCIOUS TOLD ME
THAT I WAS.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.133
THANKS, BRAIN.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.900
I MEAN, WHY WOULD I BE STRESSED
ABOUT HOSTING

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.166
A THREE-HOUR LIVE AWARD SHOW
IN FRONT OF A BILLION PEOPLE

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.966
FROM AROUND THE WORLD
WHO HAVE AN OPINION

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:48.000
ABOUT EVERY SINGLE THING
THAT YOU DO?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.766
NOT TO MENTION HAVING TO BE
ON THE RED CARPET,

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:53.900
WITH THAT 360-DEGREE GLAM CAM
ON E!.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.933
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.800
LUCKILY IF YOU'RE HAVING
STRESS DREAMS,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.500
THEY ARE WAYS FOR YOUR BODY
TO GET RID OF STRESS

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.766
WHILE YOU'RE AWAKE,

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:01.800
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT
TO SAY.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.866
YOU SHOULD...

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:03.933
audience:
DANCE.

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:04.933
- DRINK TEQUILA.

00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:07.200
BUT YOU CAN ALSO...

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.200
ALSO DANCE.
