00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello after a long time thinking 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.620
 an original idea to do something 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.230
 different in the channel and that there is not 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.170
 done nobody on youtube I thought of it 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.670
 an idea that the truth is that I miss 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 that nobody has thought of before 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.620
 but well, I'm going, the idea is that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.880
 I will 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.880
 make a gameplay 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.060
 What do you think the fuck is not, there's no 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.700
 very good everyone here you will arrive 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.100
 broadcasting live today I bring you 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.110
 a solitaire gameplay a great game 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.210
 that surely many of you do not 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.880
 you will know so I 'll explain 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.340
 briefly what is this good game what 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.010
 which is basically worth this game 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.900
 is to put in these four nights more 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.210
 from here it's worth I suppose you'll see 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.710
 because put the extra mouse size 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.750
 great because some cerrato that does not 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.420
 see so you can see it worth but 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.130
 well in these four here you have to go 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.690
 putting the different sticks of the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.790
 shuffle that in this case it will be a deck 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.500
 of poker we are going to use 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.220
 As you can see from the boxes the cv 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.540
 jota and you have to go putting the least 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.430
 to greater 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.270
 It's worth what it would be us 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.300
 j 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.770
 and here it's okay, it's not, it's not very difficult 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.900
 game dynamics get caught right away 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.990
 although the game may well be 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.600
 another sing good worth we go little by little 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.979
 you have to go a little moving the cards 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.260
 ok to know what we can 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.530
 find 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.590
 one thing that I advise you to do 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.200
 when you play when you look at the first as this 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.910
 It already looks good one thing that I 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.430
 I advise you to do is to go 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.020
 moving these cards from here to go 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.520
 turning over these cards there are 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.260
 here below it's worth it because they can be 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.480
 letters that in the future of the game are 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.950
 important, then, as soon as you have 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.100
 the opportunity to move these 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.070
 things here please move them because 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.740
 you will get rid of 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.520
 of problems you might have after 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.970
 do not 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.010
 good because I chose the solitary 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.960
 sincerely choose this game 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.000
 because I think it 's the game that is 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.850
 Blanca adds Spain is a game that is 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.240
 super dynamic milk you move a 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.830
 heap a lot of action tension e 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.080
 intrigue because that is very clear 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.030
 delivery voltage because as you see here 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.370
 you never know what is going to touch you in this 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.780
 mallet not then is a delivery that 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.690
 I can not with me for example now to see 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.930
 12 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.940
 I'm not worth it because it 's black beige 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.680
 He delivering had at that time to 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.170
 that it has become clear to me that then 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.390
 I leave it electric because it does not work 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.800
 this 2 even though it's black because I do not 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.900
 Even though this is for example from 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.630
 different for 3 and 2 as can 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.940
 see is not valid because they have to be of 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.040
 Same color is valid or they are different 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.930
 color forgiveness although they are different 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.930
 stick has to be of different color 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.450
 so that's why it has not been valid now 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.930
 I can not get a bloody letter 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.670
 red so that it does not put the good thing that 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.430
 has this game is that if you hit the h 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.989
 It is worth recommending movements for 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.940
 do for example now more recommended 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.150
 this and I have a new here perfect 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.790
 that has come to me great another great ace 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.520
 Well, this is already going well here 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.520
 three aces in none of this game what 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.400
 we have finished 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.900
 well look over there let's go if we can go 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.840
 putting letters and then we're going 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.840
 putting it is much better and then 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.070
 that's how we get rid of letters before 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.180
 decided to make a gameplay that 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.950
 surely you are also 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.710
 asking apart from why chosen 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.210
 this game because I have chosen you 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.070
 decided to make a gameplay because 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.110
 lately the gamer community like that 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.820
 it's off I do not know only you what 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.670
 you will have noticed also that lately 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.040
 nobody wants to make gameplays anymore 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.250
 gamers become bloggers here the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.610
 past world of the gameplay there and then no 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.010
 it's not cool dude the gameplay is something that's 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.740
 great is a community that in my opinion 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.630
 it has a lot of diversity is not that 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.290
 all play the minecraft already at the call of 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.590
 duty you know is not something much more diverse 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.270
 that has a lot more wealth than that 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.000
 so I 'm not from this video 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.910
 a bit to 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.280
 to encourage gamers to return to 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.350
 make gameplays that do not leave this 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.790
 world because it's great and on youtube 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.730
 there is room for everyone to 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.730
 bloggers for gamers then 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.320
 because I play this game as well as 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.760
 because that's what I give you an idea for 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.400
 that when they want to continue doing 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.550
 gameplays then I can play this game 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:52.480
 which is a pretty fun game and that 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:56.470
 hey he can play him what 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.540
 as its name indicates shit worth 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.060
 this must be like the tenth time that I 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.970
 it happens already today 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.560
 so I'm going to leave it here it's worth 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.169
 You see contessa that this little screen 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.169
 here it means that you are a coffee and 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.970
 that you do not know how to play solitaire then 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.650
 Well, just the kiss ends 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.760
 the game and that 's it 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.980
 and nothing this has been all for today we 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.990
 we see in the next video that I suppose 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:24.419
 that there will be there until then 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.419
 favorites subscribe and goodbye
