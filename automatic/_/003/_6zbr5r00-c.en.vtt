00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.250 

why<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.159> green<00:01:24.579> trim

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.600 
side panels or the different colors are
that's<00:01:31.240> why<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.480> trim<00:01:31.810> is<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.170> way
