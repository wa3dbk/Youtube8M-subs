improvisational star so it's basically

and which is why when you watch the DVDs

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.760 
and which is why when you watch the DVDs
there's<00:03:03.300> like<00:03:03.450> hours<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.230> hours<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.650> hours

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
of extra footage and I wonder if there's

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.750 
of extra footage and I wonder if there's
kind<00:03:06.960> of<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.080> lack<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.380> trust<00:03:08.100> or<00:03:08.340> lack<00:03:08.490> of<00:03:08.520> face

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
kind of a lack of trust or lack of face

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.370 
kind of a lack of trust or lack of face
because<00:03:09.330> there's<00:03:09.510> something<00:03:09.720> about<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:10.170> that

leading-man<00:03:57.360> quality<00:03:57.900> alone<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.230> think

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
leading-man quality alone I think

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.730 
leading-man quality alone I think
