our<00:03:00.080> course<00:03:00.560> is<00:03:00.800> really<00:03:01.610> quite<00:03:01.880> unique

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
our course is really quite unique

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.620 
our course is really quite unique
because<00:03:02.780> we're<00:03:03.740> a<00:03:03.770> specialist<00:03:04.370> college<00:03:04.760> so

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
because we're a specialist college so

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.750 
because we're a specialist college so
whereas<00:03:06.080> mainstream<00:03:06.740> colleges<00:03:06.980> may<00:03:07.580> offer

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
whereas mainstream colleges may offer

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.990 
whereas mainstream colleges may offer
work<00:03:08.270> placements<00:03:09.020> they<00:03:09.920> may<00:03:10.160> perhaps<00:03:10.550> not

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
work placements they may perhaps not

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.790 
work placements they may perhaps not
offer<00:03:11.180> quite<00:03:11.480> as<00:03:11.690> much<00:03:11.870> support<00:03:12.080> as<00:03:12.590> our

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
offer quite as much support as our

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.930 
offer quite as much support as our
students<00:03:13.310> get<00:03:13.490> here

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
students get here

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.120 
students get here
so<00:03:14.420> our<00:03:14.870> work<00:03:15.110> placements<00:03:15.620> are<00:03:15.709> tailored<00:03:16.100> to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
so our work placements are tailored to

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.449 
so our work placements are tailored to
the<00:03:16.370> individual<00:03:16.910> students<00:03:18.010> abilities<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.370> to

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
the individual students abilities and to

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.340 
the individual students abilities and to
their<00:03:19.610> interests<00:03:20.270> and<00:03:20.450> then<00:03:20.870> we<00:03:21.020> have<00:03:21.200> that

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
their interests and then we have that

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.260 
their interests and then we have that
one-to-one<00:03:21.770> support<00:03:22.100> out<00:03:22.520> in<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.790> workplace

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
one-to-one support out in the workplace

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.030 
one-to-one support out in the workplace
for<00:03:23.570> their<00:03:23.840> individual<00:03:24.350> placements<00:03:24.890> when

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
for their individual placements when

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.300 
for their individual placements when
they<00:03:25.190> start<00:03:25.550> off<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.570> they're<00:03:26.870> more<00:03:27.739> likely<00:03:27.800> to

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
they start off so they're more likely to

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.640 
they start off so they're more likely to
succeed<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:29.030> think<00:03:29.569> that<00:03:29.810> that<00:03:30.080> gives<00:03:30.260> us<00:03:30.440> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
succeed I think that that gives us the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.170 
succeed I think that that gives us the
leading<00:03:31.010> edge<00:03:31.190> over<00:03:31.910> many<00:03:32.090> other

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
leading edge over many other

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.240 
leading edge over many other
establishments<00:03:33.140> if<00:03:33.680> you're<00:03:33.860> between<00:03:34.040> the
