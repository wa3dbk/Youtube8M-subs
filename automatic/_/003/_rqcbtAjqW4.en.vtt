00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.650
 two 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.940
 and 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.270
 in the school company area 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.920
 European coaching team we work 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.410
 service of organizations of all kinds 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.529
 of sizes basically from a premise 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.410
 main and that is 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.050
 the organizations the companies have 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.350
 for goal to get results for 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.850
 hold on time but of course these 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.239
 results although it seems like a truism 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.940
 they are only achieved through one thing and 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.829
 is the concrete behaviors of 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.149
 people who compose it 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.579
 therefore the great challenges of the 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.460
 organizations to this day consist of no 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.120
 only in hiring the best and attracting 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.739
 talent but mostly and basically 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.899
 develop internal talent and for 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.330
 so much to make those who already have 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:11.390
 hired for that 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.190
 Our mission is to assist and accompany 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.910
 the organization in touching those 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.830
 levers that enhance the development of 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.390
 talent and the development therefore of 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.030
 performance and performance of 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.070
 people in the systemic context of a 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.750
 organization by our experience 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.730
 these levers are not usually 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.900
 technical skills because those that we 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.880
 we usually find is that you are 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.480
 Technical skills are usually very 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.520
 well worked normally therefore 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.350
 the key levers to enhance these 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.060
 results are usually elsewhere 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.270
 more transversal competencies that 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.100
 they have to do with self-confidence with 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.640
 ability to coordinate actions with 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.570
 others lead 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.430
 vision and so on 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.470
 it is not work therefore consists in 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.020
 assist organizations in designs 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.760
 strategic or more concrete designs of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.580
 intervention programs within 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.560
 organization at different levels within 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.450
 of what the chain of command is to both 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.770
 senior management as to editing committees 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.280
 middle managers and our 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.940
 organization to get new 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.010
 ways of acting more effectively and that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.900
 enhance results not only from 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.820
 people but also people 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.330
 those who lead and who you are at 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.460
 service 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.140
 we really do not just make programs 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.490
 of intervention and consulting and 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.690
 advice of that kind of 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.180
 interventions but also 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.790
 we accompany in the delivery or accompany 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.970
 in monitoring and measuring the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.930
 impact of all these programs on the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.049
 result of the organization 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.420
 without results there is no coaching therefore 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.909
 our challenge is to accompany the challenges of 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.239
 the organization to strengthen the 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.989
 expected results and to overcome them in 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.989
 the average possible
