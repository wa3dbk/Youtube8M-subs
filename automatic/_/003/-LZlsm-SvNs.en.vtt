what's up summoners I have found that
for<00:00:02.190> mid<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.520> low<00:00:02.639> level<00:00:02.970> players<00:00:03.240> that

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
for mid and low level players that

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.640 
for mid and low level players that
playing<00:00:03.720> jungle<00:00:04.140> can<00:00:04.290> be<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.500> hardest

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
playing jungle can be the hardest

playing jungle can be the hardest
position<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.310> play<00:00:05.400> effectively<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.899> isn't

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
position to play effectively this isn't

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.900 
position to play effectively this isn't
because<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:07.680> requires<00:00:08.040> insane<00:00:08.250> amount<00:00:08.849> of

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
because it requires insane amount of

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.730 
because it requires insane amount of
mechanics<00:00:09.389> or<00:00:09.540> has<00:00:09.750> difficult<00:00:10.230> combos<00:00:10.590> to

pull<00:00:10.920> off<00:00:11.099> but<00:00:11.610> rather<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.120> requires<00:00:12.570> a

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
pull off but rather that it requires a

I think you'll find your job as a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.830 
I think you'll find your job as a
jungler<00:00:25.410> way<00:00:25.859> easier<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:27.300> first<00:00:27.539> requirement

jungler way easier the first requirement

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.140 
jungler way easier the first requirement
of<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.199> good<00:00:28.380> jungler<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.980> also<00:00:29.519> my<00:00:29.640> first<00:00:29.849> tip

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
of a good jungler and also my first tip

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.720 
of a good jungler and also my first tip
is<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.869> patience<00:00:31.380> especially<00:00:32.189> when

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
is to have patience especially when

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.310 
is to have patience especially when
you're<00:00:32.880> ganking<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.050> wait<00:00:34.200> until

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
you're ganking you have to wait until

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.870 
you're ganking you have to wait until
the<00:00:34.500> perfect<00:00:34.920> moment<00:00:35.070> for<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> gank<00:00:35.730> is

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the perfect moment for you to gank is

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.330 
the perfect moment for you to gank is
present<00:00:36.500> oftentimes<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.890> means<00:00:38.100> waiting

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
present oftentimes this means waiting

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.970 
present oftentimes this means waiting
for<00:00:38.579> an<00:00:38.640> enemy<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.059> use<00:00:39.239> their<00:00:39.450> escapes<00:00:39.980> thus

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
for an enemy to use their escapes thus

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920 
for an enemy to use their escapes thus
allowing<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.610> close<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.059> them<00:00:42.300> I've

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
allowing you to close in on them I've

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.840 
allowing you to close in on them I've
seen<00:00:43.230> many<00:00:43.469> junglers<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.219> go<00:00:44.370> right<00:00:44.579> into<00:00:44.760> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
seen many junglers just go right into a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.490 
seen many junglers just go right into a
lane<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.510> absolutely<00:00:45.960> nothing<00:00:46.140> out<00:00:46.440> of

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
lane and get absolutely nothing out of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.529 
lane and get absolutely nothing out of
it<00:00:46.680> simply<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.940> first<00:00:48.120> could<00:00:48.329> just

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
it simply because the first could just

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.900 
it simply because the first could just
run<00:00:48.690> away<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.770> actually<00:00:50.100> ends<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.579> hurting

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
run away this actually ends up hurting

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.209 
run away this actually ends up hurting
you<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.710> end<00:00:52.890> up<00:00:53.039> wasting

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
you if you do this as you end up wasting

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.220 
you if you do this as you end up wasting
time<00:00:53.640> time<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> could<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.020> spent

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
time time that you could have spent

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.990 
time time that you could have spent
somewhere<00:00:55.469> else<00:00:55.710> doing<00:00:56.430> something<00:00:56.550> useful

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
somewhere else doing something useful

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.549 
somewhere else doing something useful
notice<00:00:57.600> how<00:00:57.719> I'm<00:00:57.840> sitting<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> bush

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
notice how I'm sitting in the bush

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.290 
notice how I'm sitting in the bush
waiting<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.219> said<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.520> use<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> shadow<00:01:00.000> dash

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
waiting for said to use the shadow dash

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.139 
waiting for said to use the shadow dash
while<00:01:01.230> I'm<00:01:01.440> waiting<00:01:01.649> I'm<00:01:01.980> also<00:01:02.550> looking<00:01:02.789> at<00:01:03.000> my

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
while I'm waiting I'm also looking at my

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.299 
while I'm waiting I'm also looking at my
mini<00:01:03.329> map<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> scan<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> field<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.470> know<00:01:05.040> that

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
mini map to scan the field I know that

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.920 
mini map to scan the field I know that
the<00:01:05.400> enemy<00:01:05.549> jungler<00:01:06.090> started<00:01:06.479> blue<00:01:06.689> and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the enemy jungler started blue and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.480 
the enemy jungler started blue and
because<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.530> both<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.740> my<00:01:08.010> bus<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.400> I'm

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
because I have both of my bus and I'm

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670 
because I have both of my bus and I'm
ganking<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.090> expect<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.780> she<00:01:10.020> too<00:01:10.229> will<00:01:10.380> also

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
ganking I expect that she too will also

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.160 
ganking I expect that she too will also
be<00:01:10.799> ganking<00:01:11.100> either<00:01:11.340> mitt<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.610> top<00:01:12.020> because<00:01:13.020> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
be ganking either mitt or top because it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.390 
be ganking either mitt or top because it
looked<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.619> would<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.860> getting<00:01:14.070> nothing

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
looked like I would be getting nothing

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.010 
looked like I would be getting nothing
out<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.729> mid<00:01:14.880> lane<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.299> at<00:01:15.630> least<00:01:15.750> made

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
out of the mid lane and at least made

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.289 
out of the mid lane and at least made
her<00:01:16.110> presence<00:01:16.470> known<00:01:16.680> top<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.340> now<00:01:18.119> go

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
her presence known top I now go

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.050 
her presence known top I now go
encounter<00:01:18.810> gank<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> kill<00:01:19.729> by<00:01:20.729> staying

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
encounter gank for the kill by staying

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.460 
encounter gank for the kill by staying
in<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> general<00:01:21.600> proximity<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.170> where<00:01:22.290> I

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
in the general proximity of where I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.070 
in the general proximity of where I
think<00:01:22.710> Elise<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.520> allow<00:01:24.479> myself<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.960> be

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
think Elise is I allow myself to be

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.899 
think Elise is I allow myself to be
responsive<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.590> her<00:01:25.770> actions<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.460> does<00:01:26.729> put

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
responsive to her actions and does put

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.929 
responsive to her actions and does put
my<00:01:27.030> team<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> favorable<00:01:27.840> position<00:01:28.610> I'm<00:01:29.610> able

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
my team in a favorable position I'm able

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.609 
my team in a favorable position I'm able
to<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.479> because<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.320> general

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
to do this because I have a general

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.069 
to do this because I have a general
sense<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.950> where<00:01:32.159> she<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> map<00:01:33.079> which
