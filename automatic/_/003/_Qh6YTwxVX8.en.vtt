they've come out with where the vehicle

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.240 
they've come out with where the vehicle
itself<00:00:21.480> looks<00:00:22.050> pretty<00:00:22.289> normal<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:22.830> we'll<00:00:23.160> get

pretty<00:00:27.480> straightforward<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.410> made<00:00:28.590> for

but here's the real story with the RC

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.080 
but here's the real story with the RC
touch<00:00:39.510> system<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.129> touch<00:00:41.610> screen

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
touch system it is the touch screen

touch system it is the touch screen
controller<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.930> see<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.230> looks<00:00:43.410> kind<00:00:43.620> of

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
controller you can see it looks kind of

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.860 
controller you can see it looks kind of
like<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.829> smartphone<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.850> got<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> flat

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
like a smartphone it's just got a flat

surface to it very glossy and very slick
and<00:00:49.379> sleek<00:00:49.829> there<00:00:50.399> are<00:00:50.550> no<00:00:50.700> buttons<00:00:51.059> that

and sleek there are no buttons that
stand<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.620> touch<00:00:53.160> different<00:00:53.879> parts

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
stand up you just touch different parts

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.330 
stand up you just touch different parts
of<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> controller<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:56.070> what

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
of the controller to get it to do what

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.920 
of the controller to get it to do what
you<00:00:56.489> wanted<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.840> go

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you wanted to do so if you want to go

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.840 
you wanted to do so if you want to go
forward<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.440> touch<00:00:58.949> forward<00:00:59.489> I'll<00:00:59.699> go

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
forward you just touch forward I'll go

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.369 
forward you just touch forward I'll go
reverse<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.510> touch<00:01:00.690> reverse<00:01:01.020> left

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
reverse you just touch reverse left

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.439 
reverse you just touch reverse left
right<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:02.129> all<00:01:02.280> there<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.059> little<00:01:03.270> hard

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
right it's all there it's a little hard

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.969 
right it's all there it's a little hard
to<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.870> all<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> studio<00:01:04.409> lights<00:01:04.710> going

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
to see with all the studio lights going

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.820 
to see with all the studio lights going
but<00:01:05.309> these<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:06.119> fully<00:01:06.570> lit<00:01:06.930> they're<00:01:07.290> backlit

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
but these are fully lit they're backlit

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.859 
but these are fully lit they're backlit
and<00:01:08.070> whichever<00:01:08.729> direction<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.630> don't

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
and whichever direction that you don't

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.870 
and whichever direction that you don't
select<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.650> turns<00:01:10.920> off<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.520> actually

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
select just turns off it's actually

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
select just turns off it's actually
relatively<00:01:12.570> easy<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.439> even<00:01:13.710> in

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
relatively easy to see this even in

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
relatively easy to see this even in
daylight<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.549> little<00:01:14.760> bit<00:01:14.880> easier<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.299> tell

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
daylight a little bit easier to tell

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.289 
daylight a little bit easier to tell
than<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.799> video<00:01:17.130> when<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.000> comes<00:01:18.150> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
than on this video when it comes to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.929 
than on this video when it comes to
driving<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.229> nothing<00:01:19.710> too<00:01:19.950> special<00:01:20.310> but

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
driving it it's nothing too special but

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.510 
driving it it's nothing too special but
not<00:01:21.360> completely<00:01:21.930> underwhelming<00:01:22.560> either<00:01:22.770> it

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
not completely underwhelming either it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.240 
not completely underwhelming either it
is<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.909> said<00:01:24.119> made<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.689> kids<00:01:24.930> ages<00:01:25.500> 6<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
is like I said made for kids ages 6 and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.320 
is like I said made for kids ages 6 and
up<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.640> don't<00:01:26.729> want<00:01:26.939> something<00:01:27.180> that's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
up so you don't want something that's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.810 
up so you don't want something that's
too<00:01:27.720> fast<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> little<00:01:29.250> bit<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
too fast but this is a little bit on the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.390 
too fast but this is a little bit on the
slow<00:01:30.060> side<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.320> tell<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:32.070> does

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
slow side I have to tell you it does

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.460 
slow side I have to tell you it does
take<00:01:32.700> some<00:01:32.939> getting<00:01:33.000> used<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:34.170> whole

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
take some getting used to that whole

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.679 
take some getting used to that whole
touch<00:01:34.920> screen<00:01:35.280> controller<00:01:35.759> thing<00:01:36.090> because

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
touch screen controller thing because

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.880 
touch screen controller thing because
you<00:01:36.780> don't<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.200> anything<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
you don't really have anything that you

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.069 
you don't really have anything that you
can<00:01:38.009> feel<00:01:38.430> underneath<00:01:38.729> your<00:01:39.270> fingers<00:01:39.720> unlike

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
can feel underneath your fingers unlike

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.170 
can feel underneath your fingers unlike
with<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.350> regular<00:01:40.799> controller<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.909> end<00:01:42.090> up

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
with a regular controller you end up

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.149 
with a regular controller you end up
having<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> look<00:01:43.020> at<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.439> controller<00:01:43.770> itself

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
having to look at the controller itself

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.100 
having to look at the controller itself
and<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.700> where<00:01:45.030> your<00:01:45.270> fingers<00:01:45.630> are<00:01:45.780> aligned

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
and see where your fingers are aligned

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.260 
and see where your fingers are aligned
up<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.920> takes<00:01:47.159> some<00:01:47.310> time<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.790> used<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
up it takes some time to get used to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.859 
up it takes some time to get used to
where<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.380> touch<00:01:50.000> activation<00:01:51.000> areas<00:01:51.509> are<00:01:51.840> on

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
where the touch activation areas are on

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.139 
where the touch activation areas are on
that<00:01:52.320> screen<00:01:52.729> eventually<00:01:53.729> you'll<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that screen eventually you'll get the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.880 
that screen eventually you'll get the
hang<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.540> but<00:01:54.810> when<00:01:55.439> you're<00:01:55.590> first

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
hang of it but when you're first

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.950 
hang of it but when you're first
learning<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.369> whoa<00:01:56.850> wait<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.299> minute<00:01:57.540> what's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
learning it whoa wait a minute what's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.280 
learning it whoa wait a minute what's
going<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.640> all<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.909> reverse<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.750> wasn't<00:02:01.110> me

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
going on all that reverse that wasn't me

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.499 
going on all that reverse that wasn't me
yeah<00:02:02.159> that's<00:02:02.700> another<00:02:02.969> thing<00:02:03.240> that's<00:02:03.360> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
yeah that's another thing that's a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.420 
yeah that's another thing that's a
little<00:02:03.719> bit<00:02:03.869> funky<00:02:04.200> about<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
little bit funky about this is that the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.550 
little bit funky about this is that the
touch<00:02:06.000> screen<00:02:06.299> controller<00:02:06.689> stems<00:02:07.049> sometimes

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
touch screen controller stems sometimes

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.639 
touch screen controller stems sometimes
it<00:02:07.710> gets<00:02:07.860> stuck

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
it gets stuck

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.210 
it gets stuck
one<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.459> direction<00:02:10.209> arrows<00:02:11.069> forward<00:02:12.069> back

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
one of the direction arrows forward back

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.320 
one of the direction arrows forward back
seat<00:02:12.549> there<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:12.849> goes<00:02:13.030> again

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
seat there it goes again

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.180 
seat there it goes again
that<00:02:13.930> was<00:02:14.110> not<00:02:14.290> me<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.709> wasn't<00:02:14.980> doing<00:02:15.280> anything

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
that was not me I wasn't doing anything

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.000 
that was not me I wasn't doing anything
yet<00:02:18.190> again<00:02:19.260> got<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> little<00:02:20.620> bit<00:02:20.739> annoying

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
yet again got a little bit annoying

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.880 
yet again got a little bit annoying
after<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.489> while<00:02:21.790> with<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.840> going<00:02:23.290> into<00:02:23.560> reverse

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
after a while with it going into reverse

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.009 
after a while with it going into reverse
and<00:02:23.920> sometimes<00:02:24.580> turning<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.599> direction

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
and sometimes turning in a direction

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.800 
and sometimes turning in a direction
where<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.230> didn't<00:02:26.560> want<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.799> to<00:02:26.920> go<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.940> actual

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
where I didn't want it to go the actual

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.860 
where I didn't want it to go the actual
real-world<00:02:30.030> application<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.239> way<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.720> they

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870
