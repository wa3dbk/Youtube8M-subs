00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
basically Papa boo sticks and a bunch of

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.849 
basically Papa boo sticks and a bunch of
snares<00:00:16.440> made<00:00:17.010> out<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.340> rotten<00:00:18.439> let<00:00:19.439> me<00:00:19.650> show

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
snares made out of rotten let me show

00:00:19.859 --> 00:01:43.020 
snares made out of rotten let me show
you<00:00:19.920> how<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.279> trap<00:00:20.760> looks<00:00:21.029> like

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.380 

so<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:44.110> basic<00:01:44.530> idea<00:01:44.650> is<00:01:45.040> that<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.940> put<00:01:46.210> your

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
so the basic idea is that you put your

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.630 
so the basic idea is that you put your
rooster<00:01:47.020> in<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.850> middle<00:01:49.150> of<00:01:49.270> this<00:01:49.420> square<00:01:49.600> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
rooster in the middle of this square and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.880 
rooster in the middle of this square and
his<00:01:51.640> screams<00:01:52.090> will<00:01:52.510> attract<00:01:52.990> other<00:01:53.260> roosters

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
his screams will attract other roosters

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.130 
his screams will attract other roosters
and<00:01:54.160> they<00:01:54.700> come<00:01:54.940> across<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.510> fight<00:01:55.750> with<00:01:56.020> the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
and they come across to fight with the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.650 
and they come across to fight with the
rooster<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.979> get<00:01:57.940> trapped<00:01:58.270> in<00:01:58.600> these<00:01:58.990> mares

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.410 

if<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:04.840> have<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:04.990> closer<00:02:05.410> look<00:02:06.150> you<00:02:07.150> can<00:02:07.210> see

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
if you have a closer look you can see

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.949 
if you have a closer look you can see

sticks I really love to learn from
native<00:02:42.030> tribes<00:02:42.359> because<00:02:43.319> they<00:02:43.590> really<00:02:43.950> know

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
native tribes because they really know

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.309 
native tribes because they really know

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
how to survive in the environment and

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.559 
how to survive in the environment and
they<00:02:47.069> don't<00:02:47.280> have<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.579> waste<00:02:47.790> anything<00:02:48.239> and

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
they don't have to waste anything and

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.140 
they don't have to waste anything and
that<00:02:49.319> chicken<00:02:49.620> trap<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.129> a<00:02:50.159> good<00:02:50.370> example<00:02:50.519> for

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
that chicken trap is a good example for

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.970 
that chicken trap is a good example for
it<00:02:51.269> you're<00:02:51.420> not<00:02:51.599> going<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.170> waste<00:02:52.379> any<00:02:52.650> bait

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
it you're not going to waste any bait

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.179 
it you're not going to waste any bait
for<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:54.719> an<00:02:54.930> area<00:02:55.319> was<00:02:55.620> chicken<00:02:56.040> it

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
for it and in an area was chicken it

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.119 
for it and in an area was chicken it
would<00:02:56.370> be<00:02:56.519> quite<00:02:56.730> successful<00:02:57.000> because<00:02:58.129> the

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
would be quite successful because the

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.879 
would be quite successful because the
roosters<00:02:59.790> can<00:03:00.569> hear<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.260> screams<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.859> your

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
rooster from a far distance so it should
