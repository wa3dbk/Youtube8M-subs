00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.050
 Speech, it's okay that you're 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.179
 welcome to the biology club 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.480
 I brought you today, it's not worth it. 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:16.690
 remember a very good tip for you that 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.490
 is helping genetics in several 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.860
 genetic issues you should already have 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:27.700
 is realized using grasses or 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.520
 hour genealogies is simply a 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.040
 form a graphic form of 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.170
 you show the inheritance of one or 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.550
 features along 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.890
 generations 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.440
 when you look at the grain you 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.650
 need to intensify the type of inheritance 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.079
 which he is representing with the hint of 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.760
 today you will be able to identify 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:54.790
 quickly all the inheritances 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.250
 autosomal recessive but what is it 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.110
 you need to look though the grass 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.870
 to identify this type of inheritance 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.479
 time two features you 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.069
 needs to stay in the air the grass 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.749
 neither easy looks at the first the phenotype 

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:13.840
 affected or those individuals who will 

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:16.869
 affected will appear in the offspring of 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.009
 unaffected parents 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.729
 the second characteristic affected offspring 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.759
 include both men and women 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.100
 staff a chance to come to a new 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.289
 individual being born affected in this type of 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.389
 inheritance are the same for men and for 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.840
 women 

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:40.810
 accompany me with this example zin 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:46.329
 will descend from the simplified grass notes 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:49.569
 you have a fleet and not affected having 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.420
 two sons one man one woman affected 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:56.859
 every time you have to stay that way 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.810
 inheritance will be autosomal recessive and 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:03.159
 That's when it's easy for you 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.439
 the parents will be of heterozygous genotype 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.619
 while the affected individuals will 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.740
 to be 11 recessive godos 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.380
 in this case the man and the woman 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.050
 the son of this couple unaffected you 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.170
 can not say with certainty the 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.900
 genotype of them only to state that they 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.060
 received an alert the dominant that can 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.060
 to have come from the mother or father 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.190
 Good, I hope you liked it now. 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.950
 makes it easy for you to get that type of 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.130
 inheritance in the next issue involving 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.670
 program that you will respond to 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.670
 next
