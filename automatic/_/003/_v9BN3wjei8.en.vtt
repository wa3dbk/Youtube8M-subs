00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.699 

so<00:00:00.840> today<00:00:01.050> we're<00:00:01.140> going<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.319> be<00:00:01.380> talking<00:00:01.560> about

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
so today we're going to be talking about

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.730 
so today we're going to be talking about
adding<00:00:02.190> touch<00:00:02.399> controls<00:00:02.820> construct<00:00:03.629> two<00:00:03.840> so

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
adding touch controls construct two so

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.010 
adding touch controls construct two so
the<00:00:04.859> first<00:00:05.040> thing<00:00:05.220> we<00:00:05.339> want<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.580> do<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:06.089> insert

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
the first thing we want to do is insert

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.160 
the first thing we want to do is insert
a<00:00:07.319> new<00:00:07.799> touch<00:00:08.130> input<00:00:08.700> right<00:00:09.059> click<00:00:09.330> insert<00:00:09.990> new

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
a new touch input right click insert new

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.080 
a new touch input right click insert new
object<00:00:10.200> touch<00:00:10.769> input<00:00:11.099> next<00:00:11.849> we're<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.030> to

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
object touch input next we're going to

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.030 
object touch input next we're going to
add<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.240> layer<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.019> touch<00:00:13.170> control<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:13.889> we

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
add a layer for the touch control so we

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.730 
add a layer for the touch control so we
add<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.389> touch<00:00:15.389> control<00:00:15.870> layer<00:00:16.320> that's<00:00:16.590> what

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
add a touch control layer that's what

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.689 
add a touch control layer that's what
we're<00:00:16.949> going<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.190> putting<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.490> buttons

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
we're going to be putting the buttons

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.070 
we're going to be putting the buttons
and<00:00:19.670> we're<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.820> also<00:00:21.150> change<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
and we're going to also change the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.370 
and we're going to also change the
window<00:00:22.680> property<00:00:23.220> window<00:00:23.640> size<00:00:23.970> be<00:00:24.240> 640<00:00:24.750> by

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
window property window size be 640 by

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.540 
window property window size be 640 by
360<00:00:25.789> which<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> typical<00:00:27.769> 16<00:00:28.769> by<00:00:28.920> 9<00:00:28.949> ratio

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
360 which is a typical 16 by 9 ratio

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.479 
360 which is a typical 16 by 9 ratio
which<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.820> better<00:00:29.970> for<00:00:30.300> mobile<00:00:31.109> devices<00:00:31.489> also

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
which is better for mobile devices also

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
which is better for mobile devices also
we<00:00:32.790> want<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.030> such<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.390> set<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> parallax<00:00:34.380> on

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
we want to such that set the parallax on

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.889 
we want to such that set the parallax on
the<00:00:34.710> touch<00:00:34.890> control<00:00:35.340> layer<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.540> zero<00:00:36.840> zero

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the touch control layer to be zero zero

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.250 
the touch control layer to be zero zero
and<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.010> parallax<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.670> basically<00:00:39.059> just

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
and the parallax is basically just

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.360 
and the parallax is basically just
that'll<00:00:40.260> allow<00:00:40.410> us<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.680> keep<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> buttons<00:00:41.219> on

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
that'll allow us to keep the buttons on

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.430 
that'll allow us to keep the buttons on
the<00:00:41.550> screen<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.940> all<00:00:42.000> times<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.840> use<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.260> depth

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the screen at all times so use for depth

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.709 
the screen at all times so use for depth
perception<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.040> games<00:00:44.329> next<00:00:45.329> we're<00:00:45.570> going<00:00:45.660> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
perception and games next we're going to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.959 
perception and games next we're going to
add<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.899> couple<00:00:46.170> buttons<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.190> touch

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
add a couple buttons to the touch

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.930 
add a couple buttons to the touch
control<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:49.379> rather<00:00:49.950> insert<00:00:50.760> new<00:00:50.910> object

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
control so a rather insert new object

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.380 
control so a rather insert new object
sprite<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.170> those<00:00:52.530> will<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.739> our<00:00:53.090> left<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
sprite and those will be our left and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.420 
sprite and those will be our left and
right<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.050> controls<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.309> are

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
right and up controls but they are

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.099 
right and up controls but they are
actually<00:00:56.699> sprites<00:00:58.699> insert<00:00:59.699> new<00:00:59.850> object

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
actually sprites insert new object

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.520 
actually sprites insert new object
sprite<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.510> drew<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.140> right<00:01:04.320> one

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
sprite and so we just drew the right one

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.250 
sprite and so we just drew the right one
and<00:01:04.769> now<00:01:04.830> we're<00:01:04.949> drawing<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> left<00:01:06.140> excuse<00:01:07.140> me

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and now we're drawing the left excuse me

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:16.000 
and now we're drawing the left excuse me
we're<00:01:07.799> drawing<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.689> now<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:15.150> just

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
we're drawing the right now and just

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.930 
we're drawing the right now and just
take<00:01:16.220> that<00:01:16.340> downsize<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:19.130> remember<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:19.790> put

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
take that downsize and remember to put

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.430 
take that downsize and remember to put
them<00:01:20.090> in<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:21.050> bottom<00:01:21.830> corners<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:23.720> the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
them in the bottom corners of the of the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.310 
them in the bottom corners of the of the
frame<00:01:24.680> of<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.070> dotted<00:01:25.340> frame<00:01:25.550> there<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:27.140> can

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
frame of the dotted frame there you can

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.070 
frame of the dotted frame there you can
really<00:01:27.680> change<00:01:27.980> the<00:01:28.600> really<00:01:29.600> whatever

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
really change the really whatever

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.170 
really change the really whatever
placement<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.620> want<00:01:30.830> but<00:01:31.070> usually<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.520> user

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
placement you want but usually the user

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.480 
placement you want but usually the user
would<00:01:32.450> hold<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:32.810> tablet<00:01:33.050> or<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.410> foam<00:01:33.650> by<00:01:34.430> the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
would hold the tablet or the foam by the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.370 
would hold the tablet or the foam by the
bottom<00:01:34.880> two<00:01:35.060> corners<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.870> left<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.290> right

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
bottom two corners the left and right

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.300 
bottom two corners the left and right
corner<00:01:36.710> that's<00:01:36.830> why<00:01:36.980> we're<00:01:37.070> putting<00:01:37.190> the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
corner that's why we're putting the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.190 
corner that's why we're putting the
controls<00:01:37.640> there<00:01:37.910> and<00:01:38.150> we're<00:01:38.900> going<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.080> put

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
controls there and we're going to put

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.440 
controls there and we're going to put
the<00:01:39.290> jump<00:01:39.560> control<00:01:39.950> in<00:01:40.220> both<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:41.060> left<00:01:41.270> and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
the jump control in both the left and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.500 
the jump control in both the left and
the<00:01:41.540> right<00:01:41.960> sections<00:01:42.880> just<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.030> it's<00:01:44.390> easier

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
the right sections just so it's easier

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.160 
the right sections just so it's easier
access<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:46.480> you<00:01:47.480> know<00:01:47.540> jumping<00:01:47.930> is<00:01:48.020> pretty

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
access and you know jumping is pretty

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.200 
access and you know jumping is pretty
important<00:01:48.530> in<00:01:48.620> all<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.830> our<00:01:48.950> games<00:01:52.210> it's

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
important in all of our games it's

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.969 
important in all of our games it's
always<00:01:53.390> important<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.900> rename<00:01:54.440> your<00:01:54.500> sprites

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
always important to rename your sprites

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.940 
always important to rename your sprites
so<00:01:55.220> we're<00:01:55.910> going<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.060> name<00:01:56.300> our<00:01:56.690> buttons<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.860> be

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
so we're going to name our buttons to be

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.219 
so we're going to name our buttons to be
left<00:01:58.370> movement<00:01:58.610> button<00:01:59.090> right<00:01:59.990> movement

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
left movement button right movement

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.940 
left movement button right movement
button<00:02:04.150> and<00:02:05.350> we're<00:02:06.350> going<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.530> name<00:02:06.620> this<00:02:06.770> one

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
button and we're going to name this one

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.639 
button and we're going to name this one
to<00:02:07.040> be<00:02:07.100> up<00:02:07.310> movement<00:02:07.970> button<00:02:08.330> or<00:02:09.110> we<00:02:09.380> could<00:02:09.500> say

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
to be up movement button or we could say

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.030 
to be up movement button or we could say
jump<00:02:10.180> next<00:02:11.180> we're<00:02:11.390> going<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.540> add<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.830> touch

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
jump next we're going to add the touch

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.920 
jump next we're going to add the touch
controls<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.670> event<00:02:13.880> sheet<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.450> first<00:02:14.690> we're

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
controls the event sheet so first we're

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.030 
controls the event sheet so first we're
going<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.310> create<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.490> group<00:02:17.290> just<00:02:18.290> it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
going to create a group just it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.310 
going to create a group just it
organizes<00:02:19.550> things<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.820> little<00:02:19.880> nicer<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:21.170> we'll

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
organizes things a little nicer so we'll

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.870 
organizes things a little nicer so we'll
name<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.500> touch<00:02:22.090> movement<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:24.459> I<00:02:25.459> made<00:02:25.730> that

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
name it touch movement and I made that

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.280 
name it touch movement and I made that
comment<00:02:26.300> by<00:02:26.390> mistake<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.020> can<00:02:27.140> just

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
comment by mistake so you can just

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.640 
comment by mistake so you can just
ignore<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.190> so<00:02:28.550> touch<00:02:28.700> movement<00:02:29.090> group<00:02:29.239> and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
ignore that so touch movement group and

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.030 
ignore that so touch movement group and
we're<00:02:30.650> going<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.860> say<00:02:31.130> for<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:32.769> touch<00:02:33.769> at

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
we're going to say for the touch at

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.340 
we're going to say for the touch at
event<00:02:34.340> for<00:02:34.519> touch<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.880> touching<00:02:35.540> object<00:02:36.050> and

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
event for touch is touching object and

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.710 
event for touch is touching object and
the<00:02:37.100> object<00:02:37.130> we're<00:02:37.610> going<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.790> change<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.300> left

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
the object we're going to change is left

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.800 
the object we're going to change is left
mouse<00:02:38.930> button<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:40.459> action<00:02:40.910> we're<00:02:41.690> going

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
mouse button and the action we're going

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.280 
mouse button and the action we're going
to<00:02:41.870> say<00:02:41.989> player<00:02:43.360> simulate<00:02:44.360> control<00:02:46.959> so<00:02:47.959> it's<00:02:48.200> a

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
to say player simulate control so it's a

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.070 
to say player simulate control so it's a
touch<00:02:48.500> movement<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.190> touching<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.660> button

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
touch movement is touching the button

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.840 
touch movement is touching the button
and<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.769> player<00:02:51.980> will<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.459> similarly

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
and the player will you similarly

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.640 
and the player will you similarly
control<00:02:53.180> next<00:02:53.959> we're<00:02:54.110> going<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.290> copy<00:02:54.470> and

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
control next we're going to copy and

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.130 
control next we're going to copy and
paste<00:02:54.860> this<00:02:55.040> twice<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.700> change<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:56.840> for<00:02:57.110> the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
paste this twice and change it for the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:11.120 
paste this twice and change it for the
right<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.570> up<00:02:59.570> buttons<00:03:09.190> and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
right and up buttons and

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.430 
right and up buttons and
right<00:03:11.280> button<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.910> simulated<00:03:12.420> right<00:03:15.440> so

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
right button is just simulated right so

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.930 
right button is just simulated right so
now<00:03:16.560> we<00:03:16.620> can<00:03:16.770> test<00:03:16.920> the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
now we can test the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.870 
now we can test the
controls<00:03:18.270> are<00:03:18.630> in<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.320> game<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:20.430> when<00:03:20.790> you

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
controls are in the game and when you

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.930 
controls are in the game and when you
press<00:03:21.090> jump<00:03:21.420> left<00:03:21.900> right<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.730> it's<00:03:23.730> pretty

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
press jump left right and it's pretty

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.200 
press jump left right and it's pretty
cool<00:03:24.240> as<00:03:24.360> well<00:03:24.390> if<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.260> buttons<00:03:25.740> are<00:03:25.940> over

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
cool as well if the buttons are over

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.150 
cool as well if the buttons are over
hovering<00:03:27.870> over<00:03:28.020> each<00:03:28.260> other<00:03:28.500> occupying<00:03:29.070> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
hovering over each other occupying the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.680 
hovering over each other occupying the
same<00:03:29.250> space<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.880> actually<00:03:30.360> does<00:03:30.480> both

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
same space it actually does both

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.240 
same space it actually does both
commands<00:03:31.110> as<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.350> can<00:03:31.470> see<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:31.800> he<00:03:31.890> jumps<00:03:32.130> over

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
commands as you can see so he jumps over

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.770 
commands as you can see so he jumps over
to<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.490> left<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.090> right<00:03:33.180> at<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.360> same<00:03:33.570> time

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
to the left and right at the same time

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.700 
to the left and right at the same time
left<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:34.260> up<00:03:34.410> rather<00:03:34.770> at<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.220> same<00:03:35.490> time
