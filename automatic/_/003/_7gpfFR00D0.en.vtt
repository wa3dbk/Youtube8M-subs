around corners we didn't want them to be
rolling<00:01:38.360> away<00:01:38.800> so<00:01:39.800> all<00:01:39.950> of<00:01:39.979> our<00:01:40.190> combat

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.540 
rolling away so all of our combat
designed<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:41.000> be<00:01:41.090> fast<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.630> fluid<00:01:42.399> you<00:01:43.399> can

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
designed to be fast and fluid you can

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.940 
designed to be fast and fluid you can
switch<00:01:43.850> between<00:01:44.000> melee<00:01:44.539> and<00:01:44.780> ranged<00:01:44.950> the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
switch between melee and ranged the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:02:04.070 
switch between melee and ranged the
press<00:01:46.190> of<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.429> button

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.500 

so<00:02:04.680> up<00:02:04.800> here<00:02:04.830> we<00:02:05.010> see<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.400> have<00:02:05.550> a<00:02:05.580> range<00:02:06.330> an

so up here we see we have a range an

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.910 
so up here we see we have a range an
opportunity<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:06.930> our<00:02:07.050> bigger<00:02:07.260> range<00:02:07.500> enemies

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
opportunity of our bigger range enemies

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.770

often<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.549> lower<00:02:27.700> left<00:02:27.969> you'll<00:02:28.150> notice<00:02:28.180> that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
often the lower left you'll notice that

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.240 
often the lower left you'll notice that
there's<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.719> fury<00:02:29.019> meter<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:29.530> fury<00:02:29.829> is<00:02:29.980> one<00:02:30.129> of

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
there's a fury meter so fury is one of

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.550 
there's a fury meter so fury is one of
our<00:02:30.310> central<00:02:30.760> economies<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> game<00:02:31.780> you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
our central economies of the game you

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.459 
our central economies of the game you
build<00:02:32.829> up<00:02:32.950> fury<00:02:33.310> by<00:02:34.030> doing<00:02:34.359> damage<00:02:35.109> to<00:02:35.260> the
