00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.930
 Hi guys 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.350
 Today I would like to make a small 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.119
 tutorial showing how to organize 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.640
 your hdr photos 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.670
 so I want to leave this photo that has a screen 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.560
 full in the light we'll make it clear that it is 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.740
 a new light 15 thing and we're going to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.990
 my last decoration job where I 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.910
 did hdr 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.170
 now I will have to act to move to 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.390
 grid module and to organize the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.060
 What is the problem we have? 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.510
 when we program hdr normally 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:49.410
 We 're going to do 3-photo sequences. 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.559
 to 7 up to nine single scene photos 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.570
 to be able to create hdr now problem 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.239
 that we have with it here you can 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.940
 see that it's the same repeated photo several 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.910
 Sometimes this can tire the look of knowing 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.990
 how many hdr I actually took is difficult 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.390
 see this when the photos are all 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.440
 loose and you see multiple of six 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.990
 every photo 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.270
 so what I do this can even see me 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.820
 I did a little bit here just to get this flap 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.100
 on the triangle 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.110
 for those who do not know any place 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.930
 that has a triangle you will power 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.200
 expands and abates some panel 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.049
 so what I'm going to do to organize 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.909
 these photos we can see here that we 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.780
 we have six equal pictures are what I 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.420
 I click the first photo and the key 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.580
 shift and safe shift key in last 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.680
 photo as in any 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.939
 windows this will select the photos in 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.799
 sequence 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.020
 now from that moment I put 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.119
 three stars that identifies my 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.119
 photos as hdr photos 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.750
 I put a red color by typing in 6 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.930
 for those who do not know from 6 to 9 will apply 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.909
 a color and last I have found the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.710
 g against today will piling my photos 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.599
 now you can notice that in this photo 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.360
 stacked we have a number 6 that 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.230
 identifies how many photos there are 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.029
 battery 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.099
 This is good now, instead of having to 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.940
 look at six pictures just have to look at one 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.980
 photo that identifies 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.680
 in six photos on the stack so here in the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.900
 beginning can see that I have 6 when the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.010
 Technical do not know whether to click do not know 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.920
 that my mouse 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.040
 He will play the photos we see. 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.740
 the six photos that compose hdr when the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.750
 technical again performance was you 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.410
 can you see that I also brand u cup 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.370
 visually see how many hdr I have and 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.840
 also when I play a 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.060
 hdr sequence is not confused with 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.740
 another sequence then I know that these six 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.320
 red photos are part of a 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.390
 sequence of these six yellow photos 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.760
 are part of another sequence 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.870
 visually when they say pile my 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.360
 photos and this helps the imperial king 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.100
 then so is a process that we go a 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.330
 bit boring but very fast and 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.210
 select 637 because I like to score with 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.370
 flag also against today until I 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.860
 forgot to do with the sequence, I 'm not going 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:23.200
 to play just click shift key p 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.840
 Remember when I'm on the grid and I'm yours. 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.150
 choose a sequence of photos which I 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.560
 I shot a picture there will be applying all 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.540
 selected photos 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.170
 but this only applies to when I'm in the 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.560
 severe module 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:43.980
 of course you seems I forgot 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:49.720
 a photo in my stream vote for this 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.430
 37 to I'll add this photo after island 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.940
 now you can see that the daughter has seven 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:01.390
 voices again 36 against og 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.400
 I know that each battery takes five seconds 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.890
 to make you see that it is an operation 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.019
 It takes a little bit but it's worth it. 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.209
 do because it will be worth doing 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.760
 worth doing because on light on is 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.799
 very important we have control in the 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.380
 organization of our photos 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.320
 may not appear to be necessary in the 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.380
 time to be dealing with a job 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.840
 but can help in future times like 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.860
 is the case that photo you saw in the 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.629
 beginning of the tutorial is real is a 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.030
 picture of a collection of photos that I 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:38.939
 I have photos here was nate coming 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:43.110
 developing now I can do 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:46.830
 these collection in less than 15 minutes and 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.620
 why is it that most of the 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.020
 photos are already marked with four 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.340
 stars 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.310
 this four-star marking 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.669
 normally on any 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.659
 I did identify the photos as use 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.009
 folks 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:07.469
 so I only had that in every folder 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:10.500
 photos of works that I do and filter by 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:13.770
 the four-star photos and hence not 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.789
 just take these photos and drag them up 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.930
 to my collection 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:22.080
 then this type of previous organization 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.569
 may seem annoying or unnecessary but 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.219
 in the future it will help you a lot in the matter 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:31.590
 find photos or maybe I did not even see the 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.960
 photo for someone who needs this 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.509
 organization type helps a lot 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.029
 So I wanted to thank you for the 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.580
 attention again, I apologize for the 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:44.150
 delay in making these videos but final 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.620
 The year is very intense. 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.690
 I had work a week and 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.919
 that I can not sit and do the 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.379
 videos because I like to make a 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.849
 thing done well and do one thing well 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.339
 needs time 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.770
 everything that is good for me I also wanted 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:00.900
 thank you all for the affection 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.360
 by the views 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.810
 the channel already has more than three thousand 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.240
 signatures and already has more than 160 thousand 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.080
 total views of all 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.810
 videos 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.589
 I just have to thank you guys for this. 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.719
 share to watch to indicate 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:21.240
