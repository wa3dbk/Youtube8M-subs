down and play it slow and then faster
and<00:00:44.780> then<00:00:44.930> add<00:00:45.140> some<00:00:45.170> distortion<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:47.059> lot<00:00:47.899> of

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
and then add some distortion a lot of

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.560 
and then add some distortion a lot of
times<00:00:48.320> he<00:00:48.770> would<00:00:48.980> start<00:00:49.550> his<00:00:49.700> run<00:00:49.969> on<00:00:50.360> the

fifth<00:00:50.809> note<00:00:51.079> of<00:00:51.110> scale<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:52.460> on<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:52.640> key<00:00:52.820> of

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
fifth note of scale so on the key of

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.590 
fifth note of scale so on the key of
burned<00:00:53.180> beyond<00:00:53.719> B<00:00:54.850> learn<00:00:55.850> all<00:00:56.030> your<00:00:56.180> notes<00:00:56.390> or

burned beyond B learn all your notes or
if<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:56.780> can<00:00:57.020> that<00:00:57.230> makes<00:00:57.410> things<00:00:57.620> easier<00:00:58.100> it

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
if you can that makes things easier it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.180 
if you can that makes things easier it
shouldn't<00:00:58.489> take<00:00:58.640> more<00:00:58.850> than<00:00:58.910> a<00:00:59.030> few<00:00:59.270> weeks<00:01:00.190> it

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
shouldn't take more than a few weeks it

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
lot smoother and quicker anyways here's

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.649 
lot smoother and quicker anyways here's
the<00:01:16.430> triplet<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:22.820> I<00:01:22.880> didn't<00:01:23.180> start<00:01:23.450> on<00:01:23.570> the

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
the triplet the I didn't start on the

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.890 
the triplet the I didn't start on the
enol<00:01:24.080> on<00:01:24.439> purpose<00:01:25.010> Jimmy<00:01:25.340> Page<00:01:25.780> actually<00:01:26.780> was

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
enol on purpose Jimmy Page actually was

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.530 
enol on purpose Jimmy Page actually was
kind<00:01:27.080> of<00:01:27.140> clever<00:01:27.409> um<00:01:27.939> like<00:01:28.939> an<00:01:29.090> let's<00:01:29.450> say

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
kind of clever um like an let's say

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.800 
kind of clever um like an let's say
communication<00:01:30.229> breakdown<00:01:34.210> it's<00:01:35.210> easy<00:01:35.479> to

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
communication breakdown it's easy to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.700 
communication breakdown it's easy to
slide<00:01:36.259> to<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.650> B<00:01:36.979> on<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:38.439> fifth<00:01:39.439> string

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
slide to that B on the fifth string

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.740 
slide to that B on the fifth string
which<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:39.920> your<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.159> string<00:01:40.549> up<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.030> 14th<00:01:41.479> fret

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
which is your a string up the 14th fret

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.660 
which is your a string up the 14th fret
and<00:01:41.990> what<00:01:42.890> he<00:01:43.009> did<00:01:43.189> what<00:01:43.369> I<00:01:43.400> thought<00:01:43.610> was

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
and what he did what I thought was

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.390 
and what he did what I thought was
really<00:01:43.909> clever<00:01:44.270> he<00:01:45.140> would<00:01:45.320> slide<00:01:45.740> up<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.130> rest

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
really clever he would slide up and rest

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.030 
really clever he would slide up and rest
for<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.759> a<00:01:47.119> beat<00:01:47.600> or<00:01:47.780> two<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.229> then<00:01:48.619> go<00:01:48.650> back

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
for a a beat or two and then go back

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.800 
for a a beat or two and then go back
down<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.369> actually<00:01:50.119> start<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.450> triplet

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
down and actually start the triplet

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:01.190 
down and actually start the triplet
exercise<00:01:51.200> on<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:52.009> go

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.190 

then<00:02:02.200> he'd<00:02:02.320> been<00:02:02.910> that<00:02:03.910> high<00:02:04.120> Gino<00:02:04.600> on<00:02:04.990> the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
then he'd been that high Gino on the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.620 
then he'd been that high Gino on the
15th<00:02:05.530> fret<00:02:05.680> first<00:02:05.980> string<00:02:06.100> way<00:02:06.490> up<00:02:06.640> yonder<00:02:07.120> um

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
15th fret first string way up yonder um

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.280 
15th fret first string way up yonder um
anyways<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:09.039> basically<00:02:09.429> let's<00:02:10.030> try<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.390> again

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:25.770 

get<00:02:14.290> yourself<00:02:14.680> situated<00:02:14.950> go<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:24.600> go<00:02:25.600> all<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
get yourself situated go and go all the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.490 
get yourself situated go and go all the
way<00:02:25.990> up<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:30.480> number<00:02:31.480> wise<00:02:31.660> it's<00:02:31.989> on<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.470> a

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
way up so number wise it's on the a

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.560 
way up so number wise it's on the a
string<00:02:32.620> 12<00:02:33.310> 14<00:02:34.180> 12<00:02:34.900> on<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.200> D<00:02:36.000> 14<00:02:37.000> on<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.300> y'all

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
a 12 of the name and further down the D

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
how I knew where to slide and calculate

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.220 
how I knew where to slide and calculate
a<00:04:00.170> good<00:04:00.830> place<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.070> throw<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.460> runnin<00:04:01.910> as<00:04:02.840> far<00:04:03.140> as

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
a good place to throw a runnin as far as

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.230 
a good place to throw a runnin as far as
a<00:04:03.260> location<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:04.160> think<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.550> sounds<00:04:04.820> more<00:04:04.970> cool

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
a location I think it sounds more cool

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:17.500 
a location I think it sounds more cool
that<00:04:05.480> way<00:04:05.690> than<00:04:05.870> starting<00:04:06.260> on<00:04:06.380> e<00:04:15.850> sounds<00:04:16.850> scary

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
that way than starting on e sounds scary

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:25.339
