way better up point can be way way

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.210 
way better up point can be way way
better<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.700> think<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:19.500> know<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.680> this

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
better but I think that you know is this

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.310 
better but I think that you know is this
tournament<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:21.420> didn't<00:02:21.810> really<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.170> wasn't

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
tournament it didn't really it wasn't

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.230 
tournament it didn't really it wasn't
really<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> lot<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.040> close<00:02:23.250> matches<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.970> guess<00:02:24.120> he

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
really a lot of close matches I guess he

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.400 
really a lot of close matches I guess he
gets<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.720> think<00:02:24.930> that's<00:02:25.080> primarily

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
gets it and I think that's primarily

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.170 
gets it and I think that's primarily
because<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:26.250> were<00:02:26.340> actually<00:02:26.490> winning<00:02:26.820> RS

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
because we were actually winning RS

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.870 
because we were actually winning RS
Indies<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> good<00:02:28.920> thing<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.370> think

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
Indies so that is a good thing I think

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.260 
Indies so that is a good thing I think
that<00:02:30.060> any<00:02:30.810> step<00:02:31.320> towards<00:02:31.920> improvement<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.640> RS

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
that any step towards improvement on RS

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.320 
that any step towards improvement on RS
any<00:02:33.540> game<00:02:33.750> at<00:02:34.020> tournaments<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:35.330> almost

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
any game at tournaments is almost

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.360 
any game at tournaments is almost
crucial<00:02:37.080> at<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.290> point<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.100> know<00:02:38.130> we

middle play call by Nietzsche because if

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
middle play call by Nietzsche because if
we<00:02:45.270> lost<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.690> map<00:02:45.870> I'd<00:02:46.050> be<00:02:46.200> saying<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.590> exact

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
we lost that map I'd be saying the exact

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.290 
we lost that map I'd be saying the exact
center<00:02:47.220> if<00:02:47.370> we<00:02:47.489> lost<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.850> round<00:02:47.970> I'd<00:02:48.150> be

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
center if we lost that round I'd be

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.300 
center if we lost that round I'd be
saying<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.660> exact<00:02:49.080> opposite<00:02:49.860> thing<00:02:49.920> right

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
saying the exact opposite thing right

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.160

now so definitely I've thought about it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.190 
now so definitely I've thought about it
and<00:02:55.530> we<00:02:55.920> definitely<00:02:56.550> need<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.670> practice<00:02:57.200> snd

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.580 
and we definitely need to practice snd
