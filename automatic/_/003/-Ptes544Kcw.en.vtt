00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.809
 hello today we are preparing 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.849
 do-it-yourself indicator paper for 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.769
 of this we need a red one 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.650
 cabbage is the same as 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.390
 white cabbage only 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.930
 red like this she looks like 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.880
 cut 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.930
 and so this cabbage contains coloring 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.449
 substance natural pigment which 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.120
 changes its color 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.900
 depending on the environment in which is 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.150
 In general, in principle, the sap of many plants and 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.769
 fruit berries and the like change color 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.400
 depending on ph level 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:49.489
 but red cabbage pigment changes 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.710
 its color most clearly now 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.320
 Before you is a table in which are indicated in 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.040
 dependencies level in courage and change 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.010
 the colors of the juice here this cabbage will be 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.650
 colors you understand not approximate 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.700
 you need to expect that it is very accurate 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.600
 but at least approximately with the help of such 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.009
 simple fixture can 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.530
 determine how much 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.680
 acidic environment or alkaline or she 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.630
 close to neutral for example it is important 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.039
 in agriculture we can by 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.789
 There are such simple Pribluda determine 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:28.609
 porsche of our ground and so in order 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.890
 to make our indicator 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:37.749
 paper we need of course 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.749
 cut a piece of cabbage 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.859
 the capacity in which we will cook 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.689
 not very small it is not required now 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.209
 need to pour a little water 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:03.159
 and cook minutes literally 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:05.380
 dyes go very well 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.759
 of course you can pour the whole thing into the water 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.730
 alcohol gasoline acetone and make 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.680
 drawing dyes in this way 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.860
 we can make the solution big 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.349
 concentration and drop it add to 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.530
 we need the environment in which we want 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.819
 determine the ph level and so ok now 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.269
 I'll fill it with water 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.970
 a little bit of cooking as you do it 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:35.519
 I hope you should not show in general 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.859
 we need to cook 10 minutes maximum 15 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.489
 drain it in we will soak 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:45.760
 our printer paper and so cabbage 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:49.030
 the soup is ready I poured the current amount of cabbage 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.549
 who cut one glass of water but in 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.209
 boiling process 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:59.260
 the water evaporated and I got 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.549
 Now let's see how and then to 100 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.549
 milliliters with a little 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.750
 let it all cool you down 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.750
 while preparing our funds 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.269
 cabbage so i have 2 cups with 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.260
 by water 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:30.239
 ordinary water from the filter type pushin 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.640
 van den cups i will add salt 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:41.760
 bring the acid to the nose and generally can not 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:49.280
 so I will add the second cup to it 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.280
 one more thing again 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.520
 when water temperature dissolves 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.410
 very strong and necessary 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.080
 be sure to stir our 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:12.120
 the cup was not deformed from below 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:13.290
 water is almost current for you all our surroundings 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.890
 alkaline 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.320
 acid ready now let's see what with 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.720
 of course we want our ponies 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:27.150
 well soaked again well wait completely 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:33.800
 don't feel like it so let's check here's ours 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:41.430
 piece of paper white background 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:47.640
 check on acidic environment up a chord 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:50.330
 You are checking the second pink color 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.330
 piece of paper 

00:04:52.369 --> 00:05:05.849
 on the alkaline environment devil left green 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:08.599
 color so here we drop a little glass 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.599
 one more time 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:19.249
 These are the indicators you can do in 

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:19.249
 home conditions 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:29.339
 everything is very simple elementary so what is it 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:32.129
 concerns paper indicators but you can 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:33.139
 make a liquid indicator that is 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:36.149
 make a solution 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.819
 more concentrated and add it 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:40.829
 in our environments drop by drop now 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.409
 see what happens if we 

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:45.739
 added a couple of drops of concentrated 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.739
 solution 

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:54.679
 so here and so 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:06.400
 well on that note i think it's worth finishing 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.760
 I hope I was interesting to you 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:14.580
 the community is even pleasant in life 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.580
 Thank you for your attention of good luck!
