00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.590
 Yes it is 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.450
 just a great sense of honor 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.059
 that you still come true for your own country 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.129
 and 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.259
 In addition, supports for against Mali is great for that 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:15.919
 and you win one 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.099
 and and 2 plays at home so outrageous crowd 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.400
 and 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.400
 already great to be with once upon a time to be at the 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.499
 to see it 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.499
 the red code means that no salary can be set 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.310
 It is very nice to experience a little stronger to compensate for the 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.250
 ommen to get the feeling say 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.250
 trees tell what things are going through 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.280
 to declare the name 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.120
 it seemed as if the week had already begun taking pictures so the public was saying to turn 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.390
 month 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.220
 so it is a bit exaggerated what now say but it is just he is coming now 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.760
 out of the stadium and who everyone is 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.990
 full of joy a hole in the bus city bus which swung back and forth and 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.640
 everyone's school are totally thrilled with joy 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.730
 it's nice to experience 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.730
 that sounds different than a dog when you remember that it is coming 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.910
 but i think that 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.020
 a little set was when they buy the netherlands 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.570
 because yes well who is here 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.710
 look for the joke is leaked next week as far as i know lies but i think i am 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.680
 this of us is the old one much more weekly 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.790
 the fin 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.360
 is bigger in africa 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.790
 a big team 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.140
 so one would basically be the pole 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.780
 or if we have to come through with two fingers in the nose 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.730
 and they freeze the ice so our turn this is a big step for us 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.450
 after an agent attainment targets after the Africa Cup 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.990
 you know what the unified meat legal form 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.030
 Oh yeah 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.110
 but the union 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.110
 has and he had contact in the Netherlands 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.659
 and they just follow the matches 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.580
 that contact 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.440
 personal contact 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.440
 and so they did come true and fellow players 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.520
 here in the Netherlands 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.190
 like a session the runners a toni varela don't do it 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:12.980
 the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.479
 the rest of the world 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.689
 and cook other players 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.669
 it three players willem it 2 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.669
 it became in the markets of sparta 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:27.729
 enough players that team they are currently working on to try to get them to 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.379
 pay off the guinea pigs 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.749
 she says that against 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:34.959
 yes that is discussed van rien comes when the national coach saw van roel 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:38.659
 how does it do in you nowadays 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.589
 we are doing well 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:44.209
 what my opinion asked you are if internationals miss opportunities 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:46.990
 well i think a 9 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.129
 these have enough messi you that 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.659
 take care of that 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.099
 and a view of a soccer player who might also know dun 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.990
 is welcome 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.250
 so mountain is gold but you pretended to only go through it 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.089
 emphasize 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:06.039
 we were approached completely but he was there it was 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.039
 People over the age of a horse don't doubt that is to decide 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.590
 so but it plays very often because it is very good playing maybe 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.049
 In the future it could come true for the Dutch national team 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.339
 so yes for that boy it's a bit harder for me 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.939
 must be honest because 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.629
 for me the dutch team we are probably more into 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.369
 how much more honest and the swastika is also easier for me 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.369
 I also said six small when that chance comes 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.549
 then submit to suit against and then from the second of ict 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.219
 francs again choose for themselves 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.499
 but that problem what you now sketch the duarte with a friend 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.219
 that the striking risers 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:44.759
 the 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:45.760
 yes public 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.829
 and it was from 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.519
 they see that 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.810
 are not like that 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.810
 a little further in one 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.490
 in this development 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.849
 the fixed charges young orange 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.419
 also very good fox but played all representative teams 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.419
 the punishment for the young is a bit harder to choose 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.029
 And those guys just have to take the time, it's not in twelve years 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.229
 hence a different time you have to decide and you have to think about it 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.169
 or you let your mind speak or have it pronounced 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.290
 that was canceled their choice register they might choose from 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.370
 completely out if they would choose a hard one rather than maybe opt for the 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.259
 Cape Verde Islands I think I think 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.879
 that too you are used wit that they might be for the cabinet itself too 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.270
 choose because 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.020
 f 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.139
 after this incident example I also have the cone instead 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.259
 the acknowledge that we have for you 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.840
 those who were allowed to sit once and that never plays Dutch again 

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:45.809
 team 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:46.810
 and 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.159
 f 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.469
 I don't want to say that they don't have the quality that comes around the field 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.840
 stop 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.930
 the chance is high 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.900
 the 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.870
 on the castle itself that you have continuity there and 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.550
 then with the Dutch national team 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.550
 and jerson cabral has now 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.319
 how old they chose a world full of jensen 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.870
 23 years or so 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.210
 so before he goes out of base it is again 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.939
 five six years 7 8 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.169
 so she has to think about that as well 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.860
 ir 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.479
 but what you say there you are right in I think we choose with the practical 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:24.919
 they drove for it 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.800
 cadel themselves to extinguish the dutch team and with the wits they find 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.580
 maybe in trouble 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.289
 but money for the castaignos and jerson cabral than the 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.289
 it suggests that the murder is also in the background 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.879
 because on the contrary know that he has been approached 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.370
 from now 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.949
 we do not know 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.029
 in maarssen and are we doing m 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:52.749
 the coming works for the rest and it is it is now last in v 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.189
 once released 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:56.039
 a 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.279
 now the band starts playing in the race 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.430
 we've been proven for a long time 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.190
 he thinks it's a great thing that she has it to the job it is whole 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.569
 nice for team to have especially for the future 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:13.599
 and whatever other players in the past and it 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:17.169
 look to the future look to a next africa cup 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.029
 they would also be very welcome to the players 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:22.860
 we have enough quality to 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.439
 to play with that and welcome after his fall but how do I release 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.439
 am now 25 why not a bk for buyers 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.039
 well that 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.039
 that there are very beautiful but in Tokyo I think I stayed 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.550
 we are on the right track the originated our goal is of the africa cup in 2012 again 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.639
 and then we'll see further 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.639
 what i also with they started well against mali 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.409
 the cash flows are it's a dream 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:56.090
 but if you're orio I don't think you're going to get
