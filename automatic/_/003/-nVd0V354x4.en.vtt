00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:27.110

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.170
 what clicks me in every video not 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.000

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.370

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.280
 Well , let's get down to us 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.550
 need to set up 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.360
 mouse 7 under the sink years and first you 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:57.469
 need the mouse itself and a little bit 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.269
 time, so let's start tack no magicians 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.549
 years and in advance and do not go far 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.670

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.710
 so open the tab with years and or super 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.020

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.539

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.369
 maximum angle 2-port volume that us 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:17.000
 then by yourself it will also be easier for anyone 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.830
 put us and so along with the mouse in 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.460
 there should be a small program disk 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.319
 asko 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.700
 install it on computers choose 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.500
 your mouse when installing 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.050
 there's nothing heavy there to describe it 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.750
 I will not, but if for some reason you were not 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.250

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.429

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.580
 This button is 7 because the correct time is not 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.729

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.459
