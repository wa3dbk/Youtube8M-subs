00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.740
 We are going to do massage hands 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.420
 supposed to pass the manicure that 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.030
 you can see on my channel that it was going up 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.910
 a few months 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.500
 I have the perfect basic manicure good 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.630
 Well that pulling my end and massage 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.260
 because it could not be done then now 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.240
 I'm going to do it so you can see it 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.480
 you can also use it in any 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.360
 situation that you want 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.620
 I'm putting the cream in my hand to 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.150
 that to warm it up a bit and it's not 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.430
 as very annoying to the client because 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.290
 normally the creams are cold loyola 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.310
 I warm my hand a bit and then cast 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.310
 in the cast like this 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.510
 always working 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.510
 wrist hand wrist and forearm 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.750
 I distribute the cream well and once I 've 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.750
 I spread the cream and start massaging 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.619
 with thumbs 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.730
 then we take each finger 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.060
 and we started to massage each finger 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.560
 as if we were like 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.540
 unscrewing 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.540
 one jaw is called screw 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.550
 and we repeat 2 to 3 times until the 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.630
 end of the nail then the next the 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.630
 next finger cojemos 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.140
 same relax the hand lady you 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.180
 relaxed it is very important that the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.360
 relaxed hand to be able to finish the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.360
 work 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.530
 two 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.650
 3 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.450
 the next finger 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.709
 we do it from space not very fast 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.209
 because what I want is to transmit a 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.209
 little of serenity and calm 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.030
 the tool of equal 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.400
 arrived at this point I again lame with 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.680
 the right hand here and already with this hand 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.680
 I'll be more comfortable to work 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.050
 we can also do pressures 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.050
 of the phalanges 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.000
 do not 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.970
 and repeat it 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.970
 one 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.750
 the next of 2 equal 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.750
 two 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.910
 the pressures are very nice 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.520
 as stretching a bit also the 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.850
 articulation with people who have 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.319
 arthrosis all these movements of 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.770
 Finger joint deputation 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.270
 Pressure movement comes great because 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.280
 those people your clear they are left 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:41.910
 all the international liquid 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.910
 accumulated and it's good for desinflamar 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:50.230
 by the action of the hand 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.230
 so we activate the phalanx 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.720
 and so we repeat two to three times for 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.120
 that massage without cash and you notice 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.020
 each maneuver is going to repeat two or three 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.020
 minimum times 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.480
 the massage may be lasting between 10 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.280
 minutes according to the manicure would be great 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.670
 dedicate 10 minutes 5 minutes in each 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.670
 hand 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.889
 It also depends on treatment can be 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.810
 up to 15 minutes there is a treatment of 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.229
 spa that can last an hour because 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.240
 you can be 7 minutes in each hand 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.810
 quietly so that that treatment 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.810
 so be it 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.820
 more beneficial 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.420
 in this area here of the thumb we are going to 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.760
 squeeze a little without fear is worth it 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.010
 this area loads a lot then it is 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.500
 a muscle that is very grateful when 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.210
 let's massage 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.500
 it feels like a kind of liberation 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:04.410
 all this and I just take it as well as the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.410
 pincers waters and this movement 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.999
 and then here, same 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:17.460
 then with a closed fist I will do 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.910
 of this movement 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.910
 circulatory vale 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.650
 at hand also relaxed whenever 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:31.160
 decide if I did relax and hand 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.530
 of relaxed because as well as the breakthrough 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.530
 penetrates we better understand the light 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.729
 then we take this guy and that lump 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.219
 maneuver we take the fingers 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.510
 well this way and what I'm going to do 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:47.050
 they are twists 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.610
 3 on the right and 3 on the left she 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.530
 you do not have to move, it's not me 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.530
 move the hand that is relaxed 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.710
 to 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.040
 I'm doing more turns because the 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.440
 lady does not relax is not what I want 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.010
 get him to relax 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:10.090
 relax release your lucky luck hand 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:13.590
 so I can move my wrist very well 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.590
 they are three turns 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:22.209
 and once I've made the three turns 

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:25.989
 with the same fingers he wanted to stretch 

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:28.029
 do stretches here we stretch all 

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:30.509
 the muscles tendons and a lot 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:30.509
 joints 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:37.009
 with a massage like this pulling once 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.809
 we have finished 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.210
 we have done three or four maneuvers 

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:43.339
 and we have repeated several times we go 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.240
 doing this which is how to peel the 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:50.869
 cob this is a technique maneuver 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:54.319
 oriental that is very relaxing we end up 

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:56.719
 doing so about three four times as 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:59.149
 opening the amazon like peeling the and 

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:01.779
 then in this part of the wrist we are going to 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:01.779
 make turns 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.240
 well with fingers massaging in the form of 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:12.420
 pin 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:16.220
 and then we're done with the forearm 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.220
 we ally ourselves gently 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:25.180
