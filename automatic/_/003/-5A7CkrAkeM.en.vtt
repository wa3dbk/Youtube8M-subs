00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.760
 Hello everyone today, we are talking about replacing 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.070
 in the drain pump ardo washing machine 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.590
 at one point, I noticed that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.109
 pump did not start and did not drain water 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.359
 washing machine running drain water 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.130
 forcedly it started and so 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.900
 lasted a long time she 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.210
 run through growth normally 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.220
 Worked a moment came to what I 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.590
 it is all tired I decided to figure out what 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.990
 what for to parse the washing machine 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.059
 we need tharks like this 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.870
 hex only profile looks like 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.520
 asterisk pliers and key for 10 not 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.070
 forget to disconnect the power from 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.020
 washing machine and so unscrew all 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.539
 screws along the contour of the washing machine and 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.090
 remove the back cover we see the whole 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.930
 the filling is our pump is in the left 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.989
 bottom corner 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.760
 disconnect the power wires of the pump take 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.760
 pliers and remove the drain pipe 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.160
 not 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.350
 then tilt the washing machine 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.850
 unscrew the two screws that holds 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.210
 pump housing and remove 2 clamp and pull out 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.210
 pump 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.210
 we have such info 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.409
 test try to replace it at all 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.880
 screwed on clean 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.590
 rotates and take out so 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.590
 we have a very large gap 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.080
 run down sleeve ideally you need to take 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.090
 now this pump and go to the market and 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.970
 pick a new one but i want to try 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.860
 blind from the bottom of 2 companies I have very 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.930
 long been lying pump from washing 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.980
 typewriter whirlpool which once 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.740
 gave a neighbor 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.140
 pump quite working now try them 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.750
 dock as it turned out almost on 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.180
 all computers the same seats and 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.370
 only types of fastening differ 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.730
 the pump is secured with snaps 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.320
 And pump from purple on samorezakh thinking 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.230
 a few minutes I came up with how 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.540
 dock the whirlpool pump and housing 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.370
 Tatars house does not look very much but keeps 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.440
 quite safe for a while 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.630
 will work and during this time I can find 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.640
 the pump I needed was unlucky that 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.390
 it turned out to do so now on 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.490
 winter street 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.460
 about the last few days 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.320
 40 centimeters of snow and New Year's Eve 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.040
 pumps quest not to make not very 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.660
 I now wanted to collect all 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.500
 in reverse order and check 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.500
 washing machine 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.250
 the pump is powered by AC voltage 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.690
 220 volts so it doesn't matter 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.640
 what conclusion where according to the information before 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.830
 installing the back cover you need to hold 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.530
 inspection of the drum bearing assembly 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.080
 engine and foam connections on 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.820
 subject to external faults also 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.950
 until the machine is disconnected from the water you need 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.410
 clean the inlet strainer 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.480
 the machine is taken out by pliers without 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.480
 special effort and then washed with water 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.230
 certainly not in all washing machines 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.780
 so easy to get to the computer 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.960
 the cost of a new pump about 200 hryvnia 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.380
 it is about 10 15 dollars cost 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.710
 call the master and replace the pump about 300 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.010
 hryvnia is about 15 dollars and this 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.010
 moment 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.430
 so the machine is repaired 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.860
 saved money can be bought 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.390
 kilogram 15 tangerines all with 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.160
