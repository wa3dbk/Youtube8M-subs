hello what is going on guys this is
called<00:00:02.520> double<00:00:02.700> unit<00:00:02.939> in<00:00:03.090> today's<00:00:03.360> video

we're<00:00:03.959> gonna<00:00:04.049> be<00:00:04.170> discussing<00:00:04.710> learning

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
we're gonna be discussing learning

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.430 
we're gonna be discussing learning
curves<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.150> Last<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.509> Us<00:00:06.629> factions<00:00:07.200> a

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
curves and the Last of Us factions a

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.680 
curves and the Last of Us factions a
learning<00:00:08.130> curve<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.490> basically<00:00:09.030> how<00:00:09.300> long<00:00:09.540> it

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
learning curve is basically how long it

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.930 
learning curve is basically how long it
takes<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.080> develop<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.740> skill<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> specific

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
takes to develop a skill and a specific

takes to develop a skill and a specific
thing<00:00:12.300> now<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.590> last<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.160> us<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:15.139> semi-auto

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
thing now in the last of us a semi-auto

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.960 
thing now in the last of us a semi-auto
does<00:00:16.710> not<00:00:16.890> have<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> big<00:00:17.340> learning<00:00:17.520> curve<00:00:17.850> if

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
does not have a big learning curve if

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.790 
does not have a big learning curve if
you<00:00:18.029> can<00:00:18.270> easily<00:00:18.570> pick<00:00:18.960> up<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> weapon<00:00:19.590> and

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
you can easily pick up the weapon and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.390 
you can easily pick up the weapon and
use<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:21.510> very<00:00:21.810> well<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.949> hunting

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
use it and do very well the hunting

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.490 
use it and do very well the hunting
rifle<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:23.880> example<00:00:24.390> that's<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.140> little<00:00:25.320> bit

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
rifle for example that's a little bit

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.470 
rifle for example that's a little bit
more<00:00:25.680> tricky<00:00:25.890> isn't<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.910> takes<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.240> lot<00:00:27.449> of

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
more tricky isn't it it takes a lot of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.630 
more tricky isn't it it takes a lot of
skill<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.960> practice<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.830> master<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.250> thing

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
skill and practice to master that thing

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.030 
skill and practice to master that thing
it's<00:00:29.849> probably<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> most<00:00:30.929> complex<00:00:31.470> weapon<00:00:31.920> in

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
it's probably the most complex weapon in

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.860 
it's probably the most complex weapon in
the<00:00:32.130> game<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.669> lot<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.120> people<00:00:33.390> complain<00:00:33.840> that

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the game a lot of people complain that

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.440 
the game a lot of people complain that
the<00:00:34.200> semi-auto<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.489> overpowered<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the semi-auto is really overpowered and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.280 
the semi-auto is really overpowered and
it's<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.739> best<00:00:37.890> stuff<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> game<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.600> I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
it's the best stuff in the game and I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.160 
it's the best stuff in the game and I
have<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.800> agree<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.340> disagree<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:42.480> semi-auto

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
have to agree and disagree the semi-auto

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.940 
have to agree and disagree the semi-auto
is<00:00:43.700> definitely<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:45.170> really<00:00:46.170> low<00:00:46.440> learning

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
is definitely a really low learning

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.119 
is definitely a really low learning
curve<00:00:47.160> weapon<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.000> kind<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.420> unfair<00:00:48.870> because

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
curve weapon it's kind of unfair because

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.639 
curve weapon it's kind of unfair because
it's<00:00:50.129> very<00:00:50.550> easy<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.059> use<00:00:51.300> anyone<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.410> good

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
it's very easy to use anyone can be good

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.619 
it's very easy to use anyone can be good
with<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.129> however<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> long<00:00:54.180> run<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.600> is

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
with it however in the long run it is

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.069 
with it however in the long run it is
not<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.469> best<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:56.190> my<00:00:56.550> personal<00:00:57.030> opinion<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
not the best in my personal opinion the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.990 
not the best in my personal opinion the
biggest<00:00:58.500> learning<00:00:58.710> curve<00:00:58.949> weapon<00:00:59.699> will

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
biggest learning curve weapon will

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.410 
biggest learning curve weapon will
always<00:01:00.510> dominate<00:01:01.170> once<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.100> master<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.699> since

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
always dominate once you master it since

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.690 
always dominate once you master it since
it<00:01:03.539> does<00:01:03.750> reward<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.519> mastering<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it does reward you for mastering the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.609 
it does reward you for mastering the
hunting<00:01:06.090> rifle<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:06.630> shot<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> head

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
hunting rifle one shot to the head

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.030 
hunting rifle one shot to the head
you're<00:01:08.130> down<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.540> easily<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.380> gun<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> lot

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
you're down you can easily out gun a lot

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.820 
you're down you can easily out gun a lot
of<00:01:11.189> people<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.180> accuracy<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.960> pinpoint

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
of people if your accuracy is pinpoint

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.850 
of people if your accuracy is pinpoint
some<00:01:14.760> say<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.210> burst<00:01:15.630> rifle<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.470> low

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
some say is the burst rifle a low

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.399 
some say is the burst rifle a low
learning<00:01:17.280> curve<00:01:17.520> weapon<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.090> well<00:01:18.299> Kyle<00:01:18.600> well

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
learning curve weapon as well Kyle well

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.800 
learning curve weapon as well Kyle well
I<00:01:19.890> would<00:01:20.549> say<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.299> between<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
I would say it's in between the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.109 
I would say it's in between the
semi-auto<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.830> hunting<00:01:23.610> rifle

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
semi-auto and the hunting rifle

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.600 
semi-auto and the hunting rifle
it<00:01:24.479> certainly<00:01:24.869> does<00:01:25.200> take<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> lot<00:01:25.860> more<00:01:26.100> skill

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
it certainly does take a lot more skill

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
it certainly does take a lot more skill
to<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:28.020> down<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.409> headshot<00:01:28.890> pattern<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
to get down the headshot pattern for the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.890 
to get down the headshot pattern for the
burst<00:01:30.869> rifle<00:01:31.320> than<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:33.030> semi-auto<00:01:33.570> it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
burst rifle than the semi-auto it

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.289 
burst rifle than the semi-auto it
definitely<00:01:34.380> does<00:01:34.650> take<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> little<00:01:35.909> bit<00:01:36.090> more

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
definitely does take a little bit more

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.840 
definitely does take a little bit more
time<00:01:36.600> does<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.380> take<00:01:37.560> long<00:01:37.590> no<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.520> does<00:01:38.700> not

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
time does it take long no it does not

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.060 
time does it take long no it does not
take<00:01:39.119> long<00:01:39.150> anyone<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.290> learn<00:01:40.470> how<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.799> use

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
take long anyone can learn how to use

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
take long anyone can learn how to use

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
because learning curve is really small

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.090 
because learning curve is really small
and<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.660> hunting<00:02:26.110> rifle<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.710> Barrett<00:02:26.980> rifle
