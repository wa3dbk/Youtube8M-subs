00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 then you will have to continue 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.770
 catch this boy is apply the css he 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.960
 so that it stays 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.870
 That 's how the list in case the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.480
 nothing ours is not ordered let's do 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.549
 then the following will come here right itself 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.990
 style only look at the list name o 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.750
 name of the time we gave it was boy 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.270
 So I'll create until we start putting 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.609
 in the other class here with some parameters 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.369
 for example, background of the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.680
 our menu list down here I go 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.470
 do the following I'll create for her is 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.440
 a parameter I told you stallone 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.690
 he will not have at the stadium tap name 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.770
 When I want to take out the balls of 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.510
 markers 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.140
 I put this here I'll put a 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.050
 margin of zero pixels and here I go 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.239
 place a page spacing 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.430
 zero pizza 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.760
 Okay, you'll stay there and kick it. 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.500
 found this one here to see us 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.210
 f12 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.220
 there he the beauty then he already got that 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.650
 Coladinho in this image without spacing 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.200
 and no list also now needs to be 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.150
 work on the markers themselves then 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.460
 how am I going to do this then I will 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.650
 create another rule here and say that 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.750
 this rule will only be for the list of 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.020
 menu as I do it - said that I 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.770
 I taught the school in the room to leave css 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.110
 I take parameter and there after the da 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.760
 dani identified the boy he goes 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.920
 understand that it's just for him he wants a 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.170
 distance from the top margin then margin 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.340
 top I'll leave it with 10 pixel 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.979
 remembering that all the others are 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.430
 zeroed because we went wrong there and the bottom 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:40.030
 background of his background i'm going to put 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.070
 one through here one can year beauty and one 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.810
 spacing from one to the other that 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.060
 be 2 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.180
 will be a little bit coladinhos - and 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.550
 Do not be so close together, you'll be left with 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.110
 this down here 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:00.010
 better organized ok against the left 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.500
 update here then there what happened 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.180
 he was spaced out there alone 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.980
 But what is this here is showing a 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.030
 green color in the background is because I left 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.130
 for this debt and cry here for this 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.110
 debt that is the left column a 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.190
 background and only pays for that background 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.890
 against the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.350
 She already lost the line is this color of 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.170
 background that you need our 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.270
 we centralize and if this text does not 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.730
 has this color on the bottom food only has 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.880
 color in the list I know why you got this 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.580
 shape is also has to take and this 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.820
 underline how to do it so here 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.650
 up where I have where is the menu 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.750
 he can not have this background here 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.910
 I 'm not going to take this , it's going to be like 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.400
 this past aline without guilt and the two 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.410
 things seemed a lot there then it goes 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.660
 without the background color of the menu to go 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.150
 which is curable in which the marker has 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.850
 list that was where we put it here 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.440
 underneath it then this was the right thing to do 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.100
 I need to align this text 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.410
 then text-align center for him 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.350
 Okay, so you're going to stay in the middle and 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.460
 center 7 what else do I need to do 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.530
 what 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.390
 semicolon here I think I believe that 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.570
 For this list, this is just for us. 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.880
 set some more things now for 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.550
 anchor to the menu link so I'll put 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.130
 boy and access the option is to link him 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:30.790
 the anchor lippi I need to take out then 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:34.040
 while underlining text parameter is decoration 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.320
 I do not want that decoration. 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.120
 link finds west let me come here 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.150
 update to see what has already 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.740
 Centralized and tasted aaa the little 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.170
 when passing the mouse it is interesting that 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.680
 it demonstrates to the user that 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.170
 This is a link so I'll copy this is the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.040
 rule that you invoked is down there and here 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.640
 will be the grass two points clothing that is 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.900
 property when the mouse is 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.820
 superimposed here in my name I go 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.070
 put here underline I want it 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.350
 stressing you could trade kuhn and 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.970
 do several other properties besides 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.130
 To do this here, let me do the 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:15.430
 next change another property here 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:21.910
 I came, I do not have the body of the page. 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.910
 let's create here or not 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.229
 I 'll do it later, I 'll do it. 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:38.360
 font-family will put all the aal 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:42.590
 typeface are all beauty 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.770
 against s let him not all 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.219
 arial font ok now that no 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.960
 it did not work the rover leaves the 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:56.800
 look because he did not give 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.800
 the right menu 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.580
 at the time I wrote wrong I invented this 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.760
 property here is rover let's test her 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.140
 opa then already gave it worked properly 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.390
 so we have here right? 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.830
 our menu then we can touch it 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.200
 there in the background color and such 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.880
 while we're going to leave it very complex 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.860
 That's not it , it's a simple thing too. 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.870
 is for those who have seen the other modules and 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.250
 fÃ¡bio then doing so he not quiet 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.510
 I'll go into it a lot. 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.750
 now that we're going to start doing 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.790
 sessions and divisions of the content area 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.860
 So it's going to be a bummer for us to start. 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.860
 this area a hug until the next
