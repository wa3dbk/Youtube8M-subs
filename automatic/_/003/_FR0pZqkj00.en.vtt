 we are transferred directly in front of the stairs 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.960
 every now and then he believes now percent 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.540
 but again laughed at the Ostrale because of her in the case of 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.650
 Ford Roadster driving the knife 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.540
 Mr. cared for but one hits him took over his cockpit 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.290
 first time 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.080
 now generally warns 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.610
 Together, the instance was generally very interesting 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.170
 Dr completely from 2 NV 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.590
 especially town hall pretty percent demanding 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.710
 the other courses 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.150
 but they were 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.510
 Relatively fast compared to other large instances to defend 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 but otherwise generally instance 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.670
 was there very interesting so z experts were going to draw votes 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.650
 So nothing looks like the legs to put so the first six buses 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.060
 rail project 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.690
 the stadiums are the mission, but they are still going strong 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.170
 Definitely very demanding and percent why are they interesting 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.770
 Who has to fight with it but has for that the son of the way 7 percent 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.650
 elaborate town hall await you here 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.340
 to cover that up with you 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.070
 one pushes on approx 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.590
 They definitely need an eye, however, so nowadays needs 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.110
 Noise on one so surprised can get 5 degrees at 5 degrees 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.940
 drive until then 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.410
 which majority stand in your own way 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.190
 what makes the Chancellor claim Wolgast was born on the mistake of what 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.110
 Water is dangerous 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.069
 the fight in general is therefore challenging Beitz 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.549
 there are many phases 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.780
 That's what everyone has to play 100 percent perfect 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.129
 usually ready immediately 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.680
 These are maximum result requirements and with the animal where you lie quasi 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.620
 comes at the time Brinkum are so Wagner from we wait and go 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.799
 that's why it took forever, according to Vanity Plates requirements 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.209
 We really had a lot of songs from all over the world 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.870
 and more and more EHEC and then in the end flies 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.859
 again, who let single target insert world and the last one at all 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.119
 Phase to come would have two with 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:40.619
 seven boxes 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.549
 for the entire group 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.229
 as little as it served Gladbeck aphids might possibly stand 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.379
 we want a new animal with 1 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.009
 or 7 Russell is general 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:56.679
 for me personally actually okay 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:58.619
 have been compared to the last 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:01.629
 with the three instances 2 is too much 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.139
 it was currently on the way and all the while shifting this back and forth 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:12.499
 that was so on it now have an instance this larger consuming 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.239
 Porsche Holding finds 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.190
 so far, there was oil loss catchment of Baden is still another of the 1 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.199
 if you just want to do it all with singer 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.129
 van der Sar October 6 o'clock 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.869
 its already something else to come up with 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.689
 So we have 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.489
 but single-handedly 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.679
 and then there would have to be joy 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:39.879
 from 4 0 to 4 2 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.319
 comparable celebrated 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.319
 first forgive early improved time let 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.679
 that's one thing 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.039
 the VfB with 7 3 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:54.789
 RMS conceivable for it after suspending the e-perso 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:58.649
 this certainly still a two months old time flow the verdict 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.309
 it should 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:04.309
 mrs 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.959
 I agree with that 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.959
 to Tenerife 

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:14.779
 Above all, it is always better to do so for the next one 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.389
 Challenge comes in one 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.799
 Goals 1 if it was the same as in the next few days or sixth 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.059
 of course better if he 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.059
 the so-called Russian, although not quite so extremely distorted 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:29.439
 so'n bit raised it really was very easy to get out on request 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.270
 the climb was challenging 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.340
 the barriers 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.059
 something like that became a new partner 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:46.299
 Rolf admission from 3 percent actually happy for the sales back so 

00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:50.509
 How was Kadir Topbas's credit rating? 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.900
 Zoppot the warned for a second in there is the Kaarst expanded 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.699
 Santiago is easy but you have it easier than 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.060
 Minister really extremely demanding alone because of the whole 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.029
 slimmed down before the jail you have 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:10.979
 Of this alone account for 2 in the Laue conflagration it already 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.589
 Petraeus the system is extremely difficult best of both goal 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:17.599
 Westerwelle 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.089
 the media expert the next one though 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:23.409
 I would like to Tibet so percent of natural gas is not to do 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.330
 who the mole is yes that we do not have that minimum of Minister Bavaria 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.120
 Munich Levermann if you have the nerves 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.480
 The locomotives were specially designed for that reason he wanted a very nice Bavarian goalkeeper 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.980
 Partner out she may have some of the only two celebrities to pass 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.240
 this area 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.819
 they become the Fidesz 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.210
 During the week was a weapons warehouse at the party on the way 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.419
 Val dor percent consider this a download manager 19 now olofsson-zidek 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.680
 still relatively good as far as percent 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.449
 the number of complexities would be teacher number Betz and so much too 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.270
 Food is there says Easter 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.270
 which had even if it was external 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:04.849
 an advantage 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:05.889
 ÖFB-boss 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.889
 what do you wish for the next places? 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.729
 For the next expedition will definitely be like the friendly dream gate 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.020
 the Tüv South all classes of course 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.949
 Definitely because better Regiobahn because 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.639
 it is quite difficult but start catching up as a militia in the 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.210
 Castoren especially if you still so many things based on silver fir 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.879
 So while there is a footpath at the beginning both are big but very limited 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.009
 most are DPS output 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.110
 and may it be governed later is when the final boss are slowly catching up 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.059
 that's why he is better Demidow but the beginning of the instance to pack 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:47.319
 and, as it were, that hinders Sander the optimal balance between human and with 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.869
 Look in the hand 

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:53.199
 with much better if you fell now 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:56.410
 she is currently working so if you have something we had at the time 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:58.460
 Biss had made it 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.689
 meant the box z 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:02.800
 Erfurt 17 quasi on 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.749
 with it fall two more aces or 

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:07.319
 really better with the completely new one here 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.599
 So personally I like it better with completely new beer 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:14.300
 because it is as said on which the two customers adapted them really 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:20.409
 so the BoJ we turn it into a party Lenz so the last part also rather 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:21.999
 change moderately 

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:25.659
 and it would not have worked so finance so whoever i find on the start 

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:27.719
 it is very good now 

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:30.960
 Knaup world the bar wants to give weird 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.069
 SC Waldgirmes saw 

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:34.969
 I did not seem to have been hurt 

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:38.689
 but shoulders knock the big parts it already feels better you Rietz 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:42.699
 I can travel so well 

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:46.710
 so is will it is the addition of e on hydropower therefore becomes a new one 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.860
 valence 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.649
 pleased 8 to 5 percent and there 

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:52.389
 05 12
