00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
engineering the first thing that we'll

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.570 
engineering the first thing that we'll
do<00:00:37.550> is<00:00:37.820> remove<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.739> float<00:00:40.010> Bowl<00:00:40.220> I've

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
do is remove the the float Bowl I've

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.920 
do is remove the the float Bowl I've
already<00:00:40.820> pulled<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:41.150> screws<00:00:41.420> out<00:00:41.570> of<00:00:41.629> here

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
already pulled the screws out of here

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.380 
already pulled the screws out of here
but<00:00:42.050> there's<00:00:42.199> usually<00:00:42.320> four<00:00:42.710> screws<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.390> you

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
but there's usually four screws and you

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.180 
but there's usually four screws and you
just<00:00:44.600> pull<00:00:44.780> this<00:00:44.900> this<00:00:45.320> bowl<00:00:45.590> off<00:00:45.830> being<00:00:46.100> very

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
just pull this this bowl off being very

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.020 
just pull this this bowl off being very
careful<00:00:46.850> of<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:48.170> float<00:00:48.470> this<00:00:49.460> here<00:00:49.820> would<00:00:49.970> be

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
careful of the float this here would be

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.080 
careful of the float this here would be
your<00:00:50.330> flow<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:51.040> to<00:00:52.040> get<00:00:52.190> proper<00:00:52.520> performance

and especially fuel mileage out of our
predator<00:00:55.010> Pro<00:00:55.309> this<00:00:55.940> is<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:56.300> very<00:00:56.570> important

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
predator Pro this is a very important

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.600 
predator Pro this is a very important
adjustment<00:00:57.440> must<00:00:57.649> be<00:00:57.800> done<00:00:58.010> with<00:00:58.160> our<00:00:58.309> kit<00:00:58.579> and

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
adjustment must be done with our kit and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.180 
adjustment must be done with our kit and
it's<00:00:58.940> very<00:00:59.360> simple<00:00:59.809> the<00:01:00.800> point<00:01:01.010> we're<00:01:01.100> going

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
it's very simple the point we're going

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.450 
it's very simple the point we're going
to<00:01:01.250> measure<00:01:01.399> from<00:01:01.660> there's<00:01:02.660> three<00:01:03.620> points<00:01:04.190> if

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
to measure from there's three points if

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.060 
to measure from there's three points if
you<00:01:05.000> tip<00:01:05.180> this<00:01:05.360> carburetor<00:01:05.780> all<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.740> way<00:01:06.830> down

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
you tip this carburetor all the way down

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.580 
you tip this carburetor all the way down
that's<00:01:07.520> one<00:01:07.820> point<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.390> then<00:01:09.259> as<00:01:09.410> you<00:01:09.530> start

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
that's one point and then as you start

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.719 
that's one point and then as you start
to<00:01:09.950> roll<00:01:10.130> it<00:01:10.250> up<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:11.680> floats<00:01:12.680> will<00:01:13.330> settle<00:01:14.330> in

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
to roll it up the floats will settle in

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.440 
to roll it up the floats will settle in
to<00:01:16.729> yet<00:01:16.940> another<00:01:17.060> point<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:18.220> then<00:01:19.220> as<00:01:19.490> you

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
to yet another point and then as you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.260 
to yet another point and then as you
flip<00:01:20.720> it<00:01:20.810> all<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.080> way<00:01:21.380> upside<00:01:21.740> down<00:01:22.149> for<00:01:23.149> so

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
flip it all the way upside down for so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.300 
flip it all the way upside down for so
I'm<00:01:23.420> out<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.780> screen<00:01:24.080> there<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.890> goes<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.280> a

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
I'm out of the screen there it goes to a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.850 
I'm out of the screen there it goes to a
final<00:01:25.729> point<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.930> point<00:01:27.140> we<00:01:27.380> want<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.680> go<00:01:27.830> to

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
final point the point we want to go to

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.620 
final point the point we want to go to
is<00:01:28.369> that<00:01:29.119> middle<00:01:29.810> point<00:01:30.140> right<00:01:30.500> there<00:01:30.880> not<00:01:31.880> the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
is that middle point right there not the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.920 
is that middle point right there not the
all<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.170> way<00:01:33.290> upside<00:01:33.650> down<00:01:34.010> point<00:01:36.729> so<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:38.720> take

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
all the way upside down point so to take

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.289 
all the way upside down point so to take
our<00:01:39.080> measurement<00:01:39.590> we<00:01:40.400> take<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.820> vernier

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
our measurement we take a vernier

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.499 
our measurement we take a vernier
caliper<00:01:42.040> preferably<00:01:43.040> a<00:01:43.159> metric<00:01:43.610> one<00:01:43.820> I'm<00:01:44.210> sure

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
caliper preferably a metric one I'm sure

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.069 
caliper preferably a metric one I'm sure
you've<00:01:44.659> all<00:01:44.810> seen<00:01:44.840> one<00:01:45.320> of<00:01:45.409> these<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:46.869> has<00:01:47.869> it

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
you've all seen one of these it has it

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.390 
you've all seen one of these it has it
this<00:01:48.320> particular<00:01:48.590> one<00:01:48.979> has<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.189> depth<00:01:49.490> gauge<00:01:49.630> so

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
this particular one has a depth gauge so

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.880 
this particular one has a depth gauge so
we'll<00:01:52.400> use<00:01:52.670> this<00:01:52.850> depth<00:01:53.180> gauge<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:53.780> don't<00:01:54.619> use

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
we'll use this depth gauge and don't use

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.670 
we'll use this depth gauge and don't use
one<00:01:55.220> without<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:55.939> you<00:01:56.900> can<00:01:57.020> use<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.200> standard

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
one without that you can use a standard

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.990 
one without that you can use a standard
one<00:01:57.890> if<00:01:58.040> you<00:01:58.159> get<00:01:58.369> a<00:01:58.430> proper<00:01:58.820> conversion

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
one if you get a proper conversion

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.240 
one if you get a proper conversion
that's<00:01:59.960> no<00:02:00.140> problem<00:02:00.350> but<00:02:00.680> do<00:02:00.799> not<00:02:00.979> use<00:02:01.220> a

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
that's no problem but do not use a

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.149 
that's no problem but do not use a
vernier<00:02:01.640> caliper<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.390> doesn't<00:02:02.720> have<00:02:03.159> a

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
vernier caliper that doesn't have a

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.889 
vernier caliper that doesn't have a
depth<00:02:04.939> gauge<00:02:05.030> you<00:02:05.270> just<00:02:05.479> won't<00:02:05.600> get<00:02:05.780> the

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
depth gauge you just won't get the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.949 
depth gauge you just won't get the
accurate<00:02:06.290> measurement<00:02:06.680> that<00:02:06.829> you<00:02:06.920> need<00:02:07.959> okay

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
accurate measurement that you need okay

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.660 
accurate measurement that you need okay
so<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.679> point<00:02:09.860> we<00:02:10.100> want<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.340> take<00:02:10.489> our

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
so the point we want to take our

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.000 
so the point we want to take our
measurement<00:02:11.120> from<00:02:11.329> is<00:02:11.690> right<00:02:12.560> here<00:02:12.799> on<00:02:12.890> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
measurement from is right here on the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.560 
measurement from is right here on the
pontoon<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.610> see<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.820> slight<00:02:14.090> curve<00:02:14.360> in<00:02:14.480> the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
pontoon you see a slight curve in the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.270 
pontoon you see a slight curve in the
pontoon<00:02:15.049> we<00:02:15.380> want<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.680> hit<00:02:15.829> right<00:02:16.040> on<00:02:16.160> the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
pontoon we want to hit right on the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.280 
pontoon we want to hit right on the
center<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.760> highest<00:02:17.030> point<00:02:17.360> or<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:18.110> lowest

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
center the highest point or the lowest

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
get our initial measurements see how

much<00:02:34.579> we<00:02:34.969> need<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.239> move<00:02:35.390> this<00:02:35.829> we<00:02:36.829> will<00:02:37.099> tip<00:02:37.760> to

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:37.969 
much we need to move this we will tip to

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:39.880 
much we need to move this we will tip to
our<00:02:38.000> middle<00:02:38.480> point<00:02:38.750> not<00:02:39.230> upside<00:02:39.620> down

our middle point not upside down
remember<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.430> there's<00:02:40.790> going<00:02:40.909> to<00:02:40.969> be<00:02:41.030> one

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
remember this there's going to be one

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.509 
remember this there's going to be one
more<00:02:41.510> point<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.319> recommend<00:02:42.650> not<00:02:42.829> pushing

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
more point and I recommend not pushing

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:44.740 
more point and I recommend not pushing
on<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:43.909> but<00:02:44.150> I'm<00:02:44.239> going<00:02:44.359> to<00:02:44.390> do<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.629> for

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
on this but I'm going to do it for

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.379 
on this but I'm going to do it for
demonstration<00:02:48.639> there'll<00:02:49.639> be<00:02:49.700> one<00:02:49.909> more<00:02:50.090> point

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
demonstration there'll be one more point

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.390 
demonstration there'll be one more point
you<00:02:51.139> don't<00:02:51.319> want<00:02:51.469> to<00:02:51.530> go<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.709> that<00:02:51.920> point<00:02:52.159> you

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
you don't want to go to that point you

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.729 
you don't want to go to that point you
want<00:02:52.579> to<00:02:52.609> go<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.719> the<00:02:53.840> midpoint<00:02:54.409> and

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
want to go to the to the midpoint and

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:01.899 
want to go to the to the midpoint and
then<00:02:56.170> take<00:02:57.170> your<00:02:57.319> caliper<00:02:57.769> and<00:03:00.010> slide<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.219> down

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
then take your caliper and slide it down

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.690 
then take your caliper and slide it down
till<00:03:02.599> it<00:03:02.750> almost<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.739> like<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.040> leave<00:03:04.219> a<00:03:04.250> little

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
till it almost I like to leave a little

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.699 
till it almost I like to leave a little
bit<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.269> room<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:06.919> I<00:03:06.980> don't<00:03:07.099> knock<00:03:08.709> the

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
bit of room so I don't knock the

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.490 
bit of room so I don't knock the
measurement<00:03:10.250> out<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.750> I'm<00:03:11.870> not<00:03:11.900> touching

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
measurement out so I'm not touching

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.699 
measurement out so I'm not touching
actually<00:03:13.040> touching<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:13.970> pontoon<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.870> that's

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
actually touching the pontoon and that's

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.520 
actually touching the pontoon and that's
a<00:03:15.859> little<00:03:16.129> more<00:03:16.430> than<00:03:16.760> 12<00:03:17.359> so<00:03:17.599> we'll<00:03:17.689> say<00:03:17.989> it's

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
a little more than 12 so we'll say it's

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.280 
a little more than 12 so we'll say it's
most<00:03:18.829> likely<00:03:19.540> with<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.569> little<00:03:20.900> bit<00:03:20.989> of<00:03:21.019> light<00:03:21.260> I

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
most likely with a little bit of light I

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.149 
most likely with a little bit of light I
left<00:03:21.590> there<00:03:21.769> 12<00:03:22.159> millimeters<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.919> trick

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
left there 12 millimeters that the trick

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.129 
left there 12 millimeters that the trick
is<00:03:25.340> as<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:25.849> can<00:03:25.879> see<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.150> actually<00:03:26.480> did<00:03:26.900> push

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
is as you can see I actually did push

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.080 
is as you can see I actually did push
that<00:03:27.379> a<00:03:27.439> little<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.099> trick<00:03:28.310> is<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.519> take

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
that a little so the trick is to take

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.379 
that a little so the trick is to take
your<00:03:29.269> measurement<00:03:29.719> without<00:03:30.019> pushing<00:03:31.120> okay<00:03:32.120> so

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
your measurement without pushing okay so

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.490 
your measurement without pushing okay so
now<00:03:32.930> in<00:03:33.889> order<00:03:34.069> to<00:03:34.389> adjust<00:03:35.389> this<00:03:35.659> float<00:03:36.079> we

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
now in order to adjust this float we

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.750 
now in order to adjust this float we
want<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.829> bring<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.549> from<00:03:37.729> 12<00:03:38.180> out<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:39.530> 14<00:03:40.159> which

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
want to bring it from 12 out to 14 which

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
want to bring it from 12 out to 14 which
means<00:03:40.970> we're<00:03:41.090> going<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.269> make<00:03:41.359> this<00:03:41.479> distance

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
means we're going to make this distance

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.830 
means we're going to make this distance
here<00:03:42.169> longer<00:03:42.699> we'll<00:03:43.699> Bend<00:03:43.940> this<00:03:44.090> tab<00:03:44.389> up<00:03:44.659> in

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
here longer we'll Bend this tab up in

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.280 
here longer we'll Bend this tab up in
here

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
here

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.319 
here
this<00:03:45.889> is<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.040> very<00:03:46.190> simple<00:03:46.489> procedure<00:03:46.909> but<00:03:47.060> you

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
this is a very simple procedure but you

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.050 
this is a very simple procedure but you
want<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.540> be<00:03:47.629> delicate<00:03:48.139> and<00:03:48.699> take<00:03:49.699> your<00:03:49.849> time

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
want to be delicate and take your time

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.569 
want to be delicate and take your time
here<00:03:50.359> but<00:03:51.019> it<00:03:51.169> will<00:03:51.290> be<00:03:51.349> very<00:03:52.129> quick<00:03:52.370> and

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
here but it will be very quick and

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.479 
here but it will be very quick and
simple<00:03:52.639> we'll<00:03:53.599> just<00:03:53.840> take<00:03:54.079> our<00:03:54.489> our

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
simple we'll just take our our

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.210 
simple we'll just take our our
screwdriver<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.389> wedge<00:03:56.599> it<00:03:56.629> in<00:03:56.900> here<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.439> pry

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
screwdriver and wedge it in here and pry

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.849 
screwdriver and wedge it in here and pry
down<00:03:58.280> on<00:03:59.000> this<00:03:59.560> tab<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:01.569> try<00:04:02.569> to<00:04:02.629> expand<00:04:03.199> this

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
down on this tab and try to expand this

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.259 
down on this tab and try to expand this
measurement<00:04:04.489> by<00:04:05.090> by<00:04:05.840> prying<00:04:06.530> down<00:04:06.739> on<00:04:06.859> the<00:04:06.979> tab

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
measurement by by prying down on the tab

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.039 
measurement by by prying down on the tab
now<00:04:08.269> we<00:04:08.329> measure<00:04:08.900> we've<00:04:09.889> set<00:04:10.099> our<00:04:10.220> caliper<00:04:11.049> at

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
now we measure we've set our caliper at

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.039 
now we measure we've set our caliper at
14<00:04:12.979> just<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.459> little<00:04:13.729> more<00:04:13.909> than<00:04:14.060> 14<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:14.840> allow

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
14 just a little more than 14 to allow

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.240 
14 just a little more than 14 to allow
for<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.349> small<00:04:15.620> gap<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:18.709> that<00:04:18.739> we<00:04:18.949> don't<00:04:19.039> touch

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
for a small gap so that we don't touch

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.469 
for a small gap so that we don't touch
the<00:04:19.310> pontoon<00:04:19.820> when<00:04:20.030> we're<00:04:20.209> measuring<00:04:20.389> and

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
the pontoon when we're measuring and

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.089 
the pontoon when we're measuring and
we'll<00:04:23.479> tip<00:04:23.659> it<00:04:23.780> back<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.380> second<00:04:24.919> point

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
we'll tip it back to the second point

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.790 
we'll tip it back to the second point
and<00:04:25.759> we'll<00:04:26.330> notice<00:04:26.630> that<00:04:26.659> we're<00:04:26.930> right<00:04:27.139> at<00:04:27.289> 14

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
and we'll notice that we're right at 14

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.129 
and we'll notice that we're right at 14
with<00:04:28.070> a<00:04:28.130> little<00:04:28.669> bit<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.000> gap<00:04:29.659> showing<00:04:30.020> in

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
with a little bit of a gap showing in

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.439 
with a little bit of a gap showing in
between<00:04:30.440> there<00:04:30.680> so<00:04:30.830> that's<00:04:31.759> our<00:04:31.970> measurement

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
between there so that's our measurement

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.710 
between there so that's our measurement
it's<00:04:32.659> that<00:04:32.870> simple<00:04:33.460> if<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:34.610> go<00:04:34.759> too<00:04:34.820> far<00:04:35.210> then
