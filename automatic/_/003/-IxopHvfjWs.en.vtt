00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.879 

so<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.630> reason<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.050> choose<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.710> shoot

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
so the reason that I choose to shoot

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.950 
so the reason that I choose to shoot
natural<00:00:11.280> light<00:00:11.429> versus<00:00:11.849> anything<00:00:12.210> with

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
natural light versus anything with

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.919 
natural light versus anything with
strobes<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.969> really<00:00:14.969> based<00:00:15.150> on<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> integrity

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
strobes is really based on the integrity

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.510 
strobes is really based on the integrity
of<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> actual<00:00:16.500> photo<00:00:16.740> capturing<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> raw

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
of the actual photo capturing the raw

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.340 
of the actual photo capturing the raw
image<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.270> whomever<00:00:18.600> around<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.900> shooting<00:00:19.199> I

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
image of whomever around the shooting I

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.590 
image of whomever around the shooting I
like<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.029> color<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
like the I like the color I like the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.480 
like the I like the color I like the
lighting<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.140> think<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.680> once<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.980> step<00:00:23.279> into

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
lighting I think that once you step into

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.519 
lighting I think that once you step into
strobes<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.240> start<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.630> commercialize<00:00:25.320> your

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
strobes you start to commercialize your

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.589 
strobes you start to commercialize your
product<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.039> i<00:00:26.910> think<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.119> authenticity<00:00:27.570> of

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
product and i think the authenticity of

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.169 
product and i think the authenticity of
a<00:00:28.109> natural<00:00:28.830> light<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.369> brings<00:00:29.580> much<00:00:29.789> more<00:00:30.060> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
a natural light just brings much more of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.080 
a natural light just brings much more of
the<00:00:30.269> personnel<00:00:30.779> both<00:00:31.470> emotionally<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
the personnel both emotionally and

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.639 
the personnel both emotionally and
physically<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.300> well<00:00:39.170> in<00:00:40.170> an<00:00:40.320> effort<00:00:40.469> to

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
physically as well in an effort to

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.450 
physically as well in an effort to
create<00:00:41.370> more<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> studio<00:00:42.899> light<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.980> flash

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
create more of a studio light or a flash

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.750 
create more of a studio light or a flash
effect<00:00:44.690> I've<00:00:45.690> learned<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.760> manipulate

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
effect I've learned to manipulate

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.690 
effect I've learned to manipulate
natural<00:00:48.390> light<00:00:48.539> through<00:00:49.160> reflecting<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
natural light through reflecting the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.250 
natural light through reflecting the
light<00:00:50.730> off<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.270> building<00:00:51.870> across<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.170> street

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
light off a building across the street

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.970 
light off a building across the street
and<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:52.770> onto<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> subject<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.980> style

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
and then onto the subject so that style

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.799 
and then onto the subject so that style
shooting<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.520> nice<00:00:56.670> because<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.480> great

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
shooting is nice because you get a great

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.520 
shooting is nice because you get a great
sense<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:59.210> strong<00:01:00.210> light<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.600> then<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.199> can

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
sense of strong light and then you can

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.070 
sense of strong light and then you can
you<00:01:01.920> know<00:01:01.980> depending<00:01:02.280> upon<00:01:02.399> your<00:01:02.550> style<00:01:03.080> adapt

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you know depending upon your style adapt

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.350 
you know depending upon your style adapt
accordingly<00:01:10.310> biggest<00:01:11.310> thing<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.490> me<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.760> non

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
accordingly biggest thing for me is non

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.190 
accordingly biggest thing for me is non
stage<00:01:12.689> non<00:01:12.990> posed<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.250> taking<00:01:15.210> out<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.600> all

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
stage non posed so taking out that all

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.980 
stage non posed so taking out that all
together<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.810> essentially<00:01:18.810> telling

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
together and just essentially telling

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.749 
together and just essentially telling
the<00:01:19.170> subject<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.680> forget<00:01:19.979> about<00:01:20.070> me<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.670> I'm

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the subject to forget about me that I'm

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.429 
the subject to forget about me that I'm
there<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.150> really<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.900> capture<00:01:22.080> something

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
there I really like to capture something

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.280 
there I really like to capture something
at<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> twirly<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.400> happens<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:25.110> there's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
at a twirly as it happens and so there's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.980 
at a twirly as it happens and so there's
a<00:01:25.350> lot<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.470> interaction<00:01:26.009> there's<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.520> lot<00:01:26.580> of

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
a lot of interaction there's a lot of

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.630 
a lot of interaction there's a lot of
movement<00:01:27.990> there's<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.350> lot<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.640> conversation

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
movement there's a lot of conversation

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.240 
movement there's a lot of conversation
all<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.210> these<00:01:30.509> things<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:31.049> diffuse<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
all of these things really diffuse the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.039 
all of these things really diffuse the
subject<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.790> help<00:01:33.270> them<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.810> become

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
subject and help them not to become

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.050 
subject and help them not to become
intimidated<00:01:34.320> behind<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> light

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
intimidated behind the light

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:46.730 
intimidated behind the light
I<00:01:44.750> think<00:01:45.750> probably<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.110> most<00:01:46.259> important

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
I think probably the most important

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.289 
I think probably the most important
thing<00:01:46.890> when<00:01:47.130> you're<00:01:47.250> working<00:01:47.369> with<00:01:47.579> any

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
thing when you're working with any

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.639 
thing when you're working with any
subject<00:01:48.780> especially<00:01:49.020> when<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.439> comes<00:01:49.530> to

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
subject especially when it comes to

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.060 
subject especially when it comes to
fashion<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.909> tap<00:01:51.539> into<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:51.960> emotion<00:01:52.590> your

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
fashion is to tap into your emotion your

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.730 
fashion is to tap into your emotion your
actual<00:01:53.340> your<00:01:53.670> real<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.840> an<00:01:54.990> actor<00:01:55.289> would<00:01:55.470> your

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and you cant pretend how to feel like it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.340 
and you cant pretend how to feel like it
actually<00:01:59.939> has<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.479> happen<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.079> feel

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
actually has to happen you have to feel

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.710 
actually has to happen you have to feel
that<00:02:01.380> way<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:02.460> order<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.820> work<00:02:03.090> through

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
that way so in order to work through

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.200 
that way so in order to work through
that<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.259> shoot<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.070> mean<00:02:05.579> both<00:02:05.729> subjects

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
that on a shoot I mean both subjects

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.539 
that on a shoot I mean both subjects
have<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.479> be<00:02:06.600> trained<00:02:06.960> well<00:02:07.170> enough<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.590> let<00:02:08.429> it

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
have to be trained well enough to let it

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.370 
have to be trained well enough to let it
actually<00:02:08.910> happen<00:02:09.269> not<00:02:09.720> try<00:02:10.019> to<00:02:10.080> make<00:02:10.259> it

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
actually happen not try to make it

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.620 
actually happen not try to make it
happen<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.489> that's<00:02:11.700> that's<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.239> key<00:02:12.420> is

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
happen and so that's that's the key is

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.819 
happen and so that's that's the key is
to<00:02:12.690> really<00:02:13.500> work<00:02:13.830> off<00:02:14.010> raw<00:02:14.310> emotion
