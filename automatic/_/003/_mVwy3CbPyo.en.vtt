that's<00:03:59.400> just<00:03:59.580> on<00:03:59.760> battery<00:04:00.269> so<00:04:00.480> I'll<00:04:00.540> bring<00:04:00.659> it

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
that's just on battery so I'll bring it

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.699 
that's just on battery so I'll bring it
inside<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.319> show<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.530> how<00:04:01.909> bright<00:04:02.909> it<00:04:03.060> is

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
inside and show you how bright it is

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.050 
inside and show you how bright it is
there's<00:04:04.709> no<00:04:04.860> power<00:04:05.069> on<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.580> here<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:05.939> then

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
there's no power on in here and then

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.080 
there's no power on in here and then
we're<00:04:06.180> still<00:04:06.390> using<00:04:06.810> generators<00:04:07.379> but<00:04:08.090> it's

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
we're still using generators but it's

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.270 
we're still using generators but it's
nowhere<00:04:09.330> near<00:04:09.650> nowhere<00:04:10.650> near<00:04:10.830> as<00:04:10.920> bright<00:04:11.159> as

nowhere near nowhere near as bright as

nowhere near nowhere near as bright as
those<00:04:11.459> work<00:04:11.670> lights<00:04:11.939> if<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:13.080> had<00:04:13.230> those<00:04:13.409> on<00:04:13.650> your

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
those work lights if I had those on your

bed tell a huge difference but you can
kind<00:04:16.290> of<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.440> can<00:04:16.530> see<00:04:16.650> what<00:04:16.739> you're<00:04:16.889> doing

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
kind of you can see what you're doing

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.879 
kind of you can see what you're doing
you<00:04:17.639> could<00:04:17.790> work<00:04:17.970> on<00:04:18.150> them<00:04:18.329> as<00:04:18.479> long<00:04:18.630> as<00:04:18.889> long

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
you could work on them as long as long

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.560 
you could work on them as long as long

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
as the battery lasted on them now might

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.060 
as the battery lasted on them now might
be<00:04:21.600> a<00:04:21.780> good<00:04:21.840> time<00:04:22.019> for<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.500> little<00:04:22.680> comparison

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
yard lights on ok so you don't want to

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.749 
yard lights on ok so you don't want to
put<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.539> ladder<00:04:28.720> away<00:04:28.960> just<00:04:29.380> yet<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.919> did<00:04:30.639> have

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
put the ladder away just yet I did have

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.969 
put the ladder away just yet I did have
to<00:04:30.820> go<00:04:31.000> back<00:04:31.150> up<00:04:31.419> and<00:04:31.660> readjust<00:04:32.289> the

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
to go back up and readjust the

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.340 
to go back up and readjust the
sensitivity<00:04:33.699> settings<00:04:34.120> I<00:04:34.330> could<00:04:35.050> get<00:04:35.169> it<00:04:35.259> to

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
sensitivity settings I could get it to

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.830 
sensitivity settings I could get it to
come<00:04:35.530> on<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:35.979> daylight<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.550> dusk<00:04:36.759> but<00:04:37.030> once

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
come on and daylight and dusk but once

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.270 
come on and daylight and dusk but once
it<00:04:37.990> got<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.169> fully<00:04:38.410> dark<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.889> couldn't<00:04:38.949> get

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
it got a fully dark I couldn't get

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.439 
it got a fully dark I couldn't get
anything<00:04:39.460> one<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.729> them<00:04:39.820> to<00:04:39.880> come<00:04:40.060> on<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.690> I

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
anything one of them to come on and I

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.010 
anything one of them to come on and I
still<00:04:43.449> am<00:04:43.810> having<00:04:44.139> a<00:04:44.199> fool<00:04:44.410> with<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:45.810> but<00:04:46.810> I

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
still am having a fool with it but I

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.350 
still am having a fool with it but I
don't<00:04:47.229> know<00:04:47.470> if<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.850> camera<00:04:48.850> really<00:04:49.150> is

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
don't know if the camera really is

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.420 
don't know if the camera really is
picking<00:04:49.660> up<00:04:49.810> how<00:04:50.590> much<00:04:50.740> light<00:04:51.009> is<00:04:51.039> really

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
picking up how much light is really

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.240 
picking up how much light is really
putting<00:04:51.669> off<00:04:51.880> I<00:04:52.120> don't<00:04:52.300> think<00:04:52.509> it<00:04:52.600> is<00:04:52.750> but<00:04:53.250> it's

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
putting off I don't think it is but it's

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.189 
putting off I don't think it is but it's
lighting<00:04:54.520> up<00:04:54.580> an<00:04:54.729> area<00:04:54.910> of<00:04:55.180> about<00:04:55.419> 1,500

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
lighting up an area of about 1,500

lighting up an area of about 1,500
square<00:04:56.289> foot<00:04:56.729> bright<00:04:57.729> enough<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.000> walk<00:04:58.300> and

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
square foot bright enough to walk and

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.950 
square foot bright enough to walk and
this<00:04:59.380> flashlight<00:04:59.680> i'm<00:05:00.039> using<00:05:00.430> is<00:05:01.419> a<00:05:01.509> little

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
this flashlight i'm using is a little

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.680 
this flashlight i'm using is a little
for<00:05:02.139> double-a<00:05:02.530> streamlight<00:05:03.300> it's<00:05:04.300> brighter

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
for double-a streamlight it's brighter

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.029 
for double-a streamlight it's brighter
but<00:05:04.990> it<00:05:05.080> doesn't<00:05:05.349> light<00:05:06.009> up<00:05:06.330> near<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.449> area<00:05:08.039> so

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
but it doesn't light up near the area so

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.320 
but it doesn't light up near the area so
for<00:05:09.930> further<00:05:10.930> money<00:05:11.669> not<00:05:12.669> bad<00:05:12.910> for<00:05:12.940> what
