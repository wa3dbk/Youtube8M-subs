just have to use a lot of a lot of

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.289 
just have to use a lot of a lot of
scrubbing<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:13.130> applied<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.430> at<00:02:14.700> least<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.120> the

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
scrubbing I applied it at least on the

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.199 
scrubbing I applied it at least on the
deck<00:02:15.570> with<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:17.150> sponge<00:02:18.150> applicator<00:02:18.870> and

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
deck with this sponge applicator and

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.220 
deck with this sponge applicator and
then<00:02:21.209> on<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.510> deck<00:02:21.720> itself<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.620> used<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.280> to

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
then on the deck itself I used this to

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.449 
then on the deck itself I used this to
scrub<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.600> really<00:02:27.900> didn't<00:02:28.230> do<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:29.370> know

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
scrub but it really didn't do you know

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.729 
scrub but it really didn't do you know
it<00:02:29.820> was<00:02:29.940> fine<00:02:30.269> for<00:02:30.870> getting<00:02:30.900> off<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.530> worst

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
it was fine for getting off the worst

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.949 
it was fine for getting off the worst
but<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:33.239> really<00:02:33.650> do<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> good<00:02:34.769> job<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.760> had<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.780> use

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
but to really do a good job I had to use

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.949 
but to really do a good job I had to use
this<00:02:37.970> which<00:02:38.970> has<00:02:39.180> some<00:02:39.390> pretty<00:02:39.630> tough

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
this which has some pretty tough

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.930 
this which has some pretty tough
bristles<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.709> get<00:02:40.890> down<00:02:41.100> there<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.609> get<00:02:41.820> to

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
bristles and get down there and get to

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.960 
bristles and get down there and get to
know<00:02:42.000> each<00:02:42.120> board<00:02:42.690> on<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.079> deck<00:02:46.700> then<00:02:47.700> on<00:02:47.850> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
know each board on the deck then on the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.710 
know each board on the deck then on the
railings<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.720> tended<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.799> use<00:02:49.829> this<00:02:50.630> for<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
railings I tended to use this for the

the next step step number two we'll both
lower<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.140> pH<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.830> depth<00:03:01.069> deck<00:03:01.550> and

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
lower the pH of the depth deck and

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.080 
lower the pH of the depth deck and

seven years at least is supposed to

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.350 
seven years at least is supposed to
protect<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.039> wood<00:04:28.190> from<00:04:28.340> mildew<00:04:28.789> for<00:04:28.970> seven

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
protect the wood from mildew for seven

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.290 
protect the wood from mildew for seven
years<00:04:29.630> after<00:04:30.020> about<00:04:30.710> five<00:04:31.100> years<00:04:31.130> some<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.090> the

years after about five years some of the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.940 
years after about five years some of the
color<00:04:32.570> will<00:04:32.840> be<00:04:32.870> lost<00:04:33.260> so<00:04:33.470> it's<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.680> good<00:04:33.800> idea

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
color will be lost so it's a good idea

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.850 
color will be lost so it's a good idea
to<00:04:34.190> rewrap<00:04:34.729> to<00:04:35.330> reapply<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:35.870> after<00:04:36.710> about

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
to rewrap to reapply it after about

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.510 
to rewrap to reapply it after about
every<00:04:37.340> five<00:04:37.580> years<00:04:38.710> but<00:04:39.710> everything<00:04:40.340> else

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
every five years but everything else

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.510 
every five years but everything else
I've<00:04:40.729> seen<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:42.110> just<00:04:42.289> doesn't<00:04:42.740> last<00:04:42.979> as<00:04:43.280> long

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
I've seen it just doesn't last as long

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.529 
I've seen it just doesn't last as long
as<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:45.620> one<00:04:45.860> time<00:04:46.190> from<00:04:46.580> at<00:04:47.180> least<00:04:47.389> from

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
as the the one time from at least from

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.570 
as the the one time from at least from
what<00:04:47.690> I've<00:04:47.720> been<00:04:47.900> able<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.139> research

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.700 

so<00:04:53.330> I'm<00:04:53.450> gonna<00:04:53.540> start<00:04:53.810> with<00:04:53.900> step<00:04:54.170> number<00:04:54.200> two

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
so I'm gonna start with step number two

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.260 
so I'm gonna start with step number two
today<00:04:55.960> over<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.140> out
