going<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.020> be<00:00:04.140> more<00:00:04.319> short<00:00:04.680> form<00:00:04.950> content

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490

seconds<00:00:08.490> long<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:09.000> think<00:00:09.690> things<00:00:10.170> like<00:00:10.440> movie

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040
