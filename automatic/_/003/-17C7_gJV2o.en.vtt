00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
when it comes to shooting this is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.999 
when it comes to shooting this is
probably<00:01:39.840> best<00:01:39.990> example<00:01:40.380> he<00:01:40.470> wasn't<00:01:40.770> making

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
probably best example he wasn't making

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.710 
probably best example he wasn't making
the<00:01:41.040> run<00:01:41.220> after<00:01:41.640> pretty<00:01:41.970> much<00:01:42.060> force<00:01:42.420> him<00:01:42.570> to

the run after pretty much force him to
make<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.869> ruin<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.380> he<00:01:43.710> didn't<00:01:43.920> even<00:01:43.979> finish

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
make that ruin and he didn't even finish

make that ruin and he didn't even finish
first<00:01:44.490> time<00:01:44.700> which<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:46.079> wanted<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.290> test

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
then eventually once I got going he

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.620 
then eventually once I got going he
started<00:01:53.759> playing<00:01:54.000> really<00:01:54.180> well<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:54.570> you
