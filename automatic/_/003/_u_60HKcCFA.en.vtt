00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
that's right we got innovation we've got

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.330 
that's right we got innovation we've got
someone<00:01:17.680> coming<00:01:17.800> alone

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
now since we had a passenger the area

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.050 
now since we had a passenger the area
doesn't<00:01:52.780> work

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
doesn't work

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.560

you now same elevator it's just been
innovated<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:18.069> controller<00:02:18.459> it's<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.700> same

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
innovated the controller it's the same

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.420 
innovated the controller it's the same
with<00:02:19.030> everything<00:02:19.300> yep<00:02:20.019> it's<00:02:20.739> still<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.980> Dover

with everything yep it's still a Dover
just<00:02:21.700> with<00:02:21.819> innovation<00:02:22.390> boom<00:02:22.599> it's<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.560> little

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
just with innovation boom it's a little

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.470 
just with innovation boom it's a little
slow<00:02:23.920> going<00:02:24.160> down<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.730> going<00:02:24.880> up<00:02:25.120> we'll<00:02:25.330> get

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
slow going down and going up we'll get

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.509 
slow going down and going up we'll get
we'll<00:02:25.840> get<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:25.989> full<00:02:26.319> round<00:02:26.590> trip<00:02:27.010> looking<00:02:27.370> out

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
we'll get a full round trip looking out

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:34.620 
we'll get a full round trip looking out
the<00:02:27.610> window<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.930> let<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.140> empty<00:02:29.440> baby<00:02:33.630> seems

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
the window and let it empty baby seems

the window and let it empty baby seems
like<00:02:34.810> they<00:02:34.959> made<00:02:35.110> this<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.319> glass<00:02:35.620> one<00:02:38.069> going

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
like they made this a glass one going

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.410 
like they made this a glass one going
full<00:02:39.280> force<00:02:39.430> now<00:02:39.610> let's<00:02:39.790> listen<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.239> motor

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
full force now let's listen the motor

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.759 
full force now let's listen the motor
going<00:02:40.660> on<00:02:40.870> back<00:02:43.049> get<00:02:44.049> a<00:02:44.080> view<00:02:44.200> at<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.500> window

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
going on back get a view at the window

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:56.570 
going on back get a view at the window
again

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.220 

it's<00:02:56.910> very<00:02:57.210> fast<00:02:57.570> going<00:02:57.900> up<00:02:58.050> very<00:03:00.020> fast<00:03:01.020> for

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
it's very fast going up very fast for
