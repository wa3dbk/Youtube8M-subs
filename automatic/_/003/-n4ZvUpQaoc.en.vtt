00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
when you go in the grind and then going

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.200 
when you go in the grind and then going
to<00:01:42.170> snap<00:01:42.469> to<00:01:42.740> grab<00:01:42.950> when<00:01:43.219> you<00:01:43.280> go<00:01:43.399> to<00:01:43.460> land<00:01:43.820> it

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
to snap to grab when you go to land it

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.989 
to snap to grab when you go to land it
makes<00:01:44.749> it<00:01:44.869> kind<00:01:45.170> of<00:01:45.229> tough<00:01:45.289> but<00:01:46.039> you'll<00:01:46.759> figure

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
makes it kind of tough but you'll figure

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:48.880 
makes it kind of tough but you'll figure
out<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.299> timing<00:01:47.569> as<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.109> go<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.679> more

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
out the timing as you go and the more

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.590 
out the timing as you go and the more
you<00:01:49.069> do<00:01:49.219> it<00:01:49.249> the<00:01:49.399> better<00:01:49.700> that<00:01:49.939> timing<00:01:50.210> gets<00:01:50.479> in

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
you do it the better that timing gets in

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.270 
you do it the better that timing gets in
the<00:01:50.659> easier<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.109> is<00:01:51.170> some<00:01:51.710> things<00:01:51.890> that<00:01:52.039> can<00:01:52.159> go

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
the easier it is some things that can go

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.190 
the easier it is some things that can go
wrong<00:01:52.359> obviously<00:01:53.359> you<00:01:53.450> go<00:01:53.569> into<00:01:53.719> the<00:01:53.810> five-o

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
wrong obviously you go into the five-o

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.599 
wrong obviously you go into the five-o
and<00:01:54.469> put<00:01:54.590> your<00:01:54.679> hand<00:01:54.859> down<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.069> everything

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
and put your hand down and everything

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.370 
and put your hand down and everything
shoots<00:01:55.880> out<00:01:56.030> board<00:01:56.359> chips<00:01:56.630> out<00:01:56.780> body<00:01:57.079> shoots

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
shoots out board chips out body shoots

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.610 
shoots out board chips out body shoots
out<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:58.009> then

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
out and then

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.710 
out and then
maybe<00:01:59.190> you'll<00:01:59.400> go<00:01:59.580> not<00:01:59.820> go<00:01:59.970> fully<00:02:00.210> into<00:02:00.300> five

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
maybe you'll go not go fully into five

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.480 
maybe you'll go not go fully into five
Orion<00:02:01.170> which<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.590> got<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.890> get<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.190> on<00:02:02.340> top

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
Orion which is you got to get up on top

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.270 
Orion which is you got to get up on top
you<00:02:03.210> can't<00:02:03.480> be<00:02:03.660> in<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.080> you've<00:02:04.980> got<00:02:05.160> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you can't be in here you've got to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.460 
you can't be in here you've got to
really<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.760> up<00:02:05.970> on<00:02:06.150> top<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.990> that's

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
really be up on top to get that that's

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.050 
really be up on top to get that that's
where<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.740> lay<00:02:07.950> back<00:02:08.250> part<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.790> grind

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
where the lay back part and the grind

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.050 
where the lay back part and the grind
comes<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.770> speed<00:02:10.770> if<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.460> if<00:02:11.820> you're<00:02:11.970> not

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
comes and speed if you if you're not

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.850 
comes and speed if you if you're not
going<00:02:12.330> fast<00:02:12.510> enough<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.990> might<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.320> harder<00:02:13.740> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
going fast enough it might be harder to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.710 
going fast enough it might be harder to
go<00:02:13.980> into<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.670> lot<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.090> speed<00:02:15.330> really

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
go into that so a lot of speed really

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.140 
go into that so a lot of speed really
helps<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.230> some<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.650> those<00:02:16.740> situations<00:02:16.980> okay<00:02:17.850> a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
helps in some of those situations okay a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.970 
helps in some of those situations okay a
lot<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:18.960> like<00:02:19.380> maybe<00:02:19.710> out<00:02:19.950> of

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
lot of you this is like maybe out of

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.070 
lot of you this is like maybe out of
your<00:02:20.250> technical<00:02:20.700> range<00:02:21.060> don't<00:02:21.600> want<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.930> look

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
your technical range don't want to look

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.480 
your technical range don't want to look
but<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.410> gives<00:02:22.590> an<00:02:22.740> opportunity<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.280> get

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
but this gives an opportunity to get

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.880 
but this gives an opportunity to get
look<00:02:23.550> really<00:02:23.970> stylish<00:02:24.180> but<00:02:24.870> also<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.230> when<00:02:25.830> you

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
look really stylish but also to when you

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.200 
look really stylish but also to when you
think<00:02:26.070> about<00:02:26.100> Dwayne<00:02:26.550> coming<00:02:26.880> up<00:02:27.000> with<00:02:27.120> this

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
think about Dwayne coming up with this

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.790 
think about Dwayne coming up with this
trick<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.630> get<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> chance<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.200> do<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.380> it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
trick and you get a chance to do it it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.310 
trick and you get a chance to do it it
just<00:02:28.860> feels<00:02:29.070> like<00:02:29.460> you're<00:02:29.640> back<00:02:29.850> in<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.320> 70s

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
just feels like you're back in the 70s

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.170 
just feels like you're back in the 70s
or<00:02:31.440> 80s<00:02:31.500> dog<00:02:32.100> bolt<00:02:32.400> days<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.880> you're<00:02:32.970> being

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
or 80s dog bolt days and you're being

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.000 
or 80s dog bolt days and you're being
master<00:02:33.510> disaster<00:02:33.840> yourself<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.590> who

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
master disaster yourself and who

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.800 
master disaster yourself and who
wouldn't<00:02:35.280> want<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.490> be<00:02:35.580> master<00:02:35.790> disaster<00:02:36.390> for

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
wouldn't want to be master disaster for

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.700 
wouldn't want to be master disaster for
a<00:02:36.840> hot<00:02:37.050> minute<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.590> know<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.430> would<00:02:39.710> key

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
a hot minute I know I would key

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:48.890 
a hot minute I know I would key
playbacks<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.460> lot
