00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
else are the rear hold it that up put a

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.670 
else are the rear hold it that up put a
bit<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.250> rubber<00:02:15.670> stripping<00:02:16.030> around<00:02:16.240> there

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
bit of rubber stripping around there

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.590 
bit of rubber stripping around there
which<00:02:17.680> looks<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.330> lot<00:02:19.330> better<00:02:19.510> than<00:02:19.660> what<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.050> it

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
which looks a lot better than what is it

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.410 
which looks a lot better than what is it
without<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.870> because<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:24.000> looked<00:02:25.000> like<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.180> big

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
without it because it looked like a big

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.840 
without it because it looked like a big
gap<00:02:25.690> there<00:02:25.990> so<00:02:26.260> they<00:02:26.920> fill<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.250> in<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.550> it

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
gap there so they fill it in and it

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.270 
gap there so they fill it in and it
looks<00:02:28.030> looks<00:02:28.570> nice
