will depend on the size of the tree and
once<00:00:51.899> you're<00:00:52.020> done<00:00:52.140> it'll<00:00:52.350> fall<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.680> the

if you're smart about your choice of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.529 
if you're smart about your choice of
tree<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.699> cut<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> down<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.480> you

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
tree and how you cut it down then you

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.880 
tree and how you cut it down then you
should<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:57.840> fall<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.260> come<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> complete

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
should just fall and come to a complete

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.069 
should just fall and come to a complete
stop<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.910> if<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.270> near<00:01:00.420> hill<00:01:00.660> or<00:01:00.840> river

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
stop but if you do it near hill or river

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.720 
stop but if you do it near hill or river
then<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.289> might<00:01:01.469> roll<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:01.890> float<00:01:02.100> away<00:01:02.280> which

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
then you might roll or float away which

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.789 
then you might roll or float away which
makes<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> next<00:01:03.329> part<00:01:03.510> much<00:01:03.690> harder<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
makes the next part much harder to

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.320 
makes the next part much harder to
receive<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> actual<00:01:05.430> resources<00:01:06.030> from<00:01:06.210> the

tree you need to debranching this is the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.560 
tree you need to debranching this is the
final<00:01:08.549> step<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.030> requires<00:01:09.390> more

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
final step and just requires more

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.450 
final step and just requires more
chopping<00:01:09.869> when<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> ground<00:01:10.619> then

chopping when it's on the ground then
depending<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.970> size<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> tree<00:01:12.659> you'll

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
depending on the size of the tree you'll

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.690 
depending on the size of the tree you'll
receive<00:01:13.140> several<00:01:13.500> different<00:01:13.799> resources<00:01:14.250> from

drill<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.060> into<00:02:41.210> you<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.720> mod<00:02:41.870> makes

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
drill it into you that the mod makes

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.320 
drill it into you that the mod makes
almost<00:02:42.350> every<00:02:42.710> object<00:02:42.740> craftable<00:02:43.400> think<00:02:44.210> of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
almost every object craftable think of

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.580 
almost every object craftable think of
anything<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:44.780> looks<00:02:44.930> placed<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.410> world

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
anything that looks placed in the world

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.960 
anything that looks placed in the world
and<00:02:45.830> you<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:46.040> pretty<00:02:46.190> much<00:02:46.280> guarantee<00:02:46.580> that

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
and you can pretty much guarantee that

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.310 
and you can pretty much guarantee that
you<00:02:47.060> can<00:02:47.180> make<00:02:47.300> from<00:02:47.480> scratch<00:02:47.630> which<00:02:48.200> is

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
you can make from scratch which is

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.320 
you can make from scratch which is
pretty<00:02:48.500> cool<00:02:48.740> in<00:02:48.860> my<00:02:48.890> opinion<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:50.060> mud<00:02:50.209> is

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
pretty cool in my opinion the mud is

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.910 
pretty cool in my opinion the mud is
still<00:02:50.480> technically<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.050> beat<00:02:51.320> app<00:02:51.530> although

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
still technically in beat app although

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.370 
still technically in beat app although
we<00:02:52.040> didn't<00:02:52.280> stumble<00:02:52.459> upon<00:02:52.640> any<00:02:52.940> real<00:02:53.150> issues

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
we didn't stumble upon any real issues

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.660 
we didn't stumble upon any real issues
we'd<00:02:54.380> only<00:02:54.530> like<00:02:54.740> to<00:02:54.860> see<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.100> mud<00:02:55.250> cleaned<00:02:55.520> up

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
we'd only like to see the mud cleaned up

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.370 
we'd only like to see the mud cleaned up
a<00:02:55.760> bit<00:02:55.790> because<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.540> scrounge<00:02:56.959> crafting

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
a bit because of scrounge crafting

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.780 
a bit because of scrounge crafting
system<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:57.860> how<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.010> mud<00:02:58.250> works<00:02:58.520> the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
system and how the mud works the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.949 
system and how the mud works the
craftable<00:02:59.090> items<00:02:59.270> come<00:02:59.630> with<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.780> lot<00:02:59.930> of

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
craftable items come with a lot of

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.350 
craftable items come with a lot of
duplicates<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.709> menus<00:03:01.070> for<00:03:01.360> example

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
duplicates in the menus for example

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.880 
duplicates in the menus for example
because<00:03:02.660> every<00:03:02.990> tree<00:03:03.230> produces<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.709> different

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
because every tree produces a different

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.380 
because every tree produces a different
type<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:04.220> wood<00:03:04.550> you<00:03:04.760> have<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.090> several

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
type of wood you have to have several

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.150 
type of wood you have to have several
options<00:03:05.600> for<00:03:05.840> certain<00:03:06.200> wooden<00:03:06.470> objects<00:03:06.860> even

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
options for certain wooden objects even

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.410 
options for certain wooden objects even
though<00:03:07.370> they<00:03:07.490> all<00:03:07.580> produce<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.000> exact<00:03:08.240> same

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
though they all produce the exact same

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.420 
though they all produce the exact same
item<00:03:08.630> we'd<00:03:09.470> also<00:03:09.620> like<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.980> new<00:03:10.070> crafter

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
item we'd also like the new crafter

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.800 
item we'd also like the new crafter
walls<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.700> be<00:03:10.790> locked<00:03:10.970> into<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.330> new<00:03:11.450> crafting

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
walls to be locked into the new crafting

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.480 
walls to be locked into the new crafting
stations<00:03:12.200> only<00:03:12.560> it's<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:12.920> little<00:03:13.160> jarring<00:03:13.340> to

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
stations only it's a little jarring to

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.710 
stations only it's a little jarring to
see<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.850> new<00:03:13.970> items<00:03:14.270> and<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.540> vanilla

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
see the new items and the vanilla

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.120 
see the new items and the vanilla
sections<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.470> we<00:03:15.590> think<00:03:15.800> it'd<00:03:15.860> be<00:03:15.980> much

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
sections and we think it'd be much

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.710 
sections and we think it'd be much
easier<00:03:16.520> and<00:03:16.610> compact<00:03:16.940> if<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.240> was<00:03:17.330> all<00:03:17.480> on<00:03:17.600> his

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
easier and compact if it was all on his

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.080 
easier and compact if it was all on his
own<00:03:17.840> separate<00:03:18.230> package<00:03:18.560> but<00:03:19.459> overall<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.940> mud

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
own separate package but overall the mud

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.520 
own separate package but overall the mud
is<00:03:20.209> very<00:03:20.269> interesting<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.019> combined<00:03:21.320> with<00:03:21.500> a
