00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.630

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.270
 which was a bit arranged with gods 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.439
 cubes but we would then like to take 1b 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:56.460

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.500
 you move like that when you maybe put on it 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.090
 something hot on top a perfume comes out 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.020
 of lavender because there are all the flowers 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:24.010

 Another another ra bearings in the various 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.950
 in short, maybe they are a little piece of furniture 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.820
 arranged I would like to change it 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.010
 this is a port to the newspaper full of 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.340

 father in law who collects all these 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.600
 what this frame concerned was 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.670
 very little committed this little heart 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.390
 of gesture that is those things to perfume 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.940
 the closets since I don't have the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.060
 chandelier these two clicks of wood 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.760
 with the little hearts fiorellini the neo 21 here 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.440
 one across the room 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.370
 in reality, however, I never light them 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.300
 I prefer to light the lantern then 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.030
 this is a little wooden bookcase 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:24.630
 let's say nuanced white a little kind 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.630
 ruined with very simple white 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.570
 and this I have this lantern 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.580
 in the other front row house he had in 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.830
 bedroom 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.270
 I usually turn this on 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.150
 then I would like to show the sofa is 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.790
 it was a business to find a sofa that 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.130
 let's say the features 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.460
 that could be adapted to this 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.080
 shelby environment but still the titans 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.100
 they were too much of the maison du monde 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.530

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.620
 found after a long time at the market 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.590
 with colors that are perfectly suited 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.730
 I would like to show that I also have a 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.730
 lavender pillow 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.100
