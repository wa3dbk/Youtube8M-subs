no trim system on the shifter meaning

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:33.689 
no trim system on the shifter meaning
that<00:00:32.050> you<00:00:32.200> can't<00:00:32.410> make<00:00:32.619> fine<00:00:32.980> adjustments<00:00:33.160> to

that you can't make fine adjustments to

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.490 
that you can't make fine adjustments to
the<00:00:33.820> front<00:00:34.059> derailleur<00:00:34.239> to<00:00:34.719> add<00:00:34.870> extra<00:00:35.170> chain

the front derailleur to add extra chain
clearance<00:00:36.010> when<00:00:36.190> you're<00:00:36.309> at<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.489> extremes<00:00:36.940> of

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149

clearance when you're at the extremes of
the<00:00:37.210> gear<00:00:37.510> range<00:00:37.750> so<00:00:38.350> one<00:00:38.770> of<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:38.949> things<00:00:39.100> that

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
the gear range so one of the things that

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.069 
the gear range so one of the things that
that<00:00:39.609> we<00:00:40.210> have<00:00:40.359> to<00:00:40.480> do<00:00:40.570> that<00:00:40.719> was<00:00:40.809> a<00:00:40.840> big

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
that we have to do that was a big

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.569 
that we have to do that was a big
challenge<00:00:41.289> with<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.680> new<00:00:41.829> chain<00:00:42.070> ring<00:00:42.250> set<00:00:42.430> is

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
challenge with the new chain ring set is

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.000 
challenge with the new chain ring set is
essentially<00:00:43.090> move<00:00:43.359> them<00:00:43.539> apart<00:00:43.719> wider<00:00:44.289> so<00:00:44.949> you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
essentially move them apart wider so you

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.920 
essentially move them apart wider so you
have<00:00:45.219> more<00:00:45.460> rain<00:00:45.789> for<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.269> chain<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.719> move

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
have more rain for the chain to move

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.650 
have more rain for the chain to move
back<00:00:47.500> and<00:00:47.530> forth<00:00:47.980> between<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.670> small<00:00:49.420> chain

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
back and forth between the small chain

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.970 
back and forth between the small chain
ring<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:50.019> the<00:00:50.199> smallest<00:00:50.559> cog<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:50.890> the

largest<00:00:51.370> cog<00:00:51.489> without<00:00:51.789> rubbing<00:00:52.090> on<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:52.449> chain

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
largest cog without rubbing on the chain

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.209

ring or chain ring rubbing on the
derailleur<00:00:54.699> so<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.420> is<00:00:55.539> a<00:00:55.570> first<00:00:56.230> step<00:00:56.500> we're

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
derailleur so that is a first step we're

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.889 
derailleur so that is a first step we're
changing<00:00:57.129> all<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.370> spacing<00:00:57.879> it<00:00:58.000> adjusts<00:00:58.780> all

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
changing all the spacing it adjusts all

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.360 
changing all the spacing it adjusts all
the<00:00:59.050> timing<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.530> everything<00:00:59.920> between<00:01:00.070> the

the timing and everything between the

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.209 
the timing and everything between the
Rings<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.960> also<00:01:02.079> wanted<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.469> take<00:01:02.679> a<00:01:02.739> big<00:01:03.010> step

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
Rings we also wanted to take a big step

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.480 
Rings we also wanted to take a big step
up<00:01:03.489> in<00:01:03.760> shifting<00:01:04.480> quality<00:01:04.989> which<00:01:05.490> essentially

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
up in shifting quality which essentially

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.850 
up in shifting quality which essentially
means<00:01:06.670> redesigning<00:01:07.270> everything<00:01:07.510> from<00:01:08.200> from<00:01:08.830> a

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
means redesigning everything from from a

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.950 
means redesigning everything from from a
blank<00:01:09.160> piece<00:01:09.430> of<00:01:09.460> paper<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:10.630> wanted<00:01:10.900> to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
blank piece of paper we wanted to

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.540 
blank piece of paper we wanted to
increase<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.290> stiffness<00:01:11.650> of<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.160> chain<00:01:12.370> ring

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
increase the stiffness of the chain ring

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.960 
increase the stiffness of the chain ring
stiffness<00:01:13.180> is<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.300> big<00:01:13.570> component<00:01:13.960> in<00:01:14.970> front

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
stiffness is a big component in front

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.490 
stiffness is a big component in front
shifting<00:01:16.450> when<00:01:16.660> you're<00:01:16.780> up<00:01:16.900> shifting<00:01:17.380> from

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
shifting when you're up shifting from

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.080 
shifting when you're up shifting from
the<00:01:17.620> smaller<00:01:17.980> ring<00:01:18.160> to<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.370> big<00:01:18.580> ring<00:01:18.790> you

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
the smaller ring to the big ring you

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.730 
the smaller ring to the big ring you
have<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.270> really<00:01:19.480> flexing<00:01:19.870> ring<00:01:20.290> the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
have a really flexing ring the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.230 
have a really flexing ring the

the<00:01:22.360> ring<00:01:22.510> just<00:01:22.690> flexes<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.380> doesn't<00:01:23.710> go<00:01:23.830> up<00:01:24.010> so

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
the ring just flexes it doesn't go up so

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.430 
the ring just flexes it doesn't go up so
you'll<00:01:25.060> notice<00:01:25.390> on<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:25.600> new<00:01:25.720> red<00:01:25.930> chain<00:01:26.200> rings

here that to show you the Audrey allure

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.970 
here that to show you the Audrey allure
has<00:01:43.270> an<00:01:43.390> incredible<00:01:43.960> up<00:01:44.200> shifting<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:44.830> down

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
has an incredible up shifting and down

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.460 
has an incredible up shifting and down
shifting<00:01:45.490> for<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.150> it's<00:01:46.480> a<00:01:46.600> much<00:01:46.780> superior<00:01:46.990> to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
shifting for so it's a much superior to

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.310 
shifting for so it's a much superior to
our<00:01:47.770> previous<00:01:48.670> designs<00:01:49.060> what<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:49.600> means<00:01:49.960> is

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
our previous designs what that means is

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.540 
our previous designs what that means is
where<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:52.680> great<00:01:53.680> amount<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:54.040> effort<00:01:54.190> would

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
where a great amount of effort would

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.100 
where a great amount of effort would
would<00:01:54.970> have<00:01:55.030> been<00:01:55.210> required<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.720> make<00:01:55.960> the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
would have been required to make the

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.710 
would have been required to make the
chain<00:01:56.350> ring<00:01:56.530> shift<00:01:56.860> on<00:01:57.100> numerous<00:01:57.790> teeth<00:01:58.240> for

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
chain ring shift on numerous teeth for

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.240 
chain ring shift on numerous teeth for
the<00:01:58.780> new<00:01:58.930> yarder<00:01:59.290> rail<00:01:59.410> it's<00:01:59.710> basically<00:02:00.070> gonna

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
the new yarder rail it's basically gonna

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.090 
the new yarder rail it's basically gonna
shift<00:02:00.610> almost<00:02:01.240> instantly<00:02:01.750> in<00:02:01.960> in<00:02:02.590> almost<00:02:02.860> any

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
shift almost instantly in in almost any

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.890 
shift almost instantly in in almost any
position<00:02:03.610> on<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.820> chain<00:02:03.850> ring<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:04.690> what

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
position on the chain ring so what

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.050 
position on the chain ring so what
you'll<00:02:05.080> what<00:02:05.620> you'll<00:02:05.770> get<00:02:06.160> is<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.880> need<00:02:07.030> to

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
you'll what you'll get is you need to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.359 
you'll what you'll get is you need to
add<00:02:07.270> more<00:02:07.600> up<00:02:08.050> shift<00:02:08.289> opportunities<00:02:09.069> to<00:02:09.250> the

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
add more up shift opportunities to the

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.260 
add more up shift opportunities to the
chain<00:02:09.579> ring<00:02:09.759> design

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
chain ring design

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.420 
chain ring design
and<00:02:10.360> basically<00:02:11.170> as<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.680> can<00:02:11.800> see<00:02:11.950> on<00:02:12.100> that<00:02:12.130> on

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
and basically as you can see on that on

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.970 
and basically as you can see on that on
a<00:02:12.630> 50<00:02:13.630> tooth<00:02:13.840> outer<00:02:14.170> chain<00:02:14.560> ring<00:02:14.710> which<00:02:14.830> I'll

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
a 50 tooth outer chain ring which I'll

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.620 
a 50 tooth outer chain ring which I'll
show<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.220> on<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.550> 3d<00:02:15.790> model<00:02:16.180> shortly<00:02:16.480> is

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
show you on the 3d model shortly is

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.540 
show you on the 3d model shortly is
every<00:02:17.200> single<00:02:17.380> tooth<00:02:17.680> on<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.980> entire<00:02:18.280> chain

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
every single tooth on the entire chain

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.150 
every single tooth on the entire chain
ring<00:02:18.820> is<00:02:18.970> enabled<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.690> downshift<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.710> it's<00:02:20.920> not

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
ring is enabled to downshift so it's not

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.040 
ring is enabled to downshift so it's not
a<00:02:21.220> case<00:02:21.490> where<00:02:21.550> these<00:02:22.360> ones<00:02:22.570> are<00:02:22.660> gonna<00:02:22.750> shift

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
a case where these ones are gonna shift

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.030 
a case where these ones are gonna shift
these<00:02:23.320> ones<00:02:23.560> are<00:02:23.710> not

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
these ones are not

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.190 
these ones are not
it's<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.550> derailleur<00:02:25.060> works<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:25.600> well<00:02:25.870> that

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
it's that derailleur works so well that

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.320 
it's that derailleur works so well that
it<00:02:26.380> will<00:02:26.620> actuate<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.400> shift<00:02:27.700> in<00:02:27.910> any<00:02:28.060> position

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
it will actuate a shift in any position

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.600 
it will actuate a shift in any position
so<00:02:28.810> we<00:02:28.930> have<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.200> compensate<00:02:29.590> for<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:30.010> in<00:02:30.490> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
so we have to compensate for that in the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.520 
so we have to compensate for that in the
chain<00:02:30.850> ring<00:02:31.060> design<00:02:31.360> by<00:02:31.570> adding<00:02:31.810> features<00:02:32.080> and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
chain ring design by adding features and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.370 
chain ring design by adding features and
geometry<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.520> allow<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.760> chain<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.380> deflect

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
geometry to allow the chain to deflect

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.950 
geometry to allow the chain to deflect
smoothly<00:02:35.820> off<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.090> chain<00:02:37.270> ring<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.660> down<00:02:37.810> to

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
smoothly off the chain ring and down to

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.740 
smoothly off the chain ring and down to
the<00:02:38.050> mating<00:02:38.380> chain<00:02:38.620> er<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.520> more<00:02:40.300> up<00:02:40.480> shift

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
the mating chain er so more up shift

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.460 
the mating chain er so more up shift
more<00:02:41.410> up<00:02:41.590> shift<00:02:41.860> locations<00:02:42.460> as<00:02:42.670> well

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
more up shift locations as well

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.340 
more up shift locations as well
and<00:02:44.470> Jason<00:02:45.040> draping<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.490> chain<00:02:45.700> ring<00:02:45.910> on<00:02:46.350> we've

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
and Jason draping a chain ring on we've

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.140 
and Jason draping a chain ring on we've
got<00:02:47.560> actually<00:02:47.920> six<00:02:48.250> rivets<00:02:48.700> around<00:02:49.060> the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
got actually six rivets around the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.580 
got actually six rivets around the
periphery<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.750> chain<00:02:50.020> ring<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:50.410> there's

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
periphery of the chain ring so there's

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.100 
periphery of the chain ring so there's
six<00:02:50.770> opportunities<00:02:51.640> for<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:51.940> nice<00:02:52.540> smooth<00:02:52.870> up

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
six opportunities for a nice smooth up

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.290 
six opportunities for a nice smooth up
shift<00:02:53.380> we<00:02:53.800> try<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.040> space<00:02:54.340> them<00:02:54.580> apart<00:02:54.700> fairly

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
shift we try to space them apart fairly

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.780 
shift we try to space them apart fairly
widely<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:56.140> if<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.500> happen<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:57.460> happen<00:02:57.730> to

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
widely so if you happen to you happen to

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.280 
widely so if you happen to you happen to
miss<00:02:58.000> one<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.450> have<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.630> couple<00:02:59.140> more

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
miss one you have a couple more

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.200 
miss one you have a couple more
opportunities<00:03:00.040> for<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.340> chain<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.730> shift<00:03:00.970> up

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
opportunities for the chain to shift up

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.110 
opportunities for the chain to shift up
onto<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.080> onto<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.620> big<00:03:02.800> ring<00:03:03.040> every<00:03:03.880> rider

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
onto the onto the big ring every rider

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.470 
onto the onto the big ring every rider
is<00:03:04.270> different<00:03:04.690> they'll<00:03:04.870> tend<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.260> get<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:06.480> tend

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
is different they'll tend to get a tend

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.210 
is different they'll tend to get a tend
to<00:03:07.600> actuate<00:03:08.020> a<00:03:08.140> shift<00:03:08.410> somewhere<00:03:08.950> in<00:03:09.070> their

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
to actuate a shift somewhere in their

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.500 
to actuate a shift somewhere in their
pedal<00:03:09.520> stroke<00:03:09.760> somewhere<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.210> their<00:03:10.300> power

pedal stroke somewhere in their power

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.350 
pedal stroke somewhere in their power
stroke<00:03:10.810> differently<00:03:11.320> so<00:03:11.830> one<00:03:12.610> rider<00:03:12.880> may<00:03:13.120> tend

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
stroke differently so one rider may tend

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.060 
stroke differently so one rider may tend
to<00:03:13.420> always<00:03:13.540> shift<00:03:13.870> in<00:03:13.990> that<00:03:14.140> position<00:03:14.410> but<00:03:14.950> if

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
to always shift in that position but if

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.770 
to always shift in that position but if
you<00:03:15.190> only<00:03:15.340> had<00:03:15.550> a<00:03:15.580> rivet<00:03:15.970> there<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.540> next

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
you only had a rivet there and the next

you only had a rivet there and the next
rider<00:03:16.990> tends<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.500> shift<00:03:17.560> when<00:03:17.980> they're<00:03:18.160> down

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
rider tends to shift when they're down

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.640 
rider tends to shift when they're down
lower<00:03:19.090> in<00:03:19.300> their<00:03:19.450> pedal<00:03:19.720> stroke<00:03:19.990> they'll<00:03:20.440> miss

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
lower in their pedal stroke they'll miss

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.880 
lower in their pedal stroke they'll miss
that<00:03:20.860> one<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.250> have<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.550> come<00:03:21.700> around<00:03:21.790> again

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
that one and have to come around again

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.870 
that one and have to come around again
one<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.070> other<00:03:24.100> things<00:03:24.430> again<00:03:24.760> with<00:03:25.170> I

call it a powerful front derailleur is

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
chain the shift in places maybe that are

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.380 
chain the shift in places maybe that are
not<00:03:35.230> optimized<00:03:36.190> are<00:03:36.459> intended<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.060> we<00:03:37.150> have<00:03:37.270> to

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
not optimized are intended so we have to

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.820 
not optimized are intended so we have to
compensate<00:03:37.720> for<00:03:38.050> those<00:03:38.170> as<00:03:38.410> well

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
compensate for those as well

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.449 
compensate for those as well
so<00:03:39.010> in<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.880> in<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.540> non<00:03:40.920> rivet<00:03:41.920> positions

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
so in the in the non rivet positions

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.970 
so in the in the non rivet positions
there's<00:03:42.940> numerous<00:03:43.209> geometry<00:03:44.080> created<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.830> let

the change shift up in all kinds of
additional<00:03:47.530> spots<00:03:48.130> so<00:03:48.490> similar<00:03:49.270> to<00:03:49.300> what<00:03:49.480> I've

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
additional spots so similar to what I've

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.030 
additional spots so similar to what I've
explained<00:03:50.110> with<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.290> downshift

there's actually jian chi created in the
chain<00:03:53.290> ring<00:03:53.440> so<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.680> can<00:03:53.800> shift<00:03:53.950> up<00:03:54.160> anywhere

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
chain ring so it can shift up anywhere

more simple you have a you have the

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.840 
more simple you have a you have the
outside<00:04:29.710> that's<00:04:29.949> the<00:04:30.130> industrial<00:04:30.669> design

outside that's the industrial design

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.300 
outside that's the industrial design
look<00:04:31.300> so<00:04:31.540> that's<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.710> features<00:04:33.100> that<00:04:33.130> are

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
industrial design group have come up

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.420 
industrial design group have come up
with<00:04:35.229> to<00:04:35.410> give<00:04:35.560> it<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:36.040> know<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.310> good

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
with to give it the you know the good

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.189 
with to give it the you know the good
looks<00:04:36.699> and<00:04:36.880> then<00:04:37.330> basically<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.900> the

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
looks and then basically the the

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.659 
looks and then basically the the
features<00:04:38.380> on<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.770> chain<00:04:39.010> ring<00:04:39.160> teeth<00:04:39.430> are<00:04:39.639> the

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
features on the chain ring teeth are the

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.050 
features on the chain ring teeth are the
ones<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.180> are<00:04:40.389> designed<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:41.440> let<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.220> chain

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
ones that are designed to let the chain

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.430 
ones that are designed to let the chain
get<00:04:43.270> up<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:43.540> down<00:04:43.660> smoothly

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
get up and down smoothly

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.950 
get up and down smoothly
okay<00:04:44.800> so<00:04:44.860> chain<00:04:45.190> is<00:04:45.610> starting<00:04:46.000> something<00:04:46.300> you

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
okay so chain is starting something you

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.170 
okay so chain is starting something you
know<00:04:47.050> pretty<00:04:47.320> simple<00:04:47.800> a<00:04:47.949> disc<00:04:48.430> of<00:04:48.580> aluminum<00:04:48.699> in

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
at look at them closely they've actually

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.310 
at look at them closely they've actually
got<00:05:39.729> a<00:05:39.760> lot<00:05:40.000> of<00:05:40.150> different<00:05:40.570> sized<00:05:40.840> and<00:05:41.260> shaped

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.909 
got a lot of different sized and shaped
teeth<00:05:42.250> so<00:05:42.639> as<00:05:42.820> I<00:05:43.200> like<00:05:44.200> started<00:05:44.500> zooming<00:05:44.620> in

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
teeth so as I like started zooming in

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.020 
teeth so as I like started zooming in
there<00:05:45.099> you<00:05:45.220> can<00:05:45.370> see<00:05:45.520> there's<00:05:45.700> different

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
there you can see there's different

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.610 
there you can see there's different
sizes<00:05:46.510> and<00:05:46.599> different<00:05:46.660> shapes<00:05:47.139> and<00:05:47.410> they'll

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
sizes and different shapes and they'll

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.589 
sizes and different shapes and they'll
be<00:05:47.770> an<00:05:47.919> upshift<00:05:48.280> or<00:05:48.520> down<00:05:48.669> to<00:05:48.940> spot<00:05:49.240> sometimes

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
be an upshift or down to spot sometimes

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.270 
be an upshift or down to spot sometimes
you<00:05:49.900> need<00:05:50.020> higher<00:05:50.229> ones<00:05:50.530> sometimes<00:05:50.830> you<00:05:51.160> need

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
you need higher ones sometimes you need

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.860 
you need higher ones sometimes you need
lower<00:05:51.490> ones<00:05:51.789> depending<00:05:52.300> on<00:05:52.419> if<00:05:52.539> you<00:05:52.660> want<00:05:52.810> to

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
lower ones depending on if you want to

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.260 
lower ones depending on if you want to
let<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.050> chain<00:05:53.289> get<00:05:53.500> up<00:05:53.680> chain<00:05:54.280> go<00:05:54.460> down<00:05:54.699> got

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
let the chain get up chain go down got

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.170 
let the chain get up chain go down got
it<00:05:55.449> smoothly<00:05:55.780> so<00:05:56.289> you'll<00:05:56.919> have<00:05:57.190> a<00:05:57.639> wide<00:05:58.000> array

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
it smoothly so you'll have a wide array

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.570 
it smoothly so you'll have a wide array
of<00:05:58.330> different<00:05:58.510> actual<00:05:59.139> to<00:05:59.440> shapes<00:05:59.800> sizes<00:06:00.220> and
