just so that because of time like has a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.320 
just so that because of time like has a
little<00:03:08.980> bit<00:03:09.070> of<00:03:09.130> time<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.430> dry<00:03:09.610> on<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:10.209> your

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
little bit of time to dry on to your

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.540 
little bit of time to dry on to your
nails<00:03:10.570> so<00:03:11.260> when<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.530> swipe<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.340> brush

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
nails so when you swipe the brush

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.480 
nails so when you swipe the brush
through<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.720> doesn't<00:03:13.930> like<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.410> race<00:03:14.770> all<00:03:15.070> of

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
through it it doesn't like a race all of

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.699 
through it it doesn't like a race all of
the<00:03:15.670> ink<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:18.280> took<00:03:18.910> me<00:03:18.970> about<00:03:19.530> maybe<00:03:20.530> like<00:03:20.680> a

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
the ink so it took me about maybe like a

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.740 
the ink so it took me about maybe like a
half<00:03:20.980> hour<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.430> finish<00:03:21.610> it<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:24.570> I'd<00:03:25.570> say

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
half hour to finish it and I'd say

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.970 
half hour to finish it and I'd say
that's<00:03:25.870> pretty<00:03:25.989> cool<00:03:26.290> for<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.620> for<00:03:26.950> the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
that's pretty cool for the for the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.130 
that's pretty cool for the for the
effect<00:03:27.430> that<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.239> creates<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.780> think<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.019> half

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
effect that it creates I think a half

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.509 
effect that it creates I think a half
hours<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.470> good<00:03:29.620> amount<00:03:29.800> of<00:03:29.890> time<00:03:30.010> so<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.250> would

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
hours a good amount of time so I would

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.840 
hours a good amount of time so I would
recommend<00:03:30.550> it<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:32.430> yay<00:03:33.430> okay<00:03:34.239> bye
