00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
actually pick these things up because

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.840 
actually pick these things up because
I'm<00:02:30.380> just<00:02:30.440> awful<00:02:31.010> at<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.130> in<00:02:31.340> this<00:02:31.459> game<00:02:31.640> for

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
I'm just awful at it in this game for

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.090 
I'm just awful at it in this game for
some<00:02:31.970> reason<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:33.140> static<00:02:33.560> run<00:02:33.799> is<00:02:34.040> a

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
some reason this static run is a

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.810 
some reason this static run is a
presence<00:02:34.910> plus<00:02:35.209> three<00:02:35.660> data<00:02:36.110> cron<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:37.370> now<00:02:37.760> you

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
presence plus three data cron so now you

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.210 
presence plus three data cron so now you
can<00:02:38.090> start<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.660> slowly<00:02:39.260> jump<00:02:39.709> your<00:02:39.860> way<00:02:39.890> up

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
can start to slowly jump your way up

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.440 
can start to slowly jump your way up
these<00:02:40.400> boxes<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:42.850> after<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:43.940> get<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.239> top

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
these boxes and after you get to the top

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.940 
these boxes and after you get to the top
these<00:02:44.630> boxes<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.080> have<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.320> make<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.470> tricky

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
these boxes you have to make a tricky

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.420 
these boxes you have to make a tricky
jump<00:02:46.280> onto<00:02:47.230> these<00:02:48.230> small<00:02:48.739> support<00:02:49.220> beams<00:02:49.430> and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
jump onto these small support beams and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.229 
jump onto these small support beams and
fortunately<00:02:52.430> unlike<00:02:52.880> some<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.120> other

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
fortunately unlike some of the other

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.670 
fortunately unlike some of the other
platforming<00:02:53.660> areas<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.049> don't<00:02:54.140> fall<00:02:54.440> too<00:02:54.650> far

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
platforming areas you don't fall too far

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.780 
platforming areas you don't fall too far
when<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.190> screw<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:55.549> jump<00:02:55.850> up

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
when you screw this jump up

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.670 
when you screw this jump up
so<00:02:58.629> what<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.780> like<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.019> do<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.200> kind<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.409> line

these two these next two data crowns in

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.270 
these two these next two data crowns in
this<00:04:16.389> order<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.349> this<00:04:17.530> is<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.769> fourth<00:04:18.039> data

there's<00:04:49.900> a<00:04:49.990> very<00:04:50.320> distinct<00:04:50.680> fork<00:04:50.979> in<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.220> road

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
there's a very distinct fork in the road

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.180 
there's a very distinct fork in the road
remember<00:04:52.599> this<00:04:52.870> point<00:04:53.080> because<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.919> left

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
remember this point because the left

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.680 
remember this point because the left
fork<00:04:54.520> is<00:04:54.729> where<00:04:54.880> you're<00:04:55.000> gonna<00:04:55.060> get<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.330> final

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
fork is where you're gonna get the final

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.180 
fork is where you're gonna get the final
data<00:04:55.840> kron4<00:04:56.710> Nar<00:04:56.860> Shaddaa

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
data kron4 Nar Shaddaa

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.370 
data kron4 Nar Shaddaa
but<00:04:57.940> for<00:04:58.270> now<00:04:58.419> we're<00:04:58.599> gonna<00:04:58.659> be<00:04:58.810> going<00:04:59.050> off<00:04:59.229> to

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
but for now we're gonna be going off to

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.140 
but for now we're gonna be going off to
the<00:04:59.500> right

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
the right

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.030 
the right
so<00:05:02.150> take<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:02.900> right<00:05:03.050> fork<00:05:03.290> in<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.560> road<00:05:03.680> like

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
so take the right fork in the road like

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.360 
so take the right fork in the road like
I<00:05:04.160> just<00:05:04.220> said<00:05:04.550> and<00:05:05.620> I'm<00:05:06.620> gonna<00:05:06.800> leave<00:05:07.040> this

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
I just said and I'm gonna leave this

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.600 
I just said and I'm gonna leave this
part<00:05:07.670> of<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.820> video<00:05:07.940> kind<00:05:08.510> of<00:05:08.770> only<00:05:09.770> to<00:05:10.430> X

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
part of the video kind of only to X

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.040 
part of the video kind of only to X
speed<00:05:10.850> instead<00:05:11.090> of<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.270> normal<00:05:11.510> 4<00:05:11.720> X<00:05:11.870> beat

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
speed instead of the normal 4 X beat

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.260 
speed instead of the normal 4 X beat
that<00:05:12.140> I<00:05:12.230> do<00:05:12.320> because<00:05:12.470> I<00:05:12.680> found<00:05:12.920> that<00:05:13.340> this<00:05:14.090> is

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
that I do because I found that this is

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.940 
that I do because I found that this is
actually<00:05:14.600> kind<00:05:14.840> of<00:05:14.870> a<00:05:14.930> winding<00:05:15.200> and<00:05:15.500> twisting

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
actually kind of a winding and twisting

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.400 
actually kind of a winding and twisting
area<00:05:16.280> it's<00:05:16.460> not<00:05:16.520> super<00:05:16.910> easy<00:05:16.970> to<00:05:17.450> find<00:05:18.200> your

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
area it's not super easy to find your

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.130 
area it's not super easy to find your
way<00:05:18.530> through<00:05:18.800> all<00:05:19.460> these<00:05:19.730> kind<00:05:20.660> of<00:05:20.690> twisted

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
way through all these kind of twisted

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.070 
way through all these kind of twisted
tunnels<00:05:21.500> and<00:05:21.910> then<00:05:22.910> eventually<00:05:23.600> you'll<00:05:23.930> come

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
tunnels and then eventually you'll come

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.930 
tunnels and then eventually you'll come
up<00:05:24.110> to<00:05:24.350> a<00:05:24.560> stack<00:05:24.980> of<00:05:25.010> boxes<00:05:25.280> that<00:05:25.730> you're<00:05:25.850> gonna

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
up to a stack of boxes that you're gonna

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.060 
up to a stack of boxes that you're gonna
have<00:05:26.180> to<00:05:26.300> jump<00:05:26.570> up<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:26.870> eventually<00:05:27.650> enter<00:05:27.950> the

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
have to jump up and eventually enter the

00:05:28.070 --> 00:06:00.930 
have to jump up and eventually enter the
incinerator<00:05:28.760> room

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.159 

and<00:06:01.940> now<00:06:02.180> you're<00:06:02.330> in<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.480> incinerator<00:06:02.780> room

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
and now you're in the incinerator room

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:04.810 
and now you're in the incinerator room
if<00:06:03.440> you<00:06:03.590> don't<00:06:03.770> have<00:06:03.980> very<00:06:04.190> good<00:06:04.310> health<00:06:04.610> you

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
if you don't have very good health you

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.030 
if you don't have very good health you
can<00:06:04.970> die<00:06:05.120> pretty<00:06:05.360> quickly<00:06:05.630> in<00:06:05.840> here<00:06:06.050> so<00:06:06.380> keep

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
can die pretty quickly in here so keep

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.930 
can die pretty quickly in here so keep
in<00:06:07.160> mind<00:06:07.190> that<00:06:07.400> as<00:06:07.490> soon<00:06:07.580> as<00:06:07.669> you<00:06:07.730> walk<00:06:07.910> through

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
in mind that as soon as you walk through

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.150 
in mind that as soon as you walk through
this<00:06:08.180> blue<00:06:08.510> force<00:06:09.440> field<00:06:09.710> in<00:06:09.830> front<00:06:10.010> of<00:06:10.100> you

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
this blue force field in front of you

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.100 
this blue force field in front of you
you<00:06:10.340> will<00:06:10.520> start<00:06:10.610> taking<00:06:10.970> damage<00:06:11.150> slowly<00:06:11.540> so

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
you will start taking damage slowly so
