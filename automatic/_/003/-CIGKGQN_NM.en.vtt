created the home colorway of course you

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.609 
created the home colorway of course you
know<00:01:07.880> as<00:01:08.359> I<00:01:08.509> was<00:01:08.630> mentioning<00:01:08.810> it<00:01:09.229> didn't<00:01:09.499> have

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
know as I was mentioning it didn't have

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.069 
know as I was mentioning it didn't have
that<00:01:09.799> black<00:01:10.539> midsole<00:01:11.539> but<00:01:11.780> it<00:01:11.869> was<00:01:11.959> supposed

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
that black midsole but it was supposed

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.069 
that black midsole but it was supposed
to<00:01:12.319> differentiate<00:01:12.920> between<00:01:13.579> a<00:01:13.850> home<00:01:14.209> and<00:01:14.509> a

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
to differentiate between a home and a

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.660 
to differentiate between a home and a
road<00:01:15.319> so<00:01:15.649> this<00:01:15.829> would<00:01:15.979> be<00:01:16.100> considered<00:01:16.639> your

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
road so this would be considered your

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.289 
road so this would be considered your
road<00:01:17.060> shoe<00:01:18.279> they<00:01:19.279> didn't<00:01:19.520> have<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.700> black<00:01:20.060> in

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
road shoe they didn't have a black in

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.010

all black and red air jordan - back then

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.769 
all black and red air jordan - back then
so<00:01:24.409> it<00:01:24.979> was<00:01:25.100> one<00:01:25.249> of<00:01:25.279> the<00:01:25.429> shoes<00:01:25.639> you<00:01:26.179> know<00:01:26.299> then

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:26.779

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:28.809 
so it was one of the shoes you know then
that<00:01:27.139> didn't<00:01:27.979> have<00:01:28.100> that<00:01:28.189> maybe<00:01:28.549> it<00:01:28.729> was

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
that didn't have that maybe it was

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.019 
that didn't have that maybe it was

on<00:06:14.410> the<00:06:14.470> jordan<00:06:15.040> and<00:06:15.190> on<00:06:16.150> this<00:06:16.600> panel<00:06:16.990> here<00:06:17.230> I

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
on the jordan and on this panel here I

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.480

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
believe that the count down pack was

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.400 
believe that the count down pack was
actually<00:06:22.380> a<00:06:23.520> brighter<00:06:24.520> red<00:06:24.640> as<00:06:25.200> opposed<00:06:26.200> to

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
actually a brighter red as opposed to

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.320 
actually a brighter red as opposed to
the<00:06:26.770> one<00:06:26.920> that's<00:06:27.040> coming<00:06:27.340> out<00:06:27.610> on<00:06:27.640> Saturday
