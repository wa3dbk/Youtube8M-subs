 serve as you can tell the drivers 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.600
 so many are the wages and start the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.840
 computer 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.410

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.590
 sip who say it's slightly 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.640

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.750
 more to create it however for nothing 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.420
 drag images onto the device 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.900
 virtual and expect it to open 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.310

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.010

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.590
 it will not open normally 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.120

 double click on the setup ok i 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:59.730
 I've already installed it so I don't think that 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.990
 he won't do it for me to install anyway 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.470
 you normally installed it to me 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:11.160
 later than a second I must rightly 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.000
 execute must execute the file as 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:24.720

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:27.150
 run as administrator yes ok at least 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.630
 he can do it for me or his name 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:35.610
 today he did the installation then a 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.920
 you obviously have to do here 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.330

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:14.270
 where did you install the savory game 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:18.720

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:44.180
 quite fast enough discreet 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.009
 it is not a very heavy game it comes 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.680
 borne almost by all computers 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.169
 sure if you have a lot of netbooks 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.069
