00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
day I think so so that's really crappy

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:02.020 
day I think so so that's really crappy
that's<00:04:55.160> what<00:04:55.340> i<00:04:55.370> think<00:04:56.139> i<00:05:00.010> would<00:05:01.010> also<00:05:01.280> like<00:05:01.669> to

that's what i think i would also like to

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.690 
that's what i think i would also like to
that<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:03.050> musical<00:05:03.830> videos<00:05:04.130> that<00:05:04.400> will<00:05:04.550> be

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
that the musical videos that will be

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.730 
that the musical videos that will be
integrated<00:05:05.150> in<00:05:05.419> one<00:05:05.660> so<00:05:05.960> you<00:05:06.020> have<00:05:06.169> an<00:05:06.260> ipod

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
integrated in one so you have an ipod

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.909 
integrated in one so you have an ipod
app<00:05:07.430> also<00:05:07.940> on<00:05:08.600> ipod<00:05:09.440> touch<00:05:11.590> because<00:05:12.590> i<00:05:12.740> don't

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
app also on ipod touch because i don't

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.219 
app also on ipod touch because i don't
see<00:05:13.130> the<00:05:13.400> damn<00:05:13.760> difference<00:05:14.060> between<00:05:14.900> it<00:05:15.050> you

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
see the damn difference between it you

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.990 
see the damn difference between it you
know<00:05:16.870> that's<00:05:17.870> what<00:05:18.080> I'm<00:05:18.200> saying<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.830> know

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.080 

just<00:05:21.720> what<00:05:21.840> I'm<00:05:21.930> saying<00:05:22.290> but<00:05:22.800> it<00:05:23.790> could<00:05:23.970> be

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
just what I'm saying but it could be

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.770 
just what I'm saying but it could be
possible<00:05:25.430> it's<00:05:26.430> not<00:05:26.880> really<00:05:27.210> hard<00:05:27.570> because

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
possible it's not really hard because

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.590 
possible it's not really hard because
it's<00:05:28.200> already<00:05:28.470> done<00:05:28.800> by<00:05:29.070> jailbreaking<00:05:29.600> master

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
it's already done by jailbreaking master

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.970 
it's already done by jailbreaking master
so<00:05:30.960> it<00:05:31.950> could<00:05:32.160> be<00:05:32.190> on<00:05:32.460> by<00:05:32.700> a<00:05:33.690> pole<00:05:34.350> for<00:05:34.380> very

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
so it could be on by a pole for very

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.460 
so it could be on by a pole for very
easily<00:05:36.590> now<00:05:37.590> obviously<00:05:38.010> we<00:05:38.610> all<00:05:38.640> want<00:05:39.030> this
