00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hi my name is Hashem whathe as in the

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.869 
hi my name is Hashem whathe as in the
last<00:00:03.750> video<00:00:04.080> I'm<00:00:04.319> introducing<00:00:05.220> ibex<00:00:05.700> a

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
last video I'm introducing ibex a

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.870 
last video I'm introducing ibex a
virtual<00:00:06.390> reality<00:00:06.540> desktop<00:00:07.350> for<00:00:07.589> Linux<00:00:07.919> now<00:00:08.700> in

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
virtual reality desktop for Linux now in

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.970 
virtual reality desktop for Linux now in
the<00:00:08.970> last<00:00:09.120> video<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.750> took<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.410> video<00:00:10.650> from<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
the last video I took the video from a

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.440 
the last video I took the video from a
distance<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.759> couldn't<00:00:12.090> get<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> very

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
distance so you couldn't get a very

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.780 
distance so you couldn't get a very
close<00:00:12.719> look<00:00:12.929> at<00:00:13.110> what<00:00:13.230> ibex<00:00:13.620> looked<00:00:13.860> like<00:00:14.070> when

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
close look at what ibex looked like when

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.730 
close look at what ibex looked like when
you<00:00:14.880> run<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.179> on<00:00:15.269> your<00:00:15.330> laptop<00:00:15.870> or<00:00:16.109> desktop<00:00:16.289> or

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
you run it on your laptop or desktop or

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.080 
you run it on your laptop or desktop or
whatever<00:00:16.830> system<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.430> choose<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.760> run<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.000> on

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
whatever system you choose to run it on

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.760 
whatever system you choose to run it on
so<00:00:18.660> I'm<00:00:18.779> just<00:00:18.869> gonna<00:00:18.960> launch<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.439> right<00:00:19.560> now

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
so I'm just gonna launch it right now

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.670 
so I'm just gonna launch it right now
and<00:00:20.070> as<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.180> can<00:00:21.300> see<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:22.080> get<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> virtual

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and as you can see you get a virtual

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.890 
and as you can see you get a virtual
workspace<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.730> workspace<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.390> currently

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
workspace the workspace is currently

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.480 
workspace the workspace is currently
only<00:00:25.380> what<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.830> see<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.160> your<00:00:26.279> regular

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
only what you see on your regular

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.429 
only what you see on your regular
monitor<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> hope<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:28.019> we'll<00:00:28.410> be

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
monitor but the hope is that we'll be

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.320 
monitor but the hope is that we'll be
able<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> get<00:00:28.920> multiple<00:00:29.460> virtual<00:00:29.699> workspaces

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
able to get multiple virtual workspaces

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.410 
able to get multiple virtual workspaces
up<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.840> running<00:00:31.080> now<00:00:31.830> every<00:00:32.730> window<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.180> fully

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
up and running now every window is fully

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.170 
up and running now every window is fully
interactive<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.800> works<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.030> would

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
interactive it works just as you would

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.750 
interactive it works just as you would
normally<00:00:36.510> use<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.899> all<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.290> menus<00:00:37.620> work<00:00:37.890> you

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
normally use it all the menus work you

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
normally use it all the menus work you
can<00:00:38.940> switch<00:00:39.180> between<00:00:39.329> Windows<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:39.989> tabs<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
can switch between Windows and tabs and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.600 
can switch between Windows and tabs and
games<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.530> desktop<00:00:43.710> 3d

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
games and so on and on the desktop 3d

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.510 
games and so on and on the desktop 3d
even<00:00:45.149> works<00:00:45.360> perfectly<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.250> it's<00:00:47.250> hard<00:00:47.489> to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
even works perfectly and it's hard to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.250 
even works perfectly and it's hard to
tell<00:00:47.730> from<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.719> looks<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.020> it's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
tell from here but it looks like it's

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.590 
tell from here but it looks like it's
running<00:00:49.410> around<00:00:49.829> 30<00:00:50.160> frames<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.579> second<00:00:50.940> now<00:00:51.510> if

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
running around 30 frames a second now if

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.779 
running around 30 frames a second now if
you<00:00:51.719> press<00:00:51.930> control<00:00:52.320> shift<00:00:52.350> Y<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.550> switch

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
you press control shift Y you switch

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.939 
you press control shift Y you switch
into<00:00:53.969> navigation<00:00:54.660> mode<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> means

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
into navigation mode and what that means

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.340 
into navigation mode and what that means
is<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.489> use<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> AAS<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.930> W

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
is that you can use the AAS and the W

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.200 
is that you can use the AAS and the W
and<00:00:58.500> s<00:00:58.649> keys<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.190> move<00:00:59.340> forward<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.789> backwards

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
and s keys to move forward and backwards

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.959 
and s keys to move forward and backwards
and<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.199> D<00:01:01.260> keys<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:02.070> strafe<00:01:02.370> left<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and the a and D keys to strafe left and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.890 
and the a and D keys to strafe left and
right<00:01:03.170> now<00:01:04.170> if<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.920> use<00:01:05.580> your<00:01:05.760> mouse<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.750> can

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
right now if you use your mouse you can

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.750 
right now if you use your mouse you can
actually<00:01:07.290> start<00:01:07.560> looking<00:01:07.890> around<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.369> you

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
actually start looking around you you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.149 
actually start looking around you you
can<00:01:08.939> look<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.240> at<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> sky<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:09.960> even<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> grass

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
can look up at the sky or even the grass

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.640 
can look up at the sky or even the grass
and<00:01:11.720> basically<00:01:12.720> position<00:01:13.229> yourself<00:01:13.619> for

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and basically position yourself for

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.380 
and basically position yourself for
whatever<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.130> most<00:01:14.280> comfortable<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.060> 3d

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
whatever is most comfortable in this 3d

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480 
whatever is most comfortable in this 3d
world<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.259> hope<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.619> course<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.220> we'll

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
world the hope of course is that we'll

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.490 
world the hope of course is that we'll
be<00:01:17.580> able<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.880> add<00:01:18.000> other<00:01:18.390> objects<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.409> this

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
be able to add other objects to this

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.289 
be able to add other objects to this
environment<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:21.090> we're<00:01:21.270> just

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
environment but for now we're just

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
environment but for now we're just
keeping<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.840> simple<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:22.470> individual

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
keeping it simple with individual

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.840 
keeping it simple with individual
desktops<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.659> now<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.340> last<00:01:26.520> video

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
desktops and so on now in the last video

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.460 
desktops and so on now in the last video
I<00:01:26.880> also<00:01:27.119> demonstrated<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> iPhone<00:01:28.259> app<00:01:28.439> so

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
I also demonstrated the iPhone app so

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.160 
I also demonstrated the iPhone app so
let<00:01:28.740> me<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.979> launch<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.310> right<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
let me just launch that right now and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.480 
let me just launch that right now and
you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> chance<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.310> see

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you can actually get a chance to see

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.550 
you can actually get a chance to see
what<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.759> looks<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.780> rotate<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.320> screen

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
what it looks like to rotate the screen

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.429 
what it looks like to rotate the screen
so<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.820> rift<00:01:36.119> supports<00:01:36.810> six<00:01:37.049> degrees<00:01:37.409> of

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
so the rift supports six degrees of

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.370 
so the rift supports six degrees of
freedom<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:40.079> basic

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
freedom and this is a basic

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.810 
freedom and this is a basic
demonstration<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:41.340> what<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.579> would<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.729> able

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
demonstration of what you would be able

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.300 
demonstration of what you would be able
to<00:01:41.970> achieve<00:01:42.150> using<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.350> iPhone<00:01:43.740> now

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
to achieve using the iPhone now

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.359 
to achieve using the iPhone now
obviously<00:01:44.759> there's<00:01:45.030> no<00:01:45.210> way<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> perform

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
obviously there's no way to perform

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.389 
obviously there's no way to perform
motion<00:01:47.369> tracking<00:01:47.640> forward<00:01:48.530> but<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
motion tracking forward but this is a

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.010 
motion tracking forward but this is a
very<00:01:50.670> quick<00:01:50.939> idea<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.479> what<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.720> would<00:01:51.840> look

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
very quick idea of what it would look

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.350 
very quick idea of what it would look
like<00:01:52.079> if<00:01:52.860> your<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.520> be<00:01:53.670> wearing<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> headset
