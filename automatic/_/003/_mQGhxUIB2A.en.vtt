00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.359
 the staff is the severe Gustavo teacher and 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.319
 We are going to start addressing with this 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.849
 video 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.700
 the subject related to one of the materials 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.400
 that revolutionized dentistry that are 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.350
 adhesive systems is gradually 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.630
 materials that needed macro 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.480
 retention on the back of healthy tissue 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.789
 have been and are still being replaced 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.980
 materials that make it possible to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.949
 professional interventions less and less 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.050
 invasive and thus conduct each 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.540
 more conservative 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.579
 the introduction of adhesive systems is the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.770
 enabled a paradigm shift 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.660
 daily dental practice does not 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.280
 only to the issue of adhesive systems 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.879
 in adhesives in general 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.280
 as also the number of glass is we 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.010
 today we have numerous systems 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.710
 adhesive is many companies end up 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.370
 manufacturing products before there is a 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.250
 immense renewal of products 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.660
 market and so on but she has that same 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.140
 it is very likely that soon you 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.180
 Look At This Image It's From The Video It Comes 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.210
 talking guy walks looks at both 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.729
 December the old between this teacher 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.890
 put in that video then to organize 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.430
 both the adhesive systems some 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.229
 classifications they were proposed 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.299
 there are classifications by generations of 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.689
 stickers 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.060
 modification partial or total removal 10 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.579
 mirlei and which is also called mud 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.920
 but as some authors have 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.170
 we prefer the class to rank 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.420
 rather than grouping the systems 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.880
 conventional adhesives where 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.259
 conditioning and systems 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.720
 adhesives somewhat conditioning systems 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.390
 it is conventional adhesives in turn 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.850
 they are underreported in accordance with 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.520
 number of steps or technical steps to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.829
 their application are classified in 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.750
 three-step system where the first 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.479
 step the application of an acid 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.920
 then applies a team and ends 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.780
 with the application of a adhesive 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.509
 itself 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.459
 the two-step system they present 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.250
 the acid also having a first step 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.580
 but then the application of primer and 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.620
 sticker 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.720
 happening simultaneously which 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.860
 these products are in the same 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.670
 bottle 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.710
 that way so do not confuse father and 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.640
 the sticker itself 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.160
 aimée is one thing and adhesive is another 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.200
 which is similar in this subclassification 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.180
 that ends up putting these these systems 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.650
 adhesives in the adhesive category 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.280
 conventional conditioning today 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:44.110
 total is the fact that they have the stage of 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.550
 application of the acid as steel 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.650
 too much 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.940
 on the other hand the adhesive systems to 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.370
 conditioning 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.240
 acid it does not exist as step 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.800
 separate 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.860
 there are adhesive systems 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.080
 stickers in two steps in which the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.600
 first step the application of a first 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.880
 acid or the so-called perimeter of the 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.500
 conditioning and the second step to 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.260
 adhesive application 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.280
 there are also the adhesive systems of 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.370
 a step or single steel in which it presents 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.540
 the application of the first adhesive of 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.450
 only once 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.269
 these systems only peace they can 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.800
 be presented in a single vial or 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.290
 between two bottles 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.260
 in the case of the two vials are mixed one 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.320
 drop of each vial before application and 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.510
 this application does occur as I just 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.840
 speak in a single 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:42.430
 so having already seen the rating 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.040
 let's make up your stickers and 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.670
 adhesive systems they should be 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.700
 understood with a composition of a 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.120
 acid in the case of a conventional 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.670
 time that can be accessed in the case of 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.340
 conditioning and the adhesive 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.160
 itself 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.920
 the employed acid is a phosphoric acid 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.440
 whose concentration varies between 30 and 40% and 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.950
 they are presented in consistency of 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.440
 gel are some are more stable and end up 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.750
 flowing less than others 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.669
 this even facilitates a lot of application 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.940
 in these matters 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.789
 the former is a functional substance and be 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.900
 that allows the bond between the dentine 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.660
 sticker 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.419
 it stabilizes just the matrix collar 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.949
 dentinal gene that was exposed after the 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.830
 steel conditioning 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:39.460
 the building is basically composed of 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.100
 hydrophilic monomers pedophilia ie 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.169
 affinity for water and 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.210
 solvents and that is why it is 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.979
 applied on the dentin you need 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.259
 to be lightly moistened 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.940
 the three-step systems it is 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.889
 essentially composed of monuments 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.610
 hydrophilic and solvent 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.610
 as mentioned 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:04.090
 and we have attached it to the sticker in case 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.510
 two-step conventional 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.090
 we still have the father and self-conditioning the 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.760
 first acid in the jump system 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.310
 two-step conditioners and we have 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.630
 they along with patch in a bottle only 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:23.290
 also the adhesives can finally 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.990
 be defined as a resin is very 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.870
 fluid and polymer formed or 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.970
 characteristic religious monomers 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.100
 more hydrophobic properties that bind 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.000
 hydrophilic monomers present in the 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.240
 panel 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.820
 we have the stickers is in jars 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.140
 separated in the case of conventional 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.290
 three steps 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.870
 together with the father and how we just 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.430
 see also in conventional adhesives or 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.870
 with total conditioning of two 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.500
 steps 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.720
 we still have them as a separate step in the 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.400
 stickers with dictionary before 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.770
 two steps together or the release together 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.370
 of the sticker a single jumping bottle 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.530
 only palace of good conditions we 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.740
 we will continue here with the references né 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.960
 used for the video today and we 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.880
 we will continue in this matter of 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:21.250
 future videos but as always we 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.050
 We asked you so far, you had 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.240
 any doubt about this part 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.500
 composition and classification of 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.470
 succinct way 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.670
 if you have critical doubts and 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.410
 suggestions 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.480
 you probably already know about our 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.790
 contact channels 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.800
 so we have facebook channel 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:43.210
 we also have gmail twitter is the channel 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.970
 youtube you're watching 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:50.050
 video and also google plus 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:54.210
 so for now it's just we see each other 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.210
 next videos is more a big hug
