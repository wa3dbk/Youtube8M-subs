00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.780
 Good day to all good people 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:11.740
 I continue to do dust removal 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:15.430
 his frezer 3601 and b 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:19.220
 Today I will be removed from the top 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:23.480
 I want to make protective screens and language 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:29.300
 glasses for this i need a template 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:34.040
 so dviglo inner radius on 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.730
 wooden sticks playing it on 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.730
 band saw 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.930
 both minds I already surface on 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.650
 grinding drums 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.479
 by the way here attached a pipe from 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.229
 same mother and you are homemade for 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.229
 vacuum cleaners 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:52.790
 with the help of an industrial hair dryer, I will 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.790
 I think this is now plexiglas pattern 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:17.990
 I have overheated a little glass in general 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:22.660
 I marked the trouble here grease under the ledge 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.760
 the bottom now you drank it on a ribbon 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.000
 with band saws and file 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.360
 I adjusted this protective casing 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.700
 so that he normally becomes on 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.790
 him now here here 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.580
 I'll attach the little corner to show how it will be 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:48.220
 look like this 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:51.290
 protective mode design 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.390
 I had to change the lamb which 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:02.220
 pressed parallel emphasis on the screw with 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.470
 hexagon to tape 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:12.540
 left lil i like these three 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:16.050
 blanks 1 2 and 3 did not take pictures 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.930
 dead battery in the camera like this 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.940
 it will look like it is like this 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.310
 put with light all glue 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:29.460
 this here this top drilled here 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.370
 hole diameter of 35 millimeters five 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.910
 once under the nozzle of the vacuum cleaner that I will 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.160
 to glue 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:41.030
 then this whole story is refined such 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.890
 Here it turned out in hours 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.890
 he is a little ennobled 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.910
 from the back I cut out 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.660
 a plastic bottle piece secured it 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:10.890
 Stapler cut out the window in the base 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:17.430
 Frazer so here it all looks 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:20.130
 assembled in large series no in 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:27.750
 general tab or not particularly where to 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:29.080
 go like a vacuum cleaner looks like this 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.759
 frezer 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.759
 with connected vacuum cleaner 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:43.440
 on this side we have a protective cover with 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.570
 This side of the pipe itself, too 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.630
 all closed 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.970
 hose pointing up not so convenient 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.190
 over his shoulder when he threw it 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:59.660
 milling in general on this 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:02.690
 the story of the overcomer frezer makita 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.510
 3601 b can be said 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.140
