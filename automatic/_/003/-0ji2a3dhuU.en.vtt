in<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.730> flat<00:00:14.969> barbell<00:00:15.420> bench<00:00:15.450> just<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.199> test<00:00:16.410> my

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
in a flat barbell bench just to test my

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.710 
in a flat barbell bench just to test my
strength<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.730> reason<00:00:18.060> for<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.690> that

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
strength and the reason for this is that

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.779 
strength and the reason for this is that
I<00:00:18.930> find<00:00:19.289> especially<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> incline<00:00:20.550> bench

seems to annoy my rotator cuff it
doesn't<00:00:29.189> necessarily<00:00:29.279> cause<00:00:29.970> p.m.<00:00:30.510> but

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
doesn't necessarily cause p.m. but

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.179 
doesn't necessarily cause p.m. but
whenever<00:00:31.140> I'm<00:00:31.410> doing<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> bench<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189
