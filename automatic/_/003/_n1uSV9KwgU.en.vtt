00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
many of them so ha but yeah i'm guessing

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.799 
many of them so ha but yeah i'm guessing
maybe<00:00:34.410> now<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.730> time<00:00:36.000> when<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:36.570> you've

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
done mo very consistently then he might

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.310 
done mo very consistently then he might
start<00:00:38.879> giving<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.300> your<00:00:39.450> clue<00:00:39.660> every<00:00:39.960> time<00:00:40.140> I

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
don't let's just my guess but anyways

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.470 
don't let's just my guess but anyways
let's<00:00:42.899> go<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> first<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.480> at

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
let's go to the first one this one is at

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.959 
let's go to the first one this one is at
its<00:00:46.260> not<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.440> World<00:00:46.710> II<00:00:46.800> clue<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.250> we're<00:00:47.789> good<00:00:47.940> on

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
guess surprising don't even know if

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.320 
guess surprising don't even know if
that's<00:05:40.150> happened<00:05:40.450> yet<00:05:40.570> but<00:05:40.720> yeah<00:05:41.440> anyway<00:05:41.740> so

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
that's happened yet but yeah anyway so

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.240 
that's happened yet but yeah anyway so
so<00:05:43.330> far<00:05:43.570> looks<00:05:44.080> like<00:05:44.200> elites<00:05:44.530> are<00:05:44.680> going<00:05:44.980> to<00:05:45.100> be

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
so far looks like elites are going to be

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.159

the<00:05:45.460> most<00:05:45.730> done<00:05:46.180> clue<00:05:46.450> in<00:05:46.600> this<00:05:46.750> series<00:05:46.930> so<00:05:47.140> far

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
the most done clue in this series so far

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.170 
the most done clue in this series so far
I<00:05:47.380> mean<00:05:47.560> we<00:05:47.680> have<00:05:47.860> two<00:05:48.130> days<00:05:48.310> left<00:05:48.340> and<00:05:48.790> if<00:05:49.060> we

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
I mean we have two days left and if we

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.550 
I mean we have two days left and if we
get<00:05:49.270> too<00:05:49.419> hard<00:05:49.630> so<00:05:49.750> I'll<00:05:49.810> put<00:05:49.900> us<00:05:50.020> at<00:05:50.140> 10<00:05:50.320> so

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
get too hard so I'll put us at 10 so

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.380 
get too hard so I'll put us at 10 so
that<00:05:50.590> we<00:05:50.860> got<00:05:51.010> more<00:05:51.220> elites<00:05:51.460> than<00:05:52.030> any<00:05:52.180> other

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
that we got more elites than any other

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.060 
that we got more elites than any other
clue<00:05:52.630> which<00:05:52.870> I'm<00:05:53.080> not<00:05:53.410> really<00:05:53.560> surprised<00:05:53.950> that

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
since we always ask for one but maybe I

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.970
