00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.150
 there is everybody then today we 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.340
 find myself at for a video after my 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.800
 self go of holidays so low it will be 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.119
 first video of a long line so 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.820
 during these holidays I will try to 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.670
 finish as many videos as you can 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.670
 can easily look at them it is 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.949
 realized low if you feel like it 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.689
 so well we start this series with a 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.820
 pretty short video is pretty simple 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.610
 just to show you how in 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.440
 install it can not with a socket 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.120
 of this type there in a landlord 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.170
 because see I do not know if you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.910
 so here is how could the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.379
 see there there is a double one two 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.559
 empty and a socket with the aso the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.510
 raptor so I do not know if you see 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:05.549
 but on the top you show all that 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.619
 so on the top here is wiki read the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.760
 movies with wolves so that's a little 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.020
 their link or because I really 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.810
 full frame but to pass low these 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.009
 cables and socket pitch of the ground 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.140
 we can not go directly 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.840
 like that would have to make a hole and did 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.240
 and suddenly this year so to pass 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.439
 down the one sockets inside the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.930
 field there is a very simple technique 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.520
 so yeah it's a double joy all 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.020
 quite normal that we buy in all 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.470
 stores so have to have to remove 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.470
 lampoon 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.350
 but two sides then you and you 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.450
 can see that the socket and in two 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.030
 parties a party we will accuse the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.820
 bulbs and the other part a lot more 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:51.990
 long so yes it's the one with the 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:54.250
 son turn at the same time I m like that 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.800
 now we have unscrewed the two parts 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.150
 so the bottom part that only serves 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.340
 fix on the water and this part there it is 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.840
 the one that will interest us 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.840
 I know how to smoke like that 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.220
 1 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.879
 the facts the focus so here is 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.670
 that's what will interest us this is 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.980
 dismantling these cables can fix the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.739
 first part of the sleeve height of the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.349
 rpm so that we will have that 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.220
 monkey it's just a screwdriver 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:38.859
 cruciform very simple so we're going 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:43.780
 unscrew the currencies and then we'll get 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:52.840
 find with something to do 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:54.040
 the focus here I was a little 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.079
 little too far little bit too close 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.819
 devices so these are these two 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.889
 cables then eelv is it going to be 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:09.370
 very simple to pass over the 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:14.409
 field so I 'm going to show this here you 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.379
 can see them right there so then he 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:26.979
 will have to spend them in his for the 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:29.260
 bring out the other side a little 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:31.329
 as if and then bring down the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.849
 socket we can see balla both sons 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.609
 and the sweet enough even the same 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.470
 the installation with the surah hours 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:41.079
 so down what of course not fit 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:47.260
 for all languages ​​then once 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:49.930
 that we spent the inter son I you 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.240
 shows so we pass this part of 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:58.910
 forbidden field like that downhill 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:01.940
 dario maginot yalta so there we go 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.590
 have the top of the pile here the inter of the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.610
 heap so we had to go back up the 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:15.100
 doubt about it is very simple in 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:17.270
 December so we will take our shower 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.120
 we do not wait for the bet whoever 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:23.440
 started as soon as it goes up our two 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.520
 bushings to pass the wires inside 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:32.480
 bring them out on the other side 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.790
 come back plugged each son into his 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.470
 hole so there is not really any sense 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.440
 we could plug in any 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.150
 sense the electricity is still going 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.530
 so do not be afraid do not be afraid do not have 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:52.880
 no more is not me once bag 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:54.680
 that this is done we revive this thursday 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.730
 it's a little bit that side we do 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.730
 enter the other 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:10.449
 once it's a very big screw well 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.449
 so that it fits 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:29.059
 then we come to fix the second 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:32.269
 part that's son and lang flow and 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:34.839
 normally if we will soon make a 

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:34.839
 once connected 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.770
 showing so has bah here you 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.720
 can see so for the operate 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.910
 so it's very easy to install there 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.190
 the only downside on this hasseni ball 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:56.600
 No screws as you may have 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:58.280
 see about other interests I said 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.350
 so to leave a little live on the 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.210
 video if you liked it and especially 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.840
 do not hesitate to ask a question if you 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.289
 have a problem 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.910
 and do not hesitate so especially ask your 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.100
 last question on the FAQ which then 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.690
 I close the faq at the end of the week 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.600
 next so next sunday I 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.820
 think we 'll know Sunday 27 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.990
 so I could film the faq 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.900
 answer all your questions 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.280
 so here are some low pitchers to pose the 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.830
 last question at the worst we know too much 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.830
 for a future life go one more 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.620
 Oh
