00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.530 
to TK or which would be the time to kill
what<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.400> time<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.479> know

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
what is that time and in you know

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.120 
what is that time and in you know
weapons<00:01:42.930> all<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.380> kind<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.619> congregate

weapons all have to kind of congregate

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.700 
weapons all have to kind of congregate
towards<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.579> point<00:01:44.869> in<00:01:45.869> order<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.320> achieve

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
towards that point in order to achieve

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.620 
towards that point in order to achieve
balance<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.490> accurate<00:01:47.820> accuracy<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.329> more<00:01:48.570> of

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
balance and accurate accuracy is more of

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.249 
balance and accurate accuracy is more of
a<00:01:48.659> secondary<00:01:49.049> thing<00:01:49.290> now<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.329> don't<00:01:51.329> think<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
a secondary thing now I don't think and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.350 
a secondary thing now I don't think and
so<00:01:52.439> that's<00:01:52.590> my<00:01:52.799> that's<00:01:53.009> my<00:01:53.130> basis<00:01:53.640> for<00:01:54.060> for

that is that is essentially dominated by

that is that is essentially dominated by
close<00:04:04.319> quarters<00:04:04.680> battle<00:04:04.709> that's<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.400> call<00:04:05.639> of

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
close quarters battle that's the call of

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.259 
close quarters battle that's the call of
duty<00:04:05.849> thing<00:04:06.569> that's<00:04:06.810> what<00:04:07.049> they<00:04:07.260> do<00:04:07.639> and<00:04:08.639> and<00:04:09.150> I

duty thing that's what they do and and I

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.599 
duty thing that's what they do and and I
just<00:04:09.510> don't<00:04:09.870> think<00:04:10.290> if<00:04:10.500> we<00:04:10.889> go<00:04:11.069> back<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.310> that

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
just don't think if we go back to that

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.400 
just don't think if we go back to that
to<00:04:11.849> that<00:04:11.880> play<00:04:12.299> to<00:04:12.359> that<00:04:12.630> engagement<00:04:13.049> that<00:04:13.349> I

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
to that play to that engagement that I

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.339 
to that play to that engagement that I
asked<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:13.799> all<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.010> remember<00:04:14.340> if<00:04:14.810> we<00:04:15.810> if<00:04:16.079> we
