00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
start to add a lot of footage instead of

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.640 
start to add a lot of footage instead of
it<00:01:24.400> just<00:01:24.640> continually<00:01:25.330> extending<00:01:26.140> down<00:01:26.470> the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
it just continually extending down the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.100 
it just continually extending down the
timeline<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.490> just<00:01:28.030> kind<00:01:28.210> of<00:01:28.270> starts<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.780> stack

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
timeline it just kind of starts to stack

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.310 
timeline it just kind of starts to stack
your<00:01:29.380> footage<00:01:29.740> down<00:01:29.979> here<00:01:30.340> in<00:01:30.490> your<00:01:31.000> timeline

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
timeline as you can see there it's now

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.790 
timeline as you can see there it's now

timeline so even if I try to add footage
down<00:01:57.610> here<00:01:58.150> it's<00:01:58.360> not<00:01:58.570> going<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.050> let<00:01:59.260> me

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
down here it's not going to let me

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.650 
down here it's not going to let me
because<00:02:00.190> it's<00:02:00.340> only<00:02:00.520> going<00:02:00.760> to<00:02:00.820> continue<00:02:01.210> in

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
because it's only going to continue in

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.320 
because it's only going to continue in
this<00:02:02.350> second<00:02:02.800> level<00:02:03.100> here<00:02:03.340> because<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.090> has<00:02:04.210> to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
this second level here because it has to

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.540 
this second level here because it has to
continually<00:02:04.840> stack<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.530> footage<00:02:05.920> on<00:02:06.100> the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
continually stack the footage on the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.719 
continually stack the footage on the
timeline<00:02:07.350> luckily<00:02:08.350> now<00:02:08.500> in<00:02:08.680> iMovie<00:02:09.130> 11<00:02:09.550> you
