 they could see in the title robbery to the 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.749
 first person jewelry and it was something 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.059
 that lester wanted to attract because I do not know to 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.950
 I really liked this ammunition and you can 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.660

 I have to take the van ok 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.170
 done this is one of the first 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.180
 missions if you want rope 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.829
 campaign then play the since this is 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.450
 pretty funny you know they have 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.880
 have to organize red and do many 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.350
 things more so let's give it to see now 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.050
 all the bastards went up to see 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.810
 these assholes were you will be oral asshole 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.730
 vt wey lucky to this fucking people like 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.130
 As you can see they are slow not yet 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.110
 is in a hurry to dock the fucking 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.270
 poultry and those guys doing way is 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.220
 normal this may not be possible so 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.380
 Let's go directing the poultry 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.690
 to be able to dock and in fact this is 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.210
 one of my favorite missions like that is not 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.100
 that the smi not the favorite the other the 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.170
 great robbery the great robbery that yes is my 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.640
 preferred mission and if I want to bring it 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.060
 right now in the first person because 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.979
 true 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.140
 I quite like this mission and I believe 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.659
 that it's nice to be able to bring them 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.789
 first person so let's give it 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.829
 so we are going quickly to what 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.450
 that is making the jewelry to be able 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.829
 dock the I think the other 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.329
 missions that go by in which 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.460
 be important as this can be 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.960
 Well, I'll be bringing you, not because the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.130
 I really enjoy playing 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.409
 and apart from that they are pretty 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.880
 fun and it's the only thing in another 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.799
 will cost the ones that can be played right now 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.509
 at the big point it no longer limits no 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.220
 We have what you are doing then 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.380
 you will already know there is not a way it is in 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.119
 great auto online so we'll have to 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.860
 perform it so while here it is not 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.869
 they want to do some robbery the truth 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.429
 that is quite funny and to me something 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.770
 What makes me very curious is when 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.380
 be the robberies to banks in the big 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.099
 out on line is that the cops are going to 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.390
 be people or they will be game 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.149
 computer dolls is not something 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.530
 I'm very curious but it does not matter 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.149
 let's see we are already arriving here to the 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.590
 Jewelry remembers everything well 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.240
 we had to do in any way 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.369
 installs in a kinematics then I the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.110
 I jump because that does not matter to me because 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.759
 I played it in previously and well 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.600
 see what all this is about, so let's go 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.210
 skip 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.250
 type of kinematics to see then 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.890
 now to see what we have to do to 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.470
 see ok uy uy that's good to see we're going 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.230
 to see quitate pendejo let me place 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.660
 let me steal to see they steal the jewels ok no 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.890
 it's easier if you shot them yes but no 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.720
 they leave me ok 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.820
 good to see then the aforementioned 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.800
 what to do is to grab method or else in 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.900
 how much booty we have already seen how much 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.090
 click booty we've already been good with 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.220
 franklin so I believe the truth I do not know 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.930
 now with those suits I do not know a single 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.140
 fucked up as like the fucking franklin 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.170
 His hands are covered, I do not know if 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.730
 they are black white or colored 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.800
 right then not now I can not 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.210
 give an account to see that fucking maikel is that 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.950
 I do not know who I am, I think I am 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.290
 franklin because last character that 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.350
 grab to see and there comes someone who 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.090
 take it fucking now won it flashed 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.650
 innocent but the team was innocent 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.370
 came down so they had to kill leo ni 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.720
 here I hold even because if not 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.940
 these people do not understand me to see here 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.280
 we are going to grab all this and it only remains 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.370
 a booty is mine is mine the last booty 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.799
 yes 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.420
 and now yes ok and and this helmet does not 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.370
 I really like that I think we're already 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.650
 using quiet for what I see not what 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.810
 be this way to see I want to see if we are 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.299
 using franklin yes because the skill 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.069
 of driving is solely from franklin to 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.329
 see here is half bastard I 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.069
 I remember that these parts were very 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.420
 bastards because here all the pinches 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.299
 cars were closing in fact 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.190
 First-hand driving the motorcycle is 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.049
 quite comfortable, what does work 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.670
 they are the cars but like the motorcycle you see 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.410
 the whole picture is not the truth 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.970
 nothing difficult in fact I like 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.859
 A lot of driving now the bike at first 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.510
 person because I fit more and is more 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.849
 difficult to shock is because everything 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.500
 you see from the perspective of your eyes what 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.750
 Only work is hard to do 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.879
 little horses and jumps since that is 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.060
 quite difficult and so there's going to be 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.159
 win-win being that I fall ill and for God 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.170
 is that these first person jumps 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.790
 They are too epic and difficult but 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.220
 we are heading towards there we are going to 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.230
 follow other colleagues I do not know which one 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.000
 more let's change the characters u and no 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.829
 I knew that I did that seriously I did not know 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.359
 to see I think I do not know why they do it 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.000
 it would be more because I walk to third 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.340
 saved person 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.720
 so let's do what he's doing 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.910
 our mates 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.810
 it seems they would follow if I was going 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.960
 doing everything 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.920
 the way to see we go through here no no no 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.520
 do not 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.140
 why put is this slow motion 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.720
 because otherwise my mother would break me 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.850
 and so let's see these guys 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.590
 also click fast or they are going to 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.900
 what they are not smart are not 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.750
 assholes in fact this is one of my 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.860
 favorite missions of which I most 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.050
 they like, in fact, they are the ones that 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.220
 they like the ones of the robberies in fact 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.540
 I'm going through the same 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.860
 campaign because I remember that the first 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.750
 once it happens 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.100
 a year ago I had a lot of fun and I 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.680
 I think that's why I'm going back to 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.900
 happen to see these assholes are going 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.910
 over here ok to see let's chase them 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.490
 you do not have to let them get away you do not have to 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.200
 let them escape monkeys let's see 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.880
 where are they where are they ruiz 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.430
 I see them, they are going fast 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.440
 bastards today today for a little bit I break my 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.840
 mother for a bit I break my mother's 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.360
 done I do not know why batman so fucking 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.060
 fast and not like they do not get fast 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.640
 they grab the impulse is something strange of 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.800
 done I go as done the fuck and 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:34.409
 this character then simple 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.960
 what it does is grab to see by god or 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:39.060
 teachers that when with maikel so 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.159
 it's hard not here if it costs me a lot 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.699
 I work to see what I have to do 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:47.370
 I do not remember, I think I have to go 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.009
 I do not know the policemen then 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.930
 let's throw these police pins 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.780
 they eliminate the cops although there is a key 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.599
 to see there comes the last police here 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.150
 this is one is not that that does not mark me 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.069
 in the red dot to see web following the 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.690
 and then simply the ones that go 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.610
 following and those that come to me in fact 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.530
 is that I only appear one as an enemy 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.389
 does not appear that as a red dot ok that 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.800
 is here good and we miss it from 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.810
 txomin in which rifle are killed 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.449
 policemen in campaign mode in the 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.250
 online skewer is a fart to do that in 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.139
 serious here what I like a lot of 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.210
 campaign mode that the kinematics is 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.800
 all those animations there are many 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.389
 things that make sense when 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.699
 they do not really have them and they already saw 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.590
 the accelerometer of this truck what 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:30.389
 nice is seriously is very nice not 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.770
 I had noticed the yes yes it's okay 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.060
 forward is not that at the same time 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.160
 I see the accelerometer 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.160
 and quite beautiful and having here is where 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.419
 we stop and pick up the bikes now 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.889
 will ask us to go to 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.380
 hidden and good the mission is easy 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:46.930
 in fact if they noticed it I grabbed the 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.540
 mission as they would say week you turned the 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.760
 truck as it can be can not be no 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.320
 may be I also turn to see and 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.600
 I the motorcycles inside that will be 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.310
 I do not know, I 'm very intrigued by that 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.830
 I do not know what happened to them to see or 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.389
 models here to see to see 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.130
 today we are close u and it's good what
