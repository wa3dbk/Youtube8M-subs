00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.379
 Hello everyone and today we will analyze you 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.610
 again the song of the king and the jester 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:15.030
 which is called forest master song in 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.090
 principle is not difficult it can be collected as 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.100
 And on acoustics and on electro she 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.050
 sounds a and so and so basically 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.920
 ok i'll even show you two today 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:33.180
 options and how you like it so play 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.370
 there are only four chords in the song 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.239
 true two lines in a couplet which 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.010
 played on other chords but that's all 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.989
 little things 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.320
 Now I will show you first on 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.789
 electric guitar how it will sound 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:01:07.129
 and then on acoustics 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:01:07.129
 on the electric quinte same 5 again d5 and h5 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.350
 well played 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:43.580
 so the whole couplet is played 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:47.630
 on these four fifths and the chorus here 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.690
 add a couple more chords 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.100
 rather, they are not added but the eternal 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:58.150
 flour eternal boredom begins the refrain 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:05.710
 chord g and f sharp 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.710
 rather, 5 and f sharp 5 that is 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:22.100
 and further as the verse are all the same chords 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:26.300
 we go like there are all the spirits from the fairies now 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.330
 they gave yes without and they call me master 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.330

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.100
 that's all 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.860

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.330
