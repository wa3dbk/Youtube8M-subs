actually<00:00:41.380> a<00:00:41.440> fifth<00:00:41.620> fret<00:00:41.829> but<00:00:42.160> I'm<00:00:42.430> going<00:00:42.790> to

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
actually a fifth fret but I'm going to

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.010 
actually a fifth fret but I'm going to
say<00:00:43.090> 3<00:00:43.719> v<00:00:44.050> 2<00:00:44.500> 1<00:00:44.829> because<00:00:45.160> a<00:00:45.430> capo<00:00:46.420> raises<00:00:46.870> the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
say 3 v 2 1 because a capo raises the

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.730 
say 3 v 2 1 because a capo raises the
pitch<00:00:47.230> of<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:48.010> guitar<00:00:48.310> so<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:49.600> all<00:00:50.230> start<00:00:50.560> from

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
pitch of the guitar so it all start from

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.790 
pitch of the guitar so it all start from
this<00:00:51.280> red<00:00:51.490> so<00:00:51.670> this<00:00:51.820> is<00:00:51.970> first<00:00:52.500> when<00:00:53.500> I<00:00:53.530> say

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800
