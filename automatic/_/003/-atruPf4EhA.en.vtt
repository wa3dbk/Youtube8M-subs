00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Thank you so good and good night 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.270
 night to all the audience because without a doubt 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.250
 an unusual story a little one of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.840
 just two years old identified 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.940
 as an actress like cristal Rodríguez 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.219
 Gutierrez with address in the colony 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.170
 unfortunately independence 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.779
 when he was playing with a 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.180
 rabbit owned by its neighbor then 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.920
 unfortunately, this little animal 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.099
 bites the index finger of his hand 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.900
 left and it comes off almost 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.720
 completely unfortunately this 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.820
 little animal ate the finger and it was not 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.170
 possible to recover the piece for which 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.360
 He was taken to hospital area 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.559
 urgency and what called us a lot the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.510
 Attention is that despite this 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.370
 circumstance the little one was very 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.190
 calm entered the area immediately 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.660
 of cosmetic surgery of the zone hospital 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.700
 was treated by paramedics of the cross 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.989
 green of monterrey we did not have the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.539
 opportunity to practice with parents 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.949
 of family but what they mentioned to us 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.020
 the paramedics is that during the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.789
 The parents emphasized that the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.239
 minor was playing with these 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.160
 animals will appear two and then tried 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.940
 put it in its cage after playing and 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.940
 one of 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.560
 he was the one who attacked her unfortunately 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.659
 because as I repeat the piece was not 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.700
 possible to recover it but without a doubt it is a 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.400
 very unusual story and no doubt 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.290
 also the attitude of the little one very 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.840
 quiet very serene when entering the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.020
 hospital is area víctor cara there is little 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.940
 usual and also because yes surprising and 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.520
 unfortunate because at least you 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.670
 you expect an animal that for many people 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.229
 because it reflects tenderness and totally 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.440
 harmless some take it as a 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.360
 domestic animal although many children 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.240
 they have rabbits in their house but as 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.009
 all animals have reactions and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.429
 surely this was the case 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.380
 Unfortunately, this little girl loses 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.890
 suffers this amputation of one of his 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.869
 fingers 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.390
 Well, it will be necessary to see how you 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.520
 you mention it looks calm although that's 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.319
 abroad maybe worried or more 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.149
 very surprised by what I was 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.679
 happening you never imagine a situation 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.679
 like that juan carlos then
