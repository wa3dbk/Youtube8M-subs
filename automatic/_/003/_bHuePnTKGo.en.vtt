00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.220
 back that nintendo tÃ©rek has already been 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.220
 of last week often thursday 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.740
 nightly he gave us the truth is that we 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.480
 they presented interesting things although to 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.700
 Many people knew little but from 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.530
 after what there is no doubt is that 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.570
 Mario Kart 8 was one of the 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.199
 protagonists of that nintendo of air 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.880
 one of the titles without a doubt more 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.730
 Expected for your desktop console 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.150
 of nintendo and is that you already know that mario 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.010
 kart in wii made some pints 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.300
 spectacular with more than 30 million 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.880
 copies sold 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.829
 I wish I did something similar in wii and the 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.630
 truth is that it is impossible because 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.090
 you know that it does not reach wii or even 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.920
 to the 6 million consoles sold 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.399
 therefore it has it quite difficult 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.130
 but maybe with this Karl Kart 8 in 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.469
 many users consider buying and 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.530
 Acquire a good website attentive because 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.539
 with this news it would be confirmed that yes 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.820
 that there would be many users with said 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.160
 intention or at least acquire the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.800
 title after confirming that date of 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.200
 launch of mario kart 8 in all 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.470
 because it's global launch for the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.120
 next May 30 because the title has been 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.120
 become the most reserved of 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.310
 stores like japan amazon where it goes 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.500
 marketed from May 29 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.950
 after the announcement of its official date of 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.140
 launch the title of the game in 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.450
 question has risen to the most 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.730
 sold from the amazon list in its 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.740
 Japanese version or it is curious that 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.570
 also in Japan we had it hublot 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.480
 quite difficult I was not selling very 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.760
 Well, look at mario kart 8 what 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.610
 is passing the title you know you're going 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.340
 to have 12 career cards in all 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.580
 moment which also includes the mode 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.470
 Multiplayer online and local mode or 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.350
 it does not matter where you play if you play 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.780
 online or not what are you going to have 12 karts 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.490
 with which to compete in games in 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.650
 Online users can create their 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.840
 Own tournaments specify the rules 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.360
 of the competition and even share 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.130
 the best moments of his career in my 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.900
 see we are going to allow communication 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.690
 between users with several communities 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.160
 specific the game will be able to be played 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.190
 with the gamepad 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.370
 the remote wii use only the wii 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.470
 remote or also use that nunchaku and 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.470
 attentive this is very good the title is going to 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 operate at 60 frames per second and it 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.910
 is working so that in the mode 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.430
 split screen that rate of images 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.900
 per second is still maintained I think 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.480
 that they are going to have a little difficult but 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.300
 but hey they are trying it from 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.210
 then it is a joy to play mario kart 8 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.370
 in madrid 'game week we could try it and 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.110
 It looks excellent, I think it's going 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.480
 to be a game that can give a lot that 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.090
 talk and can give a good push to 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.470
 wii and it is not the typical phrase we say 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.780
 whenever there is an interesting title 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.940
 for wii one is that this time I think that 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.450
 with mario kart 8 yes they can do 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.450
 something good
