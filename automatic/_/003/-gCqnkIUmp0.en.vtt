design<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.880> my<00:00:36.059> head<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.540> think<00:00:36.719> about<00:00:36.840> how

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
design in my head so think about how

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.780 
design in my head so think about how
many<00:00:37.530> colors<00:00:37.829> you're<00:00:37.950> gonna<00:00:38.040> want<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.340> use<00:00:38.579> it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
many colors you're gonna want to use it

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.130 
many colors you're gonna want to use it
how<00:00:38.910> you're<00:00:39.030> gonna<00:00:39.090> space<00:00:39.450> them<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.020> then

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
how you're gonna space them out and then

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.420 
how you're gonna space them out and then
you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.320> always<00:00:40.500> tweak<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.010> little<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.250> at

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
you can always tweak it a little bit at

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.250 
you can always tweak it a little bit at
the<00:00:41.550> end<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.270> I'm<00:00:42.360> gonna<00:00:42.480> cut<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:42.750> piece<00:00:43.079> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the end so I'm gonna cut one piece of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.350 
the end so I'm gonna cut one piece of
yarn<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.710> 40<00:00:44.129> inches<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:44.940> measured<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
yarn to 40 inches and I just measured it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.569 
yarn to 40 inches and I just measured it
with<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> tape<00:00:45.780> measure<00:00:45.960> make<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.980> cut<00:00:47.190> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
with the tape measure make the cut this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.010 
with the tape measure make the cut this
piece<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.300> your<00:00:48.450> template<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
piece is going to be your template and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.630 
piece is going to be your template and
then<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.530> gonna<00:00:49.620> take<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.010> ball<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.280> yarn

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
then you're gonna take your ball of yarn

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.479 
then you're gonna take your ball of yarn
and<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.000> measure<00:00:51.449> another<00:00:52.020> piece<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:53.070> exact

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
and just measure another piece the exact

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.319 
and just measure another piece the exact
same<00:00:53.760> length<00:00:54.230> make<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> cut<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.829> then<00:00:56.329> continue

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
same length make a cut and then continue

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.139 
same length make a cut and then continue
to<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.809> until<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.550> many<00:00:59.820> pieces

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
