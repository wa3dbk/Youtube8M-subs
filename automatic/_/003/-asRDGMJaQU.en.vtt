battery charged the more you charge the

turn the gas motor on to charge it and
that's<00:02:52.489> going<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.790> kill<00:02:53.000> your<00:02:53.150> fuel<00:02:53.390> economy

that's going to kill your fuel economy

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.539 
that's going to kill your fuel economy
when<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.170> gas<00:02:54.350> motor<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.830> assisting<00:02:55.370> to

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
when the gas motor is assisting to

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.280 
when the gas motor is assisting to
charge<00:02:55.850> up<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.180> battery<00:02:56.480> when<00:02:56.750> it's<00:02:56.870> as<00:02:57.049> low

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
charge up the battery when it's as low

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.150 
charge up the battery when it's as low
as<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.799> is<00:02:58.160> right<00:02:58.430> about<00:02:58.640> now

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
as it is right about now

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.730 
as it is right about now
so<00:03:00.880> there's<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.720> hybrid<00:03:02.020> system<00:03:02.350> indicator

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
so there's the hybrid system indicator

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.530 
so there's the hybrid system indicator
