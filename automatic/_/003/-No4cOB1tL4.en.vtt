00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
me this is like the normal amount of

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.750 
me this is like the normal amount of
density<00:00:58.150> here<00:00:58.950> I'm<00:00:59.950> picking<00:01:00.250> up<00:01:00.310> everything

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
density here I'm picking up everything

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:11.660 
density here I'm picking up everything
Oh<00:01:05.340> what<00:01:06.340> another<00:01:06.759> pack<00:01:07.060> hmm<00:01:07.690> interesting

that's a little different maybe by mob

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.260 
that's a little different maybe by mob
density<00:01:17.920> they<00:01:18.160> just<00:01:18.369> increase<00:01:18.940> that<00:01:18.970> you

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
density they just increase that you

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.600 
density they just increase that you
leave<00:01:19.479> I<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:22.440> see<00:01:23.440> well<00:01:23.860> that's<00:01:24.070> two<00:01:24.280> pecks
