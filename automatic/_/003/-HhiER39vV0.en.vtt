00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 in the area and so he has here 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.660
 first time between the posts pierre 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.030
 kleinheider 23 years young new arrival from 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.410
 fsv frankfurt a look at the others 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.450
 ten hallens and we see one 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.799
 further change in comparison to 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.990
 unfortunate defeat at the last 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.060
 weekend toni schmid plays for akaki 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.619
 gogia who was sitting hurt 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.230
 but at least on the bank otherwise 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.420
 everything as usual in the 4-2-3-1 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.820
 a friendly look from the boss 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.680
 mood is right despite the zero so far 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.769
 points now but in a game 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.170
 the hfc in white-black from the right to 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.750
 on the left this is Brückmann Pia Merkel first 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.680
 minute first graduation hall works here 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.690
 at first not unsure what to do 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.770
 Holstein Kiel the unbeaten 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.500
 so far not much 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.100
 but that looks good 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.160
 kasper johannsen marc heider 108 minute 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.030
 first attack first goal goes already 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.660
 go again 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.760
 do not franc too late against heiduczek 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.710
 approach to ball height and pierre 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.700
 kleinheider does not really like that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.799
 off no errors 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.560
 but is energetic more purposeful 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.930
 maybe he could have done something 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.420
 if and but the hfc after a good start 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.200
 for the fourth time in the fourth game 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.200
 in residue 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.780
 all in a row without line without 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.860
 structure keel, however, not synonymous 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.860
 really glamorous 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.960
 yes merkel and there is just times 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.460
 nothing shooting technique posture everything 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.470
 lacking the new entry 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.600
 Brunswick is second division experienced there 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.690
 You can not expect more yet 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.180
 a lot to see but watch out 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.950
 this is again merkel similar situation 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.530
 and that is quite different 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.550
 there, please, it is such a scene that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.680
 will do him good 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.680
 quite clearly with the commitment of roy 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.330
 and in artificial first bank and so on 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.040
 The children's bank also sees it 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.119
 Karsten Neitzel is the one we know 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.940
 he used to be a player in hall 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.760
 next scene throw in keel fabian weather 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.180
 and the war flank character rafael 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.340
 kazior 35 minute latent danger for 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.380
 but pierre kleinheider has to intervene 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.830
 He does not see the big opportunities 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:31.230
 neither on one nor the other 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.940
 page just before halftime with hall 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.350
 Difficulties in playing the game too 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.739
 little movement without ball 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.739
 both full-backs completely without 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.739
 obviously 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.890
 division 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.750
 10 kiel so it goes logically in the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.270
 half time and it is a certain 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.720
 somehow note nervousness 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.550
 one or the other scene the second 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.770
 half hall has changed brückmann 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.520
 and bertram out pointer and google 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.360
 ready and the ex st paulianer 50 equals 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.820
 finally a 47 minute hfc apparently 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.970
 willing to put some deal here 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.170
 gogia in the offensive central midfield 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.350
 and then up to three minutes later 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.400
 Holstein thought faster pointer 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:28.350
 haider's asleep but this time sick 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.970
 time to ask sven köhler ago 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.280
 One and a half years ago there was a zero here 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.080
 to zero with wage field and linden tap are 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.990
 only two players left today 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.270
 then team on the field 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.290
 remarkable fluctuation next scene 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.810
 the streets again 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.159
 raßbach johannsen small most striking 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.159
 not dangerous then 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.680
 hour by now again 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:59.890
 We often try it fast 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.930
 and directly the hfc is completely different 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.450
 less and less none together 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.030
 play station no train to the goal toni 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:11.280
 lindenhahn unfortunately typical of this destination 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.410
 after 70 minutes the last change at 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.760
 every year for franke 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.639
 defender for defender 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.269
 not necessarily a signal in the direction 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.520
 circuit offensive and it starts the 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.070
 final quarter hour free kick maik 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.710
 wage field four merkel schmidt one 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:34.350
 step too late, at least there is a flash 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:36.570
 Something like torgefahr merkel with 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.240
 handsome header extension he 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.710
 one of the most striking but mostly in 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.280
 the air hangs back a minute later 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.220
 freistoss hfc again maik Wagenfeld and 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.680
 that is simply too little too of the 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:58.550
 captain pierre merkel only cares here 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.310
 sometimes for a graduation 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:07.400
 merkel now the vest when opa 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.400
 but that does not really matter today 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.430
 from holstein in the last few minutes 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.560
 not really seeing anything anymore 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.270
 they are definitely not an over-team 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.979
 marcel gebers one should 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.320
 actually have on the list 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:27.860
 the defender has been three times so far 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:29.960
 already so or similar affected show 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.910
 There are almost only scenes here 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.800
 daniel ziebig was still standing by 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.610
 one like him has to come more will 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.860
 even more dangerous is it 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.229
 one and a half two steps too late 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.020
 and still a few remain for the hfc 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.500
 minutes to at least one point 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.500
 rescue 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.630
 the guests meanwhile already long ago 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:00.530
 the break rod unpacked but so 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.810
 This is not really effective 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.120
 On the contrary kobia misunderstood for 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.870
 the choice thereby the possibilities for 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.000
 counter 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:13.910
 for the kieler and that is fast 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.039
 and here unfortunately for the first time so 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:22.389
 grab it right and that in minute 84 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.389
 Marcel then left the train again 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.860
 and meanwhile already the 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.650
 replay time is three minutes 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.720
 displayed keel with even more space 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.880
 Pierre Kleinheider took good care of her 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.860
 But Holstein stays on the ball 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.090
 You can now completely relax 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:49.199
 play again small unfortunately worked 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:49.199
 reaction the keeper the last hope 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.929
 and 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:58.199
 This spark is again a 

00:06:55.929 --> 00:07:03.459
 free kick last scene of the game 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:06.939
 pretty much blocked Google yes, too 

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:07.779
 the fourth game of fourth blows away 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:10.419
 defeat 

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:13.439
 Derrick sandwich with the protagonists 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:13.439
 a crisis
