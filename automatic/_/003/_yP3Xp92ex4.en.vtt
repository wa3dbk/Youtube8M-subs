00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 and a pollution problem 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.540
 allowed to start making paper to 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.540
 base of pineapple peels 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.340
 everything started as a challenge that a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.650
 Class teacher gave his students to 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.919
 solve a serious problem that affects the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.990
 environment after several attempts does 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.080
 almost two years relief and a companion 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.180
 they found the best solution very 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.309
 practical a problem that had the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.570
 waste of the pineapple peel and that 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.210
 has many consequences to the environment 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.149
 environment such as fly production 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.660
 that harms cattle acidification 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.490
 the floors because at the time of the sun 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.680
 give the husk is fermented and produces 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.540
 acids and the same company told us 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.130
 says we have this very strong problem of 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.250
 not knowing what to do with the shells of 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.190
 pineapple and well then investigating this 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.560
 we discovered how polluting they are and I 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.540
 commenting only in good classes because they 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.660
 he offered them the alternative that 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.220
 will look how to solve this problem 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.590
 help this student of the career of 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.899
 engineering in food industries in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.110
 the technological comalcalco and in 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.930
 principle he thought about making tepache but 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.569
 this did not solve the problem today with its 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.110
 project has already won the first place in 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.920
 innovate 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.869
 technology at the national level 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.930
 first what we collect all the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.549
 pineapple peel later the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.799
 we proceed to chop it up a bit to 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.960
 put it into what is a blender for 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.080
 make grinding from there easier 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.240
 we grabbed what is left we put it and what 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.130
 we put on a flat surface and then 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.259
 with a rolling pin, we're going 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.539
 giving it a washed shape 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.369
 during processing loses those 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.799
 sugars then no longer allows that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.509
 fermentation and it no longer contaminates both the 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.280
 environment then even if it were discarded 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.429
 this type of products no longer contaminates 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.619
 as he is biodegradable we are 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.409
 trying to use all natural the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.090
 dyes are natural additives 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.580
 that they think to put also go to 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.530
 being natural almost three months ago 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.259
 gave the task of preparing several 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.010
 products with paper to give you more 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.480
 value all that what you see and 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.430
 we elaborate it first 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.280
 we elaborate what is the flat sheet of 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.650
 once dry paper we proceed to give it 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.989
 the form either in some bag of 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.580
 good gift the picture frame then 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.660
 You can have it from a very 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.120
 thin 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.420
 almost like to write like this guy 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.500
 of recycled paper from other sources 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.260
 even thicker products the idea of 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.020
 Socorro and her teacher is that this is a 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.420
 commercial and profitable product with which 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.340
 In addition , jobs can be generated and 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.340
 better help our environment
