00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
on here well I've been researching it

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.339 
on here well I've been researching it
seems<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.239> it<00:02:17.390> only<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.870> does<00:02:18.049> something

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
seems like it only it does something

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.709

with like an AC 3 audio and MPEG 2
format<00:02:23.719> and<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.049> seems<00:02:24.319> like<00:02:24.590> I've<00:02:24.859> been

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
format and it seems like I've been

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.960 
format and it seems like I've been
research<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.340> has<00:02:25.549> been<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.819> most

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
research that has been the most

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.630 
research that has been the most
complicated<00:02:26.540> stuff<00:02:27.079> to<00:02:27.290> edit<00:02:27.439> it<00:02:28.159> seems<00:02:28.489> like

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
complicated stuff to edit it seems like
