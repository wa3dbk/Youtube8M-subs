00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
see how it is okay so I'll be the same

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.660 
see how it is okay so I'll be the same
thing<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:08.070> doing<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> other

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
thing that I was doing with the other

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.520 
thing that I was doing with the other
Steel's<00:01:09.090> we're<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> same<00:01:09.720> tuning<00:01:10.229> that

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
Steel's we're in the same tuning that

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.770 
Steel's we're in the same tuning that
open<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.220> tuning<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:13.610> I'll<00:01:14.610> run<00:01:14.970> through<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.600> I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
open a tuning and I'll run through as I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.749 
open a tuning and I'll run through as I
did<00:01:15.960> before<00:01:16.080> kind<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> tone<00:01:17.100> knob<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
did before kind of the tone knob and the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.450 
did before kind of the tone knob and the
volume<00:01:18.119> knob<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:19.460> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
volume knob so you can see the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.070 
volume knob so you can see the
difference<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> sounds<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.900> you'll

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
difference in the sounds and you'll

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.719 
difference in the sounds and you'll
notice<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.619> think<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.130> pickup<00:01:23.750> is<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> little

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
notice I think this pickup is a little

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.249 
notice I think this pickup is a little
lower<00:01:26.729> output<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.540> when<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> really<00:01:28.049> get<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
lower output so when I really get it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.410 
lower output so when I really get it
cranked<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.979> doesn't<00:01:29.159> distort<00:01:29.850> quite<00:01:30.210> in

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
cranked up it doesn't distort quite in

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.540 
cranked up it doesn't distort quite in
the<00:01:30.509> same<00:01:30.720> way<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.979> super

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
the same way as the super

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.480 
the same way as the super
and<00:01:32.730> the<00:01:32.910> chicago<00:01:33.420> steel<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.110> still<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.770> very

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and the chicago steel but still a very

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.690 
and the chicago steel but still a very
pleasing<00:01:35.850> sound<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> let's<00:01:37.860> see<00:01:38.070> let's<00:01:38.280> start

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
pleasing sound so let's see let's start

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.480 
pleasing sound so let's see let's start
with<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.480> tone<00:01:39.720> knob<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> way<00:01:40.890> cranked

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
with the tone knob all the way cranked

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.120 
with the tone knob all the way cranked
and<00:01:41.780> we'll<00:01:42.780> turn<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> volume<00:01:43.290> up<00:01:43.710> about<00:01:46.130> about

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and we'll turn the volume up about about

00:01:47.130 --> 00:03:26.129 
and we'll turn the volume up about about
a<00:01:47.160> third<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.760> way

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:04:22.430 

let's<00:03:27.139> try<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.379> volume<00:03:27.799> knob<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.010> little<00:03:28.310> bit

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.779 

yeah<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:23.560> sounds<00:04:23.860> nice<00:04:24.039> but<00:04:24.310> it<00:04:24.370> doesn't<00:04:24.669> have

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
yeah it sounds nice but it doesn't have

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.370 
yeah it sounds nice but it doesn't have
the<00:04:25.030> it's<00:04:25.300> kind<00:04:25.479> of<00:04:25.539> different<00:04:25.720> quality<00:04:26.350> to

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
the it's kind of different quality to

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.939 
the it's kind of different quality to
the<00:04:26.680> distortion<00:04:27.310> which<00:04:27.780> is<00:04:28.780> nice<00:04:29.080> about

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
the distortion which is nice about

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.940 
the distortion which is nice about
different<00:04:30.430> sounds
