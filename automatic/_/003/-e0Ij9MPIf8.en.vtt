00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
thing I like about the splash guard is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.130 
thing I like about the splash guard is
it<00:01:13.439> seals<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.159> entire<00:01:14.549> bowl<00:01:14.939> all<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.990> way

into while the mixer is running it has

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.460 
into while the mixer is running it has
12<00:01:32.040> variable<00:01:32.579> speeds<00:01:32.990> including<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.110> slow

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
12 variable speeds including a slow

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.039 
12 variable speeds including a slow
start<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.130> even<00:01:35.729> if<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.939> put<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.299> speed<00:01:36.659> 12

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
start so even if you put it on speed 12

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.710

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
to start it gradually works up to speed

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.649 
to start it gradually works up to speed
12<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.250> really<00:01:41.520> great<00:01:41.700> mixing<00:01:42.270> but

button to engage the countdown timer and
like<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.920> said<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.219> works<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.579> 15<00:01:56.880> minutes<00:01:57.149> all

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
like I said it works for 15 minutes all

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.719 
like I said it works for 15 minutes all
you<00:01:57.329> do<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.719> tap<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.979> set<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> time<00:01:59.549> that

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
you do is tap it to set the time that

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.499 
you do is tap it to set the time that
you<00:01:59.820> want<00:02:00.439> turn<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> machine<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.579> what

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
you want turn the machine on and what

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.660 
you want turn the machine on and what
it'll<00:02:03.659> do<00:02:03.899> it'll<00:02:04.380> start<00:02:04.680> counting<00:02:05.219> for<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
it'll do it'll start counting for you

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.160 
it'll do it'll start counting for you
and<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.119> if<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.360> two<00:02:06.479> mixer<00:02:06.810> say<00:02:06.990> like

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and so if you have two mixer say like

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.320 
and so if you have two mixer say like
four<00:02:07.439> minutes

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
four minutes

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.300 
four minutes
basically<00:02:08.870> what<00:02:09.290> will<00:02:09.440> happen<00:02:09.470> is<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.190> will

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
basically what will happen is it will

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.370 
basically what will happen is it will
shut<00:02:10.580> off<00:02:10.790> automatically<00:02:11.600> it'll<00:02:11.960> beat<00:02:12.110> five

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
shut off automatically it'll beat five

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.900 
shut off automatically it'll beat five
times<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.860> let<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.100> know<00:02:13.250> your<00:02:13.460> mixing<00:02:13.820> is

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
times to let you know your mixing is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.850 
times to let you know your mixing is
done<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.720> going<00:02:17.720> on<00:02:17.870> from<00:02:18.140> there<00:02:18.410> like<00:02:18.710> I<00:02:18.830> said

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
done so going on from there like I said

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.860 
done so going on from there like I said
we<00:02:19.130> have<00:02:19.280> 12<00:02:19.610> variable<00:02:20.090> speeds<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.720> can

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
we have 12 variable speeds so you can

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.830 
we have 12 variable speeds so you can
start<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.530> one<00:02:21.830> wild<00:02:22.430> limousines<00:02:22.970> I'm<00:02:23.360> running

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
start on one wild limousines I'm running

start on one wild limousines I'm running
and<00:02:23.990> you<00:02:24.050> can<00:02:24.080> go<00:02:24.230> all<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.500> way<00:02:24.680> up<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.980> 12<00:02:25.250> very

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
and you can go all the way up to 12 very

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.140 
and you can go all the way up to 12 very
very<00:02:25.850> easily<00:02:26.170> has<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.200> great<00:02:27.590> fold<00:02:28.010> feature<00:02:28.340> so

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
very easily has a great fold feature so

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.580 
very easily has a great fold feature so
if<00:02:29.240> you're<00:02:29.360> gonna<00:02:29.450> be<00:02:29.540> doing<00:02:29.930> really<00:02:30.080> delicate

things like whipping a cream and then

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.140 
things like whipping a cream and then
incorporating<00:02:34.040> something<00:02:34.340> into<00:02:34.820> it

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
incorporating something into it

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.180 
incorporating something into it
use<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.630> fold<00:02:35.870> feature<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.530> runs<00:02:36.890> on<00:02:37.070> the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
use the fold feature it runs on the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.880 
use the fold feature it runs on the
slowest<00:02:37.670> speed<00:02:37.970> available<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.110> what<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.770> will

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
slowest speed available and what it will

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.220 
slowest speed available and what it will
do<00:02:40.070> is<00:02:40.220> very<00:02:40.460> delicately<00:02:41.060> mix<00:02:41.420> by<00:02:41.720> turning

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
do is very delicately mix by turning

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.530 
do is very delicately mix by turning
around<00:02:42.320> about<00:02:42.920> one<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.700> half<00:02:43.880> times<00:02:44.210> and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
around about one and a half times and

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.260 
around about one and a half times and
then<00:02:45.200> stopping<00:02:45.590> automatically<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.030> can

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
then stopping automatically so you can

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.850 
then stopping automatically so you can
use<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.750> incorporate<00:02:48.290> ingredients

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
use that to incorporate ingredients

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.260 
use that to incorporate ingredients
together<00:02:49.040> when<00:02:49.550> it's<00:02:49.700> something<00:02:49.910> very
