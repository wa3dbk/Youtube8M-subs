00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 hello because of basil I 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.590
 it's a lot of that they left track 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.980
 They give wings to the bed is close I got off 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.309
 we are an android legacy and a video 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.960
 today we are going to bring a video about what 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.600
 better is with what happened device 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.449
 android which blocks is the program 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.500
 what it brings so that you can 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:08.800
 customize your your unlocking we're going 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:11.780
 to the menu we go here where it says they place 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.610
 and here you are loading 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.460
 and then here we have both what 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.290
 we have so are several 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.710
 now we are going to show you some 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.729
 blocks because he programmed to teach first 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.190
 this 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.200
 Starlight will apply me and it has 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.740
 applied now we press the button 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.740
 the blockade 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.450
 and we wait a moment for it to load 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.719
 the blockade we press again 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.060
 for example here is how they see means 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:47.700
 the hour in the blue color the way 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:51.180
 unlocking they do it for here then 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.759
 you unlock to go where 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.090
 you left but even messages you put 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.759
 this or calls and here we go to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.490
 unlock as you see we have the pattern 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.100
 you can also configure it now 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.360
 we go to the second place 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:14.080
 is this is called three of transforming van 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.770
 to apply all should find in 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.130
 the act and d 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.750
 there they are already in the act and of being 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.440
 in free where google play but 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.980
 off 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.250
 they saw is our channel this we already did 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.700
 a video of the best applications 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.930
 and we will leave it in the decision because 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.840
 They know that the good side is good from 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.200
 download it 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.410
 good as they see it in another way is like a 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.709
 triangle if you touch it and it opens 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.980
 as well as how this is put here 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.930
 is going to the mental and this to here to 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.360
 the call and then this for the 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.060
 unlocking if they touch it again because it 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.049
 closes the triangle again open it 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.049
 they put it here 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:12.190
 social as always on 4 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:13.720
 now at number one as it is on 3 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.670
 evo 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.040
 but may contain apply 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.920
 normally create the blockade 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.340
 we are a little bit to load the blockade 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.939
 they give it here as you see it is a robot 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.680
 android that is really cool 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.290
 this is for messages this for the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.079
 block where they were and put more if you 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.620
 keep pressed as he pulls his as his 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.890
 sword and here and if you throw it 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.209
 men and it's already unlocked 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:53.959
 and they block it in the only flaw of 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.959
 this blockage is that for example 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:04.400
 here is that if personal 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:07.190
 here the personal and then it is unlocked and 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.680
 it's a very big and good flaw this has 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.610
 been all in the best blocks for your 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.800
 Android device 2.3.4 or any 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.650
 we are legacy version we do not see as 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.430
 ment to leave your live and subscribe 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.430
 until next time
