00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
front to back and basically I should

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.569 
front to back and basically I should
tell<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.750> who<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> customer<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.590> well<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.369> by

tell you who the customer is well not by
name<00:01:29.990> but<00:01:32.600> there's<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.689> man<00:01:33.930> who's<00:01:34.170> building<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
name but there's a man who's building a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.249 
name but there's a man who's building a
new<00:01:34.890> maple<00:01:35.340> syrup<00:01:36.119> operation<00:01:36.869> here<00:01:37.170> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
new maple syrup operation here in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.940 
new maple syrup operation here in
Vermont<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:39.509> came<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> surprise<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.770> me

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
Vermont and it came as a surprise to me

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.210 
Vermont and it came as a surprise to me
that<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.090> evaporator<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.799> apparatus

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
that the evaporator or the apparatus

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.690 
that the evaporator or the apparatus
that<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:45.119> takes<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.170> SAP<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.710> boils<00:01:47.549> it

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
that actually takes the SAP and boils it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.620 
that actually takes the SAP and boils it
down<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.149> turns<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.540> into<00:01:48.630> syrup<00:01:50.450> gives<00:01:51.450> off

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
down and turns it into syrup gives off

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.840 
down and turns it into syrup gives off
no<00:01:51.659> heat<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> people<00:01:53.310> who<00:01:53.430> work<00:01:53.640> in

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
no heat so that the people who work in

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.469 
no heat so that the people who work in
the<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> structure<00:01:55.320> which<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.710> new<00:01:56.479> needed

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the in the structure which is new needed

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.429 
the in the structure which is new needed
a<00:01:57.600> source<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.290> heat<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.070> keep<00:01:59.219> warm<00:01:59.520> and

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
a source of heat to keep warm and

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.889 
a source of heat to keep warm and
basically<00:02:01.439> since<00:02:01.920> they<00:02:02.159> cut<00:02:02.460> wood<00:02:02.729> 36<00:02:03.540> inches

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
basically since they cut wood 36 inches

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.190 
basically since they cut wood 36 inches
long<00:02:04.170> for<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.920> evaporator<00:02:05.520> he<00:02:06.479> said<00:02:06.780> why<00:02:07.020> not

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
long for the evaporator he said why not

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.600 
long for the evaporator he said why not
build<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.530> stove<00:02:07.770> that'll<00:02:08.129> take<00:02:08.340> thirty

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
build a stove that'll take thirty

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.580 
build a stove that'll take thirty
six-inch<00:02:09.060> logs

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
six-inch logs

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.400 
six-inch logs
and<00:02:10.679> gives<00:02:11.340> out<00:02:11.550> lots<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.599> lots<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.959> radiant

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and gives out lots and lots of radiant

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.670 
and gives out lots and lots of radiant
heat<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:15.209> building<00:02:15.569> itself<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.170> opposed<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
heat the building itself is opposed to

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.550 
heat the building itself is opposed to
beam<00:02:16.950> structure<00:02:17.370> with<00:02:18.330> siding<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:18.989> but<00:02:19.349> no

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
beam structure with siding on it but no

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.580 
beam structure with siding on it but no
insulation<00:02:20.180> no<00:02:21.180> fancy<00:02:21.480> sheetrock<00:02:22.200> or<00:02:22.440> any

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
insulation no fancy sheetrock or any

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.780 
insulation no fancy sheetrock or any
sort<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.069> inside<00:02:23.550> wall<00:02:24.000> covering<00:02:24.569> and

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
sort of inside wall covering and

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.250 
sort of inside wall covering and
basically<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:28.140> want<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.440> be<00:02:28.560> able<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.890> stand<00:02:29.640> a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
basically you want to be able to stand a

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.540 
basically you want to be able to stand a
reasonable<00:02:31.260> distance<00:02:31.440> from<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.010> stove<00:02:32.310> and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
reasonable distance from the stove and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.380 
reasonable distance from the stove and
be<00:02:32.790> warm<00:02:33.060> no<00:02:33.569> matter<00:02:33.750> how<00:02:33.900> cold<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.470> outside

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
be warm no matter how cold it is outside

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.380 
be warm no matter how cold it is outside
so<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.599> was<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> solution<00:02:37.700> other<00:02:38.700> Elms<00:02:39.209> have

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
so this was the solution other Elms have

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.340 
so this was the solution other Elms have
been<00:02:39.540> built<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:40.080> size<00:02:40.319> before<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:42.350> they're

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
been built this size before and they're

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.770 
been built this size before and they're
often<00:02:43.530> end<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.640> workshops<00:02:45.360> or

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
often end up in in workshops or

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.500 
often end up in in workshops or
basements<00:02:46.530> or<00:02:46.760> spaces<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.910> are<00:02:48.030> incredibly

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
basements or spaces that are incredibly

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.920 
basements or spaces that are incredibly
difficult<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:49.260> heat<00:02:49.500> such<00:02:49.860> as<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.220> one<00:02:50.489> and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
difficult to heat such as this one and

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.440 
difficult to heat such as this one and
the<00:02:51.930> people<00:02:52.230> love<00:02:52.440> them<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.970> happy

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450
