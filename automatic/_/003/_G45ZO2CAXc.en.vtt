00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.960
 [Music] 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.360
 sinuses have cavities located in 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.910
 the thickness of the bones of the face each 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.360
 person has frontal sinuses of 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.720
 maxillary sinus sinus and mosaic and 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.519
 the deepest sinus pedneault id 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.980
 each of these spaces can be affected 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.550
 by infections of inflammations or 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.589
 tumors 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.300
 when we think about tumors we think 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.710
 cancer but fortunately there is 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.480
 not that there are also tumors 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.910
 totally benign that can 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.829
 interest the sinus canto tumor 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.050
 malignant well today she enjoys 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.239
 actual treatment protocols 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.890
 for certain pathologies and 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.140
 especially in the case of tumors 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.800
 benign surgery is needed as the 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.020
 best treatment 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.969
 surgery that tends to be less 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.629
 in less invasive going through the 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.129
 natural ways 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.890
 through the use of instruments 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.000
 endoscopic video 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.859
 we must know that once when we 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.420
 wanted to get inside his 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.980
 famous caves we were a Nazi 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.650
 it was necessary workers it was necessary to break 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.080
 the bones of the face either sends concealed 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.880
 under the gum is not even good 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.310
 trans facial and make scars 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.330
 unsightly on the face of our 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.939
 patients 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.000
 progress is video surgery 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.369
 endoscopic the benefits of course 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.290
 no scar secondly a very 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.270
 great precision of the gesture because the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.400
 surgeon follows the progression of 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.990
 surgical instruments on a monitor 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.720
 and today they are instructors 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.130
 High Definition 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.009
 other advantage we reduce the time 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.840
 operative since we no longer need to 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.000
 this time which was only an access road 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.549
 or in fact we did not operate 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.680
 just arrived at the place of evil 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.110
 now we are there directly by 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.880
 inside the dice the realization of a 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.310
 endoscopic video sinus surgery 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.140
 and delicate by the proximity of 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.060
 some noble organs like the eye and 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.649
 the brain located at one or two 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.090
 millimeters of sinus and moses by 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.040
 example one must be 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.619
 particularly vigilant when 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.070
 uses this procedure the pathology 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.300
 that affected this patient 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.649
 corresponds to a sad one ie 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.900
 will use the word tumors but this 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.750
 is not a tumor in the malignant sense of 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.520
 term is something benign but 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.370
 which is site 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.290
 a place difficult to access while 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.540
 what is black corresponds to a 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.330
 normal aeration of the sinus and there you 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.010
 see in this space between the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.620
 big brain and eye 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.260
 on this side there is gray this 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.360
 corresponds to this cystic formation 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.520
 which is called a moult caussels then 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.960
 the dangers there are two if there is a 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.910
 county extension of the eye 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.190
 it's the visual prognosis that's 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.010
 engaged of course and if there is a 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.790
 extension at the brain level this is the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.800
 life threatening 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.420
 it's exactly the same problem for 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.590
 the disease that to operate is the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.180
 why today we 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.850
 goes through said way 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.210
 nasal ando inside the nose and 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.290
 we do a video surgery 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.990
 endoscopic what we did 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.260
 it is therefore an opening of this pocket 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.510
 an emptying of this one ie one 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.000
 has totally emptied of its contents for 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.980
 prevent there being too much pressure 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.960
 important and who have just blown 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.360
 the bone and lead to complications that 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.610
 we talked rhino diseases 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.230
 infectious sinusal a real red dull 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.209
 tumors are developing 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.260
 growing due mainly to 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.130
 context changes 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.990
 environmental 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.610
 good hygiene of the nose and lanes 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.260
 respiratory as well as a good 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.270
 protection the ordination of products 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.100
 toxic allow however prevented 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.100
 complications related to these diseases
