it's the successor to the map to an
towers<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:24.220> mark<00:00:25.220> to<00:00:25.460> an<00:00:25.669> tau<00:00:25.939> was<00:00:26.390> phased<00:00:26.689> out

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
towers the mark to an tau was phased out

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.630 
towers the mark to an tau was phased out
in<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.349> sixties<00:00:27.949> and<00:00:28.099> this<00:00:28.249> came<00:00:28.489> into

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
in the sixties and this came into

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.040 
in the sixties and this came into
service<00:00:28.880> this<00:00:29.239> is<00:00:29.390> actually<00:00:29.689> one<00:00:29.839> of<00:00:29.869> the

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
service this is actually one of the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.470 
service this is actually one of the
prototypes<00:00:30.619> has<00:00:31.279> slight<00:00:31.669> differences<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:32.360> the

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
prototypes has slight differences to the

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.229 
prototypes has slight differences to the
production<00:00:32.810> models<00:00:33.609> so<00:00:34.609> what<00:00:34.760> war<00:00:34.940> was<00:00:35.120> it

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
production models so what war was it

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.150 
production models so what war was it
used<00:00:35.420> in<00:00:35.570> to<00:00:35.660> transport<00:00:36.079> tanks<00:00:36.379> then<00:00:36.530> it

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
used in to transport tanks then it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.729 
used in to transport tanks then it
actually<00:00:37.609> wasn't<00:00:37.760> used<00:00:38.120> in<00:00:38.329> any<00:00:38.510> war<00:00:38.809> its<00:00:39.109> most

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
actually wasn't used in any war its most

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.310

the trailer that it pulled could carry
up<00:00:44.660> to<00:00:44.840> 60<00:00:45.230> tons<00:00:45.500> it<00:00:46.399> was<00:00:46.730> too<00:00:47.000> wired<00:00:47.269> to<00:00:47.480> use<00:00:47.809> on

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
up to 60 tons it was too wired to use on

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.950 
up to 60 tons it was too wired to use on
the<00:00:48.199> roads<00:00:48.379> in<00:00:48.559> England<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.730> its<00:00:50.149> main<00:00:50.690> role

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
the roads in England so its main role

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.599 
the roads in England so its main role
was<00:00:51.199> actually<00:00:51.320> in<00:00:51.679> Germany<00:00:52.100> with<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.280> British

army of the ran I was it way then ticket
ports<00:00:55.670> on<00:00:55.789> in<00:00:55.879> 60<00:00:56.300> tons<00:00:56.559> all<00:00:57.559> equates<00:00:58.039> with

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
ports on in 60 tons all equates with

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.250 
ports on in 60 tons all equates with
each<00:00:58.519> trailer<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.089> tank<00:00:59.390> he<00:00:59.629> came<00:00:59.929> in<00:01:00.109> at<00:01:00.230> just

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
each trailer and tank he came in at just

over 120 tons the tractor unit on its

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.410 
over 120 tons the tractor unit on its
own<00:01:03.230> actually<00:01:03.620> wears<00:01:03.829> 30<00:01:04.159> tump<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.180> it's<00:01:05.300> quite

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
own actually wears 30 tump so it's quite

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.780 
own actually wears 30 tump so it's quite
a<00:01:05.480> big<00:01:05.660> beast<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.710> it's<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:07.070> diesel<00:01:07.250> engine

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
a big beast so and it's a diesel engine

a big beast so and it's a diesel engine
how<00:01:07.970> much<00:01:08.150> does<00:01:08.300> it<00:01:08.330> take<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.750> fill<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.050> tank

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
how much does it take to fill the tank

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.310 
how much does it take to fill the tank
up<00:01:09.440> then<00:01:09.620> this<00:01:10.610> one<00:01:10.940> holds<00:01:11.720> somewhere<00:01:12.140> in<00:01:12.230> the
