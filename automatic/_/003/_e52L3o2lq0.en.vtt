00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
server and the point of this server is

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.820 
server and the point of this server is
these<00:00:19.740> guys<00:00:20.010> all<00:00:20.460> came<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.830> recreated

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
all this and it's kind of sad but one

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.620 
all this and it's kind of sad but one
thing<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.130> should<00:01:14.310> probably<00:01:14.340> know<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.600> I

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
thing you should probably know is that I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.700 
thing you should probably know is that I
don't<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> very<00:01:16.560> good<00:01:16.799> computer<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:18.710> stuff

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
don't have a very good computer so stuff

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
don't have a very good computer so stuff
might<00:01:19.979> get<00:01:20.220> laggy<00:01:20.490> sometimes<00:01:21.180> because<00:01:21.420> these

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
might get laggy sometimes because these

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.160 
might get laggy sometimes because these
things<00:01:21.930> are<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.470> massive<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:25.020> know

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
things are just so massive and you know

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.499 
things are just so massive and you know

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
just bear with me I'm sorry I can't do

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.240 
just bear with me I'm sorry I can't do
anything<00:01:27.750> about<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.409> I've<00:01:28.500> tried<00:01:28.770> everything

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
anything about it I've tried everything

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.200 
anything about it I've tried everything
that<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.640> could<00:01:29.909> possibly<00:01:30.420> do<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.610> I<00:01:32.610> don't

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that I could possibly do and I don't

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.080 
that I could possibly do and I don't
know<00:01:33.509> eventually<00:01:33.990> it'll<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.740> okay<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.939> can

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
know eventually it'll be okay if I can

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.149 
know eventually it'll be okay if I can
get<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> better<00:01:36.479> computer<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.259> all<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.680> but

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
get a better computer and all that but

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.660 
get a better computer and all that but
as<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:39.150> right<00:01:39.329> now<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.960> does<00:01:40.729> fine<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:45.240> I

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
as of right now this does fine so but I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.950 
as of right now this does fine so but I
figured<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.210> would<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.570> make<00:01:48.780> this

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
figured that I would just make this

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.340 
figured that I would just make this
quick<00:01:49.170> little<00:01:49.409> video<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.720> some<00:01:51.720> people<00:01:52.049> like

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
quick little video and some people like

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.109 
quick little video and some people like
it<00:01:52.649> some<00:01:52.829> people<00:01:53.130> might<00:01:53.280> not<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it some people might not like it

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.350 
it some people might not like it
and<00:01:54.560> I'm<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.740> doing<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.159> laughs<00:01:56.430> I'm<00:01:57.119> just

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
and I'm not doing it laughs I'm just

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.719 
and I'm not doing it laughs I'm just
doing<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.930> I've<00:01:58.530> recorded<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> video<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.610> now

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
doing it I've recorded the video and now

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.149 
doing it I've recorded the video and now
I'm<00:01:59.820> just<00:01:59.969> going<00:02:00.180> back<00:02:00.360> over<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.829> next

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
I'm just going back over it but the next

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.950 
I'm just going back over it but the next
one<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> do<00:02:02.430> will<00:02:02.729> probably<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.360> live<00:02:03.600> where<00:02:03.930> I

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
one I do will probably be live where I

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
one I do will probably be live where I
can<00:02:04.170> actually<00:02:04.350> talk<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.740> lot<00:02:05.009> more<00:02:05.250> about<00:02:05.490> what

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
can actually talk a lot more about what

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.419 
can actually talk a lot more about what
