00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.559 

the<00:04:51.800> same<00:04:52.009> thing<00:04:52.039> you<00:04:52.460> adjust<00:04:52.910> you<00:04:53.180> go<00:04:53.330> down

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
the same thing you adjust you go down

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.680 
the same thing you adjust you go down
you<00:04:53.780> move<00:04:53.990> your<00:04:54.139> pic<00:04:54.349> to<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.620> D<00:04:54.800> string<00:04:55.690> and

you move your pic to the D string and

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.830 
you move your pic to the D string and
then<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:57.110> pick<00:04:57.349> with<00:04:57.620> your<00:04:57.770> fingers<00:04:58.840> less

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
then you pick with your fingers less

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.320 
then you pick with your fingers less
that<00:05:00.379> last<00:05:00.590> night<00:05:00.800> in<00:05:00.889> that<00:05:01.039> pool

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.170 

so<00:05:04.900> this<00:05:05.110> is<00:05:05.289> a<00:05:05.319> good<00:05:05.560> one<00:05:05.710> for<00:05:05.979> a<00:05:06.460> little<00:05:06.970> bit

so this is a good one for a little bit

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.330 
so this is a good one for a little bit
