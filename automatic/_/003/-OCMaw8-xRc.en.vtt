00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
nowadays hard to find those you know the

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.039 
nowadays hard to find those you know the
carbons<00:03:49.280> oh<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:52.040> by<00:03:52.820> 2<00:03:52.850> f.r<00:03:53.390> piece<00:03:53.630> glue

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
carbons oh and so I by 2 f.r piece glue

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.900 
carbons oh and so I by 2 f.r piece glue
it<00:03:54.170> together<00:03:54.320> so<00:03:54.920> it<00:03:55.070> comes<00:03:55.730> more<00:03:57.190> stiff<00:03:58.190> more

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
it together so it comes more stiff more

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.550 
it together so it comes more stiff more
harder<00:03:59.299> so<00:03:59.650> it<00:04:00.650> won't<00:04:00.950> break<00:04:01.690> if<00:04:02.690> you<00:04:03.290> play

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
harder so it won't break if you play

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.460 
harder so it won't break if you play
very<00:04:03.890> rough<00:04:04.190> very<00:04:04.519> rough<00:04:04.790> just<00:04:05.570> only<00:04:05.840> will

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
very rough very rough just only will

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.539 
very rough very rough just only will
break<00:04:06.680> ya<00:04:07.220> think<00:04:07.640> so<00:04:08.739> ok<00:04:09.739> let's<00:04:10.340> inside<00:04:12.549> sorry

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
becomes more stiff so it's not that easy

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
to bend and you won't pop out yeah

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.100 
to bend and you won't pop out yeah
that's<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.670> thing<00:04:58.840> so<00:05:00.070> look<00:05:01.070> at<00:05:01.430> it<00:05:01.870> yeah<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:02.900> do

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
that's the thing so look at it yeah I do

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.880 
that's the thing so look at it yeah I do
some<00:05:03.560> customized<00:05:04.630> some<00:05:05.630> customized<00:05:06.290> job<00:05:06.620> on

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
some customized some customized job on

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.870 
some customized some customized job on
this<00:05:07.550> car<00:05:08.180> so<00:05:08.990> it's<00:05:09.200> like<00:05:09.470> I<00:05:09.830> think<00:05:10.490> maybe<00:05:10.670> it's

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
this car so it's like I think maybe it's

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.040 
this car so it's like I think maybe it's
quite<00:05:11.150> light<00:05:11.600> I<00:05:12.160> still<00:05:13.160> have<00:05:13.340> an<00:05:13.460> OD<00:05:14.050> weight

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
quite light I still have an OD weight

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:25.470 
quite light I still have an OD weight
yet<00:05:15.350> so<00:05:16.330> yeah<00:05:19.960> okay<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:22.690> this<00:05:23.690> thing<00:05:24.200> it<00:05:25.040> quite

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
yet so yeah okay and this thing it quite

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.760 
yet so yeah okay and this thing it quite
hard<00:05:26.800> stiff<00:05:27.800> so<00:05:28.430> it's<00:05:28.610> not<00:05:28.760> easily<00:05:29.120> break

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
hard stiff so it's not easily break

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.460 
hard stiff so it's not easily break
because<00:05:30.770> it<00:05:30.980> got<00:05:31.160> carbons<00:05:31.790> fr<00:05:32.630> piece<00:05:32.930> I<00:05:33.230> think

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
because it got carbons fr piece I think

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.160 
because it got carbons fr piece I think
it's<00:05:33.620> supported<00:05:34.160> very<00:05:34.430> well<00:05:34.640> and<00:05:34.940> I<00:05:35.270> do<00:05:35.780> cook

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
it's supported very well and I do cook

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.310 
it's supported very well and I do cook
some<00:05:36.470> glues<00:05:36.950> here<00:05:37.460> to<00:05:37.760> support<00:05:38.000> it<00:05:38.270> more<00:05:39.110> nicer

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
some glues here to support it more nicer

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.860 
some glues here to support it more nicer
and<00:05:40.360> copper<00:05:41.360> terminals<00:05:42.320> I<00:05:43.630> don't<00:05:44.630> really

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
and copper terminals I don't really

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.370 
and copper terminals I don't really
suggest<00:05:45.380> to<00:05:45.860> buy<00:05:46.070> go<00:05:46.520> terminals<00:05:47.090> costs<00:05:47.660> go

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
suggest to buy go terminals costs go

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.850 
suggest to buy go terminals costs go
