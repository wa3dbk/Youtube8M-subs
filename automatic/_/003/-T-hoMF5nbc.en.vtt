00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.250
 Friday in Jordanian camps 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.500
 it is worth to us which 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.929
 differential that this new 2014 line and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:19.619
 philips tvs offer good morning good staff 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:22.500
 here is a tv philips 7 383 she tvs mars 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.560
 anguilla of works in the platform 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.630
 smart specifically tells us search 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.539
 bring a spokesperson for the UN today or 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.899
 have a great interaction with the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.270
 online environment islate environment and the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.030
 score without leaving the simplest 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.760
 possible more streamlined practical 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.230
 navigation between jota quest content and 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.500
 online content 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.270
 and we seek to bring services beyond 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.520
 to give the full range of applications that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.980
 They offer the program content 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.820
 we are looking for the services we 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.750
 focus on the convenience of accessing the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.670
 content year 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.530
 then this is for example a 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.989
 application that we launched at the end 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.220
 last year in the strongly present 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.830
 I would not want to October 14 efe from 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.890
 who is it brings to the consumer the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.920
 possibility to watch TV and linear 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.700
 I live using only your tv and band 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.439
 long 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.159
 so in this case here we are seeing 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.140
 these buttons are the channels 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.130
 you can select according to your 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.960
 preference 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.520
 currently we have on the platform 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.869
 world we have more than 1,000 channels 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.119
 already integrated 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.009
 then we are negotiating some 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.890
 local partnerships also obviously 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.420
 bring channels to places that the consumer 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.670
 currently we on those channels 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.189
 international relations, there is a 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.250
 these national channels you fiddle March 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.960
 this year, the initial forecast is 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.950
 Obviously it 's a new service, it's a 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.670
 new concept 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.820
 cm 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.330
 this proposal if you remove 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.979
 basically use the smartphone 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.009
 a quality broadband exists 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.060
 any kind of channel then I advise you to 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.030
 work and also from the providers' 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.799
 offer real interest 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.479
 she has advanced talks to 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.000
 Growing up in Brazil 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.080
 what you see channels the full range of 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.819
 channel 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.890
 the consumer chooses and access to the magazine 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.209
 if you have a menu it will be that you 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.580
 have all the channels 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.470
 you can bookmark favorite channels to 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.080
 difference between free and paid 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.640
 and here you have the operators are 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.540
 seeing that I'm browsing using with 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.360
 the Internet 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.069
 it was integrated in the same series 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.670
 below the remote control in the country and 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.230
 Death here and that has a cut on keyboard 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.410
 back also to facilitate 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.410
 typing
