00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
kind of an idea of roughly see if you

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.160 
kind of an idea of roughly see if you
get<00:01:08.100> some<00:01:08.280> kind<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.490> coordinates<00:01:08.970> over<00:01:09.930> our

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
get some kind of coordinates over our

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.260 
get some kind of coordinates over our
mat<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:11.280> kind<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.640> know<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:12.060> kind<00:01:12.150> of

mat it's kind of you know it's kind of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.609 
mat it's kind of you know it's kind of
hard<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> tell<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.840> these<00:01:12.960> events<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.439> we're

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
hard to tell at these events but we're

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.789 
hard to tell at these events but we're
closer<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> front<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.530> what's<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.740> on

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.859 
wonder what expel stealth looks like
this<00:02:03.369> is<00:02:03.520> something<00:02:04.210> that<00:02:04.240> basically<00:02:04.570> takes

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
this is something that basically takes

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.389 
this is something that basically takes
the<00:02:06.390> gloss<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:08.229> can<00:02:08.319> see<00:02:08.500> there<00:02:08.709> takes

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
the gloss that you can see there takes

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.080 
the gloss that you can see there takes
the<00:02:09.489> gloss<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:10.149> turns<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.869> into<00:02:10.959> a<00:02:11.940> more<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:13.060> a

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
the gloss and turns it into a more of a

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.180 
the gloss and turns it into a more of a
satin<00:02:13.660> that's<00:02:14.260> more<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.650> finish<00:02:15.040> that

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190
