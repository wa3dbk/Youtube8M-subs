00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
puddle

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.479 
puddle
and<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.569> ground<00:02:17.890> from<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.010> puddle<00:02:19.280> shift

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
and the ground from the puddle shift

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.330 
and the ground from the puddle shift
system<00:02:19.879> I've<00:02:20.540> just<00:02:20.750> wired<00:02:21.019> temporarily<00:02:21.980> into

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
system I've just wired temporarily into

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.280 
system I've just wired temporarily into
the<00:02:22.430> ground<00:02:22.700> for<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.900> cigarette<00:02:24.260> lighter

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
the ground for the cigarette lighter

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.770 
the ground for the cigarette lighter
doesn't<00:02:25.159> matter<00:02:25.459> which<00:02:25.610> ground<00:02:25.940> schuster

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
doesn't matter which ground schuster

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.440 
doesn't matter which ground schuster
ground<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.500> complete<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:27.860> circuit<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:29.269> I'm

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
ground to complete the circuit so I'm

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:39.650 
ground to complete the circuit so I'm
going<00:02:29.629> to<00:02:29.659> start<00:02:29.870> my<00:02:29.989> car

now I'm going to demonstrate using the

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.530 
now I'm going to demonstrate using the
paddle<00:03:11.170> shift<00:03:11.640> I'm<00:03:12.640> going<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:12.970> go<00:03:13.090> into<00:03:13.270> 2<00:03:15.150> 3<00:03:16.150> 4

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
paddle shift I'm going to go into 2 3 4

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.520 
paddle shift I'm going to go into 2 3 4
&amp;<00:03:16.900> 5

&amp; 5
it<00:03:18.340> goes<00:03:18.490> back<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.820> 1<00:03:18.970> because<00:03:19.210> obviously<00:03:19.330> I'm

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
it goes back to 1 because obviously I'm

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.000 
it goes back to 1 because obviously I'm
not<00:03:19.750> moving<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.200> that's<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.470> best<00:03:20.620> gift<00:03:20.860> for

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
not moving and that's the best gift for

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.760 
not moving and that's the best gift for
the<00:03:21.430> Jakarta<00:03:21.760> driving<00:03:22.240> what<00:03:23.200> I'm<00:03:23.410> going<00:03:23.620> to

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
the Jakarta driving what I'm going to

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.770 
the Jakarta driving what I'm going to
show<00:03:24.610> you<00:03:25.140> 1<00:03:26.140> 2<00:03:26.980> 3<00:03:27.640> 5

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
there you go and back to 1 because it's

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.400 
there you go and back to 1 because it's
detecting<00:03:31.930> now<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.960> normal<00:03:34.960> manual<00:03:35.230> mode

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
detecting now the normal manual mode

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.600 
detecting now the normal manual mode
still<00:03:35.650> work<00:03:35.800> so<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:36.070> can<00:03:36.220> go<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:39.310> can<00:03:39.459> hear<00:03:39.550> the

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
still work so I can go you can hear the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.470 
still work so I can go you can hear the
clicks<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:42.580> can<00:03:42.700> go<00:03:42.790> down<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:43.150> gear<00:03:43.300> box

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
clicks and I can go down the gear box

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.370 
clicks and I can go down the gear box
using<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.320> shifter<00:03:45.070> so<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.670> all<00:03:45.790> still<00:03:46.090> works

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
using the shifter so it all still works

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:54.140 
using the shifter so it all still works
but<00:03:47.380> now<00:03:47.620> we've<00:03:48.190> got<00:03:48.370> paddle<00:03:48.700> shift<00:03:50.190> yeah<00:03:51.190> so

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.790 

see<00:03:55.150> if<00:03:55.240> I<00:03:55.300> can<00:03:55.450> move<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.750> across<00:03:55.840> okay<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:56.590> I've

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
see if I can move it across okay so I've

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.630 
see if I can move it across okay so I've
got<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:56.920> paddle<00:03:57.220> shift<00:03:57.400> here<00:03:57.580> so<00:03:57.850> ready<00:03:58.140> 2<00:03:59.140> 3<00:03:59.980> 4

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
got the paddle shift here so ready 2 3 4

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.010 
got the paddle shift here so ready 2 3 4
5<00:04:01.420> about<00:04:02.320> 2<00:04:02.470> 1<00:04:02.620> pitch<00:04:02.800> that's<00:04:03.130> right<00:04:03.280> once<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:04.360> 1

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
5 about 2 1 pitch that's right once so 1

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.710 
5 about 2 1 pitch that's right once so 1
2<00:04:06.239> that's<00:04:07.239> why

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
2 that's why

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.900 
2 that's why
so<00:04:08.020> that's<00:04:08.320> paddle<00:04:08.590> shift<00:04:08.770> working<00:04:08.950> on<00:04:09.430> an<00:04:09.610> L<00:04:09.700> 3

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
so that's paddle shift working on an L 3

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:18.060 
so that's paddle shift working on an L 3
3<00:04:10.120> 2<00:04:10.390> 2<00:04:10.420> L<00:04:11.050> 3<00:04:11.110> 2<00:04:11.560> 2<00:04:11.800> early<00:04:12.730> Range<00:04:12.940> Rover<00:04:16.169> is<00:04:17.169> 2003
