00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.420 
smoother and it's open an application
simply<00:03:41.329> highlight<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.480> tap<00:03:42.750> on<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.430> it

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
simply highlight it tap on it and it

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.620 
simply highlight it tap on it and it
opens<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.910> up<00:03:47.030> alright<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.209> there<00:03:48.359> was<00:03:48.480> our

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
opens it up alright so there was our

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.360 
opens it up alright so there was our
weather<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.530> then<00:03:49.650> against<00:03:49.859> sliding<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.280> down

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
weather and then against sliding it down

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.710 
weather and then against sliding it down
will<00:03:50.519> close<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.880> now<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.060> can<00:03:51.180> also<00:03:51.329> open<00:03:51.630> it

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
will close it now you can also open it

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.690 
will close it now you can also open it
up<00:03:51.810> part<00:03:52.019> way<00:03:52.200> if<00:03:52.320> you'd<00:03:52.470> like<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:53.489> again

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
up part way if you'd like and again

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.670 
up part way if you'd like and again
still<00:03:53.820> scroll<00:03:54.269> between<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.750> different<00:03:55.140> menus

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
still scroll between the different menus

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.900 
still scroll between the different menus
so<00:03:55.829> if<00:03:55.920> you've<00:03:56.040> got<00:03:56.069> your<00:03:56.340> top<00:03:56.579> four

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
so if you've got your top four

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.180 
so if you've got your top four
applications<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.720> typically<00:03:58.170> use<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:59.040> can

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
applications you typically use you can

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.410 
applications you typically use you can
set<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.459> up<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.609> this<00:03:59.730> and<00:03:59.910> leave<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.299> like

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
set it up like this and leave it like

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.449 
set it up like this and leave it like
that<00:04:00.450> as<00:04:00.750> well<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.230> there's<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.100> look<00:04:02.250> at<00:04:02.340> the
