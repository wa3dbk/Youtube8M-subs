00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.480 
think educating people about Ramadan you
know<00:02:46.080> I'm<00:02:46.170> fasting<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.770> always<00:02:47.070> answer<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
question about why am I not drinking

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.570 
question about why am I not drinking

education<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:51.150> important<00:02:51.600> but<00:02:52.130> decorations

education is important but decorations

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.740 
education is important but decorations
and<00:02:53.610> trying<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.000> impose<00:02:54.270> sort<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.690> a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
and trying to impose sort of a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.020 
and trying to impose sort of a
celebratory<00:02:55.140> phenomena<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.100> think<00:02:56.580> crosses

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
celebratory phenomena I think crosses

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.090 
celebratory phenomena I think crosses
the<00:02:57.150> line<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.530> church<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.680> state<00:02:58.740> not<00:02:59.040> to

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
the line of church and state not to

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.160 
the line of church and state not to
mention<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.610> in<00:02:59.940> Muslim<00:03:00.510> societies<00:03:01.050> we

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
mention that in Muslim societies we

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.930 
mention that in Muslim societies we
certainly<00:03:01.440> celebrate<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.160> end<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.430> Ramadan

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940

with<00:03:03.150> during<00:03:03.390> Ramadan<00:03:03.810> actually<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.410> think

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
with during Ramadan actually I think

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.530 
with during Ramadan actually I think
what's<00:03:04.980> happening<00:03:05.430> here<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.820> have<00:03:06.030> and
