decisions with a team you know obviously

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.209 
decisions with a team you know obviously
with<00:01:52.240> lukey<00:01:52.659> burges<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.229> know<00:01:53.319> we'll<00:01:53.829> make<00:01:54.159> a

with lukey burges you know we'll make a

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.010 
with lukey burges you know we'll make a
decision<00:01:54.399> of<00:01:54.639> the<00:01:54.700> back<00:01:54.819> in<00:01:54.939> avoid<00:01:55.179> your

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.309 
support is really getting behind our
team<00:01:57.999> and<00:01:58.149> i<00:01:58.179> think<00:01:58.359> the<00:01:58.450> boys<00:01:58.630> are<00:01:58.779> benefiting

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
team and i think the boys are benefiting

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.769 
team and i think the boys are benefiting
from<00:01:59.439> it<00:01:59.560> without<00:02:00.219> a<00:02:00.399> dad<00:02:00.579> Ella<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:01.479> support

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:01.779 
from it without a dad Ella the support

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:03.059 
from it without a dad Ella the support
that<00:02:01.840> we<00:02:01.899> get<00:02:02.109> particularly<00:02:02.499> at<00:02:02.590> home<00:02:02.740> is

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
that we get particularly at home is

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.379 
that we get particularly at home is
great<00:02:03.340> now<00:02:03.549> and<00:02:03.579> we're<00:02:03.819> looking<00:02:04.149> forward<00:02:04.299> to

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
and he's been showing that on the park

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.780 
and he's been showing that on the park
you<00:04:06.590> know<00:04:06.680> each<00:04:06.830> game<00:04:07.069> he's<00:04:07.220> taking<00:04:07.520> small

you know each game he's taking small

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.250 
you know each game he's taking small
steps<00:04:07.880> forward<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:08.900> know<00:04:08.959> it's<00:04:09.110> really

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
steps forward and you know it's really

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.540

really drawing the team around the park

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.400 
really drawing the team around the park
so<00:04:10.730> I<00:04:10.760> think<00:04:10.970> at<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.720> moment<00:04:11.750> he's<00:04:12.200> very

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
so I think at the moment he's very

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.539 
so I think at the moment he's very
comfortable<00:04:12.770> in<00:04:12.860> that<00:04:12.890> position

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.270 

oh<00:04:16.720> I<00:04:17.720> think<00:04:17.900> it's<00:04:18.019> very<00:04:18.409> important<00:04:18.829> I<00:04:18.949> think

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
oh I think it's very important I think

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.219 
oh I think it's very important I think
yeah<00:04:19.430> from<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.699> weekend<00:04:20.090> we<00:04:20.239> had<00:04:20.269> a<00:04:20.690> reunion

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
yeah from the weekend we had a reunion

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.839 
yeah from the weekend we had a reunion
and<00:04:21.590> it<00:04:21.829> was<00:04:21.919> no<00:04:22.009> way<00:04:22.099> up<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.310> 300<00:04:22.699> players

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
and it was no way up to 300 players

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.999 
and it was no way up to 300 players
coming<00:04:23.210> back<00:04:23.659> to<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.810> reunion<00:04:23.990> so<00:04:24.470> now<00:04:24.949> the

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
coming back to a reunion so now the

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.420 
coming back to a reunion so now the
history<00:04:25.310> plays<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.520> big<00:04:25.729> part<00:04:25.759> in<00:04:26.090> my

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
history plays a big part in my

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.770 
history plays a big part in my
department<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.490> obviously<00:04:29.060> coaching<00:04:29.449> and<00:04:29.599> I

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
department of obviously coaching and I

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.119 
department of obviously coaching and I
think<00:04:30.259> the<00:04:30.319> players<00:04:30.500> themselves<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:31.099> know

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
think the players themselves you know

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:32.499 
think the players themselves you know
we're<00:04:31.460> very<00:04:31.639> lucky<00:04:31.759> with<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.060> facility<00:04:32.240> we

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
got with a lot of history around us and

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.649

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.110 
as airline injured player so you know
Troy<00:04:57.069> is<00:04:57.190> doing<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.400> great<00:04:57.550> job

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.450 

oh<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:04.260> intensities<00:05:04.740> of<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.919> game<00:05:05.070> for<00:05:05.310> 80

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
oh the intensities of the game for 80

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.159 
oh the intensities of the game for 80
minutes<00:05:05.550> is<00:05:05.940> definitely<00:05:06.300> one<00:05:06.389> of<00:05:06.419> them<00:05:06.540> yeah

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
minutes is definitely one of them yeah

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.780 
minutes is definitely one of them yeah
the<00:05:07.290> concentration<00:05:07.949> across<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.250> game<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:08.729> know

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
the concentration across a game you know

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.790 
the concentration across a game you know
as<00:05:08.910> always<00:05:09.180> a<00:05:09.419> big<00:05:09.750> part<00:05:09.990> in<00:05:10.110> you<00:05:10.229> know<00:05:10.290> I<00:05:10.320> see

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
as always a big part in you know I see

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.080 
as always a big part in you know I see
us<00:05:10.919> taking<00:05:11.250> message<00:05:11.520> steps<00:05:11.760> forward

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
us taking message steps forward

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.939 
us taking message steps forward
particularly<00:05:12.690> as<00:05:12.960> last<00:05:13.169> two<00:05:13.320> weeks<00:05:13.530> for<00:05:13.740> that

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
particularly as last two weeks for that

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.670 
particularly as last two weeks for that
so<00:05:14.160> that's<00:05:14.850> that's<00:05:15.270> a<00:05:15.389> big<00:05:15.540> part<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.020> guess

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
so that's that's a big part and I guess

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.189 
so that's that's a big part and I guess
probably<00:05:16.860> their<00:05:17.100> defense<00:05:17.460> you<00:05:17.729> know<00:05:17.820> it<00:05:17.940> was<00:05:18.060> a

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
probably their defense you know it was a

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.030 
probably their defense you know it was a
spoken<00:05:19.199> about<00:05:19.290> through<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:19.680> week<00:05:19.800> from<00:05:19.949> the

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
spoken about through the week from the

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.860 
spoken about through the week from the
pliers<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.580> even<00:05:20.790> after<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.120> game<00:05:21.300> that<00:05:21.330> you

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
pliers and even after the game that you

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.420 
pliers and even after the game that you
know<00:05:21.960> we<00:05:22.080> need<00:05:22.229> to<00:05:22.350> toughen<00:05:22.770> up<00:05:22.979> in<00:05:23.100> that<00:05:23.220> area

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
know we need to toughen up in that area

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.860 
know we need to toughen up in that area
defensively<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.389> making<00:05:24.630> sure<00:05:24.720> we're<00:05:24.840> not

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
defensively and making sure we're not

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:32.210 
defensively and making sure we're not
leaking<00:05:24.960> too<00:05:25.260> many<00:05:25.440> points

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220
