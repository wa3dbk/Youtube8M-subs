more years so my priorities try to play
as<00:02:24.920> long<00:02:24.980> as<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.400> can<00:02:25.610> my<00:02:26.120> career<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.690> if<00:02:26.900> that

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
as long as I can my career and if that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.229 
as long as I can my career and if that
makes<00:02:27.920> me<00:02:28.870> lose<00:02:29.870> maybe<00:02:30.860> some<00:02:31.099> tournament<00:02:31.550> to

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
makes me lose maybe some tournament to

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.699 
makes me lose maybe some tournament to
protect<00:02:32.630> my<00:02:32.959> health<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.590> in<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:35.150> know<00:02:35.680> from<00:02:36.680> a

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
protect my health and in you know from a

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.020 
protect my health and in you know from a
consequence<00:02:37.220> here<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.580> will<00:02:37.700> have<00:02:37.850> less

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
consequence here you will have less

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.059 
consequence here you will have less
chances<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.480> be<00:02:38.630> in<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.350> top<00:02:39.530> positions<00:02:39.950> of

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
chances to be in the top positions of

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.530 
chances to be in the top positions of
the<00:02:40.160> ranking<00:02:40.549> so<00:02:40.819> it's<00:02:41.000> something<00:02:41.299> that<00:02:41.390> is

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
the ranking so it's something that is

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.259 
the ranking so it's something that is
not<00:02:41.569> worries<00:02:42.049> no<00:02:42.830> worries<00:02:42.860> much<00:02:43.340> for<00:02:43.489> me<00:02:43.580> I<00:02:43.910> I

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
not worries no worries much for me I I

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.050 
not worries no worries much for me I I
have<00:02:44.900> been<00:02:45.049> in<00:02:45.200> top<00:02:46.160> two<00:02:46.370> positions<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
have been in top two positions of the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.610 
have been in top two positions of the
ranking<00:02:47.390> for<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.569> lot<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:47.840> years<00:02:48.080> in<00:02:48.230> my<00:02:48.350> career

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
ranking for a lot of years in my career

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.160 
ranking for a lot of years in my career
so<00:02:49.100> it's<00:02:49.370> something<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:49.940> is<00:02:50.150> not<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.330> priority

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
so it's something that is not a priority

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.699 
so it's something that is not a priority
