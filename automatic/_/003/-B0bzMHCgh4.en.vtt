00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
might actually say that somewhere but

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.230 
might actually say that somewhere but
right<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:43.649> really<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.579> small<00:01:44.850> phone<00:01:45.090> it

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
right here really really small phone it

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.240

those obviously you're almost perfectly

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.460 
those obviously you're almost perfectly
one-to-one<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.899> all<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.140> your<00:01:55.229> movements

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
actually playing it I will get to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.009 
actually playing it I will get to
pricing<00:02:19.890> information<00:02:20.400> probably<00:02:21.120> towards<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
pricing information probably towards the

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.979 
pricing information probably towards the
end<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.590> video<00:02:22.830> but<00:02:23.489> this<00:02:23.700> one<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.569> not

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
end of the video but this one it's not

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.259 
end of the video but this one it's not
full<00:02:25.769> price<00:02:26.069> right<00:02:26.250> now<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.790> shouldn't<00:02:27.120> be

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
full price right now and it shouldn't be

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.330 
full price right now and it shouldn't be
because<00:02:27.450> really<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.500> Wii<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.950> actually

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
because really with the Wii it actually

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.509 
because really with the Wii it actually
did<00:02:29.519> come<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:30.209> free<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.840> for<00:02:31.800> free<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.040> mean<00:02:32.190> it

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
did come for free and for free I mean it

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.880 
did come for free and for free I mean it
came<00:02:32.700> bundled<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.480> with<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.050> Wii<00:02:34.230> console

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
came bundled in with the Wii console

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.990 
came bundled in with the Wii console
whenever<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.310> bought<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.880> was<00:02:35.910> a

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
whenever you bought it and it was a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.789 
whenever you bought it and it was a
really<00:02:36.209> smart<00:02:36.690> idea<00:02:36.870> for<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.200> Nintendo<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.650> do

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
really smart idea for a Nintendo to do

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.860 
really smart idea for a Nintendo to do
something<00:02:38.099> like<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.910> almost<00:02:39.239> like<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
something like that it's almost like the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.839 
something like that it's almost like the
Nintendo<00:02:40.049> land<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.709> last<00:02:40.920> generation<00:02:41.129> and

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
Nintendo land of last generation and

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.699 
Nintendo land of last generation and
when<00:02:42.269> they<00:02:42.360> did<00:02:42.569> do<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.080> actually<00:02:43.500> made

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
when they did do that it actually made

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.830 
when they did do that it actually made
Wii<00:02:43.890> Sports<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.310> think<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.910> best<00:02:45.150> selling<00:02:45.630> game

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
Wii Sports I think the best selling game

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.600 
Wii Sports I think the best selling game
of<00:02:46.080> all<00:02:46.200> time<00:02:46.530> because<00:02:46.769> it's<00:02:47.099> considered<00:02:47.430> a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
of all time because it's considered a

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.160 
of all time because it's considered a
game<00:02:47.790> sold<00:02:48.120> even<00:02:48.540> though<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.870> was<00:02:48.959> actually

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
game sold even though it was actually

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.110 
game sold even though it was actually
just<00:02:50.010> coming<00:02:50.220> with<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.430> console<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.000> I'm

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
it I really do like the design of that

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.379 
it I really do like the design of that
so<00:05:01.919> now<00:05:02.040> pricing<00:05:02.610> information<00:05:02.850> and<00:05:03.270> how<00:05:03.360> you

so now pricing information and how you

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.000

interested<00:05:05.430> in<00:05:05.490> picking<00:05:05.790> it<00:05:05.880> up<00:05:06.229> right<00:05:07.229> now<00:05:07.290> in

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
interested in picking it up right now in

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.210 
interested in picking it up right now in
stores<00:05:08.070> in<00:05:08.400> Canada<00:05:08.669> I<00:05:09.030> believe<00:05:09.360> it's<00:05:09.510> actually

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
stores in Canada I believe it's actually

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.560 
stores in Canada I believe it's actually
$45<00:05:11.220> which<00:05:11.430> sounds<00:05:11.790> like<00:05:11.850> it's<00:05:12.000> a<00:05:12.060> full<00:05:12.270> price

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
$45 which sounds like it's a full price

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.450 
$45 which sounds like it's a full price
game<00:05:12.870> but<00:05:13.139> most<00:05:13.320> games<00:05:13.590> in<00:05:13.830> Canada<00:05:14.190> now<00:05:14.310> are

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
game but most games in Canada now are

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.110 
game but most games in Canada now are
$50<00:05:15.090> 55<00:05:15.900> or<00:05:16.050> 60<00:05:16.410> dollars<00:05:16.740> in<00:05:16.919> the<00:05:17.639> States<00:05:17.940> I

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
$50 55 or 60 dollars in the States I

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.730 
$50 55 or 60 dollars in the States I
believe<00:05:18.150> it's<00:05:18.510> only<00:05:18.720> 40<00:05:19.080> that's<00:05:19.380> because<00:05:19.650> the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
believe it's only 40 that's because the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.560 
believe it's only 40 that's because the
Canadian<00:05:20.070> dollars<00:05:20.310> weaker<00:05:20.639> and<00:05:20.790> worldwide

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
Canadian dollars weaker and worldwide

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.480 
Canadian dollars weaker and worldwide
it's<00:05:21.780> probably<00:05:22.110> comparative<00:05:22.650> for<00:05:23.040> pricing

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
it's probably comparative for pricing

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.520 
it's probably comparative for pricing
but<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.120> really<00:05:24.360> cool<00:05:24.570> part<00:05:24.630> about<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.139> and

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
but the really cool part about that and

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.170 
but the really cool part about that and
I'll<00:05:25.590> actually<00:05:25.770> pull<00:05:26.190> over<00:05:26.400> my<00:05:26.520> gamepad<00:05:27.000> right

this the reason why I got this was

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.129 
this the reason why I got this was
because<00:06:47.100> actually<00:06:47.759> I<00:06:47.940> had<00:06:48.270> like<00:06:48.539> a<00:06:48.690> hundred

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
because actually I had like a hundred

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.379 
because actually I had like a hundred
dollars<00:06:49.470> at<00:06:49.650> EB<00:06:49.889> Games<00:06:50.069> saved<00:06:50.550> up<00:06:50.789> so<00:06:51.210> I<00:06:51.240> was

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389 
dollars at EB Games saved up so I was

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:53.029
