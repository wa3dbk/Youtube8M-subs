00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.330 

so<00:02:29.210> what<00:02:29.600> we<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.900> here<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:30.350> these<00:02:30.770> three

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
so what we have here in these three

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.070 
so what we have here in these three
petals<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:31.820> three<00:02:32.060> different<00:02:32.360> flavors<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.690> the

and<00:02:40.400> then<00:02:40.640> over<00:02:41.000> here<00:02:41.030> we<00:02:41.330> have<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.600> GHS

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
and then over here we have the GHS

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.010 
and then over here we have the GHS
strong<00:02:42.470> mod<00:02:42.710> which<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.220> smoother<00:02:43.730> more

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
gives you more tones a lot more gain two

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.060 
gives you more tones a lot more gain two

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
mod for JHS it is the high gain mod and

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.260 
mod for JHS it is the high gain mod and
it<00:02:59.180> offers<00:02:59.570> tons<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.500> gain<00:03:00.820> two<00:03:01.820> times<00:03:02.060> the

it offers tons of gain two times the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.450 
it offers tons of gain two times the

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
more of a cleaner kind of I guess a

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:51.450 
more of a cleaner kind of I guess a
lighter<00:05:42.590> Drive<00:05:42.949> tone<00:05:49.630> and<00:05:50.630> I'll<00:05:50.960> let<00:05:51.169> you
