shouldn't<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.729> too<00:01:35.909> difficult<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
shouldn't be too difficult it's just a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.120 
shouldn't be too difficult it's just a
matter<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.020> being<00:01:37.229> paid<00:01:37.560> happened<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> run<00:01:38.009> off

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
matter of being paid happened to run off

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.740 
matter of being paid happened to run off
the<00:01:38.250> small<00:01:38.460> enough<00:01:38.640> voltage<00:01:38.970> at<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.240> fit

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the small enough voltage at this fit

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.270 
the small enough voltage at this fit
that's<00:01:40.110> pretty<00:01:40.259> cool<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.799> plug<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.979> car

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
that's pretty cool you can plug a car

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.160 
that's pretty cool you can plug a car
battery<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.729> your<00:01:41.759> notebook<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:43.079> you

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
battery in your notebook if you if you

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.569 
battery in your notebook if you if you
have<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> right<00:01:43.470> convergys<00:01:43.979> know<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> real

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
have the right convergys know the real

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.069 
have the right convergys know the real
question<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.060> how<00:01:45.149> he<00:01:45.210> got<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> case<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.930> look

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
question is how he got the case to look

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.389 
question is how he got the case to look
this<00:01:46.229> cool<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:46.829> what<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.040> think<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.280> was

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
this cool what what do you think it was

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.800 
this cool what what do you think it was
still<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.850> haven't<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.270> an<00:01:48.329> example<00:01:48.570> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
still we haven't we have an example of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.780 
still we haven't we have an example of
the<00:01:49.049> clay<00:01:49.380> model<00:01:49.799> he<00:01:49.920> made<00:01:50.070> everything<00:01:50.369> before

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the clay model he made everything before

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.310 
the clay model he made everything before
he<00:01:50.850> did<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.119> he<00:01:51.210> had<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> make<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.659> clay<00:01:51.899> model

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
he did it he had to make this clay model

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.780 
he did it he had to make this clay model
so<00:01:52.649> he<00:01:52.799> made<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> model<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.610> how<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
so he made the model of how the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.130 
so he made the model of how the
controller<00:01:54.210> dwork<00:01:54.509> how<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> screen<00:01:54.990> would

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
controller dwork how the screen would

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.330 
controller dwork how the screen would
said<00:01:55.350> he<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.619> carved<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.040> out<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.159> clay

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
said he just carved it out of clay

kind of way liked all the Star Wars guys
make<00:02:06.540> their<00:02:06.659> armor<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.530> they<00:02:07.740> mold<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
make their armor so they mold the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.040 
make their armor so they mold the
plastic<00:02:08.759> down<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> clay<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.690> underneath

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
plastic down so the clay is underneath

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.779 
plastic down so the clay is underneath
that

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
that

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.830 
that
yeah<00:02:10.879> that's<00:02:11.209> how<00:02:11.299> they<00:02:11.420> do<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:11.780> then

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
yeah that's how they do that and then

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.229 
yeah that's how they do that and then
its<00:02:11.989> suction<00:02:12.319> it<00:02:12.709> smolders<00:02:13.189> gets<00:02:13.849> heated<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
its suction it smolders gets heated the

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.599 
its suction it smolders gets heated the
cheese<00:02:14.420> in<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.629> section<00:02:14.840> yeah<00:02:15.189> wow<00:02:16.189> that's

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:16.609 
cheese in this section yeah wow that's

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.729 
cheese in this section yeah wow that's
so<00:02:16.790> cool<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.390> then<00:02:17.659> and<00:02:18.230> what<00:02:18.349> it<00:02:18.439> does<00:02:18.530> it

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
so cool and then and what it does it

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.800 
so cool and then and what it does it
gives<00:02:18.829> you<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.010> very<00:02:19.280> nice<00:02:19.579> very<00:02:19.909> mood<00:02:20.239> pretty

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
gives you a very nice very mood pretty

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.119 
gives you a very nice very mood pretty
much<00:02:20.989> what<00:02:21.170> I'm<00:02:21.260> implying<00:02:21.469> you<00:02:21.799> couldn't

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
much what I'm implying you couldn't

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.679 
much what I'm implying you couldn't
really<00:02:22.280> do<00:02:22.489> any<00:02:22.640> other<00:02:22.700> way<00:02:23.030> whatever<00:02:23.359> you<00:02:23.510> had

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
really do any other way whatever you had

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.089 
really do any other way whatever you had
in<00:02:23.810> your<00:02:23.840> in<00:02:24.260> your<00:02:24.290> model<00:02:24.680> that's<00:02:24.859> what's

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
in your in your model that's what's

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.830 
in your in your model that's what's
gonna<00:02:25.189> be<00:02:25.280> there<00:02:25.549> it's<00:02:26.150> really<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:26.689> clay

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
gonna be there it's really and the clay

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.449 
gonna be there it's really and the clay
doesn't<00:02:27.019> get<00:02:27.200> deformed<00:02:27.500> by<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:28.099> section

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
doesn't get deformed by the the section

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.250 
doesn't get deformed by the the section
process<00:02:28.849> I<00:02:28.939> guess<00:02:28.970> no<00:02:29.420> no<00:02:29.540> no<00:02:29.780> no<00:02:29.930> not<00:02:30.019> at<00:02:30.170> all

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
process I guess no no no no not at all

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.599 
process I guess no no no no not at all
you<00:02:30.470> probably<00:02:30.859> heat<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.099> clay<00:02:31.250> up<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.430> little

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
you probably heat the clay up a little

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.699 
you probably heat the clay up a little
bit<00:02:31.730> maybe<00:02:31.879> can<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.269> dry<00:02:32.659> it<00:02:32.689> a<00:02:32.780> little<00:02:32.900> bit<00:02:33.140> we

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
bit maybe can you dry it a little bit we

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:34.929 
bit maybe can you dry it a little bit we
have<00:02:33.829> another<00:02:34.040> shot<00:02:34.280> there<00:02:34.489> it's<00:02:34.609> has<00:02:34.760> some<00:02:34.879> of

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
have another shot there it's has some of

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.490 
have another shot there it's has some of
the<00:02:35.000> details<00:02:35.329> just<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.629> get<00:02:35.750> people<00:02:35.780> example

the details just to get people example
of<00:02:37.430> how<00:02:37.609> much<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:38.030> old<00:02:38.180> wiring<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.230> know

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
of how much the old wiring and you know

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.259 
of how much the old wiring and you know
moving<00:02:39.829> stuff<00:02:40.129> around<00:02:40.219> was<00:02:40.609> actually<00:02:40.969> had<00:02:41.120> to
