here some balls to turn them on and off
it<00:01:07.420> goes<00:01:07.510> into<00:01:07.840> this<00:01:07.960> tank<00:01:08.229> and<00:01:08.890> then<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.220> can

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
it goes into this tank and then it can

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.109 
it goes into this tank and then it can
go<00:01:09.490> down<00:01:09.640> there<00:01:09.850> it<00:01:10.240> was<00:01:11.759> you<00:01:12.759> can<00:01:12.970> make

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
go down there it was you can make

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.850 
go down there it was you can make
experiment<00:01:13.810> with<00:01:13.930> tanks<00:01:14.380> there<00:01:14.619> is<00:01:14.710> its

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
experiment with tanks there is its

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.429 
experiment with tanks there is its
design<00:01:15.610> thank<00:01:16.119> you<00:01:16.240> note<00:01:16.420> but<00:01:16.659> we<00:01:16.810> added<00:01:17.080> some

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
design thank you note but we added some

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.710 
design thank you note but we added some
other<00:01:17.920> stuff<00:01:18.280> like<00:01:18.460> we<00:01:18.670> put<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:18.910> water<00:01:19.180> heel<00:01:19.510> in

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
other stuff like we put a water heel in

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.170 
other stuff like we put a water heel in
you<00:01:20.680> can<00:01:20.860> also<00:01:20.980> experiment<00:01:21.370> a<00:01:21.640> twenty-twelve

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
you can also experiment a twenty-twelve

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
there are a lot of different

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.330 
there are a lot of different
configurations<00:01:29.050> in<00:01:29.200> here<00:01:29.500> here<00:01:29.980> we<00:01:30.100> have<00:01:30.310> a

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
configurations in here here we have a

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.790 
configurations in here here we have a
float<00:01:30.880> valve

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
float valve

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.930 
float valve
that's<00:01:32.800> an<00:01:32.920> interesting<00:01:33.159> device<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.670> can<00:01:33.790> put

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
that's an interesting device you can put

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.300 
that's an interesting device you can put
that<00:01:34.060> in<00:01:34.240> there<00:01:34.390> water<00:01:34.710> funny<00:01:35.710> dreams<00:01:36.010> once

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
that in there water funny dreams once

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.800 
that in there water funny dreams once
that<00:01:36.490> flow<00:01:36.700> gets<00:01:36.880> up<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.120> a<00:01:37.150> certain<00:01:37.330> level<00:01:37.510> and

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
that flow gets up to a certain level and

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.890 
that flow gets up to a certain level and
over<00:01:38.470> here<00:01:38.710> we<00:01:38.830> have<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:39.370> spray<00:01:39.970> tank<00:01:40.330> with<00:01:40.750> an

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
over here we have a spray tank with an

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.570 
over here we have a spray tank with an
optional<00:01:41.320> spray<00:01:41.680> head<00:01:41.890> in<00:01:42.010> there<00:01:42.130> David<00:01:42.430> want

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
optional spray head in there David want

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.610 
optional spray head in there David want
you<00:01:42.670> take<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:42.970> top<00:01:43.180> off<00:01:43.360> of<00:01:43.510> that<00:01:43.659> is<00:01:44.409> they

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
you take the top off of that is they

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.260 
you take the top off of that is they
even<00:01:44.800> have<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> spray<00:01:45.340> head<00:01:45.550> in<00:01:45.670> there<00:01:45.820> so<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.060> lot

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
even have a spray head in there so a lot

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.960 
even have a spray head in there so a lot
of<00:01:46.570> detail<00:01:47.070> everything<00:01:48.070> in<00:01:48.190> just<00:01:48.760> it's<00:01:48.880> a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
of detail everything in just it's a

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.390 
of detail everything in just it's a
187th<00:01:49.780> scale<00:01:50.110> an<00:01:50.320> h:o<00:01:50.590> scale<00:01:50.920> so<00:01:51.100> these<00:01:51.220> are

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
187th scale an h:o scale so these are

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.730 
187th scale an h:o scale so these are
like<00:01:51.550> real<00:01:51.850> devices<00:01:52.300> just<00:01:52.720> shrunk<00:01:53.260> down<00:01:53.440> very

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
like real devices just shrunk down very

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.440 
like real devices just shrunk down very
small<00:01:54.040> so<00:01:54.190> you<00:01:54.280> learn<00:01:54.460> quite<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.850> bit<00:01:55.090> right

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
small so you learn quite a bit right

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.120 
small so you learn quite a bit right
David<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:55.960> demonstrating<00:01:56.620> here<00:01:56.860> what<00:01:57.010> you

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
David is demonstrating here what you

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.100 
David is demonstrating here what you
find<00:01:57.400> in<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.640> manual<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.299> as<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:58.960> see

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
find in the manual and as you see

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.270 
find in the manual and as you see
they've<00:01:59.260> got<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.470> number<00:01:59.920> of<00:01:59.950> different

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
they've got a number of different

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.620 
they've got a number of different
structures<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:00.940> can<00:02:01.120> build<00:02:01.390> a

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
structures that you can build a

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.140 
structures that you can build a
toothpaste<00:02:02.170> factory<00:02:02.710> in<00:02:02.890> there<00:02:03.070> an<00:02:03.280> ice<00:02:03.909> cream

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
toothpaste factory in there an ice cream

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.800 
toothpaste factory in there an ice cream
factory

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
factory

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.789 
factory
the<00:02:05.409> vinegar<00:02:05.830> factory<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:07.349> lot<00:02:08.349> of<00:02:08.470> different

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
the vinegar factory a lot of different

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.009 
the vinegar factory a lot of different
designs<00:02:09.159> in<00:02:09.369> there<00:02:09.580> but<00:02:10.390> again<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.810> know<00:02:10.899> we

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
designs in there but again you know we

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.869 
designs in there but again you know we
did<00:02:11.140> put<00:02:11.349> together<00:02:11.470> one<00:02:11.830> we<00:02:11.980> modified<00:02:12.489> it<00:02:12.519> and

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
did put together one we modified it and

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.280 
did put together one we modified it and
what's<00:02:13.060> really<00:02:13.239> fun<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.599> trying<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.049> create

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
what's really fun is trying to create

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.170 
what's really fun is trying to create
your<00:02:14.560> own<00:02:14.650> creations<00:02:15.159> using<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.610> different

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180

of<00:02:38.060> different<00:02:38.420> ways<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.540> can<00:02:38.780> control<00:02:39.140> the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
of different ways you can control the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.020 
of different ways you can control the
water<00:02:39.500> different<00:02:39.980> valves<00:02:40.340> in<00:02:40.490> there<00:02:40.700> where

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
water different valves in there where

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.490 
water different valves in there where
you<00:02:41.060> can<00:02:41.330> shut<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.630> off<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.200> see<00:02:42.320> what<00:02:42.470> happens

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
you can shut it off and see what happens

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.820 
you can shut it off and see what happens
when<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.310> valves<00:02:44.270> are<00:02:44.420> shut<00:02:44.630> off<00:02:44.830> there's

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
when the valves are shut off there's

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.010 
when the valves are shut off there's
piping<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.460> there<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:47.090> clear<00:02:47.360> tube<00:02:47.630> David

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
piping in there the clear tube David

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.810 
piping in there the clear tube David
while<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.260> hold<00:02:48.380> up<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.740> clear<00:02:49.190> tube<00:02:49.460> so<00:02:49.730> they

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
while you hold up the clear tube so they

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.180 
while you hold up the clear tube so they
can<00:02:50.000> see<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.270> piping<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.960> can<00:02:51.620> cut<00:02:51.830> this<00:02:51.980> and

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
can see the piping you can cut this and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.530 
can see the piping you can cut this and
that's<00:02:52.310> really<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.760> key<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.300> can<00:02:53.420> make

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
that's really the key to it you can make

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.970 
that's really the key to it you can make
all<00:02:53.720> different<00:02:53.840> sized<00:02:54.170> piping<00:02:54.710> throughout

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
all different sized piping throughout

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.340 
all different sized piping throughout
the<00:02:55.160> kit<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.750> there<00:02:56.870> are<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:56.960> whole<00:02:57.080> bunch<00:02:57.110> of

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
the kit and there are a whole bunch of

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.540 
the kit and there are a whole bunch of
other<00:02:57.500> parts<00:02:57.860> we'll<00:02:58.010> have<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.130> full<00:02:58.370> review

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
other parts we'll have a full review

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.910 
other parts we'll have a full review
over<00:02:58.970> on<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.210> site<00:02:59.480> but<00:03:00.200> what<00:03:00.500> we<00:03:00.650> really

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
over on the site but what we really

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.220 
over on the site but what we really
liked<00:03:01.100> about<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.370> was<00:03:01.520> very<00:03:02.300> creative<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:03.050> can

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
liked about it was very creative you can

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.570 
liked about it was very creative you can
build<00:03:03.410> all<00:03:03.530> types<00:03:03.740> of<00:03:03.830> different<00:03:03.950> towers<00:03:04.250> and

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
build all types of different towers and

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.400 
build all types of different towers and
you<00:03:04.670> learn<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.850> lot<00:03:05.150> about<00:03:05.390> how<00:03:05.780> water<00:03:06.020> water

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
you learn a lot about how water water

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.680 
you learn a lot about how water water
pressure<00:03:06.740> works<00:03:07.100> come<00:03:07.880> over<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.240> dad<00:03:08.450> does

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
pressure works come over to dad does

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.620 
pressure works come over to dad does
we'll<00:03:08.960> have<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.080> lot<00:03:09.260> more<00:03:09.290> on
