 dorsal nerve of the scapula I think that 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:11.189
 There I have spent the 40 nerves of balance 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.700
 the scapula on 40 the one on artery two 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:17.870
 are from the scapula or deep branch is the 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.910
 39 I think it's scarce but here 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.800
 rectify the dorsal artery of the 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.250

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.820
 transverse neck is this that before 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.820
 we have confused 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.540
