00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
nice now I know that my stuff is working

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.100 
nice now I know that my stuff is working
there's<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.580> lot<00:01:21.789> of<00:01:21.910> value<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.509> this<00:01:22.720> obstacle

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
there's a lot of value on this obstacle

there's a lot of value on this obstacle
it's<00:01:23.560> very<00:01:23.890> likely<00:01:24.190> that<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.580> behavior<00:01:24.940> will

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
it's very likely that the behavior will

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.210 
it's very likely that the behavior will
happen<00:01:25.420> once<00:01:26.140> I<00:01:26.259> develop<00:01:26.590> this<00:01:26.770> then<00:01:26.950> I'll<00:01:27.070> go

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
happen once I develop this then I'll go

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.520

dog<00:02:02.500> while<00:02:02.649> they're<00:02:02.799> going<00:02:03.009> over<00:02:03.130> so<00:02:03.909> that's<00:02:04.090> a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
dog while they're going over so that's a

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.389 
dog while they're going over so that's a
linear<00:02:04.360> ball<00:02:04.689> once<00:02:04.960> I<00:02:05.079> have<00:02:05.259> that<00:02:05.290> going<00:02:05.890> what

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
linear ball once I have that going what

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.590 
linear ball once I have that going what
I'm<00:02:06.490> going<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.670> do<00:02:06.790> is<00:02:06.939> I'm<00:02:07.060> going<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.299> I'm

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
going to throw them a curve ball and I'm

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.740 
going to throw them a curve ball and I'm
going<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.429> ask<00:02:09.610> him<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:09.880> stall<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.540> looks

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
going to ask him to stall and it looks

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.199 
going to ask him to stall and it looks
like<00:02:13.900> she's<00:02:14.049> got<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.260> real<00:02:15.130> big<00:02:15.430> desire<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.090> be
