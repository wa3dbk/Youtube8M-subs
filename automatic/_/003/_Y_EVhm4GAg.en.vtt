ready<00:01:31.549> but<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.700> install<00:01:33.500> I'll<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.650> take<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
ready but one install I'll just take a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.770

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
now technically it is on installed but

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.260 
now technically it is on installed but
