00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.770
 on youtube so there were 607 of eight in a 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.480
 bookmark for them and today 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.000
 they study this famous game that 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.340
 everyone knows that minecraft is like 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.010
 you can see the one that came out 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.920
 I commented on in the episode of our 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.900
 series is a more hurt place like 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.880
 I commented came the tv 19 where they appear 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.640
 many things not like the horse the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.820
 Fireworks etc in this engine 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.390
 teaches them how to find the 12 discs 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.890
 of this modular so let's start here 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.510
 our first chest we will find another 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.219
 first record that would be the cat here you 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.340
 I leave the coordinates pause in the video 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.719
 there is a little while and the video is already habituated 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.020
 if I want to see it there if it's doing 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.020
 night 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:01.050
 then we will cross all this bridge that 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.900
 we would use all this the bridge and down 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.650
 of the bridge would be our second album 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.680
 Katy left the coordinates 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.770
 that is, do not forget and well after this 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.350
 disk I do not know here we would be we'll get to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.050
 this point and then if we remove this 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.290
 block here we would find our 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.290
 third disc that is hidden 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.320
 here would be in case there is then the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.360
 coordinate I forgot too good 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.920
 after that in this same castle 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.690
 we would climb up to the top 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.420
 up to the top as it was 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.860
 can not climb with making a ladder 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.900
 up or whatever and 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.620
 we will find our fourth record of 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.620
 rent with coordinates 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.590
 then we would follow this type of this 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.939
 waterfall do not know if they made him 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.310
 he did four action studies photos and in 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:02.789
 europe and here we would find our 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.789
 fifth disc here with the coordinates 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.459
 well after this if we would go to 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.530
 a town that is two power better 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.890
 said that they are close to here that the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.080
 main would be this since 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.080
 since I'm closer than the other 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.709
 so here we would enter as 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.530
 would be our sixth half disc 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.530
 of two put there far the coordinate 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.460
 then we would go to the other town that 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.260
 would the other disk we would go to 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.260
 here we spend all this 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:47.720
 and here would be the town that would be 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.220
 here our seventh album 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.910
 the desert color here far 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.910
 coordinates 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.900
 well after that, not if we do not 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.630
 we would move quite armed because 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.330
 we would have to go to some areas that 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.770
 they are far from here 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.140
 that would be happening the snowy areas 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.660
 We would continue to follow and here 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.210
 we would find another town that is here 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.080
 another town as you can see and here not 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.420
 would be our believe that ninth disc 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.930
 eighth disc cord and the coordinate is 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.930
 I leave you here 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.750
 well after this we would go to 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.700
 by the ocean to go around the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.530
 left and we would go here too 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.340
 we would find two discs that are not 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.610
 first I would recommend them to go up and 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.560
 then because here we would find our 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.750
 ninth album now if it 's ninth our 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.750
 ninth disk that circulate which coordinate 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.530
 well after that we would do good if 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.209
 You can come down here, but like me 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.600
 I want to be quick I will do this 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.090
 some a little bit lower and there's 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.080
 here here would be our 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.130
 tenth disk that would be the coordinates 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.130
 here I leave them 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.000
 well after this we would go 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.739
 from this point to another point that 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.320
 would enable the last two discs that 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.450
 they would be another castle 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.210
 guys, I want to tell you that if they see 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.470
 that is a bit dark tell me 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.480
 because I change on my television because 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.910
 my parents bought me a new one I do not know 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.010
 why if I already had the other but say 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.160
 the comments that I can tell you there 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.550
 something else this video will not be now but 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.160

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:55.390

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:57.640

 for a week 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.760
 but then we would activate this 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.200
 after arriving at the castle guys 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.170
