00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.860
 and it's because I while ge 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.860
 it's okay 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.300
 good 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.000
 we apologized but if you felt 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:37.250
 attacked the truth that we are and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.250
 I do not have any awards to the contrary 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.270
 they were incredible these bad these 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.680
 dimes and diretes began in chile yo 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.390
 I think it has to do with the little ball that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.890
 it exists between countries but I 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.530
 I personally have many Peruvians 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.930
 also experience with guilt for 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.519
 what happened 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.390
 for ignorance maybe but 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.280
 we continue in situ in the jungle 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.159
 with you it was an incredible experience 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.270
 loving we call them also just 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.520
 ask forgiveness for my countrymen 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.049
 Chileans because the goal for us 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.280
 never time the bass in them was said in 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.420
 a program in china has nothing to do 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.670
 with us we are 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.140
 thankful grateful people of 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:24.619
 the poor and from you I have friends 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.619
 but I 'm not 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.250
 Today, like this, it really sold me the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.250
 drop we are made 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.410
 but unfortunately the only thing 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.560
 we can say well all of us are 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.560
 poor 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.730
 the issue of waste as 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.890
 protagonists of the islands 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.980
 we apologize for our companions 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.440
 the name of my fault and grateful what 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.480
 what were you doing after us 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.480
 It was spectacular 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.930
 others 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.930
 and there we are 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.849
 it's terrible the worst is that we can by 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.849
 not have it cold 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.710
 die when you are a love 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.040
 with her 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.230
 you do not know how sad the light lost 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.719
 when we got it but it 's looking good 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.719
 but he does not know sir he leaves you two passes 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.090
 nobody what there is then what 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.780
 the condemned who do not pass so that the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.430
 savage we found that that same 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.840
 advance and in force from the press and 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.840
 in writing those within the portal 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.610
 but 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.599
 it's outrageous when it comes out that 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.920
 characters in a character that came out 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.690
 touching the sweep as 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.510
 to the world that we are all 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.550
 wild and we eat children in this 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.200
 meaning translated to us from that 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.810
 way this was our concern 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.489
 and our indignation even when 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.770
 we are told that we too 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.290
 we are the pure ones in that sense 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.239
 I believe that our culture our wealth 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.620
 culture that we maintain in the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.970
 place of events we did not control 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.430
 proven years that we are better 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.170
 educated smart and well clean not 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.870
 like them who have come who has gone 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.280
 from his land to get in there 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.220
 we have shown him with our waters 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.480
 from the Amazon river the river nervion like no 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.040
 in the area of influence 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.690
 they have bathed hopefully today they have 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.500
 come clean that I hope you come back 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.500
 clean to other countries
