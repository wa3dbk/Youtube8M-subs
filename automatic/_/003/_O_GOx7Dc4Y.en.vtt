00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
we go this is that mortar test I was

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:11.190 
we go this is that mortar test I was
telling<00:00:01.979> y'all<00:00:02.159> belt

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.549 

all<00:00:11.679> right<00:00:11.950> many<00:00:12.880> people<00:00:13.290> let's<00:00:14.290> see<00:00:14.469> how

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
all right many people let's see how

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.670 
all right many people let's see how
we're<00:00:14.740> gonna<00:00:14.799> do

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.400 

you<00:00:19.250> know<00:00:19.400> he's<00:00:19.550> going<00:00:19.670> to<00:00:19.730> pinch<00:00:20.000> me<00:00:20.180> I<00:00:20.410> moved

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
you know he's going to pinch me I moved

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.020 
you know he's going to pinch me I moved
my<00:00:21.470> dog<00:00:21.740> because<00:00:21.890> I<00:00:22.100> knew<00:00:22.220> he<00:00:22.340> was<00:00:22.430> coming

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.980 

so<00:00:26.600> that's<00:00:26.780> up<00:00:26.930> there<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:27.440> he<00:00:27.800> won't<00:00:27.950> hit<00:00:28.160> it

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
so that's up there so he won't hit it

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.770 
so that's up there so he won't hit it
probably<00:00:29.990> came<00:00:30.170> in<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:30.470> wrong<00:00:30.650> direction

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.120 

just<00:00:34.500> wait<00:00:34.680> 40

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
just wait 40

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.080 

Oh

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
Oh

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.460 
Oh
not<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.840> little<00:00:39.990> ships<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.740> the<00:00:40.950> big<00:00:41.130> ships

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.870 

all<00:00:45.740> right<00:00:45.980> I<00:00:46.010> see

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
all right I see

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.390 
all right I see
if<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.960> truly<00:00:49.470> a<00:00:49.500> mortar<00:00:49.800> fleet<00:00:50.040> that<00:00:50.220> won't

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
if it's truly a mortar fleet that won't

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.000 
if it's truly a mortar fleet that won't
be<00:00:50.490> a<00:00:50.520> problem

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.620 

up<00:00:57.609> there<00:00:57.820> are<00:00:57.879> stover<00:00:58.089> loads

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:14.990 

there<00:01:02.230> we<00:01:02.320> go

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.100 

just<00:01:15.360> try<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.690> clean<00:01:15.960> out<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> little<00:01:16.290> bit

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.650 

now<00:01:21.010> I'm<00:01:21.130> curious<00:01:21.370> as<00:01:21.670> if<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.970> mortars<00:01:22.360> will

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
now I'm curious as if the mortars will

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.940 
now I'm curious as if the mortars will
reach

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.190 

hoping<00:01:25.820> not<00:01:26.060> I'm<00:01:26.570> hoping<00:01:26.780> not<00:01:27.049> because<00:01:27.320> he

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
hoping not I'm hoping not because he

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.230 
hoping not I'm hoping not because he
yeah<00:01:29.710> there<00:01:29.860> we<00:01:29.979> go<00:01:30.009> since<00:01:30.820> these<00:01:30.939> can<00:01:31.149> be

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
yeah there we go since these can be

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.670 
yeah there we go since these can be
aiming<00:01:31.539> up<00:01:31.600> there<00:01:31.840> he's<00:01:32.200> probably<00:01:32.409> going<00:01:32.590> to

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
aiming up there he's probably going to

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.950 
aiming up there he's probably going to
hit<00:01:32.770> back<00:01:32.890> here<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:33.310> that's<00:01:33.430> pretty<00:01:33.610> cool<00:01:33.960> but

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
hit back here so that's pretty cool but

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.480 
hit back here so that's pretty cool but
he's<00:01:35.170> probably<00:01:35.289> got<00:01:35.560> enough<00:01:35.680> an<00:01:35.920> time<00:01:36.130> order

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
he's probably got enough an time order

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.670 
he's probably got enough an time order
to<00:01:36.789> prevent<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.240> one<00:01:37.450> from<00:01:37.630> landing

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.430 

yes<00:01:42.190> last<00:01:43.090> one<00:01:43.270> hasn't<00:01:43.450> fired<00:01:43.720> is<00:01:43.960> this<00:01:44.200> one

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
yes last one hasn't fired is this one

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.850 
yes last one hasn't fired is this one
and<00:01:44.770> he<00:01:45.280> starts<00:01:45.790> firing

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:00.970 

not<00:01:51.430> yet

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.470 

are<00:02:01.520> we<00:02:01.670> even<00:02:01.700> damaging<00:02:02.330> me<00:02:02.510> up<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.840> little<00:02:03.170> bit

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.560 

whoa<00:02:07.850> holy<00:02:08.850> crap<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.260> lot<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.620> pinch

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
whoa holy crap that's a lot of pinch

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.180 
whoa holy crap that's a lot of pinch
yeah<00:02:12.570> that's<00:02:12.840> exactly<00:02:13.320> why<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.590> have<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> problem

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
yeah that's exactly why I have a problem

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.370 
yeah that's exactly why I have a problem
right<00:02:14.520> there

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:32.460 

ah<00:02:20.880> yep<00:02:21.880> that's<00:02:22.210> my<00:02:22.390> problem<00:02:22.690> right<00:02:22.990> there

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.220 

that's<00:02:33.100> not<00:02:33.310> firing

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.960 

there's<00:02:37.830> really<00:02:38.040> no<00:02:38.220> point<00:02:38.430> separating

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
there's really no point separating

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.729 
there's really no point separating
because<00:02:39.150> those<00:02:39.360> are<00:02:39.569> both<00:02:39.810> pinched<00:02:40.500> at<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
because those are both pinched at the

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.800 
because those are both pinched at the
same<00:02:40.950> time<00:02:41.569> it's<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.720> splash<00:02:44.360> really<00:02:45.360> taking<00:02:45.720> it

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
same time it's a splash really taking it

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.449 
same time it's a splash really taking it
on<00:02:45.959> well<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.379> did<00:02:46.709> more<00:02:46.890> damage<00:02:46.950> than<00:02:47.310> those

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
on well I did more damage than those

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.339 
on well I did more damage than those
other<00:02:47.580> two<00:02:47.819> fleets<00:02:48.060> at<00:02:48.209> least<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:52.140> I'm<00:02:52.200> at

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
other two fleets at least so I'm at

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.420 
other two fleets at least so I'm at
least<00:02:52.500> doing<00:02:52.709> something<00:02:53.900> all<00:02:54.900> my<00:02:55.379> home<00:02:55.739> these

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
least doing something all my home these

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.670 
least doing something all my home these
are<00:02:56.640> still<00:02:56.910> alive

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.500 

so<00:03:00.340> that's<00:03:00.549> good

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.360 

I<00:03:04.569> just<00:03:05.409> got<00:03:05.620> this<00:03:05.769> feeling<00:03:06.069> that

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.200 

oh<00:03:10.140> we<00:03:11.140> made<00:03:11.319> some<00:03:11.470> made<00:03:11.860> some<00:03:12.010> progress

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.380 

for<00:03:16.780> overwhelming<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.710> his<00:03:18.670> pinch<00:03:19.060> came<00:03:19.360> I

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
for overwhelming it his pinch came I

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.120 
for overwhelming it his pinch came I
think<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.810> little<00:03:19.990> early<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:20.440> think<00:03:20.560> he<00:03:20.890> should

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
think a little early I think he should

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.360 
think a little early I think he should
have<00:03:21.250> had<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.490> little<00:03:21.670> bit<00:03:21.850> more<00:03:22.000> rain<00:03:22.240> going<00:03:22.450> on

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
have had a little bit more rain going on

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.260 
have had a little bit more rain going on
before<00:03:24.370> he<00:03:24.670> pinched<00:03:25.000> it

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
before he pinched it

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.790 
before he pinched it
because<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.020> should<00:03:27.200> have<00:03:27.290> metal<00:03:27.500> take<00:03:27.650> out

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
because it should have metal take out

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.120 
because it should have metal take out
these<00:03:27.950> three<00:03:28.430> when<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.730> was<00:03:28.850> pinched<00:03:30.130> he's

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
these three when it was pinched he's

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.020 
these three when it was pinched he's
going<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.370> die

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.140 

oh<00:03:36.090> that's<00:03:36.900> it

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.600 

my<00:03:41.930> base<00:03:42.110> has<00:03:42.319> been<00:03:42.500> broken<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.099> think<00:03:43.430> if

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
my base has been broken and I think if

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.259
