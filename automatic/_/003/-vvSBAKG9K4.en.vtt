chase<00:04:24.470> it<00:04:24.620> down<00:04:24.770> again<00:04:25.810> because<00:04:26.810> now<00:04:26.960> he<00:04:27.020> is

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
untamed so that is pretty cool I will be

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.080 
untamed so that is pretty cool I will be
updating<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:30.290> model<00:04:30.590> for<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.830> crawl<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.460> just

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
updating the model for the crawl I just

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.430 
updating the model for the crawl I just
need<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.270> find<00:04:32.480> some<00:04:32.600> time<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.990> do<00:04:33.080> that<00:04:33.230> and

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
need to find some time to do that and

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.470 
need to find some time to do that and
I'm<00:04:33.980> also<00:04:34.160> working<00:04:34.400> on<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.700> Panda<00:04:35.030> mob<00:04:35.210> so

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.159 
I'm also working on the Panda mob so
look<00:04:35.990> forward<00:04:36.350> to<00:04:36.440> that<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:38.210> think<00:04:38.570> that's

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
look forward to that and I think that's

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.659 
look forward to that and I think that's
pretty<00:04:39.440> much<00:04:39.530> everything<00:04:39.770> I've<00:04:40.220> covered<00:04:40.460> on

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669

pretty much everything I've covered on
the<00:04:40.760> mod<00:04:41.470> however<00:04:42.470> if<00:04:43.330> you're<00:04:44.330> really<00:04:44.690> close
