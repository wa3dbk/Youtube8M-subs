00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
recommend going out and buying him I

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.649 
recommend going out and buying him I
didn't<00:01:59.399> expect<00:01:59.759> him<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.060> as<00:02:00.240> good<00:02:00.420> as<00:02:00.479> he

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
didn't expect him to be as good as he

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.330 
didn't expect him to be as good as he
was<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.170> personally<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.890> thought<00:02:02.189> his

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
was you know personally I thought his

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.249 
was you know personally I thought his
pace<00:02:02.579> may<00:02:02.880> prove<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.270> problem<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.960> didn't

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
pace may prove a problem but it didn't

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.139 
pace may prove a problem but it didn't
why'd<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.009> need<00:02:05.159> pace<00:02:05.430> when<00:02:05.670> he<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.939> shoot

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
why'd you need pace when he can shoot

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.169 
why'd you need pace when he can shoot
from<00:02:06.360> four<00:02:06.659> yards<00:02:06.840> out<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.789> he's<00:02:08.789> always<00:02:09.000> in

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
from four yards out and he's always in

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.369 
from four yards out and he's always in
the<00:02:09.239> right<00:02:09.390> positions<00:02:09.929> because<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.289> his

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the right positions because of his

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.430 
the right positions because of his
medium<00:02:10.800> medium<00:02:11.190> work<00:02:11.370> rate<00:02:11.840> highly<00:02:12.840> recommend

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
medium medium work rate highly recommend

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.880 
medium medium work rate highly recommend
going<00:02:13.590> out

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
going out

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.860 
going out
buying<00:02:14.100> him<00:02:14.250> guys<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.850> think<00:02:15.150> his<00:02:15.240> price<00:02:15.510> should

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
buying him guys I think his price should

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.620 
buying him guys I think his price should
fall<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.410> lot<00:02:16.740> not<00:02:17.490> quite<00:02:17.819> sure<00:02:17.850> how<00:02:18.060> much<00:02:18.420> it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
fall a lot not quite sure how much it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.750 
fall a lot not quite sure how much it
will<00:02:18.690> fall<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.110> think<00:02:19.260> probably<00:02:19.650> around<00:02:20.190> 200

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
will fall to I think probably around 200

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.180 
will fall to I think probably around 200
k<00:02:20.940> maybe<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.959> hundred<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.530> eighty<00:02:22.680> if<00:02:23.040> you're

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
k maybe a hundred and eighty if you're

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.360 
k maybe a hundred and eighty if you're
lucky<00:02:23.540> if<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.750> goes<00:02:24.900> down<00:02:24.930> anymore<00:02:25.470> why<00:02:26.310> you

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
lucky if it goes down anymore why you

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.949 
lucky if it goes down anymore why you
haven't<00:02:26.790> bought<00:02:26.940> him<00:02:27.090> already<00:02:27.330> i<00:02:27.450> don't<00:02:27.780> know

haven't bought him already i don't know

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.310
