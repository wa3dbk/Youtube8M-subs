so<00:01:14.439> I<00:01:14.469> declare<00:01:14.979> this<00:01:15.130> building<00:01:15.549> topped<00:01:15.820> out<00:01:16.090> I

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
so I declare this building topped out I

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.069 
so I declare this building topped out I
think<00:01:18.820> this<00:01:18.909> is<00:01:19.060> significant<00:01:19.659> event<00:01:19.869> for<00:01:20.020> the

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
think this is significant event for the

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.600 
think this is significant event for the
University<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.649> construction<00:01:21.159> of<00:01:21.219> diamond

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
University the construction of diamond

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.550 
University the construction of diamond
matters<00:01:22.299> for<00:01:22.570> this<00:01:22.719> university<00:01:23.259> it's<00:01:23.439> our

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
matters for this university it's our

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.429 
matters for this university it's our
largest<00:01:23.799> ever<00:01:24.250> investment<00:01:25.000> in<00:01:25.090> teaching<00:01:25.479> it

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
largest ever investment in teaching it

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.169 
largest ever investment in teaching it
will<00:01:26.560> give<00:01:26.679> a<00:01:26.710> state-of-the-art<00:01:27.429> facilities

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
for practical engineering teaching I

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.010 
for practical engineering teaching I
think<00:01:30.429> it's<00:01:30.789> important<00:01:31.329> to<00:01:31.450> know<00:01:31.569> though<00:01:31.810> it

this<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:56.739> great<00:01:56.950> for<00:01:56.979> engineering<00:01:57.459> it<00:01:58.090> is<00:01:58.239> good

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
this is great for engineering it is good

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.749 
this is great for engineering it is good
for<00:01:58.750> all<00:01:59.049> of<00:01:59.110> teaching<00:01:59.799> in<00:01:59.950> this<00:02:00.099> university

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
for all of teaching in this university
