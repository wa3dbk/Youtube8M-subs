like I keep my lip glosses here and then

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.330 
like I keep my lip glosses here and then
my<00:01:00.000> lipsticks<00:01:00.510> back<00:01:00.840> there<00:01:01.129> probably<00:01:02.129> can't

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
my lipsticks back there probably can't

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.719 
my lipsticks back there probably can't
even<00:01:02.399> see<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.820> that's<00:01:03.629> okay<00:01:03.960> um<00:01:04.580> yeah<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
even see that that's okay um yeah and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.960 
even see that that's okay um yeah and
then<00:01:05.880> here's<00:01:06.509> a<00:01:06.630> smaller<00:01:07.229> size<00:01:07.649> and<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.880> all

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.640 
then here's a smaller size and they all
just<00:01:09.119> hook<00:01:09.270> together<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.810> actually<00:01:10.200> believe

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
just hook together I actually believe

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.609 
just hook together I actually believe
these<00:01:10.860> were<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.520> cutlery<00:01:11.939> section

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
these were in the cutlery section

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.560 
these were in the cutlery section
because<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.549> put<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.820> knives<00:01:15.270> in

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
because like you can put like knives in

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.630 
because like you can put like knives in
here<00:01:15.930> Forks<00:01:16.320> no<00:01:16.590> spoons<00:01:16.650> there<00:01:17.070> whatever<00:01:17.280> but

here Forks no spoons there whatever but

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.010 
here Forks no spoons there whatever but
I<00:01:17.820> thought<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.360> was<00:01:18.479> actually<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.840> really

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
I thought this was actually a really

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.359 
I thought this was actually a really
cute<00:01:19.290> idea<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.860> right<00:01:20.009> now<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.340> it

annoying thing about this is that this
is<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.020> far<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.409> door<00:01:34.590> comes<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.250> to

is as far as this door comes out and to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.270 
is as far as this door comes out and to
get<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.150> big<00:01:36.509> fat<00:01:36.869> ass<00:01:37.110> whore<00:01:37.500> palette<00:01:38.070> I
