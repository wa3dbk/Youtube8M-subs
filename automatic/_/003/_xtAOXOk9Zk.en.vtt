polish<00:00:48.260> in<00:00:48.410> black<00:00:49.090> mostly<00:00:50.090> because<00:00:50.120> on<00:00:50.719> the

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
polish in black mostly because on the

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.490 
polish in black mostly because on the
images<00:00:51.649> that<00:00:51.680> have<00:00:52.039> these<00:00:52.309> really<00:00:53.079> bold<00:00:54.079> like

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
images that have these really bold like

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.850 
images that have these really bold like
solid<00:00:55.160> big<00:00:55.430> chunk<00:00:55.760> solid<00:00:56.270> images<00:00:56.860> sometimes

solid big chunk solid images sometimes

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.279 
solid big chunk solid images sometimes
the<00:00:58.340> regular<00:00:58.699> polishes<00:00:59.300> can<00:00:59.600> make<00:00:59.870> it<00:01:00.079> a

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
the regular polishes can make it a

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.610 
the regular polishes can make it a
little<00:01:00.859> hard<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:01.430> get<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.910> nice<00:01:02.090> clean<00:01:02.629> solid

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
image so I like to use the cone ad for

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.499 
image so I like to use the cone ad for
for<00:01:06.740> those<00:01:06.860> kinds<00:01:07.310> of<00:01:07.340> things<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:08.330> we're<00:01:08.450> going

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:19.480 
for those kinds of things so we're going
to<00:01:08.630> use<00:01:08.750> this<00:01:08.899> nice<00:01:09.170> thick<00:01:09.920> black

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.160 

and<00:01:20.540> then<00:01:21.540> we're<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> put<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:24.170> all

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and then we're going to put that on all

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.290 
and then we're going to put that on all
of<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> fingers<00:01:25.950> except<00:01:26.369> for<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.119> ring

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
if there's only two konad polishes you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.990 
if there's only two konad polishes you
buy<00:01:39.840> white<00:01:40.800> and<00:01:41.040> black<00:01:41.310> would<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> ones

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
buy white and black would be the ones

that I would recommend now I've said
this<00:01:44.340> before<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.060> best<00:01:45.240> way<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.509> clean<00:01:45.810> up

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
this before but the best way to clean up

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.109 
this before but the best way to clean up
after<00:01:46.170> konad<00:01:46.770> black<00:01:47.100> around<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.640> cuticles

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119

after konad black around your cuticles
is<00:01:48.270> pure<00:01:48.929> acetone<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.789> use<00:01:51.090> nail

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
is pure acetone now you can use nail

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.830 
is pure acetone now you can use nail
polish<00:01:51.570> remover<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.470> does<00:01:53.250> work<00:01:53.550> but<00:01:54.360> konad

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
polish remover that does work but konad

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.650 
polish remover that does work but konad
black<00:01:55.170> tends<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.770> really<00:01:56.429> messy<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.360> clean

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
black tends to be really messy to clean

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.340 
black tends to be really messy to clean
up<00:01:57.810> off<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.289> skin<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.250> always<00:01:59.850> use<00:02:00.350> pure

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
up off the skin so I always use pure

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.609 
up off the skin so I always use pure
acetone<00:02:01.860> when<00:02:02.280> removing<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:04.440> makes

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
acetone when removing it it just makes

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.960 
acetone when removing it it just makes
the<00:02:04.830> cleanup<00:02:05.160> so<00:02:05.429> much<00:02:05.610> easier<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:07.970> acetone

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the cleanup so much easier and acetone

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.430 
the cleanup so much easier and acetone
of<00:02:09.060> course<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.390> extremely<00:02:09.929> drawing<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
of course is extremely drawing to the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.320 
of course is extremely drawing to the
skin<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.039> want<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.610> some<00:02:11.880> cuticle

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
your own cow print it actually would

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.670 
your own cow print it actually would
look<00:03:52.270> good<00:03:52.420> with<00:03:52.480> just<00:03:52.810> plain<00:03:53.170> white<00:03:53.440> and

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
look good with just plain white and

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.880 
look good with just plain white and
black<00:03:53.860> too<00:03:54.130> but<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.430> do<00:03:54.550> like<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.030> OPI<00:03:55.890> skull

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
black too but I do like the OPI skull

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.830 
black too but I do like the OPI skull
and<00:03:57.040> gloss<00:03:57.220> bones<00:03:57.580> underneath<00:03:57.850> just<00:03:58.450> because

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
and gloss bones underneath just because

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.630 
and gloss bones underneath just because
I<00:03:58.870> think<00:03:59.020> that<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.440> tones<00:03:59.800> it<00:03:59.980> down<00:04:00.010> just<00:04:00.459> a

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
I think that it tones it down just a

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.449 
I think that it tones it down just a
little<00:04:00.850> bit<00:04:01.320> but<00:04:02.320> I<00:04:02.560> guess<00:04:02.740> what<00:04:02.980> cow<00:04:03.130> print

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
little bit but I guess what cow print

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.770 
little bit but I guess what cow print
you're<00:04:03.610> not<00:04:03.760> really<00:04:03.940> toning<00:04:04.270> down<00:04:04.420> anything

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
you're not really toning down anything

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.320 
you're not really toning down anything
are<00:04:05.050> we<00:04:05.590> anyway<00:04:06.400> have<00:04:06.760> fun<00:04:06.790> with<00:04:07.180> it
