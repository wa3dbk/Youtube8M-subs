00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
at the number statistically once a guy

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.610 
at the number statistically once a guy
he's<00:03:04.500> 27<00:03:05.130> now<00:03:05.310> once<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.269> score<00:03:06.600> hits<00:03:06.840> 31<00:03:07.380> years

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
he's 27 now once the score hits 31 years

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.949 
he's 27 now once the score hits 31 years
old<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.010> numbers<00:03:08.340> tend<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.700> drop<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.660> think

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
old the numbers tend to drop so I think

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.660 
old the numbers tend to drop so I think
you're<00:03:10.319> looking<00:03:10.620> at<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.830> team<00:03:11.069> that<00:03:11.280> thinks<00:03:11.550> he

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
you're looking at a team that thinks he

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.370 
you're looking at a team that thinks he
can<00:03:11.850> make<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.030> difference<00:03:12.269> for<00:03:12.569> them<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
can make a difference for them in the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.410 
can make a difference for them in the
next<00:03:13.680> three<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.980> four<00:03:14.190> years<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:15.150> know<00:03:15.269> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
next three to four years you know the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.470 
next three to four years you know the
first<00:03:15.900> team<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.290> jumped<00:03:16.829> into<00:03:17.070> my<00:03:17.250> head<00:03:17.700> was

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
first team that jumped into my head was

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.810 
first team that jumped into my head was
Nashville<00:03:19.200> because<00:03:20.010> they've<00:03:20.190> had<00:03:20.430> interest

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
Nashville because they've had interest

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.170 
Nashville because they've had interest
in<00:03:20.910> him<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.570> past<00:03:22.130> when<00:03:23.130> Toronto<00:03:23.700> got<00:03:23.940> him

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
in him in the past when Toronto got him

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.090 
in him in the past when Toronto got him
Nashville<00:03:24.750> was<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.019> other<00:03:25.200> team<00:03:25.530> looking<00:03:25.980> at

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
Nashville was the other team looking at

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.580 
Nashville was the other team looking at
getting<00:03:26.400> them<00:03:26.670> but<00:03:27.450> I'm<00:03:27.600> not<00:03:27.900> convinced<00:03:28.140> that

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
getting them but I'm not convinced that

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.039 
getting them but I'm not convinced that
Nashville<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:29.820> place<00:03:30.060> now<00:03:30.360> for<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.840> couple

Nashville is the place now for a couple

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.740 
Nashville is the place now for a couple
of<00:03:31.320> reasons<00:03:31.519> number<00:03:32.519> one<00:03:32.670> they<00:03:33.480> have

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
everything that comes with that that

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.250 
everything that comes with that that
would<00:04:21.180> be<00:04:21.330> my<00:04:21.479> question<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:21.989> know<00:04:22.080> and<00:04:22.200> of

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
would be my question you know and of

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.719 
would be my question you know and of
course<00:04:22.409> Nashville<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:22.830> go<00:04:23.070> back<00:04:23.280> there<00:04:23.310> that

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
course Nashville you go back there that

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.550 
course Nashville you go back there that
that<00:04:24.060> was<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.390> other<00:04:24.510> team<00:04:24.750> in<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:24.990> bidding

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
that was the other team in the bidding

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.440 
that was the other team in the bidding
so<00:04:25.680> I<00:04:26.010> still<00:04:26.639> think<00:04:26.850> yeah<00:04:26.970> if<00:04:27.090> they<00:04:27.210> had<00:04:27.360> the

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
so I still think yeah if they had the

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.670 
so I still think yeah if they had the
money<00:04:27.630> they<00:04:27.840> would<00:04:27.930> try<00:04:28.139> to<00:04:28.169> make<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.440> work

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
money they would try to make it work

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.440 
money they would try to make it work

Toronto<00:04:37.560> I<00:04:37.590> just<00:04:37.889> think<00:04:38.070> it's<00:04:38.190> it's<00:04:38.340> it's<00:04:38.520> a

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
Toronto I just think it's it's it's a

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.850 
Toronto I just think it's it's it's a
funny<00:04:38.970> thing<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.330> he<00:04:40.110> doesn't<00:04:40.290> mind<00:04:40.560> this

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
funny thing that he doesn't mind this

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.340 
funny thing that he doesn't mind this
fishbowl<00:04:41.490> in<00:04:42.000> Toronto<00:04:42.570> he<00:04:42.750> seems<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.080> handle

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
fishbowl in Toronto he seems to handle

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.570 
fishbowl in Toronto he seems to handle
it<00:04:43.440> quite<00:04:43.620> well<00:04:43.800> but<00:04:43.950> he<00:04:44.040> doesn't<00:04:44.310> seem<00:04:44.370> to

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
it quite well but he doesn't seem to

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.340 
it quite well but he doesn't seem to
embrace<00:04:44.790> it<00:04:45.060> either<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:45.540> it's<00:04:46.020> kind<00:04:46.290> of

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
embrace it either so it's kind of

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.260 
embrace it either so it's kind of
strange<00:04:46.560> that<00:04:46.710> way<00:04:46.980> so<00:04:47.040> if<00:04:47.610> it's<00:04:47.820> time<00:04:48.030> to<00:04:48.180> go

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
strange that way so if it's time to go

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.260 
strange that way so if it's time to go
somewhere<00:04:48.600> else<00:04:48.660> now<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:50.430> me<00:04:50.550> Vancouver<00:04:51.120> I

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
somewhere else now to me Vancouver I

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.940 
somewhere else now to me Vancouver I
know<00:04:51.330> they<00:04:51.570> have<00:04:51.660> cap<00:04:51.870> issues<00:04:52.050> okay<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:52.800> that

know they have cap issues okay and that

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.530 
know they have cap issues okay and that
but<00:04:53.130> I<00:04:53.190> mean<00:04:53.220> they<00:04:53.850> need<00:04:54.030> more<00:04:54.150> balanced

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
but I mean they need more balanced

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
if a team like Calgary would have any

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.360
