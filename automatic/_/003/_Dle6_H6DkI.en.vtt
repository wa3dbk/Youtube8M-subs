00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
always stay on so what I did was

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.319 
always stay on so what I did was
actually<00:00:35.309> called<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.730> tape<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.149> want

to find out the size of their pouch to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.430 
to find out the size of their pouch to
see<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:38.969> would<00:00:39.090> even<00:00:39.360> hold<00:00:39.750> an<00:00:39.960> iphone<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.660 
see if would even hold an iphone with a
case<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.890> because<00:00:41.100> most<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.370> these<00:00:41.460> things

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
case on it because most of these things

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.670 
case on it because most of these things
are<00:00:41.850> pretty<00:00:41.969> tight<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.510> don't<00:00:43.230> hold<00:00:43.440> anything

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680

are pretty tight and don't hold anything
more<00:00:44.010> than<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> phone<00:00:44.489> itself<00:00:44.930> when<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> call

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
more than the phone itself when I call

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900 
more than the phone itself when I call
to<00:00:46.320> ask<00:00:46.469> them<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.039> told<00:00:47.610> them<00:00:47.730> what<00:00:47.820> my

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
intentions one they said no problem

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.040 
intentions one they said no problem

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
works really well couch sticks out a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.469 
works really well couch sticks out a
little<00:01:22.680> bit<00:01:22.860> more<00:01:23.040> than<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
little bit more than I like but it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.570 
little bit more than I like but it
actually<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.990> an<00:01:25.170> adequate<00:01:25.470> size<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:26.250> holding

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
actually is an adequate size for holding

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.289 
actually is an adequate size for holding
in<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.780> headphones<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.790> actually<00:01:29.939> works

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
in the headphones so it actually works

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.580 
in the headphones so it actually works
well<00:01:32.810> at<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> bottom<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.259> case<00:01:34.409> these

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
well at the bottom of the case these

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
well at the bottom of the case these
guys<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.220> done<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> good<00:01:35.640> job<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.180> can

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
guys have really done a good job you can

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.210 
guys have really done a good job you can
see<00:01:36.540> where<00:01:36.750> they<00:01:36.869> kind<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.470> made<00:01:37.619> holes<00:01:37.860> out

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
see where they kind of made holes out

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.520 
see where they kind of made holes out
for<00:01:38.520> where<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> speakers<00:01:39.150> are<00:01:39.299> doesn't<00:01:40.290> line

for where the speakers are doesn't line

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.670 
for where the speakers are doesn't line
up<00:01:40.560> perfectly<00:01:42.079> but<00:01:43.079> lines<00:01:43.259> up<00:01:43.409> well<00:01:43.560> enough

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
up perfectly but lines up well enough

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.870 
up perfectly but lines up well enough
that<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.159> hear<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> phone<00:01:44.640> when<00:01:44.790> it

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
that you can hear the phone when it

that you can hear the phone when it
makes<00:01:45.000> noise<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:46.070> I<00:01:47.070> don't<00:01:47.340> know<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.579> can

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
makes noise and I don't know if you can

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.120 
makes noise and I don't know if you can
see<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.290> patch<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.560> actually

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
see this but the patch is actually

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.639 
see this but the patch is actually
really<00:01:50.369> quite<00:01:51.000> roomy<00:01:51.780> which<00:01:52.259> doesn't

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
really quite roomy which doesn't

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.649 
really quite roomy which doesn't
actually<00:01:52.710> bother<00:01:53.070> me<00:01:53.399> because<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.630> know

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
actually bother me because as you know

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.639 
actually bother me because as you know
the<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.380> ifrogz<00:01:56.070> has<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.030> has<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> tacky<00:01:58.320> feel

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
the the ifrogz has it has a tacky feel

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.350 
the the ifrogz has it has a tacky feel
to<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> was<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> tight<00:01:59.790> case<00:02:00.119> this

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
to it so if it was a tight case this

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.880 
to it so if it was a tight case this
thing<00:02:00.570> would<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:00.810> hard<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.469> slip<00:02:01.770> in

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
thing would be hard really to slip in

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.800 
thing would be hard really to slip in
and<00:02:02.009> out<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.060> slips<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.719> out

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
and out but it really slips in and out

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.169 
and out but it really slips in and out
very<00:02:04.290> easily<00:02:05.299> not<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> lot<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.689> force<00:02:07.160> but

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
very easily not with a lot of force but

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.089 
very easily not with a lot of force but
holds<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.300> well<00:02:09.509> enough<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.830> shaking<00:02:10.830> it

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
holds in well enough that shaking it

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.440 
holds in well enough that shaking it
doesn't<00:02:12.030> really<00:02:12.180> dislodge<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.750> coming<00:02:13.200> out

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
doesn't really dislodge it coming out

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.720 
doesn't really dislodge it coming out
