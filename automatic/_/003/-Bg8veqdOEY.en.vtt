00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 welcome to a first 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 video my name is mario and i would 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.760
 Happy if you subscribe 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.290
 I would show you today as I 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.889
 find the easiest way like a tank 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.299
 I can get from the military base 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.850
 find me as you see the big one 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.970
 Airport form a diary that exists 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.710
 the first thing he needs is the second one 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.619
 The working head is looking away from 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.230
 Leicester because that's what it should be 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.820
 not a problem 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.740
 so now I'll show you where we are 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.010
 want to go 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.610
 So that 's the big airport and here in the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.860
 north is the moment but too 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.129
 far 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:48.230
 here is the military base 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.230
 there are the tanks in gta online 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.830
 yes , let's go if 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.930
 you times here at the airport no kg top 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.250
 four should find then just ride 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.470
 a bit further away and if he does 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.630
 comes back then usually change the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.330
 Types of helicopters we on the three 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.470
 parking spaces 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.780
 You can also do the little ones 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.590
 Airport landscapes should pass by 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.590
 from it finds 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.130
 I believe the cobox in tampere with 22 3 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.590
 we did not quite sure and 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.870
 the function head can look away 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.970
 would have to have a certain level and 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.970
 some missions makes for leaves 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.820
 By the way, it should be another 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.970
 Possibility of giving armor from the beta 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.560
 phase to get by on one 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.909
 nearby mountain sets and enters 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.520
 bit the passenger vehicles in the 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.560
 base produced 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.830
 then the tanks should be out someday 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.810
 driving by the meter and we can do it 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.890
 At the beginning, however, I have never been 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.080
 probably not so succeeded 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.929
 either I was bad of that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.890
 Chancellor is captured or the tanks are 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.890
 just not to come out 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.069
 well as I said I think this is 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.180
 the easiest way if you have the 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:22.489
 function and should have the character 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.510
 but sunset fourth kind online 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.260
 because I am a little bit the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.340
 dark I can you was to 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.340
 do not show so good 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.239
 By the way, I'm playing one of those 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.269
 Playstation 3 and take over the action 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.920
 gamepad for HDTV, even if so 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.490
 actually quite satisfied though 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.510
 over the playstation 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:57.170
 no party and lets play recorded 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.170
 possible are 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.849
 but it is youtube skill 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.020
 so back there before the next mountain 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.290
 so it is right there then it will be 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.290
 serious 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.720
 Seeing the world why I really need to be there 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.090
 required of no bock has namely 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.940
 possibility to drive a godfather out 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.370
 with other vehicles 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.520
 can transport 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:47.390
 for that you have to give the courts the rights 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.430
 press button shows something equally should 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.800
 now come from meaningful right again 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.370
 around and comes from the east on the back 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.660
 part of the tenant bades to beech now 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.660
 once last office 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.890
 activate visco foam 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.410
 and now I do not get any planning 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.590
 star otherwise you get a lot of drive 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.720
 and if you look at the military base 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.560
 a few liters of wine are here in the back 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.100
 Part are mostly tanks but there 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.630
 is already one 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:30.240
 sometimes they also stand around then it is 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.240
 little easier I must have look 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:40.220
 now the right hook the hag 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:41.659
 extend and the tank with now the 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.199
 Working head is looking away is the three 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:47.169
 minutes activated so can now in 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:54.909
 rest the grounds leave at the me 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:54.909
 attacked whole city area 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:03.520
 yes that 's it already as you see it 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.520
 is relatively unproblematic 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.090
 Thank you for your watching and 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.090
 say until next time
