used to rock climb so like I think a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.620 
used to rock climb so like I think a
rock<00:01:20.430> climbing<00:01:20.820> doll<00:01:20.970> would<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.390> cool

American<00:01:23.250> got<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.610> yeah<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:24.810> like

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
American got to have yeah and then like

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.130 
American got to have yeah and then like
I<00:01:25.110> think<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:26.220> she<00:01:26.400> would<00:01:26.549> look<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.140> I

think maybe gray eyes since Molly's now

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.120 
think maybe gray eyes since Molly's now
retired<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.409> she<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> only<00:01:31.890> doll

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
with grey eyes and then probably like

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.300

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
have to admit the girls of the years

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.729 
have to admit the girls of the years
like<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.750> past<00:02:53.930> couple<00:02:54.170> years<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.530> haven't

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
like the past couple years I haven't

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.350 
like the past couple years I haven't
been<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.010> best<00:02:55.040> but<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.610> really<00:02:56.030> want<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.269> get

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
been the best but I really want to get

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.210 
been the best but I really want to get
Kanani<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.019> of<00:02:57.110> course<00:02:57.319> punany<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:57.799> gone<00:02:58.010> and

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
Kanani and of course punany is gone and

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.830 
Kanani and of course punany is gone and
she's<00:02:58.370> not<00:02:58.400> coming<00:02:58.549> back<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.480> think<00:02:59.600> it

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
she's not coming back so I think it

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.170 
she's not coming back so I think it
would<00:02:59.989> be<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:00.319> a<00:03:00.380> good<00:03:00.590> idea<00:03:00.620> for<00:03:01.180> American

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
would be like a good idea for American

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.819 
would be like a good idea for American
girl<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.540> take<00:03:02.660> like<00:03:02.840> one<00:03:03.079> year<00:03:03.320> instead<00:03:03.769> of

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
girl to take like one year instead of

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.640 
girl to take like one year instead of
like<00:03:04.359> making<00:03:05.359> a<00:03:05.450> new<00:03:05.600> girl<00:03:05.780> year<00:03:06.140> they<00:03:06.440> could

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
like making a new girl year they could

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.410 
like making a new girl year they could
just<00:03:06.680> bring<00:03:07.070> back<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> couple<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.239> girl

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
just bring back a couple of the girl

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.330 
just bring back a couple of the girl
years<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.049> then<00:03:09.230> they<00:03:09.350> could<00:03:09.500> have<00:03:09.680> all<00:03:09.950> those

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
years and then they could have all those

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.680 
years and then they could have all those
I<00:03:10.640> think<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:11.209> would<00:03:11.299> be<00:03:11.359> a<00:03:11.450> good<00:03:11.570> idea

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
I think that would be a good idea

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.420 
I think that would be a good idea
although<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.920> would<00:03:13.040> be<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.190> lot<00:03:13.400> of

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
although that would be a lot of

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.770 
although that would be a lot of
merchandise<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:14.150> make<00:03:14.269> but<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.450> think<00:03:14.720> that

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
merchandise to make but I think that

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.420 
merchandise to make but I think that
that<00:03:14.900> would<00:03:15.109> be<00:03:15.290> really<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.769> really<00:03:16.160> good<00:03:16.310> idea

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
that would be really a really good idea

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.060 
that would be really a really good idea
