00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.890
 this is not the second video I upload and the reason why there were them is because 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.770
 this reason the other day I was philosophizing 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.889
 It's been three years since the premiere of Super Smash Bros. Brawl 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.149
 game to match or the best game of the wii so far 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:16.730
 and I started thinking 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.650
 what would happen if the next e3 gave us the surprise of another super smash 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.970
 bros 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.980
 personally, that would fascinate me 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.510
 since they would have the opportunity to polish some mistakes they had in the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.089
 last delivery 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.329
 when searching the network 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.910
 I realized that I'm not the only person who thinks what I 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.790
 apparently many are already speculating about the new project of al 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.649
 laboratories 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.650
 and it is prudent to think about it 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.530
 since every home console from the nintendo 64 onwards have had a 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.000
 delivery of this series 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.020
 in the network is known by the code name of super is more bros 4 there 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.770
 some videos on 'youtube' that talk about the possible characters 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.690
 eligible 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.470
 the attending characters 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.820
 stadiums applications among other things 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.820
 between what they comment more highlights 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.190
 eligible characters 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.640
 perhaps what worries us all the most 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.920
 well to the point that I want to reach and to which everyone wants to hear the characters 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.140
 third party 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.270
 Yes it is 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.490
 as in the last installment we observed that the fighters of this game were not 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.120
 only from the nintendo brand but they were special guests 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.500
 and of the greatest category these two characters were solidity me and that sonic 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.400
 the Hedgehog 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.490
 however, we all had the question of 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.140
 because only pull party characters 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.420
 that is, nintendo forgot some brands among which and those that 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.290
 I was surprised 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.070
 I had high hopes that mega man would appear as a special guest 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.090
 that's not to mention the other brands like ubisoft lan com escuer in mexía tahri 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.670
 and now that we really know the answer and they are two words 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.220
 legal matters 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.650
 it's not very easy to say I want to fulanito x series character for me 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.210
 game 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.560
 it's more than that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.739
 it involves a lot of paperwork a lot to sign and a lot to respect 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.019
 still I think that nintendo will give us a surprise for the next one is more 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.440
 now a few rumors that I've heard about the characters 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.609

 Well yes you do not miss much and if you have played you will know what I mean 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.349
 when I say that the online game of he is more is a real butt pain 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.259
 that's why some people believe that this will be improved and in a way 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:54.719
 amazing some suggest a hotel where you get with your mii you walk 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:58.569
 until you find some adversary you put a few washes in a game 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.739
 and then you have the option to aggravate it as a friend 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.110
 others believe that it will be through a channel 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.709

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.549

 can not be 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.879
 or not the yellow color only changes his wristbands 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.410
 what would happen if the programmers gave us an option to customize 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.260
 our favorite characters 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.379

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.340
