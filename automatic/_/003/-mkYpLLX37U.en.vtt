00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
and the first time I really focused on

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.690 
and the first time I really focused on
healing<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.110> support<00:00:13.679> abilities<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.549> the

healing and support abilities for the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.880 
healing and support abilities for the
monk<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.839> time<00:00:15.870> around<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.529> was<00:00:16.650> looking

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
monk so this time around I was looking

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.710 
monk so this time around I was looking
to<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.100> something<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.550> bit<00:00:17.699> different<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.630> I

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
to do something a bit different and I

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.510 
to do something a bit different and I
kind<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.050> stumbled<00:00:19.260> across<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:20.039> polar

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
kind of stumbled across the polar

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.970 
kind of stumbled across the polar
opposite<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.420> previous<00:00:21.840> build<00:00:22.289> as<00:00:22.859> you

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
opposite of that previous build as you

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.920 
opposite of that previous build as you
might<00:00:23.160> see<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.240> title<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.720> this

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
might see to the in the title of this

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.380 
might see to the in the title of this
video<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.769> managed<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.730> create<00:00:27.000> kind<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.269> an

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
video I managed to create kind of an

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.009 
video I managed to create kind of an
evil<00:00:27.810> monk<00:00:28.340> it's<00:00:29.340> more<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.179> thematic<00:00:30.420> build

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
evil monk it's more of a thematic build

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.990 
evil monk it's more of a thematic build
than<00:00:31.710> anything<00:00:32.070> although<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.340> find<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.759> it's

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
than anything although I find it it's

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.670 
than anything although I find it it's
going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> be<00:00:33.390> very<00:00:33.540> functional<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.260> think<00:00:34.500> to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
going to be very functional I think to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.970 
going to be very functional I think to
has<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> lot<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> good<00:00:35.520> skill<00:00:35.850> combinations<00:00:36.980> but

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
has a lot of good skill combinations but

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.010 
has a lot of good skill combinations but
really<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> idea<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.390> pick<00:00:39.629> all<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
really the idea here was to pick all the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.950 
really the idea here was to pick all the
skills<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.410> looked<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:41.040> evil<00:00:41.960> things

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
skills that looked really evil things

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.290 
skills that looked really evil things
that<00:00:43.140> cause<00:00:43.320> your<00:00:43.500> opponents<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> explode<00:00:44.879> set

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that cause your opponents to explode set

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.880 
that cause your opponents to explode set
them<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.539> fire<00:00:45.750> shoot<00:00:46.230> them<00:00:46.379> with<00:00:46.410> lightning

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
them on fire shoot them with lightning

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.010 
them on fire shoot them with lightning
like<00:00:47.039> some<00:00:47.250> kind<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.460> dark<00:00:47.730> jedi<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.899> normally

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
like some kind of dark jedi we normally

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.619 
like some kind of dark jedi we normally
think<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> monk<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.820> anyway<00:00:51.149> as<00:00:51.329> kind

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
think of the monk I think anyway as kind

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.720 
think of the monk I think anyway as kind
of<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.840> holy<00:00:52.079> warrior<00:00:52.500> somebody<00:00:53.039> who<00:00:53.190> protects

of a holy warrior somebody who protects

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.029 
of a holy warrior somebody who protects
people<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.629> think<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.199> monks<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.739> kung

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
people you think of the monks from kung

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.490 
people you think of the monks from kung
fu<00:00:56.250> movies<00:00:56.640> or<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.570> general<00:00:57.719> monk<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.350> just

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
has more benevolent tone to it but

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.450 
has more benevolent tone to it but
looking<00:01:01.170> at<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> lot<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.590> these<00:01:01.680> skills<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.250> he

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
looking at a lot of these skills a he

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.860 
looking at a lot of these skills a he
really<00:01:02.579> has<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> ability<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.300> set<00:01:03.539> people<00:01:03.660> on

fire<00:01:03.930> shoot<00:01:04.680> them<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:04.799> lightning<00:01:05.280> make<00:01:05.909> them

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
fire shoot them with lightning make them

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.010 
fire shoot them with lightning make them
explode<00:01:06.360> snap<00:01:07.080> their<00:01:07.290> bones<00:01:07.850> some<00:01:08.850> in

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
explode snap their bones some in

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.390 
explode snap their bones some in
otherworldly<00:01:10.020> allies<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.799> potentially

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
otherworldly allies that potentially

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.550 
otherworldly allies that potentially
could<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.760> fire<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.360> otherwise<00:01:13.049> explode

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
could be on fire and otherwise explode

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
could be on fire and otherwise explode
as<00:01:13.710> well<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.580> thought<00:01:14.939> there<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> lot<00:01:15.330> of

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
as well so I thought there was a lot of

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.270 
as well so I thought there was a lot of
potential<00:01:15.689> person<00:01:16.110> kind<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.380> evil<00:01:16.740> skills<00:01:17.100> for

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
potential person kind of evil skills for

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.660 
potential person kind of evil skills for
a<00:01:17.340> monk<00:01:17.580> maybe<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.600> monk<00:01:18.869> who<00:01:19.340> leans<00:01:20.340> more

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
a monk maybe a monk who leans more

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.999 
a monk maybe a monk who leans more
towards<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> evil<00:01:21.450> side<00:01:21.630> having<00:01:21.930> dished<00:01:22.890> out

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
towards the evil side having dished out

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.740 
towards the evil side having dished out
so<00:01:23.220> much<00:01:23.310> pain<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.909> violence<00:01:24.119> over<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> years

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
so much pain and violence over the years

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.020 
so much pain and violence over the years
he<00:01:24.960> may<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.560> became<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> little<00:01:26.220> bit<00:01:26.310> corrupted

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
he may be became a little bit corrupted

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.090 
he may be became a little bit corrupted
so<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> thought<00:01:27.659> would<00:01:27.810> be<00:01:27.840> kind<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.200> fun<00:01:28.740> team

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
so I thought would be kind of a fun team

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.399 
so I thought would be kind of a fun team
and<00:01:29.369> build<00:01:29.549> not<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.570> much<00:01:30.689> necessarily<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and build not so much necessarily a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.350 
and build not so much necessarily a
role-playing<00:01:31.920> build<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.030> i<00:01:33.150> don't<00:01:33.299> think

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
role-playing build because i don't think

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.469 
role-playing build because i don't think
diablo<00:01:33.840> 3<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.079> best<00:01:34.979> play<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> type<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.000> game<00:01:36.270> to

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
diablo 3 is best play a type of game to

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.600 
diablo 3 is best play a type of game to
be<00:01:36.659> role<00:01:36.930> playing<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:38.310> seems<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
be role playing with but it seems like a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.359 
be role playing with but it seems like a
cool<00:01:38.850> theme<00:01:39.090> build<00:01:39.409> like<00:01:40.409> how<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> lot<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
cool theme build like how a lot of the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.249 
cool theme build like how a lot of the
skills<00:01:41.640> seem<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.030> work<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.390> without<00:01:43.020> any

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
skills seem to work so without any

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.960 
skills seem to work so without any
further<00:01:43.470> rambling<00:01:44.009> i<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.189> actually<00:01:44.460> get<00:01:44.729> onto

further rambling i was actually get onto

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.630 
further rambling i was actually get onto
the<00:01:45.060> bill<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:46.619> first<00:01:46.860> spirit<00:01:47.250> generating

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the bill the first spirit generating

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.550 
the bill the first spirit generating
attack<00:01:47.909> i<00:01:48.119> chose<00:01:48.390> for<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
attack i chose for this was the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.920 
attack i chose for this was the
exploding<00:01:50.130> palm<00:01:50.390> nothing<00:01:51.390> more<00:01:51.570> evil<00:01:51.899> than

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
exploding palm nothing more evil than

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.020 
exploding palm nothing more evil than
causing<00:01:52.380> your<00:01:52.649> opponents<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.130> explode<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
causing your opponents to explode and a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.300 
causing your opponents to explode and a
shower<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.540> blood<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.930> guts<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.470> that's<00:01:56.159> going

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
shower of blood and guts so that's going

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.940 
shower of blood and guts so that's going
to<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.460> my<00:01:56.610> first<00:01:56.880> skill<00:01:57.380> it's<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.500> pretty<00:01:58.710> good

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
to be my first skill it's a pretty good

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.359 
to be my first skill it's a pretty good
just<00:01:59.460> basic<00:02:00.149> attack<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:01.409> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.979> combo

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
just basic attack it's kind of a combo

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.889 
just basic attack it's kind of a combo
deal<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.670> first<00:02:02.850> two<00:02:03.000> attacks<00:02:03.329> deal<00:02:03.630> just

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
deal the first two attacks deal just

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.660 
deal the first two attacks deal just
good<00:02:04.049> damage<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.950> third<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.340> causes

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
good damage and the third one causes

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.789 
good damage and the third one causes
your<00:02:05.729> opponent<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.119> start<00:02:06.420> bleeding<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.170> if

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
your opponent to start bleeding and if

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.529

they die under the effects of that bleed

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.650 
they die under the effects of that bleed
they<00:02:10.259> will<00:02:10.500> while<00:02:11.099> under<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> mall<00:02:12.239> bleeding

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
they will while under the mall bleeding

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.340 
they will while under the mall bleeding
they<00:02:12.840> will

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
they will

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.170 
they will
load<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:14.130> shower<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.610> blood<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.880> guts<00:02:15.030> like

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.420 
load and a shower of blood and guts like
I<00:02:15.300> talked<00:02:15.480> about<00:02:15.540> earlier<00:02:15.980> which<00:02:16.980> doesn't

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
I talked about earlier which doesn't

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.670 
I talked about earlier which doesn't
seem<00:02:17.550> all<00:02:17.730> too<00:02:17.940> holy<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.300> me<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.140> fits<00:02:19.470> well

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
seem all too holy to me so it fits well

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.010 
seem all too holy to me so it fits well
into<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.040> evil<00:02:20.370> monk<00:02:21.000> build<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.450> figure<00:02:21.840> and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
into this evil monk build I figure and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.650 
into this evil monk build I figure and
the<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.100> decided<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.640> ruin<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.510> can

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
the I decided to ruin it so that I can

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.360 
the I decided to ruin it so that I can
hit<00:02:24.840> up<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.110> five<00:02:25.380> enemies<00:02:25.800> with<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.100> bleed

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
hit up to five enemies with the bleed

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.820 
hit up to five enemies with the bleed
effect<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.110> potentially<00:02:28.110> cause<00:02:28.290> massive

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
effect and potentially cause massive

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.180 
effect and potentially cause massive
chain<00:02:29.160> explosions<00:02:29.970> because<00:02:30.870> if<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:32.010> first

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
chain explosions because if the first

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.680 
chain explosions because if the first
enemy<00:02:32.400> dies<00:02:32.700> while<00:02:32.970> bleeding<00:02:33.210> there's<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> good

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
enemy dies while bleeding there's a good

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.000 
enemy dies while bleeding there's a good
chance<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.110> guy<00:02:34.200> next<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.530> him<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.770> going<00:02:34.920> to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
chance the guy next to him is going to

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.850 
chance the guy next to him is going to
get<00:02:35.190> killed<00:02:35.490> by<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.670> explosion<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.740> if<00:02:37.740> I'm

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
get killed by that explosion and if I'm

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.350 
get killed by that explosion and if I'm
just<00:02:38.070> wailing<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.670> people<00:02:38.910> with<00:02:39.030> exploding

just wailing on people with exploding

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.060 
just wailing on people with exploding
palm<00:02:39.630> I'll<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:39.930> causing<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.380> lot<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.590> people<00:02:40.890> to

bleed with that third strike and

potentially cause a lot of chain
explosions<00:02:45.540> which<00:02:45.750> seems<00:02:46.050> quite<00:02:46.830> dastardly

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
explosions which seems quite dastardly

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.520 
explosions which seems quite dastardly
to<00:02:47.640> me<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.910> be<00:02:48.030> exploding<00:02:48.900> all<00:02:48.990> my<00:02:49.140> enemies<00:02:49.260> in

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
to me to be exploding all my enemies in

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.450 
to me to be exploding all my enemies in
a<00:02:49.650> huge<00:02:50.490> meat<00:02:50.850> explosion<00:02:51.710> so<00:02:52.710> that<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
a huge meat explosion so that is the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.100 
a huge meat explosion so that is the
first<00:02:53.760> skill<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.300> start<00:02:54.510> off<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.630> evil<00:02:54.900> monk

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
first skill to start off the evil monk

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.230 
first skill to start off the evil monk
build<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:56.430> second<00:02:56.670> one<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.850> chose<00:02:57.030> was

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
build and the second one I chose was

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.210 
build and the second one I chose was
fists<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.750> thunder<00:02:58.080> could<00:02:58.770> be<00:02:58.860> another<00:02:59.070> good

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
fists of thunder could be another good

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.190 
fists of thunder could be another good
spirit<00:02:59.670> generating<00:03:00.060> an<00:03:00.120> attack<00:03:00.390> it's

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
spirit generating an attack it's

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.900 
spirit generating an attack it's
something<00:03:01.440> i<00:03:01.500> would<00:03:01.680> plan<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.980> use<00:03:02.580> while

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
something i would plan to use while

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.580 
something i would plan to use while
having<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.450> lot<00:03:03.600> of<00:03:03.690> enemies<00:03:03.930> under<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.350> bleed

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
having a lot of enemies under the bleed

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.930 
having a lot of enemies under the bleed
effect<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.100> i<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.250> cause<00:03:05.430> those<00:03:05.640> chain

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
effect so i can cause those chain

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.240 
effect so i can cause those chain
explosions<00:03:06.570> does<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> lot<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:07.830> damage

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
explosions does a lot of damage

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.980 
explosions does a lot of damage
lightning<00:03:08.670> damage<00:03:08.850> it's<00:03:09.540> also<00:03:09.660> going<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.870> be<00:03:09.930> a

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
lightning damage it's also going to be a

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.680 
lightning damage it's also going to be a
secondary<00:03:10.410> source<00:03:10.740> of<00:03:11.010> damage<00:03:11.430> type<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:12.090> think

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
secondary source of damage type I think

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.760 
secondary source of damage type I think
they've<00:03:12.870> mentioned<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.410> they're<00:03:13.590> going<00:03:13.680> to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
they've mentioned that they're going to

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.680 
they've mentioned that they're going to
have<00:03:13.980> some<00:03:14.280> damage<00:03:14.940> immunities<00:03:15.480> and

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
have some damage immunities and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.840 
have some damage immunities and
resistances<00:03:16.380> in<00:03:16.440> this<00:03:16.680> game<00:03:16.890> especially<00:03:17.790> in

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
resistances in this game especially in

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.180 
resistances in this game especially in
the<00:03:17.940> higher<00:03:18.150> difficulty<00:03:18.960> so<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.770> do<00:03:19.890> want<00:03:20.070> to

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
the higher difficulty so you do want to

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.190 
the higher difficulty so you do want to
diversify<00:03:20.460> your<00:03:20.940> attacks<00:03:21.360> much<00:03:21.630> like<00:03:21.810> we<00:03:21.990> used

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
diversify your attacks much like we used
