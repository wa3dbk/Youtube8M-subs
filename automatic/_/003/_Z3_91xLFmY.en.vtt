00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.709 

also<00:01:06.700> my<00:01:07.829> my<00:01:08.829> port<00:01:09.189> score<00:01:09.520> is<00:01:09.729> it's<00:01:10.359> getting<00:01:10.600> up

there almost maxed out as well as my
distance<00:01:13.329> so<00:01:13.630> that<00:01:13.929> should<00:01:14.140> be<00:01:14.170> done<00:01:14.380> within

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
distance so that should be done within

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.120 
distance so that should be done within
the<00:01:14.829> next<00:01:14.979> week<00:01:15.189> or<00:01:15.310> two<00:01:16.649> getting<00:01:17.649> my<00:01:17.740> upgrades

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
the next week or two getting my upgrades

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.179 
the next week or two getting my upgrades
my<00:01:18.549> port<00:01:18.819> upgrades<00:01:19.590> not<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:20.740> important

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
my port upgrades not that important

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.330 
my port upgrades not that important
honestly<00:01:21.939> I<00:01:22.299> I<00:01:22.899> tried<00:01:23.319> to<00:01:23.500> really<00:01:23.740> look<00:01:24.159> at

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
honestly I I tried to really look at

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.359 
honestly I I tried to really look at
what<00:01:24.640> i<00:01:24.670> think<00:01:24.939> is<00:01:25.060> going<00:01:25.240> to<00:01:25.299> be<00:01:25.329> worth<00:01:25.569> doing

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
what i think is going to be worth doing

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.219 
what i think is going to be worth doing
but<00:01:27.369> i<00:01:27.610> think<00:01:27.939> the<00:01:28.329> refurbished<00:01:28.810> bar<00:01:28.959> is<00:01:29.079> all

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
but i think the refurbished bar is all

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.569 
but i think the refurbished bar is all
you<00:01:29.350> need<00:01:30.539> depending<00:01:31.539> of<00:01:32.259> course<00:01:32.649> like<00:01:33.369> this

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
you need depending of course like this

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.690 
you need depending of course like this
is<00:01:33.729> going<00:01:33.939> to<00:01:34.090> depend<00:01:34.240> on<00:01:34.979> what<00:01:35.979> you<00:01:36.459> want<00:01:36.640> to

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
is going to depend on what you want to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.740 
is going to depend on what you want to
do<00:01:36.939> for<00:01:37.929> your<00:01:38.079> endgame<00:01:38.470> crew<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:40.119> i'll<00:01:40.539> talk<00:01:40.689> a

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
do for your endgame crew and i'll talk a

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.120 
do for your endgame crew and i'll talk a
little<00:01:40.929> bit<00:01:41.110> more<00:01:41.200> about<00:01:41.259> that<00:01:41.439> in<00:01:41.679> a<00:01:41.739> second

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
little bit more about that in a second

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.139 
little bit more about that in a second
but<00:01:42.909> fourth<00:01:43.509> ship<00:01:43.810> this<00:01:44.770> here<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.759> this

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
but fourth ship this here the this

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.870 
but fourth ship this here the this
building<00:01:46.599> doesn't<00:01:46.959> really<00:01:47.200> matter<00:01:47.409> if<00:01:47.880> you

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
building doesn't really matter if you

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.929 
building doesn't really matter if you
don't<00:01:49.060> really<00:01:49.179> have<00:01:49.420> a<00:01:49.479> bank<00:01:49.810> skill<00:01:50.200> left<00:01:50.439> so

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
don't really have a bank skill left so

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.399 
don't really have a bank skill left so
yeah<00:01:51.939> just<00:01:52.299> one<00:01:52.450> thing<00:01:52.599> to<00:01:52.659> keep<00:01:52.869> in<00:01:53.020> mind<00:01:53.079> i

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
yeah just one thing to keep in mind i

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.229 
yeah just one thing to keep in mind i
guess<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.759> i<00:01:54.819> didn't<00:01:55.060> need<00:01:55.179> to<00:01:55.270> buy<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.630> this

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.239 
guess so i didn't need to buy that this

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:00.179 
guess so i didn't need to buy that this
this<00:01:58.239> is<00:01:58.450> important<00:01:58.989> i<00:01:59.110> think<00:01:59.170> but<00:01:59.770> i<00:01:59.829> didn't

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
this is important i think but i didn't

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.770 
this is important i think but i didn't
want<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.399> go<00:02:00.489> back<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.670> get<00:02:00.909> 2k<00:02:01.299> bamboo

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
want to go back and get 2k bamboo

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.630 
want to go back and get 2k bamboo
because<00:02:02.349> I<00:02:02.679> would<00:02:02.799> have<00:02:02.890> taken<00:02:03.069> probably

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
because I would have taken probably

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.789 
because I would have taken probably
three<00:02:04.060> days<00:02:04.239> to<00:02:04.509> do<00:02:04.659> well<00:02:05.259> two<00:02:05.439> or<00:02:05.590> three<00:02:05.770> days

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
three days to do well two or three days

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.550 
three days to do well two or three days
maybe<00:02:06.369> because<00:02:07.360> it<00:02:07.509> you<00:02:07.810> don't<00:02:07.989> always<00:02:08.229> get

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
maybe because it you don't always get

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.109 
maybe because it you don't always get
bamboo<00:02:08.890> missions<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.549> when<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:09.850> do<00:02:09.970> it's

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
bamboo missions and when you do it's

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.180 
bamboo missions and when you do it's
only<00:02:10.239> for<00:02:10.509> like<00:02:10.600> 80<00:02:10.959> so<00:02:11.440> would<00:02:11.769> have<00:02:11.859> taken<00:02:12.010> a

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
only for like 80 so would have taken a

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.340 
only for like 80 so would have taken a
while<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:12.730> wasn't<00:02:13.720> really<00:02:13.840> sure<00:02:13.959> if<00:02:14.109> that's

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
while I wasn't really sure if that's

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.319 
while I wasn't really sure if that's
going<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.530> be<00:02:14.680> worth<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.100> for<00:02:15.280> an<00:02:15.730> extra<00:02:16.030> one

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
going to be worth it for an extra one

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.379 
going to be worth it for an extra one
percent<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.109> crew<00:02:17.579> but<00:02:18.579> the<00:02:18.730> speed<00:02:19.030> stats

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:19.389 
percent for crew but the speed stats

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.140 
percent for crew but the speed stats
would<00:02:19.569> have<00:02:19.660> been<00:02:19.750> nice<00:02:19.959> but<00:02:21.060> wouldn't<00:02:22.060> have

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
would have been nice but wouldn't have

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.500 
would have been nice but wouldn't have
made<00:02:22.269> that<00:02:22.329> much<00:02:22.630> of<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.840> difference<00:02:24.510> again

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
made that much of a difference again

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.500 
made that much of a difference again
here<00:02:26.079> with<00:02:26.769> your<00:02:26.920> ship<00:02:27.100> right<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.269> all

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
here with your ship right this is all

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.080 
here with your ship right this is all
based<00:02:28.840> on<00:02:29.139> whatever<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.739> want<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.160> do<00:02:30.430> I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
based on whatever you want it to do I

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.390 
based on whatever you want it to do I
think<00:02:32.079> this<00:02:32.230> sleek<00:02:32.530> ship<00:02:32.769> right<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.069> probably

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
think this sleek ship right is probably

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.520 
think this sleek ship right is probably
the<00:02:33.549> best<00:02:33.760> because<00:02:34.750> you'll<00:02:34.930> get<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.200> extra

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
the best because you'll get the extra

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.550 
the best because you'll get the extra
speed<00:02:36.540> speed<00:02:37.540> when<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.810> comes<00:02:37.989> to<00:02:38.139> ports<00:02:38.440> is

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
speed speed when it comes to ports is

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.770 
speed speed when it comes to ports is
the<00:02:38.650> most<00:02:38.799> important<00:02:39.220> thing<00:02:39.459> if<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:40.420> can<00:02:40.569> cut

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
the most important thing if you can cut

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.259 
the most important thing if you can cut
off<00:02:40.900> an<00:02:41.049> hour<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.470> time<00:02:41.709> then<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.819> want<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.150> do

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
off an hour of time then you want to do

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.740 
off an hour of time then you want to do
it<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:44.019> very<00:02:45.010> important<00:02:45.549> and<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:46.389> can't

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
it so very important and you can't

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.129 
it so very important and you can't
really<00:02:47.319> do<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.590> with<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:49.139> explosive

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
really do that with the explosive

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.900 
really do that with the explosive
experts<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.919> they<00:02:51.069> give<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.609> the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
experts that they give you and the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.360 
experts that they give you and the
fireworks<00:02:52.209> experts<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.829> speed<00:02:54.099> people

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
fireworks experts the speed people

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.920 
fireworks experts the speed people
basically<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:55.269> can't<00:02:55.510> really<00:02:55.750> do<00:02:55.900> that

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
basically you can't really do that

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.860 
basically you can't really do that
because<00:02:56.380> it's<00:02:57.160> not<00:02:57.340> viable<00:02:57.599> unless<00:02:58.599> you<00:02:58.750> go

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
because it's not viable unless you go

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.620 
because it's not viable unless you go
back<00:02:59.139> in<00:02:59.169> island<00:03:01.919> next<00:03:02.919> is<00:03:03.250> going<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.060> be<00:03:04.209> the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
back in island next is going to be the

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.629 
back in island next is going to be the
Imperial<00:03:05.049> warehouse<00:03:05.440> this<00:03:06.190> will<00:03:06.340> be<00:03:06.430> my<00:03:06.459> very

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
Imperial warehouse this will be my very

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.110 
Imperial warehouse this will be my very
last<00:03:07.239> upgrade<00:03:07.569> though<00:03:07.930> because<00:03:08.519> 10k<00:03:09.519> steel<00:03:09.849> is

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
last upgrade though because 10k steel is

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.140 
last upgrade though because 10k steel is
a<00:03:10.150> lot<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:12.400> I'm<00:03:12.519> not<00:03:12.669> really<00:03:12.819> worried<00:03:13.120> about

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
a lot so I'm not really worried about

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.719 
a lot so I'm not really worried about
that<00:03:13.419> other<00:03:13.630> than<00:03:14.350> that<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.590> did<00:03:14.889> throw<00:03:15.130> up<00:03:15.160> to

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:15.729 
that other than that I did throw up to

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:17.700 
that other than that I did throw up to
jade<00:03:16.389> statues

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
jade statues

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.770 
jade statues
because<00:03:18.460> they<00:03:18.610> do<00:03:18.670> increase<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.390> trade<00:03:19.600> goods

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
because they do increase the trade goods

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.740 
because they do increase the trade goods
received<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:21.190> didn't<00:03:21.550> really<00:03:21.700> see<00:03:22.090> any<00:03:22.330> purpose

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
received I didn't really see any purpose

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.200 
received I didn't really see any purpose
to<00:03:22.900> keeping<00:03:23.260> Jade<00:03:23.560> or<00:03:24.340> cherry<00:03:24.730> wood<00:03:24.910> at<00:03:25.060> this

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
to keeping Jade or cherry wood at this

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.180 
to keeping Jade or cherry wood at this
point<00:03:25.480> because<00:03:25.990> of<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.500> upgrades<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.100> I

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
point because of the upgrades that I

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.190 
point because of the upgrades that I

pretty solid captain not really too

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.960 
pretty solid captain not really too
spectacular<00:04:24.250> but<00:04:24.850> getting<00:04:25.420> there<00:04:26.760> this<00:04:27.760> is

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
spectacular but getting there this is

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.460 
spectacular but getting there this is
definitely<00:04:28.120> one<00:04:28.420> that<00:04:28.540> I'm<00:04:28.660> going<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.020> replace

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
definitely one that I'm going to replace

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.670 
definitely one that I'm going to replace
is<00:04:29.770> Honoka<00:04:30.250> because<00:04:31.240> it's<00:04:31.510> very<00:04:31.630> low<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.470> want

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
is Honoka because it's very low you want

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.750 
is Honoka because it's very low you want
something<00:04:32.950> that's<00:04:33.010> going<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.250> be<00:04:33.340> over<00:04:34.000> 1k<00:04:34.600> and

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
something that's going to be over 1k and

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.520 
something that's going to be over 1k and
yeah<00:04:36.760> it's<00:04:37.180> not<00:04:37.390> really<00:04:37.570> breaking<00:04:37.750> it<00:04:38.020> so<00:04:38.290> I'm

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
yeah it's not really breaking it so I'm

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.180 
yeah it's not really breaking it so I'm
looking<00:04:39.130> to<00:04:39.310> replace<00:04:39.550> that<00:04:39.670> and<00:04:40.710> this<00:04:41.710> one<00:04:41.920> as

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
looking to replace that and this one as

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.520 
looking to replace that and this one as
well<00:04:42.430> because<00:04:43.120> low<00:04:43.510> stats<00:04:43.870> on<00:04:44.080> everything

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
well because low stats on everything

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.750 
well because low stats on everything
aside<00:04:45.310> from<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.610> 1000<00:04:46.120> combat<00:04:47.580> other<00:04:48.580> than

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
aside from the 1000 combat other than

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.670 
aside from the 1000 combat other than
that<00:04:49.800> my<00:04:50.800> stats<00:04:51.160> looking<00:04:51.700> pretty<00:04:51.910> good<00:04:52.680> I've

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
that my stats looking pretty good I've

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.770 
that my stats looking pretty good I've
been<00:04:53.860> taking<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.280> break<00:04:54.430> from<00:04:54.490> any<00:04:55.300> kind<00:04:55.570> of

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
been taking a break from any kind of

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.070 
been taking a break from any kind of
skilling<00:04:56.320> because<00:04:56.680> I<00:04:56.770> didn't<00:04:56.980> want<00:04:57.070> this<00:04:57.490> I

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
skilling because I didn't want this I

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.360 
skilling because I didn't want this I
didn't<00:04:59.080> want<00:04:59.140> this<00:04:59.290> max<00:04:59.560> cape<00:04:59.860> to<00:05:00.010> be<00:05:00.250> in<00:05:00.310> a

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
didn't want this max cape to be in a

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.920 
didn't want this max cape to be in a
rush<00:05:00.580> basically<00:05:02.100> so<00:05:03.480> yeah<00:05:04.480> just<00:05:04.720> kind<00:05:04.810> of

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
rush basically so yeah just kind of

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.500 
rush basically so yeah just kind of
takin<00:05:05.290> it<00:05:05.410> slow<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:09.210> eventually<00:05:10.210> I'll<00:05:10.330> get

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
takin it slow and eventually I'll get

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.650 
takin it slow and eventually I'll get
there<00:05:10.720> I'll<00:05:11.320> definitely<00:05:11.560> get<00:05:11.890> it<00:05:12.040> by<00:05:12.660> probably

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
there I'll definitely get it by probably

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.590 
there I'll definitely get it by probably
by<00:05:13.750> summer<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.520> mean<00:05:15.520> if<00:05:15.850> I<00:05:16.000> really<00:05:16.300> wanted<00:05:16.540> to

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
by summer I mean if I really wanted to

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.510 
by summer I mean if I really wanted to
grind<00:05:16.930> out<00:05:17.110> I<00:05:17.380> could<00:05:17.590> probably<00:05:17.800> max<00:05:18.130> in<00:05:18.340> about

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
grind out I could probably max in about

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.300 
grind out I could probably max in about
two<00:05:18.730> months<00:05:19.560> because<00:05:20.560> I<00:05:20.860> think<00:05:20.920> that's<00:05:21.190> how

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
two months because I think that's how

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.090 
two months because I think that's how
long<00:05:21.520> farming<00:05:21.970> would<00:05:22.060> take<00:05:22.800> farmers<00:05:23.800> in<00:05:24.010> to

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
long farming would take farmers in to

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.190 
long farming would take farmers in to
take<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.280> month<00:05:24.810> basically<00:05:25.810> I<00:05:25.930> think<00:05:26.110> it's

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
take a month basically I think it's

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.650 
take a month basically I think it's
about<00:05:26.290> 100k<00:05:26.830> a<00:05:26.860> day<00:05:27.160> that<00:05:27.940> you<00:05:28.090> can<00:05:28.210> get<00:05:28.360> and

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
about 100k a day that you can get and

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.350 
about 100k a day that you can get and
farming<00:05:29.050> if<00:05:29.169> you<00:05:29.350> you<00:05:29.680> know<00:05:29.710> just<00:05:30.040> do<00:05:30.160> trees

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
farming if you you know just do trees

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.540 
farming if you you know just do trees
so<00:05:32.340> that<00:05:33.340> would<00:05:33.430> take<00:05:33.460> about<00:05:34.120> 30<00:05:34.479> days

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
so that would take about 30 days

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.839 
so that would take about 30 days
essentially<00:05:36.930> so<00:05:37.930> farming<00:05:38.349> is<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:39.400> slowest

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
essentially so farming is the slowest

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.350 
essentially so farming is the slowest
one<00:05:40.050> mining<00:05:41.050> pretty<00:05:41.439> easy<00:05:42.000> fishing<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.210> only

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
one mining pretty easy fishing and only

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.730 
one mining pretty easy fishing and only
a<00:05:43.389> 445<00:05:44.289> k<00:05:44.669> agility<00:05:45.669> is<00:05:45.819> boring<00:05:46.270> and<00:05:46.479> so<00:05:46.990> is<00:05:47.259> DV

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
a 445 k agility is boring and so is DV

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.830 
a 445 k agility is boring and so is DV
and<00:05:47.919> then<00:05:48.729> I<00:05:48.879> gotta<00:05:49.060> do<00:05:49.270> hunter<00:05:49.599> which

and then I gotta do hunter which

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.529 
and then I gotta do hunter which
