00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:35.610

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.210
 here 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.340
 so 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.020
 so it does not have to be mandatory 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.020
 super super straight 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.570
 model and we can see how the thing is that 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.550
 it's fine today I have assistant I'm very 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.080
 happy enters the second model over here 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.080
 this is my dear today 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.130
 efe 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.130
 to cut them 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.500
 we had stayed with the thing 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.540
 next that was cut to horizontal 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.080
 that is, following the edge seam 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.700
 from below the light mulberry 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.700
 that is to say quite 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.860
 as horizontal 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.200
 when we have this as you never have 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.620
 I see you explain and explain everything 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.260
 we do it is simply stretch so that 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.750
 the bands get prettier such 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.760
 a short brevity count to go out and take a 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.409
 coffee on the beach is worth it when we have 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.349
 this we will see what we are going to do 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.629
 in front he knows that he always cut his neck 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.489
 but today not ok 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:46.299
 you are if I go from here where is 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:50.769
 the headquarter well the stitching of the neck here 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:53.220
 from this point I go to the seam of the 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.220
 sleeve 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.170
 that is to say the stitching of the neck and here 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.580
 and if I remember well until sewing 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.410
 of the armpit in a straight line 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.120
 but that clearly fred is 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.280
 doing with the shirt on but you 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.550
 at home you can do it on the table with 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:20.290
 the extended shirt and scratch the stripe for 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.800
 that is not exposed but almost better than 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.800
 do it directly 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:44.609
 but again the point is that here 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.170
 shoulder seam up to the neck 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:51.810
 here in weight the peak 1 and until the 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.790
 armpit seam here I simply 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.790
 from here I'm going down 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.359
 without cutting in bikini cations under the 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.129
 agreements as it says armpit in French 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.129
 a lady asked us from her house 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.930
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:33.610
 I will not cut you following the seam 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.610
 By the neck 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.000
 and then what we do simply 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.400
 look, we remove this 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.150
 take off your clothes slowly so you had to 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.920
 finish the last point 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.920
 look delighted 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
 to 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.279
 we stretch a little as always girl 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.840
 here and see that suddenly the shirt 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:11.059
 also it stays like a little longer 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.059
 turn around to dance 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:21.070
 it's a bit cold for this and other 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.940
 magical I sent it because it suffered in the 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.940
 beach at night
