00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.580 
figure so his articulation is hindered
in<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.580> head<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.790> little<00:04:33.090> bit<00:04:33.240> from<00:04:33.540> his<00:04:34.169> you

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
in the head a little bit from his you

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.840 
in the head a little bit from his you
know<00:04:34.710> his<00:04:34.800> big<00:04:35.040> hair<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.310> don't<00:04:35.460> have<00:04:35.700> the

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
know his big hair I don't have the

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.700 
know his big hair I don't have the
variant<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.419> show<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:36.630> if<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.900> can<00:04:37.470> look<00:04:37.590> up

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
variant to show you if it can look up

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.550 
variant to show you if it can look up
more<00:04:37.740> but<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.100> bet<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.430> could<00:04:38.700> and<00:04:39.169> move<00:04:40.169> side<00:04:40.530> to

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
more but I bet it could and move side to

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.490 
more but I bet it could and move side to
side<00:04:40.740> just<00:04:41.310> fine<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:41.700> moves<00:04:41.940> down<00:04:42.260> so<00:04:43.260> the

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
side just fine and moves down so the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.500 
side just fine and moves down so the
bandanna<00:04:43.889> doesn't<00:04:44.250> really<00:04:44.400> block<00:04:44.669> it<00:04:44.880> this<00:04:45.030> is

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
bandanna doesn't really block it this is

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.820 
bandanna doesn't really block it this is
the<00:04:45.630> rubbery<00:04:45.960> material<00:04:45.990> you<00:04:46.470> can<00:04:46.590> moving
