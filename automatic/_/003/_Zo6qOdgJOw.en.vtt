00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.710 

the<00:01:46.680> cascada<00:01:47.220> has<00:01:47.550> been<00:01:47.790> designed<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.480> be<00:01:48.570> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the cascada has been designed to be a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.110 
the cascada has been designed to be a
bit<00:01:49.080> more<00:01:49.230> of<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.440> cruiser<00:01:49.830> than<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.370> sports<00:01:50.730> car

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
bit more of a cruiser than a sports car

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.720 
bit more of a cruiser than a sports car
so<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> ride<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.200> soft<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:53.130> irons<00:01:53.520> out

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
so the ride is soft and it irons out

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.340 
so the ride is soft and it irons out
most<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.270> bumps<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.750> road<00:01:55.080> which

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
most of the bumps in the road which

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.860 
most of the bumps in the road which
means<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.860> fairly<00:01:56.250> comfortable<00:01:56.910> wind

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
means it's fairly comfortable wind

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.140 
means it's fairly comfortable wind
buffeting<00:01:58.440> with<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.010> roof<00:01:59.220> down<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.700> kept<00:02:00.000> to

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
buffeting with the roof down is kept to

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.790 
buffeting with the roof down is kept to
a<00:02:00.180> minimum<00:02:00.270> which<00:02:01.020> means<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.620> have<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
a minimum which means you can have a

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.830 
a minimum which means you can have a
decent<00:02:02.280> conversation<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:03.150> your<00:02:03.240> passengers
