00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.600
 rar 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.620
 Hmm 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.970
 This time I will introduce a little how to use the grenade 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:24.829
 Glenedia is a little knack bell unit, but there are not many people who use it 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.669
 It is possible to launch a very effective attack if you hold down and use it properly depending on the situation. 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:30.460
 I will 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.460
 We will introduce an example of this using operations videos. 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.180
 You need to be careful when using grenades 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:42.530
 Up to 6 system and the launcher grip撃某 Sniper and the Canon system 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:46.940
 It is a premise not to enter the range Just because it depends on the level of the enemy I can not say to myself 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.340
 But if there is a bull is not killed instantly be hit by attack in the opponent Offer level 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.070
 so 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.450
 It was to talk to our station while using 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.680
 Next to hq 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.740
 I have a shock launcher, but if I leave this, it will be a little more troublesome later 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.740
 I will 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.549
 After that you are already relatively relatively 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.310
 Without eats attack 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.310
 One'm But a little here can attack 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.590
 There is a click 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.179
 I would like to introduce you there 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.179
 I will keep the picture a little different from Edo 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.680
 Yes this and I'm guy of operations in the curtain call, but 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.040
 First of all, there is a sniper on the left 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.170
 This sniper using the zuka 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.850
 I will crush 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.000
 Well, in the meantime 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.440
 The Grenadier 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.010
 A and landed 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.010
 Canon 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.640
 Here is one trip 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:56.270
 It does not enter the range of the canon depending on the way of landing 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.730
 Attacking like this 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.540
 This is right 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.920
 At the same point 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.920
 Collectively to power and out 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.120
 Everyone 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.179
 Canon approaching 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:15.780
 I will be attacking 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:19.730
 To be equally also be image Riku in to say you do a little bit away feeling I equally 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.730
 Everyone lined up neatly in this way 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.500
 It is pushed from the outside of the range attack okra 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.220
 So let's use this data energy 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.960
 To Rokeran to Earth 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.930
 Damaged hotels 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.930
 It was an important attack 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.050
 Almost 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.080
 It is these efforts 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.890
 A little Matane a video that had 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.890
 I will return 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.300
 It's okay with that 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.300
 completely 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.860
 I am in a safe state 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.670
 Oh dear 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.750
 There is a little time so this left 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.750
 Genie is this 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.540
 Background car 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:13.510
 8 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:17.180
 Well, you can attack as it is, but it is as it is 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.950
 I can not kill it in time 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.370
 Because the grenadier is already so bad at that hit 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.639
 It does not hit only generally about the entire 50% 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.530
 It is better to think 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:33.490
 So I can not smash even if I continue throwing as it is, so one more here 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.490
 Grenadier's Trip 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.740
 Glare on the side of the target 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:46.590
 By getting close 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.590
 It can greatly improve the hit rate 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.060
 Before that that right 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.320
 The date is 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.320
 Yes it was crushed 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.370
 Yes it approaches with flare 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.590
 帝 東 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.590
 And here we are targeting the player one more time 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.610
 By rubbing 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.670
 There are very hit rate 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.690
 Have cladding and What about a little while ago 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.690
 I think I think that was quite a 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:28.810
 Because it shortens the time from throwing to hitting by bringing close and close again 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.270
 A short period of time also be a lot of damage scale 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:37.249
 But do not I have to put this opportunity to care 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:41.899
 Or rather their own and too close to the each other anymore each other to the attack 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:44.259
 Be careful not to get too close as the grenade may hit and suicide 

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:44.259
 is 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.710
 It is another 20 seconds, but this is already 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.430
 Deer Ne me is that yes 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.449
 It was a little 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.319
 Description Video So 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.319
 Thank you very much
