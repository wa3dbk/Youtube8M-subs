correct me if I'm wrong but I believe

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.060

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
that was the last time and that was a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.780 
that was the last time and that was a
snoozefest<00:00:20.780> that<00:00:21.780> was<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> fight<00:00:22.290> which<00:00:22.790> caused

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
snoozefest that was a fight which caused

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.810

HBO<00:00:24.450> to<00:00:24.600> pull<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> plug<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.560> Klitschko<00:00:26.520> fights

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
for a long time after that because it

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.870 
for a long time after that because it
was<00:00:28.950> really<00:00:30.170> anticlimax<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.290> say<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.530> least

improving<00:01:51.770> but<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.830> still<00:01:53.189> think<00:01:53.460> he's<00:01:54.229> he's

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
improving but I still think he's he's

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.600 
improving but I still think he's he's
not<00:01:55.500> his<00:01:55.680> peak<00:01:55.979> yet<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:57.409> his<00:01:58.409> skills<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.580> his

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
not his peak yet and his skills and his

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.410 
not his peak yet and his skills and his
technique<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.810> still<00:02:01.020> underdeveloped<00:02:01.439> I

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
technique are still underdeveloped I

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.850 
technique are still underdeveloped I
reckon<00:02:03.420> he<00:02:03.509> needs<00:02:03.689> at<00:02:03.840> least<00:02:03.869> two<00:02:04.170> three<00:02:04.650> more

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
reckon he needs at least two three more

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.529 
reckon he needs at least two three more
years<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:06.290> improvement<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.789> give<00:02:08.789> himself<00:02:08.939> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
years of improvement to give himself the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.300 
years of improvement to give himself the
best<00:02:09.989> possible<00:02:10.259> chance<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.889> be<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.129> Valletta

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
best possible chance to be in Valletta

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.580 
best possible chance to be in Valletta
MacLeish<00:02:11.639> go<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.969> even<00:02:12.329> Brian<00:02:12.930> Jennings<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.469> is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
MacLeish go and even Brian Jennings a is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.370 
MacLeish go and even Brian Jennings a is
absolute<00:02:14.010> bad

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
absolute bad

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.720 
absolute bad
this<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.740> probably<00:02:15.280> not<00:02:15.460> going<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.640> be

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
this is probably not going to be

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.400 
this is probably not going to be
wladimir<00:02:16.150> klitschko<00:02:16.240> anyway<00:02:16.750> but<00:02:17.290> we're

we're talking about so and forty percent

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.960 
we're talking about so and forty percent
is<00:02:31.570> probably<00:02:31.810> generous<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:33.310> right<00:02:33.520> now<00:02:33.700> i

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
is probably generous but right now i

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.280

this<00:02:36.610> fight<00:02:36.850> based<00:02:37.450> on<00:02:37.630> what<00:02:37.810> I've<00:02:37.930> seen<00:02:38.010> he<00:02:39.010> is

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
this fight based on what I've seen he is

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.620 
this fight based on what I've seen he is
an<00:02:39.250> athlete<00:02:39.640> he<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:39.790> improving<00:02:40.240> all<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.510> time

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
an athlete he is improving all the time

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.590 
an athlete he is improving all the time
so<00:02:41.020> maybe<00:02:41.200> he's<00:02:41.500> gonna<00:02:42.060> bring<00:02:43.060> something<00:02:43.510> out

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.230 
so maybe he's gonna bring something out
I've<00:02:43.810> never<00:02:44.020> seen<00:02:44.260> before<00:02:44.410> but<00:02:45.340> I've<00:02:45.730> seen

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
I've never seen before but I've seen

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.580 
I've never seen before but I've seen
branch<00:02:46.630> endings<00:02:47.020> in<00:02:47.140> many<00:02:47.350> different

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
branch endings in many different

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.470 
branch endings in many different
situations<00:02:47.950> I've<00:02:48.520> seen<00:02:48.730> him<00:02:48.850> going<00:02:49.060> forward

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
situations I've seen him going forward

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.420 
situations I've seen him going forward
I've<00:02:49.630> seen<00:02:50.050> him<00:02:50.170> on<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.380> back<00:02:50.560> foot<00:02:50.830> I've<00:02:51.220> seen

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
I've seen him on the back foot I've seen

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.070 
I've seen him on the back foot I've seen
him<00:02:51.520> fighting<00:02:51.790> on<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.060> inside<00:02:52.390> I've<00:02:52.780> seen<00:02:52.930> him

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
him fighting on the inside I've seen him

in<00:02:53.170> many<00:02:53.320> different<00:02:53.590> situations<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.360> think

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
in many different situations so I think

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.980 
in many different situations so I think
I've<00:02:56.140> got<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.320> good<00:02:56.590> understanding<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:58.000> what<00:02:58.840> he

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
kind of can't do up to this point okay

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.960 
kind of can't do up to this point okay
and<00:03:03.570> when<00:03:04.570> I<00:03:04.600> say<00:03:04.960> that<00:03:05.140> his<00:03:05.640> technique<00:03:06.640> and

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.110 
tends to loop these shots and shooting
them<00:03:50.620> instead<00:03:51.190> of<00:03:51.250> getting<00:03:51.490> full<00:03:51.730> extension

think that he'll be able to cope with

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.820 
think that he'll be able to cope with
letting<00:04:58.060> his<00:04:58.240> jab<00:04:58.449> and<00:04:58.479> strengthen<00:04:59.199> height

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
letting his jab and strengthen height

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.310

and<00:05:00.009> reach<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:00.370> all<00:05:00.490> that<00:05:00.840> well<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:01.930> will<00:05:01.960> say

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
and reach and all that well I will say

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.760 
and reach and all that well I will say
for<00:05:02.530> Jennings<00:05:02.830> though<00:05:03.010> is<00:05:03.220> that<00:05:04.260> he's<00:05:05.260> smart

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
for Jennings though is that he's smart

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.040 
for Jennings though is that he's smart
he'll<00:05:06.669> have<00:05:06.820> a<00:05:06.850> good<00:05:07.060> idea<00:05:07.240> of<00:05:07.479> what<00:05:07.750> to<00:05:07.900> do

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
he'll have a good idea of what to do

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.300 
he'll have a good idea of what to do
he's<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.470> thinking<00:05:09.100> fighter<00:05:09.340> he<00:05:09.850> kind<00:05:10.120> of<00:05:10.180> that

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
he's a thinking fighter he kind of that

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.840 
he's a thinking fighter he kind of that
wasn't<00:05:12.310> too<00:05:12.430> impressed<00:05:12.550> with<00:05:12.850> him<00:05:13.030> against

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
wasn't too impressed with him against

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.550 
wasn't too impressed with him against
Perez<00:05:15.850> in<00:05:16.180> his<00:05:16.300> last<00:05:16.510> fight<00:05:16.810> a<00:05:17.050> lot<00:05:17.289> of<00:05:17.350> people

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
Perez in his last fight a lot of people

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.900 
Perez in his last fight a lot of people
felt<00:05:17.800> he<00:05:17.860> didn't<00:05:18.070> actually<00:05:18.190> win<00:05:18.520> that<00:05:18.699> fight

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
felt he didn't actually win that fight

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.909 
felt he didn't actually win that fight
and<00:05:19.150> that's<00:05:19.389> fair<00:05:19.630> enough<00:05:19.660> but<00:05:20.139> that<00:05:20.620> showed

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
and that's fair enough but that showed

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.370 
and that's fair enough but that showed
some<00:05:20.949> of<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.400> limitations<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:22.380> Jennings

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
some of the limitations of Jennings

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.210 
some of the limitations of Jennings
because<00:05:24.160> he's<00:05:25.060> got<00:05:25.300> these<00:05:25.419> big<00:05:25.630> long<00:05:25.840> arms<00:05:26.259> but

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
because he's got these big long arms but

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.950 
because he's got these big long arms but
he<00:05:27.370> shortens<00:05:27.820> his<00:05:27.880> art<00:05:28.120> it<00:05:28.270> punches<00:05:28.599> up<00:05:28.780> all

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
he shortens his art it punches up all

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.990 
he shortens his art it punches up all
the<00:05:29.050> time<00:05:29.229> doesn't<00:05:29.860> know<00:05:30.190> how<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.460> keep<00:05:30.699> a<00:05:30.849> guy

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
the time doesn't know how to keep a guy

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.960 
the time doesn't know how to keep a guy
on<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.240> outside<00:05:32.039> you<00:05:33.039> know<00:05:33.130> by<00:05:33.280> extending<00:05:33.820> his

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
on the outside you know by extending his

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.790 
on the outside you know by extending his
arms<00:05:34.090> and<00:05:35.639> utilizing<00:05:36.639> those<00:05:36.760> that<00:05:37.270> long<00:05:37.449> reach

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
arms and utilizing those that long reach

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.310 
arms and utilizing those that long reach
so<00:05:38.800> he's<00:05:39.340> kind<00:05:39.550> of<00:05:39.669> in<00:05:39.820> mid<00:05:40.120> range<00:05:40.389> in<00:05:40.810> the

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
so he's kind of in mid range in the

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.320 
so he's kind of in mid range in the
Perez<00:05:41.590> fight<00:05:41.889> and<00:05:42.099> Perez<00:05:42.849> having<00:05:43.240> the

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
Perez fight and Perez having the

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.210 
Perez fight and Perez having the
naturally<00:05:43.720> shorter<00:05:44.080> arms<00:05:44.289> and<00:05:44.590> the<00:05:44.949> quicker

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
naturally shorter arms and the quicker

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.490 
naturally shorter arms and the quicker
hands<00:05:45.610> up<00:05:45.729> close<00:05:46.030> he<00:05:46.659> was<00:05:46.780> having<00:05:47.050> a<00:05:47.139> field<00:05:47.380> day

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
hands up close he was having a field day

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.189 
hands up close he was having a field day
and<00:05:47.889> the<00:05:48.520> better<00:05:48.699> balance<00:05:49.120> as<00:05:49.330> well<00:05:49.360> Perez<00:05:49.990> was

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
and the better balance as well Perez was

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.600 
and the better balance as well Perez was
able<00:05:50.380> to<00:05:50.440> duck<00:05:50.650> underneath<00:05:50.919> shots<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:51.460> he<00:05:51.520> was

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
able to duck underneath shots and he was

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.760 
able to duck underneath shots and he was
just<00:05:51.760> a<00:05:51.820> bit<00:05:51.940> better<00:05:52.090> coordinated<00:05:52.780> up<00:05:53.139> closed

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
just a bit better coordinated up closed

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.939 
just a bit better coordinated up closed
and<00:05:54.039> Jennings<00:05:55.030> was<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:55.570> this<00:05:56.560> is<00:05:56.680> going<00:05:56.770> to<00:05:56.860> be

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
and Jennings was and this is going to be

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.529 
and Jennings was and this is going to be
a<00:05:56.979> situation<00:05:57.520> I<00:05:57.639> think<00:05:57.669> in<00:05:57.940> this<00:05:58.030> fight<00:05:58.300> where

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
a situation I think in this fight where

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.210 
a situation I think in this fight where
Vladimir<00:05:59.320> is<00:05:59.560> gonna<00:05:59.710> be<00:05:59.830> a<00:05:59.860> bit<00:06:00.070> better

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
Vladimir is gonna be a bit better

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.270 
Vladimir is gonna be a bit better
coordinated<00:06:00.849> at<00:06:01.300> long<00:06:01.599> range<00:06:01.870> did<00:06:02.710> Jenny<00:06:02.949> so

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
coordinated at long range did Jenny so

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.310 
coordinated at long range did Jenny so
yeah<00:06:03.820> long<00:06:04.150> story<00:06:04.360> short<00:06:04.750> man<00:06:04.930> let<00:06:05.050> me<00:06:05.139> stop

waffling<00:06:05.470> I<00:06:06.030> don't<00:06:07.030> see<00:06:07.240> past<00:06:07.570> the<00:06:07.780> wladimir

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
waffling I don't see past the wladimir

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.990 
waffling I don't see past the wladimir
klitschko<00:06:08.229> victory<00:06:08.860> here<00:06:09.099> Jenny's<00:06:09.639> might<00:06:09.849> be

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
klitschko victory here Jenny's might be

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.310 
klitschko victory here Jenny's might be
able<00:06:10.060> to<00:06:10.180> make<00:06:10.270> it<00:06:10.360> a<00:06:10.539> little<00:06:10.659> bit<00:06:10.840> interesting

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
able to make it a little bit interesting

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.320 
able to make it a little bit interesting
by<00:06:11.440> moving<00:06:11.710> around<00:06:12.039> and<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.669> fact<00:06:12.909> that<00:06:13.000> he

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
by moving around and the fact that he

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.830 
by moving around and the fact that he
won't<00:06:13.900> be<00:06:14.050> able<00:06:14.199> to<00:06:14.349> lean<00:06:14.530> on<00:06:15.659> you<00:06:16.659> know<00:06:16.780> if

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
won't be able to lean on you know if

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.969 
won't be able to lean on you know if
letting<00:06:16.990> me<00:06:17.110> won't<00:06:17.289> be<00:06:17.380> able<00:06:17.470> to<00:06:17.590> lean<00:06:17.770> on<00:06:17.800> and

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
letting me won't be able to lean on and

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.750 
letting me won't be able to lean on and
hold<00:06:18.510> but<00:06:19.510> ultimately<00:06:19.780> I<00:06:20.650> just<00:06:21.280> don't<00:06:21.520> think

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
hold but ultimately I just don't think

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.600 
hold but ultimately I just don't think
he's<00:06:21.909> developed<00:06:22.389> enough<00:06:22.479> to<00:06:22.810> give<00:06:22.960> himself<00:06:23.080> a

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
he's developed enough to give himself a

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.800 
he's developed enough to give himself a
realistic<00:06:24.610> opportunity<00:06:24.789> from<00:06:25.210> what<00:06:25.419> I<00:06:25.449> seen

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
realistic opportunity from what I seen

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.050 
realistic opportunity from what I seen
so<00:06:26.169> that's<00:06:26.889> just<00:06:27.099> me<00:06:27.280> I'm<00:06:27.639> going<00:06:27.970> with

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
so that's just me I'm going with

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.810 
so that's just me I'm going with
wladimir<00:06:28.449> klitschko<00:06:28.570> to<00:06:28.870> win<00:06:29.110> this<00:06:29.260> fight

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
wladimir klitschko to win this fight

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.180 
wladimir klitschko to win this fight
maybe<00:06:30.820> on<00:06:31.090> points<00:06:31.539> if<00:06:31.720> Jenny's<00:06:32.470> can<00:06:32.680> stay<00:06:32.919> away

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
maybe on points if Jenny's can stay away

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.850 
maybe on points if Jenny's can stay away
and<00:06:33.479> maybe<00:06:34.479> land<00:06:34.810> a<00:06:34.960> few<00:06:35.169> shots<00:06:35.380> here<00:06:35.620> in<00:06:35.710> there

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
and maybe land a few shots here in there

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.680 
and maybe land a few shots here in there
to<00:06:36.010> give<00:06:36.130> letting<00:06:36.430> me<00:06:36.490> honest<00:06:36.849> but<00:06:37.060> I<00:06:37.270> think

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
to give letting me honest but I think

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.690 
to give letting me honest but I think
more<00:06:37.840> likely<00:06:38.229> Vladimir<00:06:38.650> will<00:06:38.800> probably<00:06:39.130> stop

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
more likely Vladimir will probably stop

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.519 
more likely Vladimir will probably stop
