back<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.280> my<00:00:38.399> 20s<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.910> had<00:00:38.940> cancer<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.379> wasn't

back in my 20s I had cancer and I wasn't

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.010 
back in my 20s I had cancer and I wasn't

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
sure what the cause was but I was very

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.750 
sure what the cause was but I was very
suspicious<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> could<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.280> emotions

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
suspicious that it could be emotions

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.400 
suspicious that it could be emotions
that<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.910> wasn't<00:00:45.149> dealing<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.050> once<00:00:46.289> I

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
that I wasn't dealing with and so once I

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.690 
that I wasn't dealing with and so once I
got<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.649> touch<00:00:46.770> with<00:00:46.980> those<00:00:47.129> emotions<00:00:47.579> I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
got in touch with those emotions I

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.459 
got in touch with those emotions I
started<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.180> get<00:00:48.270> better<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.079> realized

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
started to get better and I realized

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.770 
started to get better and I realized
that<00:00:49.559> my<00:00:49.770> own<00:00:49.890> truth<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> big<00:00:51.090> factor<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.539> my

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that my own truth was a big factor in my

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.240 
that my own truth was a big factor in my
healing<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.770> know<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.890> think<00:00:52.980> that's

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
doing this and ultimately developed a

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.100 
doing this and ultimately developed a
program<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.329> know<00:01:36.420> thousands<00:01:37.020> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
program that now you know thousands of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.780 
program that now you know thousands of
other<00:01:37.229> people<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.680> use<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.040> well<00:01:38.189> well<00:01:38.759> I

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
other people can use as well well I

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.030 
other people can use as well well I
started<00:01:39.360> right<00:01:39.570> from<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.350> go<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.829> that

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
started right from the get go with that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.580 
started right from the get go with that
with<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> hands-on<00:01:42.299> healing<00:01:42.590> experience

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
with the hands-on healing experience

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.530 
with the hands-on healing experience
that<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.770> had<00:01:43.979> myself<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.610> started<00:01:45.000> there<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.479> I

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
that I had myself I started there and I

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.050 
that I had myself I started there and I
would<00:01:45.750> study<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.950> years<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.430> I'd<00:01:47.520> master<00:01:47.909> one

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
would study for years and I'd master one

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.490 
would study for years and I'd master one
technique<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.659> then<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.840> was<00:01:48.990> studying<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
technique and then I was studying with a

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.200 
technique and then I was studying with a
shaman<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.070> an<00:01:50.189> entirely<00:01:50.610> different<00:01:50.790> field

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
shaman in an entirely different field

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.420 
shaman in an entirely different field
and<00:01:51.450> master<00:01:51.780> another<00:01:52.049> technique<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.829> years

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and master another technique and years

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.190 
and master another technique and years
went<00:01:53.670> by<00:01:53.700> until<00:01:54.060> finally<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.630> ultimately

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
went by until finally I ultimately

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.649 
went by until finally I ultimately
developed<00:01:55.710> my<00:01:55.920> own<00:01:55.950> technique<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.479> how<00:01:57.630> was

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
developed my own technique so how was

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.719 
developed my own technique so how was
the<00:01:57.840> program<00:01:58.229> set<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.710> what's<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.159> well

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the program set up and what's in it well

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.999 
the program set up and what's in it well
the<00:01:59.820> program<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.360> set<00:02:00.540> up<00:02:00.750> online<00:02:01.009> it's

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the program is set up online it's

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.649 
the program is set up online it's
essentially<00:02:02.640> perhaps<00:02:03.180> eighty<00:02:03.450> percent

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
essentially perhaps eighty percent

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.100 
essentially perhaps eighty percent
online<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.500> students<00:02:05.420> join<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:06.930> come

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
online so students join in and they come

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.749 
online so students join in and they come
to<00:02:07.229> my<00:02:07.350> learning<00:02:07.710> center<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.190> there<00:02:08.429> every

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
to my learning center and there every

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.660 
to my learning center and there every
week<00:02:08.970> they<00:02:09.149> get<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.619> noun<00:02:10.619> load<00:02:10.920> where<00:02:11.280> they<00:02:11.430> get

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
week they get a noun load where they get

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.550 
week they get a noun load where they get
a<00:02:11.700> an<00:02:12.540> audio

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
a an audio

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.160 
a an audio
and<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:14.430> visual<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.420> know<00:02:15.450> because<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:16.020> some

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and a visual you know because for some

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.839 
and a visual you know because for some
people<00:02:16.200> it's<00:02:16.560> easier<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.980> learn<00:02:17.099> from<00:02:17.370> images

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
people it's easier to learn from images

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.910 
people it's easier to learn from images
