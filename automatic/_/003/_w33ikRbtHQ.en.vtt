00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello nowadays we all have 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.029
 you can film a smartphone with this 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.040
 but how do you really make a good one 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.280
 school video assignment 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.320
 views and care before you start filming 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.849
 always that you have a scenario one 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.619
 scenario is nothing but your idea 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.570
 written out on paper 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.720
 what is the subject in the title 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.529
 what is your film about care 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.529
 for a clear structure 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.990
 write your text also from this gives 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.490
 handhold for your actors and the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.779
 presenter 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.880
 Think carefully about how you get it in the picture 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.469
 want to go get a drawing 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.540
 is so that you get to do another 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.649
 about what it will look like 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.239
 standing or when such films upright 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.040
 then it just looks good but in 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.260
 the settings here this 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.489
 two black bars while if you are such 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.500
 films 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.829
 lying down then you just look nice 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.600
 no black bars and a beautiful image 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.800
 but yes if you keep a black bar then 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.480
 above all you should keep filming this way 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.370
 upright is often much more out of the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.409
 loose wrist but this does not always deliver 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.619
 a calm image to do it 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.619
 appearance 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.020
 look for stone or use your tripod 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.820
 pension you can of course finish your story 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.170
 tell different ways 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.799
 so try out multiple shots 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.799
 different positions 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.990
 theory as long as you film against light 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.940
 against the light 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.830
 Your subject becomes dark 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.909
 but when the cameraman and I switch 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.909
 place come jesper 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.770
 then the light falls on the subject and 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.979
 so i am good to see movie is always 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.060
 focusing with the light 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.040
 focusing is done with most 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.190
 telephones universe itself 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.650
 often that is handy but sometimes not 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.909
 focusing is done in this square 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.430
 so if you take a shot with two 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.590
 people and your smartphone precisely 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.229
 sharp between those persons then the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.000
 background sharp and the people must 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.040
 first on one of the two people and 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.840
 keep the square here product with it 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.070
 clock the auto focus and it stays 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.580
 subject sharp sound 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.580
 good sound 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.190
 good sound is at least as important as 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.630
 you can use a good image 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.250
 an external microphone 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.110
 do that then what do you have for this 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.110
 needed and special cable 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.080
 you put it in your phone and close it 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.540
 you turn on your microphone ' 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.640
 so now you have good sound make sure you 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.900
 Microphone uses AA batteries as you 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.340
 well not to use one 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.110
 external microphone 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.430
 then sit in a quiet room and 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.940
 hold the camera approximately one meter 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:03.040
 distance 1 meter so check check after it 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.270
 filming on everything to get up again 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.350
 otherwise you run into the assembly 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.910
 problems with punta when you finish the with 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.740
 much mine is going to assemble 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.450
 first create a new project 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.490
 import your recordings and export 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.480
 film later after a place that you return well 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.330
 can find 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.780
 also mention your sources in the credits 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.610
 so take care of good scenario 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.490
 use much with the light well 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.970
 sound make multiple film shots always 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.459
 landscape 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.180
 And last but not least, save your movie 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.820
 on 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.830
 where you can find it again and 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.209
 don't forget the best camera you have 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.209
 the camera that rows 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.200
 hi yes I had just finished really 10 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.700
 again or so 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.660
 what should you do 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.660
 Sorry
