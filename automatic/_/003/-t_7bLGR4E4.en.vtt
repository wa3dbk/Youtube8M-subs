00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.530
 she salutes to all these majors 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.300
 shepard i hope you're fine we 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.279
 is found on battlefield 3 for 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.510
 a little video a bit peculiar 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.619
 since it is intended to inform you 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.270
 of two three little things 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.610
 you may know it since 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.300
 now two days I will be me 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.930
 regularly on twitch tv so 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.449
 in order to ask you is well due from the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.400
 live 100% and 100% month 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.370
 a few hours for now I saw 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.750
 two live that lasted respectively 6h 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.540
 and 6:30 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.909
 it's a little bit so I know 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.229
 not too much on radio and this person on 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.070
 seven 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:53.479
 this command is in this dynamic 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.059
 here is a little more seek to 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.010
 excuse me in this dynamic 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.479
 now that's the goal it's really 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.970
 to share good times together 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.299
 quietly and then not take the 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.150
 head 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:07.970
 just so here is a myth is 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.960
 not a head then maybe we'll be there 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.030
 here and so that was the first 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.970
 point so obviously the string that I 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.470
 offers you it's not it's not 1080 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.610
 as linen can allow it with my 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.050
 it's 480p of good quality 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.000
 without being extraordinary but good 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.310
 way it's not before - loot of a live 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.710
 it's more the opportunity for us to be 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.170
 a little bit projected into the others 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.580
 bring closer that that is so globally 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.630
 the atmosphere is very very very good 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.770
 I'm trying to offer you a stream on 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.420
 will say quality whether it's at the level 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.660
 parties earlier to your listening 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.830
 about because you want to see 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.510
 during the evening and that and that's it 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.980
 I just do not have much more 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.620
 to say on it in general just crime 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.970
 of the battlefield however Thursday was 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.890
 brought to do a little bit of red 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.520
 orchestrate things like that 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.350
 so quietly so that's it 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.100
 really according to the feeling of the moment and 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.090
 then 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.160
 and then that's just so I 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.819
 will put the link of the flagship stream of the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.760
 dead stream chain I will put 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.620
 the dupuich alien of my conduct in the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.569
 discussions of this video there so that's 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.209
 such that here is simply en 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.530
 Major shepard if you ever seek 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.840
 you can subscribe directly 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:33.739
 story not to miss the future 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.930
 live and and then and then that's it 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.830
 I think I went around 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.750
 otherwise what did I want to tell you 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.900
 of others we approach the 10 put the 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.130
 subscribers and obviously you're all me 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.810
 ask is what am I doing 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.430
 particular thing so already good of a 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.400
 somehow throwing me 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.110
 in streaming during yeah the live 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.360
 like simply 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.040
 it's a bit of an improvement I 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.840
 would say that I occasionally propose 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.630
 ten thousand but that's going a little bit 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.700
 easy to tell you this is my 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.250
 helpful answer first loupe I tell you 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.350
 thank you right now it's normal but 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.840
 also i think that fac 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.440
 also I think I hope to organize 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.030
 an evening on knowing the cart 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.620
 to share a moment together 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.750
 a little con and live you can 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:24.170
 with me and all that and then I picked up 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:28.690
 not afraid why you have not fed up I 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.580
 see as crazy with a magnum go 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:36.110
 these balls and so I will organize the 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.720
 evening bowl at 164 slot I think the 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.190
 brain of my team and then been able to 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.960
 unravel together during 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.150
 a few hours I think that's all 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.920
 simply 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.410
 and here we go I think I did 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.270
 turn so really if you if you too 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.650
 you want to have a good time 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.270
 moment for you to take the lead 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.000
 you are welcome on the 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.930

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.500
 others there is really a good 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.420
 mentality 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.890
