 finally after his long tour of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.680

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.389
 to interview one of the djs 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.389
 most known producers in the environment 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.779
 rob syntek was in coacalco where 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.759
 offered a production clinic 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.169
 aimed at the youth of this part of 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.970
 the Mexican Republic 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.919
 the interns commented on the success 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.170
 that has been had with the tour remix 3 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.470
 among other things tell us we already have 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.540
 really want to meet you and here 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.430
 working with the kids we see that 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.680
 you're going around all the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.449
 republic in different places have 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.920
 his clinics were very successful 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.519
 work is recognized at the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.649
 national and international, then and 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.530
 thank God we are throwing him 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.359
 much desire for the republic with the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.410
 tour remix 3 already has a year and they have 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.600
 lower 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.399
 you take the year and thus imparting 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.949
 clinics so that all the djs can 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.649
 get this part of the production of the 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.899
 remix of the concern they have when 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.330
 there is no one who says the same 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.220
 watch a remix that followed your role side you 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.780
 idea you can translate it so 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.030
 remixes is coming to places 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.509
 where they call us the clinical plots 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.390
 we play all that roll because it's remix 3 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.690
 in conjunction with master luján and server 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.520
 rock syntek 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.900
 everyone, that's when it ends 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.540
 mission 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.340
 I would like it the same everywhere in 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.930
 all the cities of mexico get to 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.490
 this so that the kids start to 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.590
 expressing the remix is ​​a way of 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.660
 expression since it is not very well 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.210
 supported for a long time by the record companies but 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.580
 we have a movement that few 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.150
 people are doing then I think 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.500
 that 's where the importance lies 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.600
 to continue with the remix in fact if 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.640
 we are listening here are the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.330
 boys practicing this one of those 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.910
 attended the clica and so from Chiapas 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.460
 until we've been in town we've been with the tour 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.170
 remix 3 also told us about the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.230
 video production which has had 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.820
 hit all djs and me is 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.709
 interesting the good I do the remix 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.860
 now I make the video remix 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.620
 there are many very talented kids who have 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.240
 deformed this remix thing the video 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.500
 remix but I think the cleanest or 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.830
 the most 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.390
 and transparent and of images that you can 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.920
 use I think the best at the end of 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.170
 accounts if you make a very 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.350
 father at the start all when the mix 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.030
 the people in ilave then be tucked 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.060
 in Vegas platform and all that roll 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.010
 I handle something track motion the people of the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.959
 pax connection and that but good and it depends 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.850
 I've always liked the style 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.260
 I do like to know I am a person of 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.880
 cycles every year I like to be doing 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.890
 something new and this time I went acapulco 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.930
 edit video and now I'm doing other 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.260
 animations also for questions 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.420
 personal is giving a little inside 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.420
 what you told me I studied radio 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.790
 also this one time that was a stage 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.260
 and then from the radio thing I started to get into 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.540
 to production and then I started saying 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.850
 with the video then it is very important 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.130
 that we are not staying behind the djs 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.920
 and like that question, what do you think of me? 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.290
 of the remix video as it is a parent part 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.000
 not for what good I produce my thing and 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.230
 edited my video remix and it's a 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.750
 very father tool now to all 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.250
 managers and the dj's play with medium 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.450
 remix then I think it's a part 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.930
 important that you have to be there 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.930
 taking care of 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.140
 Grapes 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.880
 the students showed total interest and 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.770
 with a lot of attention applied to each one 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.170
 of the steps to follow this was what 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.630
 some students commented to us as you see 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.910
 the clinic in the workshop that is 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.070
 imparting brown rice in this afternoon 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.130
 then they were terrific I say is a 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.570
 very important step for us because 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.040
 I say programs right now in this era 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.210
 anyone can download them from the internet 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.640
 but knowing what you really use is a 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.740
 good mess no and more with even that we 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.830

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.610

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.440
 I mentioned there's a lot we're going to 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.420
 exploit it and give everything we have 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.340
 so that they see that really in 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.710
 mexico there is talent as the idea of 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.140
 bring brown rice 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.690
 we have it in that we have many friends 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.510
 who like remixes then 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.010
 we invite people and people always 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.230
 Ask others want rock syntek 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.020
 good but feels that is this remix 3 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.420
 as you see the clinics and this afternoon that 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.580
 is taking good overall learning 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.110
 because very accessible to the person what 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.210
 feels that he is a very complete person 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.670
 very very good people if we are 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.190
 very happy with him and apart that the 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.590
 rock really is a person who 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.500
 they lend that good in some way 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.610
 It clearly explains what is happening 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.200
 step by step what do you have to go 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.510
 doing and I think all the boys 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.940
 They are in a good atmosphere 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.800
 all learning and sharing from 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.090
 a little bit of learning 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.740
 we as I said we have to 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.810
 evolve always always always 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.580
 be at the forefront then you can not 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.520
 stay behind because the kids 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.080
 they come pushing hard and then obviously 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.430
 this will displace you or not if you 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.410
 you want to continue maintaining this 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.260
 you have to go ahead with the 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.810
 technology you were one of those who had 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.880
 the idea of bringing robs intercatia to the 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.910
 Mexico City yes, in fact, look 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.040
 curiously me when I start looking 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.860
 again this is this roll of the 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.900
 production the remix eo and all this I gave 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.450
 account that there were many places where 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.910
 they were handling this but the truth is 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.460
 that they are people of great quality and 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.620

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.220

 carried is from the master and robson as very 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.530
 good at their job and that makes for 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.320
 somehow this attracts the one in which 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.630
 they give you a little bit of what 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.130
