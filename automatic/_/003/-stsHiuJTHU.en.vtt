00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:20.060
 On the other hand really study by the imaginary today is Zillah walk 1 Keith in Tokyo Otsuki 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.890
 Nishida 0 literally shakes the world's cg day 8 parliament 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:29.189
 The story of tk 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.350
 City and said the dream taste It is especially in the real behind you with a cg video 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.190
 I thought 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.380
 Mitsui's first time 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.660
 tan 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.230
 The world is really famous 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.720
 It is round here the video of the N 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.370
 eh 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:54.450
 Let me introduce the research covered by Mr. Lab 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:58.140
 First of all, it 's about the lighting effect 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:01.260
 Dealing with things like trends and various light sources 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.070
 The lighting effect is the second we go 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:10.550
 Or a cloud Toka mountain to say that natural objects 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:13.850
 I'm doing what people in the water of light has said something about in there in the middle 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.650
 In what is said to be ring processing 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:23.330
 Although especially famous There is a technique called raid Raging still in the ray tracing 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:27.520
 It is the research which becomes the basis of the market support of writing of 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:34.650
 I said next to the active display I was 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:40.260
 It is like being able to draw something with a calculator interactively using a mouse and well 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:44.760
 In the end, it is said that one photorealism and this is commonly called npr 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.750
 There Toka processing mosaic-style Toka oil painting style things such as writing with a pen 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:54.890
 Very wide general purpose like this 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.970
 I'm researching, but why is it that this kind of research has been started since 1970 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.840
 Because 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:05.780
 As there is another 43 years of history, 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.530
 There are a lot of research laboratories that do only this field, but there are many fields in general. 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.740
 The 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:15.390
 Man experience 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.590
 There are four main features of this laboratory that covers a wide area. 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.860
 but 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:26.810
 One is the reflection from the wall of the light called Mara x city, and so on. 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:33.349
 If you think about it, you will be more beautiful 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:35.910
 Because it is humble, it is said that it is simultaneous announcement with Cornell University in the world, but in fact 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.400
 A year and a half ago in Japan 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.379
 I'm doing a view 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.420
 Well, it's a good idea that the first time I saw the radio city in the world is Japanese. 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:49.730
 I would like to emphasize 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:52.819
 The shadow that I mentioned in the real world is usually normal 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:58.069
 Where there is until before about 20 years 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.030
 Since the shadow was not sharp and crisp shadow but the case say that soft shadows if 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:07.220
 You 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:10.380
 Although we say that reflects the blurred part of its shadow in 1982 its prosperity also voice even in the world's first 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.820
 At a conference called graph It was developed 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:19.170
 I was selected in this art category, but rather than a light bulb 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:23.540
 In 1985, it was okay if I said that earlier 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.230
 I announced in the main graph, so here is yes 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:32.000
 How efficiently the display of the curved surface 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:37.550
 Bebe tax clipping how and ion that in or do well head accuracy 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.300
 If you put 10 tables of control with a famous curve 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:47.660
 Line is easy to draw, but its page tax 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:50.420
 There is a combination of curves and the Vezel phase, but it is defined in that phase phase 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.990
 Do not approximate the 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:58.260
 I'm going to direct 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:59.980
 Say can with high accuracy is say that this is the company that commercialized using this idea 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.900
 There is 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:08.710
 It is 90 years later, so the postmaster is in this water 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:13.090
 It looks like this one, but it is really 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:14.680
 I can see the pattern on the back of the killer whale or the numbers on the back, but these effects 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:23.030
 The 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:29.600
 I made it possible to make it public. Mr. Mar is a group of water vapor, but the above integrated version car 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.490
 When light strikes, it hits water vapor and it bounces back and returns several times and flies to human eyes 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.690
 But 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.500
 The color of the accessory by calculating the effect so faithfully 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.600
 Sunless 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.910
 Direction and 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:46.000
 The movement of the cloud is decided by various conditions, but such a color is calculated scientifically properly 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:53.139
 There is an attempt or requirement 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.529
 Well, such research continues in various ways 8 after all in this affiliation called astringent bluff 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:02.909
 17This article 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:10.889
 Announced Was it in the results is evaluated we had to say and black vinegar disease 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:14.969
 This is that in Asia after I just gave an award lecture on the 12th double car alone 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.520
 It is also an interesting thing that I always bought a performance of Ryokasei 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:20.680
 later 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:25.990
 There is a conference called Eurographics which is famous for the rain in our field 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:30.050
 Well because if more and more pass through any number in the graph of euro graphics death of one 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.620
 I will decide the status, but that number too 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.919
 Both tomorrow and 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:42.310
 In and now Well, more than 35 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:45.900
 I will have attended one of the Dream Society of the Year in a variety of images from Hollywood now 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:51.750
 But will he look at everyone wow wonderful Fig. 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:54.030
 Actually, the part that becomes the basis of such technology is that there are various technologies from Japan 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.930
 You may not know much 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.490
 In fact , the various technologies we did in Japan 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:05.490
 Presentation at a conference 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:12.540
 It Gyun Well also because has led to various video it to hint 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:20.090
 Although When asked to know Oh, and do you think that is that once we have various hard 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:24.680
 I do not put on a low pension for a while I will study at university in the next year from a university and I am a private company 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:26.760
 I will establish a healthy place, but this is 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.030
 I am humble 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:34.530
 Well, that it does not have Well suddenly quit the 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:37.830
 There is a company that will support you and this is ubiquitous entertainment good 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:43.980
 Better to mention expulsion in Hitachi 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:45.620
 We have established a laboratory named uei Research, and will continue to work hard in the future 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.540
 So everyone is 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:51.900
 Thank you 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.870
 a 3 is a pre-change of prime because it is good 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.449
 eh 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:07:00.999
 It is something delicious Do life 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:03.500
 Today first or say Miya playing with cg boundaries of the Nobel Prize rime 

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:10.130
 Japanese only 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:10.730
 1 It has not been done, but it is the age of cg fishing if it is necessary for movies etc. 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.300
 Also 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:18.050
 Koshi store We are able to enjoy the cg picture 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:24.630
 It is no exaggeration to say that thanks to the fess 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:31.860
 What is great even just the fact that my head for such researchers 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:38.160
 The turn is hopeful that the research from the right is also why 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:40.970
 Dish I would also like to go should be the Kinki egg water little luck 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.970
 Regards, Aso
