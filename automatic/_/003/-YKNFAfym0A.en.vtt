00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
some new blood very soon because

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.340

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
otherwise it's gonna get very stale very

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.920 
otherwise it's gonna get very stale very
quickly<00:01:31.790> so<00:01:32.790> Balor<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.630> gonna<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.900> that

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
quickly so Balor it's not gonna be that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.569 
quickly so Balor it's not gonna be that
long<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.409> think<00:01:34.590> before<00:01:34.710> Balor's<00:01:35.220> up<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
long I think before Balor's up on the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.789 
long I think before Balor's up on the
main<00:01:35.729> roster<00:01:35.939> Sami<00:01:36.509> Zayn<00:01:36.840> once<00:01:37.140> he<00:01:37.290> comes<00:01:37.470> back

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
main roster Sami Zayn once he comes back

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.200 
main roster Sami Zayn once he comes back
I<00:01:38.009> don't<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.280> it'll<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.520> very<00:01:38.549> long<00:01:38.880> before

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
I don't think it'll be very long before

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.649 
I don't think it'll be very long before
he's<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> main<00:01:39.810> roster<00:01:41.540> they're<00:01:42.540> gonna

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
he's on the main roster they're gonna
