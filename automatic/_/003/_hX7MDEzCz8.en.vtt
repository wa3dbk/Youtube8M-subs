bars<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:58.040> only<00:01:58.340> reason<00:01:58.580> I<00:01:59.140> you<00:02:00.140> know<00:02:00.260> straight

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
bars the only reason I you know straight

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.500 
bars the only reason I you know straight
against<00:02:01.280> these<00:02:01.430> is<00:02:01.640> because<00:02:01.760> there<00:02:02.120> is<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.270> God

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
against these is because there is a God

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.050 
against these is because there is a God
and<00:02:02.720> nectar<00:02:03.170> in<00:02:03.260> them<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:04.000> there's<00:02:05.000> more

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
and nectar in them and there's more

so we really want to you know again if
you're<00:02:14.270> going<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.450> choose<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.690> bar<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.830> is

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
you're going to choose a bar and this is

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.860 
you're going to choose a bar and this is
the<00:02:16.130> healthiest<00:02:16.550> one<00:02:16.730> there<00:02:16.970> go<00:02:17.540> with<00:02:17.720> this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
the healthiest one there go with this

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.220 
the healthiest one there go with this
one<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:19.459> does<00:02:19.730> have<00:02:20.090> all<00:02:20.480> organic<00:02:21.050> ingredients

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
one it does have all organic ingredients

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.190 
one it does have all organic ingredients
which<00:02:22.040> makes<00:02:22.400> me<00:02:22.610> happy<00:02:22.990> decent<00:02:23.990> amount<00:02:24.140> of

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
which makes me happy decent amount of

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.960 
which makes me happy decent amount of
protein<00:02:24.470> in<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.980> not<00:02:25.940> super<00:02:26.270> high<00:02:26.630> in<00:02:26.840> sugar<00:02:27.140> so

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
protein in it not super high in sugar so

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.370 
protein in it not super high in sugar so
number<00:02:28.970> one<00:02:29.150> or<00:02:29.420> number<00:02:29.450> three<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:30.110> going<00:02:30.320> to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
number one or number three is going to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.240 
number one or number three is going to
be<00:02:30.530> pure<00:02:30.830> bars<00:02:31.750> number<00:02:32.750> two<00:02:32.990> green<00:02:33.530> superfood

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
be pure bars number two green superfood

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.670 
be pure bars number two green superfood
by<00:02:34.430> amazing<00:02:34.970> grass<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.959> reason<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.290> like<00:02:36.530> these

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
by amazing grass the reason I like these

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.770 
by amazing grass the reason I like these
is<00:02:36.890> because<00:02:37.010> they<00:02:37.400> use<00:02:37.430> their<00:02:38.030> superfood

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
is because they use their superfood

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.780 
is because they use their superfood
powder<00:02:39.019> in<00:02:39.320> their<00:02:39.560> bars<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.190> they<00:02:40.280> mask<00:02:40.580> the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
powder in their bars and they mask the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.520 
powder in their bars and they mask the
flavor<00:02:40.910> with<00:02:41.360> coconut<00:02:41.870> which<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.230> what<00:02:42.380> this

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
flavor with coconut which is what this

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.940 
flavor with coconut which is what this
one<00:02:42.739> is<00:02:42.790> chocolate<00:02:43.790> chip<00:02:43.970> coconut<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:45.560> you

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
one is chocolate chip coconut so you

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.040 
one is chocolate chip coconut so you

not<00:02:56.600> really<00:02:56.870> high<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.320> protein<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.830> we<00:02:58.730> really

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
not really high in protein and we really

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.670 
not really high in protein and we really
want<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.150> be<00:02:59.239> careful<00:02:59.690> with<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.560> know

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
sugar protein ratio fat so again this is

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.390 
sugar protein ratio fat so again this is
going<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.480> be<00:03:05.570> my<00:03:05.750> number<00:03:06.050> two<00:03:06.190> favorite<00:03:07.190> bar

coating one without chocolate coating

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.539 
coating one without chocolate coating
and<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:24.230> know<00:03:24.350> obviously<00:03:24.800> there's<00:03:25.370> going<00:03:25.400> to

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
and you know obviously there's going to

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:26.670 
and you know obviously there's going to
be<00:03:25.580> less<00:03:25.760> sugar<00:03:26.060> in

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
be less sugar in

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.660 
be less sugar in
one<00:03:26.829> that<00:03:27.010> doesn't<00:03:27.129> have<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.459> chocolate

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
coating but if you're really going for

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.619 
coating but if you're really going for
flavor<00:03:30.250> I'd<00:03:30.430> probably<00:03:30.700> choose<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.239> chocolate

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
flavor I'd probably choose the chocolate

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.240 
flavor I'd probably choose the chocolate
coating<00:03:31.930> it's<00:03:32.109> an<00:03:32.200> alkaline<00:03:32.560> forming<00:03:32.799> bar

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
coating it's an alkaline forming bar

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.640 
coating it's an alkaline forming bar
it's<00:03:33.849> called<00:03:34.120> press<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.810> lot<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.109> nutrition<00:03:35.590> in

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
it's called press a lot of nutrition in

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.520 
it's called press a lot of nutrition in
here<00:03:35.950> now<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:37.209> have<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:37.510> tie<00:03:37.780> for<00:03:37.840> number<00:03:38.349> one

here now I have a tie for number one

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.259
