00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:22.990 
huge difference I'm so much happier now
with<00:05:20.750> my<00:05:20.930> life<00:05:21.229> and<00:05:21.620> with<00:05:22.460> everything<00:05:22.849> that

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
with my life and with everything that

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.610 
with my life and with everything that
I've<00:05:23.180> done<00:05:23.330> in<00:05:23.509> with<00:05:23.659> my<00:05:23.840> body<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:24.349> I<00:05:24.409> just

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
I've done in with my body and I just

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.800 
I've done in with my body and I just
feel<00:05:24.830> a<00:05:24.889> million<00:05:25.310> times<00:05:25.460> better<00:05:25.789> and<00:05:26.180> it<00:05:26.270> shows

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
feel a million times better and it shows

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.589 
feel a million times better and it shows
with<00:05:27.680> all<00:05:27.979> my<00:05:28.340> interactions<00:05:28.580> with<00:05:29.000> people<00:05:29.449> and

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
with all my interactions with people and

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.869 
with all my interactions with people and
I<00:05:29.719> think<00:05:29.780> that<00:05:30.020> if<00:05:30.650> people<00:05:31.129> knew<00:05:31.400> how<00:05:31.430> they

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:31.879 
I think that if people knew how they

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.119 
I think that if people knew how they
would<00:05:32.060> really<00:05:32.659> feel<00:05:32.990> when<00:05:33.319> they<00:05:33.439> got<00:05:33.620> in<00:05:33.860> good

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:34.129 
would really feel when they got in good

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:36.550 
would really feel when they got in good
shape<00:05:34.490> that<00:05:34.909> more<00:05:35.090> people<00:05:35.419> would<00:05:35.539> do<00:05:35.659> it

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
shape that more people would do it

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:47.250 
shape that more people would do it
