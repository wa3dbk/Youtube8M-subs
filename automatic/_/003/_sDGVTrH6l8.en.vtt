00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.509
 web friends 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.059
 the question of today and of laura asking 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.190
 how do you determine fat 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.720
 effectively several times 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.420
 we mentioned the fact that the weight 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.100
 by itself it is not necessarily indicative 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.199
 health status as well as i 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.390
 weight and height ratios such as pe 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.670
 never the body mass index it is 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.520
 often used to classify people 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.350
 in normal weight overweight or obese and is 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.760
 certainly a comfortable index because the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.770
 weight and height are two measures 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.350
 very simple to take therefore the be 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.480
 never afterwards calculate anyone but not 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.730
 always reliable because it is not able 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.129
 to evaluate body composition 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.379
 that is, what our fat mass is worth 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.300
 to say adipose tissue compared to 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.000
 our lean mass that is all the rest 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.620
 the bones the muscles the water in the middle for 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.360
 which if we take the be ever to a body 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.340
 builder will easily come out of that 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.800
 obese but it's not true he weighs more 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.049
 because it has much more muscle mass than 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.850
 it is not a health problem 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.409
 the problem is adipose tissue 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.150
 vice versa in older people 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.460
 it happens often and they have a weight 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.710
 compared to the perfect height but in 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.330
 actually they lost a lot of muscle e 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.430
 counterbalance with a percentage 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.130
 high fatty tissue that holds the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.990
 normal weight but from the point of view of 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.270
 fat mass are overweight if not 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.640
 obese so much that we talk about obesity 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.590
 sarcopenia and therefore we diagnosis more 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.540
 effective on overweight and obesity is done 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.250
 evaluating which fat mass of one 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.900
 person and here is the graduation question that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.640
 he says but how to do it 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.829
 actually it's not such a measure 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.990
 immediate as the weight the height for 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.909
 many years the reference method is 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.829
 was the hydrostatic weighing ie the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.899
 person was weighed after being 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.210
 completely immersed in a full tank 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.070
 of water and in this way on the basis of 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.810
 physical principles on which there is now 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.820
 then we go into the principle of 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.560
 archimede in this way I said you can 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.270
 go up with extreme precision to 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.399
 body volume and therefore to his 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.649
 density and therefore its fat mass 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.580
 taking advantage of the fact that fat has one 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.470
 lower density 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.000
 of all the rest of course like 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.399
 you can imagine it is a method 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.290
 very impractical if I have to do it a 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.910
 bold young man is an account but if I am already 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.620
 comes the grandmother who keeps them that damage 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.570
 but it is not with his teeth that he can burn it 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.910
 in the tub say now put it under the 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.680
 head and sofia brings in the mug in 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.380
 actually today we have other methods for 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.240
 measure dry so let's say the volume 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.550
 hence the density of an individual like 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.530
 the plethysmography from the echo to the bot but the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.780
 absolute method more accurate than 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.760
 we have available today is the texa 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.860
 that the tool I show you 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.960
 now it is that it uses a principle 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.910
 different because a radiographic technique 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.650
 the person covers this bed 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.540
 which puts very low ics rays 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.370
 power the arm of the instrument 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.840
 began to move slowly 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.150
 records point by point 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.090
 how many rays have passed through the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.830
 body and on the basis of the different radio 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.990
 peace of mind of our molecules 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.940
 body can calculate for each point 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.490
 how much is the percentage of fat mass 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.020
 and how much the percentage of lean mass e 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.390
 the lean mass divides it into mass 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.800
 bone mineral and lean bone mass 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.890
 so in the end we gave a lot 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.590
 precise both on the fat mass and on the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.420
 bone mass and radiological exposure e 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.130
 very low less than a day in 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.410
 beach in the sun or a trip 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.820
 the main transatlantic liner 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.200
 disadvantage is that a very technique 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.050
 expensive especially for 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.820
 the equipment and then also quite 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.970
 tedious because you have to stand there for 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.739
 20 40 minutes to get you all scanned 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.530
 fortunately there are two more 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.330
 measurements that are much faster and 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.430
 flexible and economic obviously not 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.440
 they are so accurate but they are more than 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.190
 enough to get a pretty good idea 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.230
 precise body composition 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.330
 the first is the measurement of the folds 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.519
 cutaneous and that is the thickness of that 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.980
 subcutaneous fat layer that 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.739
 clothes all our body is done with 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.450
 this tool that costs a few dozen 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.530
 of euro the click ometro with which 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.690
 simply 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.670
 we are to pinch wounds in a series 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.310
 of predefined points typically 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.170
 biceps and triceps under the shoulder blade and 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.420
 above the iliac crests now for 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.860
 example I will show you covers due 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.200
 call someone but just to give you 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.870
 an idea I'll take my see this 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.079
 that I'm taking subcutaneous fat 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.820
 I read the value we repeat it normally 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.130
 three times we do the media then 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.169
 we record the values we start in 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.389
 an equation that has been calibrated on 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.190
 reference method for density e 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.770
 then from there we go up again 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.930
 to the percentage of fat mass 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.169
 another technique that lately has 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.840
 made much progress especially on the 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.860
 portability and economy and bio 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.600
 impedance meter that still uses a 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.940
 other filanci that there is the different one 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.280
 conductivity of tissues on passage 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.990
 of a very weak electric current 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.030
 the fabric of poses to a villain 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.660
 conductor of the water and therefore the mass 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.190
 lean is a good conductor 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.720
 this is my metroc commitment and i use myself 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.150
 see a tool you can carry 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.160
 everywhere there are many different types 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.290
 this must be grasped with both 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.970
 hands touching these four elected of 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.410
 he and puts a small volley of 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.690
 absolutely electric current 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.490
 imperceptible that starts from the hand 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.620
 right travels throughout the body 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.810
 coming the left look how much 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.760
 current was prevented by the tissues does 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.740
 the calculation also taking into account the weight 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.910
 of the height of the ages and it is said 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.460
 immediately 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.060
 what is the percentage of lean mass 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:27.539
 then get ready here you are putting them 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.020
 its very low power current i 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.820
 I don't feel anything and now it gives me mine 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.710
 measurement 16 and 6 that mine 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.380
 percentage of fat mass than in the 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.820
 range of normality for which they are in place 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.370
 of course there is a margin of error 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.990
 which is about 5 percent if I do 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.419
 I measure fast for at least two hours a 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.130
 rest and without metal objects dos 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.900
 but if I measure the folds as well 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.729
 both take a moment and the two values 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.110
 obtained with the two methods are 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.440
 close enough are enough 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.770
 quiet field ater reasonably 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.900
 reliable 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.990
 finally, let's not forget that next to him 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.520
 of the composition 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.340
 there is another bodily body 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.890
 important that is the distribution of 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.510
 this subcutaneous body fat po 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.120
 We have already talked about this visceral 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.650
 in the video you see here the link 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.480
 we have seen that a very simple way 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.520
 to evaluate it and the size of the 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.290
 abdominal circumference 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.360
 I stop here I remind you mica 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.040
 then fully diet and moderate diets 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.380
 the email address to write this 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.340
 post and that for the cud and I hope precisely e 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.340
 with everything clear
