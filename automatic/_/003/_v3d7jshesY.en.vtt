00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
it so basically what happened was I had

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.720 
it so basically what happened was I had
a<00:00:33.600> bunch<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.050> fish<00:00:34.260> stored<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:35.160> winter<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
a bunch of fish stored for winter and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.330 
a bunch of fish stored for winter and
then<00:00:36.420> somehow<00:00:36.780> water<00:00:37.410> got<00:00:37.649> down<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.010> there<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
then somehow water got down in there and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.459 
then somehow water got down in there and
it<00:00:38.430> frozen<00:00:38.700> frozen<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.570> whole<00:00:39.750> thing<00:00:39.989> solid
