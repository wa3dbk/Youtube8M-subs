00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
be black you would go to reflection at a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:44.680 
be black you would go to reflection at a
Fresnel<00:02:38.599> then<00:02:39.599> i<00:02:39.630> would<00:02:40.280> hear<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:43.620> and

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
Fresnel then i would hear this and

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.039 
Fresnel then i would hear this and
specular<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.860> go<00:02:47.099> down<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.450> go<00:02:48.840> up

want black on color go to reflection

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.190 
want black on color go to reflection
turn<00:03:36.569> it<00:03:36.720> on<00:03:36.900> go<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.799> fresno<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:39.470> then<00:03:40.470> trip

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
pretty good and if you go to specular

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:58.490 
pretty good and if you go to specular
then<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.170> drag<00:03:52.620> this<00:03:53.100> up<00:03:53.690> looks<00:03:54.690> nice<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:57.500> then

this tutorial helped in anyway um oh and
also<00:06:49.960> for<00:06:51.040> this<00:06:52.040> is<00:06:52.190> if<00:06:52.460> you<00:06:52.700> wanted<00:06:53.120> to<00:06:53.300> make

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
also for this is if you wanted to make

00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:08.970 
also for this is if you wanted to make
MIT<00:06:55.990> and<00:06:56.990> I<00:06:57.050> drag<00:06:57.530> moat<00:06:58.520> eggs<00:06:58.880> into<00:06:59.500> random

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.430 

uncheck<00:07:09.980> positioning<00:07:10.700> go<00:07:11.240> to<00:07:11.300> rotation<00:07:12.140> and

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 
uncheck positioning go to rotation and

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.030 
uncheck positioning go to rotation and
then<00:07:13.220> you<00:07:13.760> could<00:07:13.910> sort<00:07:14.090> of<00:07:14.330> move<00:07:15.080> the<00:07:15.470> text

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040
