00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.430
 Welcome from Munich with the of 111 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.530
 helicopter parked by the supervisor 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.640
 need Chinese online shop for eg 40 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.080
 euro to germany 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.820
 not only has free delivery 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.440
 but also no problem with customs or 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.510
 other types of charge reports that it 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.070
 even regulation that just exists 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.310
 so could such little chains 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.619
 order 1 to use 14.54 at the same time 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.480
 will an 18 resp 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.430
 There are no interviews with others 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.910
 if you also leave in sweden 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.740
 would pick 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.539
 the remote control is not included 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.559
 which now has to be ordered separately 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.149
 a bit more so best 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.270
 separate order then give up 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.250
 her with these 40 euros and so too 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.450
 no problem and yes the packaging is 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.160
 Now not all that exciting thing 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.469
 However, this can be shown to be hip 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.460
 Hopper you're pretty stable in there would be better 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.440
 but really only the 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.790
 Helicopter in there and nothing else 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.410
 but you can also have one 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.489
 order things as a charger would be 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.539
 of course, still important from the battery 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.280
 because she was not in it 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.110
 Here you see the charger would be here 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.000
 Two batteries fit in here 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.550
 can charge over this little porti 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.920
 either usb via the computer or 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.670
 an external usb battery or what that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.649
 Nice is if you have the remote 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.869
 has the compatible with that we here 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.060
 can see again micro led 911 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.889
 then we can on the back here 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.450
 Just open the door and here 

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:15.549
 is then exactly the same again 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.349
 same cable in it something that is quite 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.369
 nice and practical if you are 

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:20.619
 on the way, and maybe one 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.359
 charge second or third battery 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.130
 and is it really enough power 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.990
 in here because we have six here 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.700
 matches the response inserted here 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.740
 will have it 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.969
 High quality praise used as you can see 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.139
 can you at the top two keys at the 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.520
 I 'm not sure where you are 

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:35.679
 what you can use for them but here 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.090
 With these you can calibrate the heli 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.950
 with this lever if I go up to you 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.340
 press starts to fly and then 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.810
 here 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.849
 if we go a bit then 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.979
 we can see that too then you can see 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:47.649
 that if I move this here then 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.409
 these four little ones are moving here 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.469
 or three pages exactly and then you can 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.569
 we control accordingly for the heli 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.219
 Here is the battery that comes in 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.389
 whole led forward so also know if 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.889
 The battery dreams is the heli 

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:01.059
 automatically to make out at a few 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:03.429
 you just have to get the battery 

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:04.959
 pull out and then you can go 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.159
 This is very simple by her this 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.929
 small lever very slightly forward operated 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.580
 then see here it feels already 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.470
 to turn a little bit as this little whole 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.319
 perfectly calibrated but when i enter 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.980
 I can do that bit stronger then I can 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.980
 already big 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.100
 of course, should be careful with the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.580
 speed forth rotate the whole 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.500
 let or as the direction indicates 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.060
 but can not you just order 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.070
 you have to deal with a lot 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.420
 i think and also practice a lot or yourself 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.300
 maybe a higher price last 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.610
 buy nation 20 euro heli that was so 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.410
 very first impression and unboxing resp 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.000
 Presentation of the theme of online shopping 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.160
 is about two to three weeks to wait 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.990
 if you take the cheap shipping 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
 is free so that comes all 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.110
 but then the field even becomes 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.490
 for Christmas have fun with such a 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.170
 have a small budget thanks to the 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.170
 next time the fau 911
