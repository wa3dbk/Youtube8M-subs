aboard the TARDIS we'd already decided

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
to hide it wherever possible and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.240 
to hide it wherever possible and
commissioned<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.550> story<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.060> get<00:01:36.149> rid<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.360> it

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:53.839 

the<00:01:41.250> limitations<00:01:52.039> they<00:01:53.039> did<00:01:53.250> suggest<00:01:53.700> the

the limitations they did suggest the

possibility that it would be able to I'm
not<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.110> bad<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.979> idea<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:03.030> could

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
not so bad the idea was that they could

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:12.620 
not so bad the idea was that they could
do<00:02:03.539> it<00:02:04.220> when<00:02:05.220> we<00:02:05.429> was<00:02:06.119> being<00:02:06.270> spoken<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:11.540> but<00:02:12.540> he

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
do it when we was being spoken to but he

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.490 
do it when we was being spoken to but he
didn't<00:02:12.870> even<00:02:12.959> do<00:02:13.230> that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
didn't even do that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.220 
didn't even do that
they<00:02:14.069> just<00:02:14.250> had<00:02:14.430> run<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.120> tape<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.810> had<00:02:16.080> to

they just had run the tape you had to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.650 
they just had run the tape you had to
fit<00:02:16.440> your<00:02:16.590> line<00:02:16.860> into<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.459> back<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:18.569> was
