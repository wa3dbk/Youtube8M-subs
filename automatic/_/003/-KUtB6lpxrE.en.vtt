fuel calm no more fear from exam so now
we<00:00:10.559> will<00:00:10.889> talk<00:00:11.099> about<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.610> second<00:00:12.059> component

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
we will talk about the second component

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.770 
we will talk about the second component
that<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.200> pressure<00:00:13.469> potential<00:00:14.540> now<00:00:15.540> let

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
that is the pressure potential now let

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.429 
that is the pressure potential now let
us<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:16.109> what<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.590> pressure<00:00:16.949> potential<00:00:18.439> now

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
us see what is pressure potential now

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.320 
us see what is pressure potential now
pressure<00:00:19.770> potential<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.760> more<00:00:21.029> about

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
pressure potential is more about

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.279 
pressure potential is more about
applying<00:00:21.840> physical<00:00:22.590> pressure<00:00:23.000> as<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.150> said<00:00:24.420> in

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
applying physical pressure as I said in

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.339 
applying physical pressure as I said in
soil<00:00:25.680> potentially<00:00:26.640> add<00:00:26.849> solute<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> pure

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
soil potentially add solute to the pure

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.070 
soil potentially add solute to the pure
water<00:00:28.680> now<00:00:29.400> what<00:00:29.609> happens<00:00:30.060> if<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.390> apply<00:00:31.019> some

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
water now what happens if we apply some

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.770 
water now what happens if we apply some
physical<00:00:31.890> pressure<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.759> how<00:00:32.940> does<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.390> will

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
physical pressure so how does that will

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.979 
physical pressure so how does that will
that<00:00:34.020> affect<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.309> water<00:00:35.730> potential<00:00:36.149> if<00:00:36.660> yes

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
that affect the water potential if yes

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.110 
that affect the water potential if yes
how<00:00:37.200> will<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.860> affect<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> water<00:00:38.489> potential

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
how will it affect the water potential

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.060 
how will it affect the water potential
whether<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.540> will<00:00:39.719> decrease<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.350> increase<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
whether it will decrease it increase it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.900 
whether it will decrease it increase it
or<00:00:41.219> let<00:00:41.910> us<00:00:42.030> see<00:00:42.149> what<00:00:42.420> happens<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> let<00:00:44.879> us

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
or let us see what happens so let us

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.270 
or let us see what happens so let us
take<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.420> same<00:00:45.629> example<00:00:46.140> which<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:46.980> took<00:00:47.010> in

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
take the same example which we took in

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310 
take the same example which we took in
the<00:00:47.370> previous<00:00:47.789> slide<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.600> happened<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.140> that

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the previous slide what happened in that

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.580 
the previous slide what happened in that
case<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.430> pure<00:00:51.239> water<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:52.110> region

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
case this was pure water this was region

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.090 
case this was pure water this was region
1<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.579> region<00:00:53.820> 2<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.660> region<00:00:55.079> 1<00:00:55.350> had<00:00:55.680> pure

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
1 this is region 2 so region 1 had pure

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.080 
1 this is region 2 so region 1 had pure
water<00:00:57.350> where<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.829> water<00:00:58.859> potential<00:00:59.579> was

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
water where the water potential was

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.389 
water where the water potential was
considered<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.840> 0<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.710> second<00:01:02.190> one

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
considered to be 0 the second one

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.850 
considered to be 0 the second one
initially<00:01:03.329> had<00:01:03.600> pure<00:01:03.870> water<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.680> added

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
initially had pure water but we added

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.490 
initially had pure water but we added
some<00:01:05.280> solute<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.420> when<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.720> added<00:01:06.869> some<00:01:07.260> solute

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
some solute so when we added some solute

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.740 
some solute so when we added some solute
the<00:01:07.890> solute<00:01:08.280> potential<00:01:08.670> was<00:01:09.090> negative<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the solute potential was negative and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.380 
the solute potential was negative and
that<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.619> why<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:11.189> happened<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.090> water

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that is why what happened the water

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.359 
that is why what happened the water
flowed<00:01:13.130> from<00:01:14.130> region<00:01:14.640> 1<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.420> region<00:01:15.840> 2<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
flowed from region 1 to region 2 and

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.859 
flowed from region 1 to region 2 and
that<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.520> why<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> level

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that is why here you can see the level

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.719 
that is why here you can see the level
of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.170> water<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.650> more<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:20.189> most<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
of the water is more because most of the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.910 
of the water is more because most of the
water<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.210> started<00:01:21.720> flowing<00:01:21.990> into<00:01:22.229> this

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
water have started flowing into this

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.630 
water have started flowing into this
region<00:01:23.400> due<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.509> osmosis<00:01:24.890> now<00:01:25.890> let<00:01:26.280> us<00:01:26.310> suppose

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
region due to osmosis now let us suppose

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.719 
region due to osmosis now let us suppose
that<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.600> apply<00:01:28.049> some<00:01:28.110> physical<00:01:28.979> pressure<00:01:29.340> on

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that we apply some physical pressure on

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.080 
that we apply some physical pressure on
region<00:01:30.450> 2<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.560> region<00:01:31.979> 2<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.700> apply<00:01:33.030> some

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
region 2 so on region 2 we apply some

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.560 
region 2 so on region 2 we apply some
physical<00:01:33.900> pressure<00:01:34.200> maybe<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.860> have<00:01:35.340> some<00:01:35.700> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
physical pressure maybe we have some a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.469 
physical pressure maybe we have some a
plate<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.409> structure<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.759> push<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
plate like structure and we push the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.319 
plate like structure and we push the
water<00:01:39.720> hard<00:01:40.290> by<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.159> applying<00:01:41.790> physical

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
water hard by the applying physical

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.020 
water hard by the applying physical
pressure<00:01:42.630> now<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.680> what<00:01:44.100> happens<00:01:44.549> when

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
pressure now what one what happens when

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.240 
pressure now what one what happens when
we<00:01:45.210> apply<00:01:45.299> pressure<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.290> direction<00:01:46.470> so

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
we apply pressure in this direction so

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.520 
we apply pressure in this direction so
this<00:01:47.490> water<00:01:47.790> will<00:01:48.240> not<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.600> able<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.020> move<00:01:49.200> up

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
this water will not be able to move up

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.370 
this water will not be able to move up
instead<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.579> water<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.270> forced<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.110> move

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
instead the water will be forced to move

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.760 
instead the water will be forced to move
down<00:01:53.130> now<00:01:53.820> where<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.509> go<00:01:54.780> down<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.710> is

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
down now where we it go down so this is

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.679 
down now where we it go down so this is
like<00:01:56.130> applying<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.759> pressure<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.450> like

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
like applying this pressure is like

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.920 
like applying this pressure is like
pumping<00:01:58.380> water<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.329> positive

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
pumping water so this is a positive

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.740 
pumping water so this is a positive
pressure<00:02:01.229> which<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:01.920> are<00:02:02.100> applying<00:02:02.509> so<00:02:03.509> what

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
pressure which we are applying so what

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.840 
pressure which we are applying so what
will<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.110> do<00:02:04.350> when<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:04.950> apply<00:02:05.250> pressure

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
will this do when we apply pressure

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.389 
will this do when we apply pressure
here<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.360> pressure<00:02:06.930> will<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.560> applied<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
here a pressure will be applied to the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.870 
here a pressure will be applied to the
walls<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.030> container<00:02:09.740> right<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.009> because

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
walls of the container right and because

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.910 
walls of the container right and because
of<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.420> pressure<00:02:12.780> which<00:02:13.170> will<00:02:13.410> be<00:02:13.560> applied

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
of this pressure which will be applied

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.790 
of this pressure which will be applied
to<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.580> wall<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.180> container<00:02:15.380> water<00:02:16.380> will

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
to the wall of the container water will

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.250 
to the wall of the container water will
start<00:02:17.190> flowing<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.180> direction<00:02:18.260> because

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
start flowing in this direction because

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.170 
start flowing in this direction because
there<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.500> no<00:02:19.650> other<00:02:19.800> way<00:02:20.100> with<00:02:20.400> water<00:02:20.670> can<00:02:20.970> go

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
there is no other way with water can go

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.330 
there is no other way with water can go
when<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.540> allow<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.140> much<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.440> pressure<00:02:22.650> you

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
when you allow so much of pressure you

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.070 
when you allow so much of pressure you
actually<00:02:23.760> end<00:02:23.910> up<00:02:24.060> applying<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.750> much<00:02:24.900> of

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
actually end up applying so much of

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.390 
actually end up applying so much of
pressure<00:02:25.350> on<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.680> walls<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.250> container

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
pressure on the walls of the container

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.150 
pressure on the walls of the container
and<00:02:26.910> because<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.900> pressure<00:02:28.230> water<00:02:28.709> has

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
and because of this pressure water has

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.360 
and because of this pressure water has
no<00:02:29.520> other<00:02:29.700> choice<00:02:29.850> then<00:02:30.480> go<00:02:31.050> pass<00:02:31.380> across<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
no other choice then go pass across the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.490 
no other choice then go pass across the
semi<00:02:32.610> permeable<00:02:33.030> membrane<00:02:33.270> again<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.170> so

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
semi permeable membrane again and so

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.020 
semi permeable membrane again and so
water<00:02:34.739> will<00:02:35.040> start<00:02:35.340> flowing<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.880> this

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
water will start flowing in this

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.090 
water will start flowing in this
direction<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.780> what<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.410> happening<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:37.920> this

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
direction so what is happening in this

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.160 
direction so what is happening in this
case<00:02:38.340> where<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.850> apply<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.540> much<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.870> pressure

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
case where you apply so much of pressure

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.979 
case where you apply so much of pressure
here<00:02:40.709> due<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.459> this<00:02:41.730> positive<00:02:42.030> pressure<00:02:42.660> which

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
here due to this positive pressure which

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.350 
here due to this positive pressure which
is<00:02:43.140> being<00:02:43.350> applied<00:02:43.650> then<00:02:44.370> negative<00:02:44.580> solute

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
is being applied then negative solute

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.020 
is being applied then negative solute
potential<00:02:45.750> gets<00:02:46.319> compensated<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> water

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
potential gets compensated so the water

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.750 
potential gets compensated so the water
potential<00:02:48.540> increases<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.130> side<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
potential increases so this side the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.059 
potential increases so this side the
water<00:02:50.910> potential<00:02:51.390> increases<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.410> therefore

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
water potential increases and therefore

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.860 
water potential increases and therefore
water<00:02:53.459> starts<00:02:54.060> flowing<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.690> water

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
water starts flowing and the water

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.930 
water starts flowing and the water
potential<00:02:55.470> becomes<00:02:55.830> more<00:02:56.160> than<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.730> water

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
potential becomes more than the water

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.940 
potential becomes more than the water
potential<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.690> pure<00:02:57.930> water<00:02:58.200> because<00:02:58.620> here<00:02:58.830> you

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
potential of pure water because here you

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.920 
potential of pure water because here you
are<00:02:58.980> applying<00:02:59.370> mechanical<00:02:59.640> force<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.870> are

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
are applying mechanical force you are

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.440 
are applying mechanical force you are
applying<00:03:01.230> pressure<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:02.760> will<00:03:02.970> keep<00:03:03.269> on

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
applying pressure you will keep on

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.270 
applying pressure you will keep on
applying<00:03:03.720> pressure<00:03:04.110> until<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.830> unless<00:03:04.920> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
applying pressure until and unless the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.970 
applying pressure until and unless the
water<00:03:05.519> starts<00:03:06.090> moving<00:03:06.480> into<00:03:06.780> region<00:03:07.590> one<00:03:07.769> as

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
water starts moving into region one as

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.330 
water starts moving into region one as
soon<00:03:08.519> as<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.150> potential<00:03:09.959> on<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.680> region<00:03:11.100> two

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
soon as the potential on in region two

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.610 
soon as the potential on in region two
becomes<00:03:12.060> greater<00:03:12.420> than<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.989> potential<00:03:13.320> in

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
becomes greater than the potential in

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.460 
becomes greater than the potential in
region<00:03:13.980> one<00:03:14.160> water<00:03:14.459> starts<00:03:15.000> flowing<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:16.140> this

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
region one water starts flowing so this

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.220 
region one water starts flowing so this
shows<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:17.100> pressure<00:03:17.640> potential<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.870> a

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
shows that pressure potential is a

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.650 
shows that pressure potential is a
positive<00:03:20.070> progression<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.299> is<00:03:21.420> that

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
positive progression so it is that

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.930 
positive progression so it is that
component<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.410> water<00:03:22.620> potential<00:03:23.430> which<00:03:23.910> is

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
component of water potential which is

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.449 
component of water potential which is
due<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.600> hydrostatic<00:03:25.109> pressure<00:03:25.560> exerted

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
due to the hydrostatic pressure exerted

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.120 
due to the hydrostatic pressure exerted
on<00:03:26.760> water<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.989> cell<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.859> is<00:03:29.010> the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
on water in a cell so this is the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.920 
on water in a cell so this is the
hydrostatic<00:03:29.579> pressure<00:03:30.060> right<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.720> pressure

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
hydrostatic pressure right the pressure

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.130 
hydrostatic pressure right the pressure
exerted<00:03:31.440> by<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.799> water<00:03:32.359> why<00:03:33.359> is<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.750> exerted

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
exerted by the water why is it exerted

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.590 
exerted by the water why is it exerted
because<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:34.980> mechanical<00:03:35.400> pressure<00:03:36.299> so

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
because of this mechanical pressure so

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.900 
because of this mechanical pressure so
it<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.140> mechanical<00:03:37.769> pressure<00:03:38.070> so<00:03:38.640> even

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
it is like a mechanical pressure so even

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.759 
it is like a mechanical pressure so even
when<00:03:39.060> we<00:03:39.209> talk<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.570> now<00:03:39.750> here<00:03:40.170> we<00:03:40.320> are<00:03:40.350> talking

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
when we talk it now here we are talking

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.710 
when we talk it now here we are talking
about<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:41.040> beaker<00:03:41.519> now<00:03:41.910> let<00:03:42.090> us<00:03:42.239> suppose<00:03:42.510> if<00:03:42.630> you

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
about a beaker now let us suppose if you

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.289 
about a beaker now let us suppose if you
have<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.959> cell<00:03:43.320> there<00:03:43.890> if<00:03:44.190> too<00:03:44.730> much<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.060> water

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
have a cell there if too much of water

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.210 
have a cell there if too much of water
enter<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.049> sites<00:03:46.320> are<00:03:46.590> said<00:03:46.769> what<00:03:47.040> will

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
enter and sites are said what will

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.280 
enter and sites are said what will
happen<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:47.940> cell<00:03:48.209> will<00:03:48.420> start<00:03:48.720> swelling<00:03:49.049> up

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
happen the cell will start swelling up

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.470 
happen the cell will start swelling up
now<00:03:49.709> if<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.160> water<00:03:50.400> which<00:03:50.820> has<00:03:50.970> entered<00:03:51.180> is

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
now if the water which has entered is

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.599 
now if the water which has entered is
really<00:03:51.870> really<00:03:52.230> too<00:03:52.440> much<00:03:52.620> then<00:03:53.100> too<00:03:53.280> much<00:03:53.459> of

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
really really too much then too much of

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.330 
really really too much then too much of
pressure<00:03:53.820> will<00:03:54.180> be<00:03:54.299> exerted<00:03:54.900> on<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.470> walls<00:03:56.040> of

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
pressure will be exerted on the walls of

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.039 
pressure will be exerted on the walls of
the<00:03:56.549> cell<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.150> cells<00:03:57.390> might<00:03:57.690> even

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
the cell and the cells might even

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.949

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
handle so much of pressure so that is

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.180 
handle so much of pressure so that is

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
for example in this example which I

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.409 
for example in this example which I
mentioned<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:18.400> pressure<00:04:18.639> potential<00:04:19.299> is

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
mentioned the pressure potential is

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.629 
mentioned the pressure potential is
possible<00:04:19.900> but<00:04:20.410> in<00:04:20.560> many<00:04:20.769> situations<00:04:21.489> for

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
possible but in many situations for

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.360 
possible but in many situations for
example<00:04:21.699> in<00:04:22.330> plants<00:04:22.810> in<00:04:23.289> certain<00:04:23.740> cases<00:04:24.039> the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
example in plants in certain cases the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.670 
example in plants in certain cases the
pressure<00:04:24.610> potential<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.449> also<00:04:25.960> be<00:04:26.169> negative

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
pressure potential and also be negative

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.520 
pressure potential and also be negative
so<00:04:27.280> osmotic<00:04:27.940> pressure<00:04:28.389> so<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:28.930> is<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.139> new

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
so osmotic pressure so that is a new

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.830 
so osmotic pressure so that is a new
term<00:04:29.860> which<00:04:30.160> we<00:04:30.340> get<00:04:30.520> introduced<00:04:31.270> here<00:04:31.630> what

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
term which we get introduced here what

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.450 
term which we get introduced here what
is<00:04:31.990> osmotic<00:04:32.410> pressure<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.039> here<00:04:33.250> what

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
is osmotic pressure so here what

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.850 
is osmotic pressure so here what
happened<00:04:33.910> due<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.810> application<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:35.590> this

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
happened due to the application of this

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.550 
happened due to the application of this
positive<00:04:36.430> pressure<00:04:36.759> water<00:04:37.600> was<00:04:37.960> forced<00:04:38.530> to

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
positive pressure water was forced to

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.909 
positive pressure water was forced to
move<00:04:39.449> backwards<00:04:40.449> so<00:04:40.930> water<00:04:41.110> was<00:04:41.350> forced<00:04:41.830> to

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
move backwards so water was forced to

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.909 
move backwards so water was forced to
move<00:04:42.250> into<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.940> I<00:04:43.180> mean<00:04:43.900> forced<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.440> diffuse

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
move into the I mean forced to diffuse

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.089 
move into the I mean forced to diffuse
basically<00:04:45.580> osmosis<00:04:46.150> was<00:04:46.509> forced<00:04:47.020> so<00:04:47.770> this

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
basically osmosis was forced so this

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.610 
basically osmosis was forced so this
pressure<00:04:48.460> this<00:04:48.880> positive<00:04:49.509> pressure<00:04:49.810> which<00:04:50.470> is

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
pressure this positive pressure which is

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.550 
pressure this positive pressure which is
required<00:04:51.160> to<00:04:51.669> prevent<00:04:52.060> water<00:04:52.419> from<00:04:52.630> diffusing

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
required to prevent water from diffusing

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.189 
required to prevent water from diffusing
in<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:54.190> called<00:04:54.610> osmotic<00:04:55.360> pressure<00:04:55.599> like

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
in is called osmotic pressure like

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.409 
in is called osmotic pressure like
before<00:04:57.009> you<00:04:57.130> apply<00:04:57.460> it<00:04:57.520> this<00:04:57.820> pressure<00:04:58.090> what

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
before you apply it this pressure what

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.450 
before you apply it this pressure what
was<00:04:58.570> happening<00:04:58.960> water<00:04:59.199> was<00:04:59.500> entering<00:04:59.889> from<00:05:00.160> 1

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
was happening water was entering from 1

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.089 
was happening water was entering from 1
to<00:05:00.699> 2<00:05:00.910> now<00:05:01.630> if<00:05:01.780> you<00:05:01.930> don't<00:05:02.199> want<00:05:02.530> any<00:05:02.800> more

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
to 2 now if you don't want any more

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.370 
to 2 now if you don't want any more
water<00:05:03.370> to<00:05:03.669> diffuse<00:05:04.090> in<00:05:04.389> you<00:05:04.599> don't<00:05:04.780> want<00:05:04.960> any

water to diffuse in you don't want any

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.920 
water to diffuse in you don't want any
further<00:05:05.680> water<00:05:06.070> to<00:05:06.639> move<00:05:06.820> from<00:05:07.120> 1<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.509> 2<00:05:07.660> or

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
further water to move from 1 to 2 or

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.629 
further water to move from 1 to 2 or
depending<00:05:08.620> you<00:05:08.710> can<00:05:08.889> apply<00:05:09.160> some<00:05:09.400> pressure

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
depending you can apply some pressure

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.520 
depending you can apply some pressure
from<00:05:09.910> here<00:05:10.180> as<00:05:10.750> soon<00:05:10.930> as<00:05:11.080> you<00:05:11.139> apply<00:05:11.349> pressure

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
from here as soon as you apply pressure

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.089 
from here as soon as you apply pressure
immediately<00:05:12.870> what<00:05:13.870> are<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.139> not<00:05:14.320> stop<00:05:14.740> coming

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
immediately what are the not stop coming

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.550 
immediately what are the not stop coming
in<00:05:15.220> as<00:05:15.400> you<00:05:15.789> keep<00:05:16.000> increasing<00:05:16.259> the<00:05:17.259> pressure

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
in as you keep increasing the pressure

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.010 
in as you keep increasing the pressure
gradually<00:05:18.280> you<00:05:18.729> will<00:05:18.910> see<00:05:19.090> that<00:05:19.240> what<00:05:19.479> is<00:05:19.690> that

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
gradually you will see that what is that

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.010 
gradually you will see that what is that
stopped<00:05:20.800> coming<00:05:21.130> in<00:05:21.430> from<00:05:21.760> 1<00:05:22.000> to<00:05:22.150> 2<00:05:22.360> if<00:05:22.780> you

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
stopped coming in from 1 to 2 if you

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.930 
stopped coming in from 1 to 2 if you
even<00:05:23.349> then<00:05:23.740> if<00:05:23.889> you<00:05:24.010> keep<00:05:24.190> applying<00:05:24.490> Road

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
even then if you keep applying Road

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.820 
even then if you keep applying Road
pressure<00:05:25.210> you<00:05:25.510> will<00:05:25.599> see<00:05:25.780> that<00:05:25.930> water<00:05:26.199> started

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
pressure you will see that water started

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.010 
pressure you will see that water started
moving<00:05:27.220> from<00:05:27.460> 2<00:05:27.789> to<00:05:28.000> 1<00:05:28.030> so<00:05:28.720> it<00:05:28.840> actually

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
moving from 2 to 1 so it actually

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.010 
moving from 2 to 1 so it actually
started<00:05:29.620> going<00:05:29.770> out<00:05:30.070> so<00:05:31.000> many<00:05:31.389> pump<00:05:31.750> pressure

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
started going out so many pump pressure

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.170 
started going out so many pump pressure
that<00:05:32.349> is<00:05:32.500> required<00:05:32.979> to<00:05:33.280> prevent<00:05:33.699> water<00:05:34.000> from

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
that is required to prevent water from

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.810 
that is required to prevent water from
diffusing<00:05:34.870> in<00:05:35.349> so<00:05:35.620> here<00:05:35.919> the<00:05:36.400> minimum

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
diffusing in so here the minimum

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.670 
diffusing in so here the minimum
pressure<00:05:37.000> which<00:05:37.330> is<00:05:37.479> required<00:05:37.870> to<00:05:37.960> stop<00:05:38.349> water

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
pressure which is required to stop water

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.640 
pressure which is required to stop water
from<00:05:38.979> coming<00:05:39.430> in<00:05:39.669> from<00:05:40.000> 1<00:05:40.330> to<00:05:40.659> 2<00:05:40.900> that<00:05:41.440> is

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
from coming in from 1 to 2 that is

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.890 
from coming in from 1 to 2 that is
called<00:05:41.889> osmotic<00:05:42.400> pressure<00:05:42.789> if<00:05:43.270> you<00:05:43.510> increase

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
called osmotic pressure if you increase

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.659 
called osmotic pressure if you increase
the<00:05:44.139> pressure<00:05:44.320> even<00:05:44.590> beyond<00:05:45.099> horse<00:05:45.310> modak

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
the pressure even beyond horse modak

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.399 
the pressure even beyond horse modak
pressure<00:05:45.880> then<00:05:46.210> water<00:05:46.449> potential<00:05:47.229> will

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
pressure then water potential will

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.969 
pressure then water potential will
increase<00:05:47.580> here<00:05:48.580> and<00:05:48.760> water<00:05:48.970> bills<00:05:49.389> and<00:05:49.979> what

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
increase here and water bills and what

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.800 
increase here and water bills and what
will<00:05:51.130> put<00:05:51.490> it<00:05:51.639> in<00:05:51.789> water<00:05:52.000> will<00:05:52.240> start<00:05:52.570> moving

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
will put it in water will start moving

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.810 
will put it in water will start moving
into<00:05:53.320> this<00:05:53.860> side<00:05:54.720> right<00:05:55.720> so<00:05:56.349> that<00:05:56.860> is<00:05:57.099> osmotic

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
into this side right so that is osmotic

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.790 
into this side right so that is osmotic
pressure<00:06:00.150> so<00:06:01.150> it<00:06:01.389> is<00:06:01.659> a<00:06:01.870> positive<00:06:02.500> pressure

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
pressure so it is a positive pressure

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.879 
pressure so it is a positive pressure
which<00:06:03.250> is<00:06:03.400> applied<00:06:03.880> because<00:06:04.120> it<00:06:04.510> basically

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
which is applied because it basically

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.129 
which is applied because it basically
increases<00:06:05.889> the<00:06:06.370> water<00:06:06.610> potential<00:06:07.180> it<00:06:07.750> helps

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
increases the water potential it helps

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.170 
increases the water potential it helps
to<00:06:08.289> increase<00:06:08.409> the<00:06:08.680> water<00:06:08.979> potential<00:06:09.490> because

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
to increase the water potential because

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.570 
to increase the water potential because
due<00:06:10.930> to<00:06:11.080> addition<00:06:11.500> of<00:06:11.590> the<00:06:11.740> solute<00:06:12.159> the<00:06:12.370> water

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
due to addition of the solute the water

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.120 
due to addition of the solute the water
potential<00:06:13.000> was<00:06:13.360> reduced<00:06:13.750> to<00:06:14.050> sai<00:06:14.349> s<00:06:14.650> that<00:06:14.979> is<00:06:15.009> a

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
potential was reduced to sai s that is a

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.339 
potential was reduced to sai s that is a
negative<00:06:15.340> potential<00:06:15.940> but<00:06:16.630> now<00:06:16.810> this<00:06:17.110> pressure

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349 
negative potential but now this pressure

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.610 
negative potential but now this pressure
potential<00:06:17.979> by<00:06:18.099> application<00:06:18.699> of<00:06:18.759> this

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
potential by application of this

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.140 
potential by application of this
it<00:06:19.860> will<00:06:20.010> again<00:06:20.280> increase<00:06:20.340> the<00:06:20.970> water

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
it will again increase the water

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.750 
it will again increase the water
potential<00:06:21.600> so<00:06:22.140> it<00:06:22.350> might<00:06:22.650> be<00:06:22.950> able<00:06:23.100> to<00:06:23.250> convert

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
potential so it might be able to convert

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.640 
potential so it might be able to convert
this<00:06:24.090> negative<00:06:24.540> value<00:06:24.660> into<00:06:25.080> a<00:06:25.170> positive

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
this negative value into a positive

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.310 
this negative value into a positive
value<00:06:25.980> or<00:06:26.130> it<00:06:26.760> might<00:06:26.970> be<00:06:27.210> negative<00:06:27.720> but<00:06:28.170> the

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
value or it might be negative but the

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.950 
value or it might be negative but the
magnitude<00:06:28.950> will<00:06:29.220> at<00:06:29.340> least<00:06:29.520> decrease<00:06:29.940> like<00:06:30.690> if

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
magnitude will at least decrease like if

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.980 
magnitude will at least decrease like if
it<00:06:31.200> was<00:06:31.410> say<00:06:31.860> minus<00:06:32.310> 600<00:06:33.000> now<00:06:33.390> it<00:06:33.660> will<00:06:33.840> be

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
it was say minus 600 now it will be

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.890 
it was say minus 600 now it will be
maybe<00:06:34.170> minus<00:06:34.650> 6<00:06:35.030> so<00:06:36.030> that<00:06:36.150> is<00:06:36.420> it<00:06:36.540> is<00:06:36.660> still

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
maybe minus 6 so that is it is still

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.480 
maybe minus 6 so that is it is still
negative<00:06:37.080> that<00:06:37.440> is<00:06:37.590> why<00:06:37.740> we<00:06:37.920> told<00:06:38.250> that

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
negative that is why we told that

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.910 
negative that is why we told that
pressure<00:06:38.940> potential<00:06:39.360> can<00:06:39.810> be<00:06:39.990> negative<00:06:40.410> but

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
pressure potential can be negative but

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.370 
pressure potential can be negative but
it<00:06:41.340> increases<00:06:42.240> the<00:06:42.480> value<00:06:42.870> of<00:06:42.900> water

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
it increases the value of water

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.240 
it increases the value of water
