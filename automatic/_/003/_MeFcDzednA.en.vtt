00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
area now in this segment we're going to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.429 
area now in this segment we're going to
specifically<00:00:17.699> talk<00:00:17.910> about<00:00:18.180> calories<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.020> how

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
specifically talk about calories and how

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.220 
specifically talk about calories and how
they<00:00:19.619> affect<00:00:19.710> your<00:00:20.100> body<00:00:20.480> now<00:00:21.480> before<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.990> do

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
they affect your body now before you do

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.560 
they affect your body now before you do
that<00:00:22.260> let's<00:00:22.650> just<00:00:22.920> kind<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.160> go<00:00:23.310> into<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:24.449> is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
that let's just kind of go into what is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.380 
that let's just kind of go into what is
a<00:00:24.600> counter<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.279> calorie<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.550> actually<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.029> units

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
a counter a calorie is actually a units

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.750 
a counter a calorie is actually a units
of<00:00:27.570> heat<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.070> need<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> understand

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
of heat so what you need to understand

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.730 
of heat so what you need to understand
that<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.689> all<00:00:30.750> calories<00:00:31.140> actually<00:00:31.679> are

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
that not all calories actually are

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.260 
that not all calories actually are
created<00:00:32.070> equal<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.579> they<00:00:32.730> affect<00:00:33.030> your<00:00:33.149> body

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
created equal and they affect your body

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.819 
created equal and they affect your body
differently<00:00:33.510> let<00:00:34.380> me<00:00:34.440> show<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.770> I'm

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
differently let me show you what I'm

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.520 
differently let me show you what I'm
talking<00:00:34.860> about<00:00:35.750> for<00:00:36.750> every<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.110> gram<00:00:37.350> of

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
talking about for every one gram of

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.520 
talking about for every one gram of
carbohydrate<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.460> ingest<00:00:38.910> four<00:00:39.270> calories

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
carbohydrate you ingest four calories

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.920 
carbohydrate you ingest four calories
now<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:40.739> every<00:00:40.829> protein<00:00:41.280> one<00:00:41.969> brand<00:00:42.270> you

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
now for every protein one brand you

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.080 
now for every protein one brand you
ingest<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.410> calories<00:00:43.800> now<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:44.789> every<00:00:44.850> gram

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
ingest for calories now for every gram

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.910 
ingest for calories now for every gram
with<00:00:45.360> fat<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:45.809> double<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.770> nine

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
with fat it's double actually nine

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
with fat it's double actually nine
calories<00:00:47.899> so<00:00:48.899> as<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.260> see<00:00:49.940> calories

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
calories so as you can see calories

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.130 
calories so as you can see calories
aren't<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.390> created<00:00:51.719> equal<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.110> just

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
aren't really created equal as I just

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.260 
aren't really created equal as I just
told<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:53.340> also<00:00:53.489> don't<00:00:53.730> affect<00:00:54.149> your

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
told you but they also don't affect your

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
told you but they also don't affect your
body<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.629> same<00:00:54.840> way<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.410> ingest

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
body the same way when you do ingest

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.619 
body the same way when you do ingest
them<00:00:56.070> actually<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.300> something

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
them actually going to do something

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
them actually going to do something
called<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> thermogenic<00:00:58.379> effect<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.920> food<00:00:59.100> so

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
called the thermogenic effect of food so

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.250 
called the thermogenic effect of food so
for<00:00:59.879> every<00:01:00.059> car<00:01:00.270> 100<00:01:00.809> calories<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
for every car 100 calories and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.229 
for every car 100 calories and
carbohydrates<00:01:01.530> your<00:01:02.399> body's<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:02.850> going

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
carbohydrates your body's actually going

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.370 
carbohydrates your body's actually going
to<00:01:03.329> burn<00:01:03.570> about<00:01:04.460> 10<00:01:05.460> calories<00:01:06.020> now<00:01:07.020> because

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
to burn about 10 calories now because

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.030 
to burn about 10 calories now because
protein<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.040> such<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> very<00:01:08.700> thick<00:01:09.320> dense<00:01:10.320> piece

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
protein is such a very thick dense piece

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.490 
protein is such a very thick dense piece
of<00:01:11.340> food<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> take<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.049> lot<00:01:13.260> longer

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
of food it's going to take a lot longer

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.620 
of food it's going to take a lot longer
if<00:01:13.740> your<00:01:13.860> body<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.310> digest<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.060> inside<00:01:15.479> of

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
if your body to digest that inside of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.929 
if your body to digest that inside of
you<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.380> you're<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.799> take<00:01:16.979> 15<00:01:17.549> calories

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
you so you're going to take 15 calories

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.920 
you so you're going to take 15 calories
to<00:01:18.659> digest<00:01:19.430> 100<00:01:20.430> calories<00:01:21.240> worth<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.540> protein

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
to digest 100 calories worth of protein

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.859 
to digest 100 calories worth of protein
that's<00:01:22.170> pretty<00:01:22.320> cool<00:01:22.439> with<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:23.119> now<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.780> you
