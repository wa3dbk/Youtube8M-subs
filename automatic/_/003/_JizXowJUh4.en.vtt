00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.719
 hello such greetings lambs and 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.019
 come back I'll talk about some 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.900
 very little wheels for free ride 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:21.369
 for slides maybe they can also be 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.780
 for freestyle or for krugman for 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.260
 use them there in whatever you want 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.710
 They are the rain 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.040
 green 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.340
 and the blood have a size of 70 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.340
 millimeters 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.090
 they come in several hardnesses I have here are 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.960
 80 come in several smaller sizes 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.210
 bigger 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.210
 and they have a contact area of 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.899
 They also have this size 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.250
 when you make a slide skidding the 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.610
 louvre is not that you're going to let it go 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.710
 drop this wheel is pink then 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.909
 it's interesting it does not look very good 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.909
 they are centers 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.430
 and they facilitate the skidding a lot and 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.220
 example the center of the core is a bit 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.110
 wider that allows wear 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.900
 be uniform and also that the feeling of 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.260
 of the skid is a little better without 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.500
 so much rebound then if I were the ones 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.140
 I recommend they are very good 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.070
 and it's another option for slides 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.070
 freeride 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.250
 different things are more or less 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.440
 I could say that they are not for 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.300
 beginners because wayne does not have 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.300
 very hard wheels 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.670
 then these are soft if they are for 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.979
 Freeride at a certain speed a little bit 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.189
 greater not so much for beginners 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.220
 so if you want to start in 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.400
 slides 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.880
 you can use these but they are not so 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.180
 easy to skid bone I refer to as 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.590
 for example some 86 are a little bit more 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.950
 easy to defeat that about 80 or 79 a 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.950
 something like that 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.709
 they already have a little more practice if 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.600
 You can but I would recommend it more 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.210
 for those who 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.250
 this 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.120
 they already have a little more experience 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.819
 with skids 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.900
 but that's your opinion, I say it's my 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.689
 opinion if you want to have them 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.780
 even if this beginner can be 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:45.230
 more need to practice a little more 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.510
 slides with glove or no glove 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.290
 to fry but they are very good wheels 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.290
 Well, there it is
