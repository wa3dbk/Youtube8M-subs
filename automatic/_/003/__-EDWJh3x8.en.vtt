00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
kind of have to take a step back I think

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.369 
kind of have to take a step back I think
they're<00:00:46.860> always<00:00:47.100> top<00:00:47.520> perspective<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.379> there

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
they're always top perspective and there

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.889 
they're always top perspective and there
is<00:00:49.530> also<00:00:49.739> such<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> thing<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.610> over<00:00:51.390> practicing

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
is also such a thing as over practicing

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.350 
is also such a thing as over practicing
mm-hmm<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.039> kill<00:00:53.250> something<00:00:53.670> kind<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.270> by

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
mm-hmm you can kill something kind of by

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.090 
mm-hmm you can kill something kind of by
doing<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> wrong<00:00:55.199> way<00:00:55.230> too<00:00:55.379> many<00:00:55.620> times<00:00:55.890> or

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
psychology on oneself one thing that I

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.600 
psychology on oneself one thing that I
noticed<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.730> when<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> give<00:01:03.329> master<00:01:03.629> classes

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
noticed with when I give master classes

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.899 
noticed with when I give master classes
just<00:01:05.610> once<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:07.220> this<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.760> say<00:01:08.880> that

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
just once when this is not to say that

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.730 
just once when this is not to say that
everyone<00:01:09.540> does<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:09.990> very<00:01:10.020> often<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.560> see

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
everyone does this but very often I see

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.160 
everyone does this but very often I see
if<00:01:11.520> something<00:01:12.000> goes<00:01:12.390> wrong<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.900> student

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
if something goes wrong like a student

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.149 
if something goes wrong like a student
play<00:01:13.320> something<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.710> play<00:01:13.860> something<00:01:14.010> out

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159

play something they play something out
of<00:01:14.220> tune<00:01:14.400> or<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:14.610> miss<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> shift<00:01:14.880> they<00:01:15.600> will

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
of tune or they miss a shift they will

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
of tune or they miss a shift they will
go<00:01:15.869> back<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.080> sort<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.490> just

it's<00:01:29.100> very<00:01:29.189> important<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.030> think<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.500> that

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
it's very important I think I think that

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.600 
it's very important I think I think that
kind<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.860> practice<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.280> very

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
kind of practice is very

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.460 
kind of practice is very
counterproductive<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.509> discovered<00:01:34.380> for

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
counterproductive I discovered for

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.440 
counterproductive I discovered for
myself<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.640> students<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.240> very

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
myself and for students it's very

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.700 
myself and for students it's very
important<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> practice<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.290> complete

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
important to practice in a complete

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.890 
important to practice in a complete
sentence<00:01:38.009> yeah<00:01:38.490> because<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.450> way<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
sentence yeah because that way with the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.600 
sentence yeah because that way with the
with<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> stuttering<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.009> actually<00:01:41.400> learned

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
with the stuttering you actually learned

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.120 
with the stuttering you actually learned
the<00:01:41.759> mistake<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:43.500> teach<00:01:43.710> yourself<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the mistake you teach yourself the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
the mistake you teach yourself the
mistake<00:01:44.460> whereas<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.090> stopped<00:01:45.960> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
mistake whereas if you stopped you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840 
mistake whereas if you stopped you
calmly<00:01:46.439> put<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.829> bow<00:01:46.979> down<00:01:47.159> take<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> breath

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
calmly put your bow down take a breath

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.789 
calmly put your bow down take a breath
and<00:01:48.119> then<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.899> back<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> beginning<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and then go back to the beginning of the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.580 
and then go back to the beginning of the
phrase<00:01:50.119> you<00:01:51.119> said<00:01:51.329> okay<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.659> did<00:01:52.049> something<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
phrase you said okay I did something and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.929 
phrase you said okay I did something and
now<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> know<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.220> did<00:01:53.310> I'm<00:01:53.579> going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.820> fix

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
now I know what I did I'm going to fix

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.480 
now I know what I did I'm going to fix
it<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.290> much<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.680> positive<00:01:56.369> approach

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it so it's a much more positive approach

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.359 
it so it's a much more positive approach
like<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> mistake<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> fresh<00:01:58.530> frustrating

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
like a mistake or a fresh frustrating

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.679 
like a mistake or a fresh frustrating
part<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.729> piece<00:01:59.880> yeah<00:02:00.090> instead<00:02:00.570> of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
part of a piece yeah instead of

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.929 
part of a piece yeah instead of
approaching<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.140> from<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.520> negative<00:02:02.520> aspect

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
approaching it from the negative aspect

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:03.950 
approaching it from the negative aspect
right<00:02:03.090> well<00:02:03.299> because<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.840> become

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
right well because then you become

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.609 
right well because then you become
irrational<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.860> panicked<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.630> creates

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
irrational and panicked and that creates

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.529 
irrational and panicked and that creates
all<00:02:07.799> sorts<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.129> problems<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.670> it's<00:02:08.879> better<00:02:09.390> go

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
all sorts of problems so it's better go

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.839 
all sorts of problems so it's better go
balls<00:02:09.840> at<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.259> point<00:02:10.560> totally<00:02:11.280> snowballs<00:02:11.640> so

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
balls at that point totally snowballs so

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.640 
balls at that point totally snowballs so
just<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.780> know

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
just you know

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.050 
just you know
take<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.680> step<00:02:14.920> back<00:02:15.130> take<00:02:15.460> your<00:02:15.640> breath<00:02:15.790> and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
take a step back take your breath and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.450 
take a step back take your breath and
then<00:02:16.240> do<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.720> again<00:02:16.870> until<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.800> get<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.040> mean<00:02:18.370> of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
then do it again until you get I mean of

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.640 
then do it again until you get I mean of
course<00:02:18.610> until<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.030> get<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.240> right<00:02:19.360> but<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:20.530> a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
course until you get it right but in a

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:29.420 
course until you get it right but in a
complete<00:02:20.950> sentence<00:02:21.220> yeah

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.489 

you
