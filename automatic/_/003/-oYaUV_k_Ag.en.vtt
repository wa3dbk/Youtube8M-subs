00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.440 
Stewart I think there's some truth with
some<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.900> people<00:02:28.079> but<00:02:28.440> not<00:02:28.980> everyone<00:02:29.420> no<00:02:30.420> I

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
some of the people but not everyone no I

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.750 
some of the people but not everyone no I
I'm<00:02:31.440> sure<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:32.010> there<00:02:32.280> are<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> lot<00:02:32.549> of<00:02:32.579> them

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
I'm sure like there are a lot of them

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.780 
I'm sure like there are a lot of them
who<00:02:32.909> are<00:02:33.000> richer<00:02:33.269> crappy<00:02:33.629> but<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:36.349> like<00:02:40.159> I<00:02:41.159> think

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
who are richer crappy but I like I think

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.660 
who are richer crappy but I like I think
every<00:02:42.180> private<00:02:42.690> school<00:02:42.930> or<00:02:43.470> public<00:02:43.769> school<00:02:44.220> as

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
every private school or public school as

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.240 
every private school or public school as
they're<00:02:45.090> they're<00:02:45.450> preppy<00:02:45.810> kids<00:02:45.989> it's<00:02:46.799> just<00:02:47.160> a

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
they're they're preppy kids it's just a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.390 
they're they're preppy kids it's just a
way<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.430> dress<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:48.000> really<00:02:48.299> not<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.510> big

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
way to dress it's really not that big

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.430 
way to dress it's really not that big
also<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.609> think<00:02:50.760> no<00:02:51.450> matter<00:02:51.629> where<00:02:51.930> you're

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
also I think no matter where you're

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.960 
also I think no matter where you're
gonna<00:02:52.560> find<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.069> kid<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.430> think<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.760> better

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
gonna find the kid you think is better

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.360 
gonna find the kid you think is better
than<00:02:54.209> someone<00:02:54.660> else<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.769> don't<00:02:55.950> think<00:02:56.159> that

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
than someone else so don't think that

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.550 
than someone else so don't think that
these<00:02:56.489> stereotypes<00:02:57.090> are<00:02:57.299> unique<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.690> member<00:02:58.260> I

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
these stereotypes are unique to member I

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.619 
these stereotypes are unique to member I
think<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.370> they<00:02:59.519> may<00:02:59.730> have<00:02:59.760> a<00:03:00.030> little<00:03:00.450> bit<00:03:00.599> of

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
think that they may have a little bit of

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.080 
think that they may have a little bit of
truth<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.650> think<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.069> they're<00:03:02.250> true<00:03:02.609> for

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
truth but I think that they're true for

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.379 
truth but I think that they're true for
other<00:03:03.720> schools<00:03:03.989> besides
