M 14x now a lot of you who are familiar
with<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.220> Alienware<00:00:26.580> staff<00:00:27.000> will<00:00:27.180> already

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
with the Alienware staff will already

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.750 
with the Alienware staff will already
know<00:00:28.109> about<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.369> those<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.519> you

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.519 
know about this but for those of you
that<00:00:29.880> don't<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.269> think<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.720> quite<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> cool

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that don't I think this is quite a cool

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.990 
that don't I think this is quite a cool
little<00:00:31.679> feature<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.700> might<00:00:32.880> be

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
little feature that you might be

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.389 
little feature that you might be
interested<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.070> essentially<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.280> this

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
interested in and essentially what this

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.340 
interested in and essentially what this
enables<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.570> completely

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
enables you to do is completely

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.860 
enables you to do is completely
configure<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.520> colors<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.719> lights

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
configure the colors of the lights

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.910 
configure the colors of the lights
around<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:41.030> Alienware<00:00:42.030> laptop<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:43.110> there's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
around this Alienware laptop and there's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.529 
around this Alienware laptop and there's
an<00:00:44.070> application<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> that's

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
an application on here and that's

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.799 
an application on here and that's
actually<00:00:45.780> called<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.410> TNF<00:00:47.160> X<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.760> then<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:48.480> of

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
actually called a TNF X and then all of

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.650 
actually called a TNF X and then all of
the<00:00:49.050> different<00:00:49.739> sections<00:00:49.980> here<00:00:50.520> are<00:00:50.730> broken

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
the different sections here are broken

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.229 
the different sections here are broken
down<00:00:51.809> into<00:00:52.070> separate<00:00:53.070> kind<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.460> code<00:00:53.760> areas

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
down into separate kind of code areas

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.180 
down into separate kind of code areas
and<00:00:54.600> all<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.960> need<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.500> click<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:55.949> of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and all we need to do is click on one of

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.270 
and all we need to do is click on one of
those<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.690> choose<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.649> color<00:00:58.920> that

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
those and then the choose the color that

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.959 
those and then the choose the color that
we<00:00:59.670> want<00:01:00.469> for<00:01:01.469> example<00:01:01.500> blue<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
we want for example blue and then you

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.179 
we want for example blue and then you
can<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.290> front<00:01:04.710> lights<00:01:04.949> for

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
can see that the front lights for

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.580 
can see that the front lights for
example<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> change<00:01:06.150> blue<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.380> want

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
example here of change blue if we want

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.520 
example here of change blue if we want
to<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.430> choose<00:01:08.880> pulse<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:10.350> they're

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
to we can choose pulse and then they're

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.649 
to we can choose pulse and then they're
actually<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> pulse<00:01:14.150> but<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.450> see

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
actually going to pulse but you can see

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.840 
actually going to pulse but you can see
now<00:01:15.689> or<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.979> aren't<00:01:17.189> -<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.729> actually

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
now or if we aren't - we can actually

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.050 
now or if we aren't - we can actually
choose<00:01:18.210> morph<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.560> apply<00:01:19.830> that

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
choose morph and then we can apply that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.520 
choose morph and then we can apply that
and<00:01:21.060> they'll<00:01:21.180> actually<00:01:21.479> morph<00:01:21.900> between<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
and they'll actually morph between the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.039 
and they'll actually morph between the
two<00:01:22.680> colors<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.900> video

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
two colors as you can see in the video

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.819 
two colors as you can see in the video
here<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:27.000> if<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.570> want<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.960> also<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.799> change

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
here so if we want to also we can change

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.350 
here so if we want to also we can change
all<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> different<00:01:29.759> sections<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
all the different sections of the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.690 
all the different sections of the
keyboards<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.990> different<00:01:31.320> colors<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:32.460> can

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
keyboards to different colors we can

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.450 
keyboards to different colors we can
choose<00:01:32.939> pink<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> first<00:01:34.380> one<00:01:34.680> orange<00:01:35.310> for

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
choose pink for the first one orange for

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.090 
choose pink for the first one orange for
the<00:01:35.520> next<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.360> then<00:01:36.869> yellow<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:38.009> if

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the next one and then yellow and then if

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.219 
the next one and then yellow and then if
we<00:01:38.250> want<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.820> could<00:01:38.970> choose<00:01:39.180> maybe<00:01:39.420> blue

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
we want to we could choose maybe blue

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.319 
we want to we could choose maybe blue
for<00:01:40.530> example<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.820> we're<00:01:41.939> going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> have

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
for example and then we're going to have

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.200 
for example and then we're going to have
the<00:01:42.960> whole<00:01:43.170> keyboard<00:01:43.770> lit<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.030> different

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
the whole keyboard lit up in a different

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.880 
the whole keyboard lit up in a different
array<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.899> colors<00:01:47.750> we<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:49.049> change<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
array of colors we can change the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.850 
array of colors we can change the
Alienware<00:01:50.490> light<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.810> screen<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
Alienware light on the screen here to a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.410 
Alienware light on the screen here to a
different<00:01:53.159> color<00:01:53.340> by<00:01:53.549> simply<00:01:54.000> clicking<00:01:54.240> on

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
different color by simply clicking on

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.539 
different color by simply clicking on
that<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.439> choosing<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.979> color<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.460> we

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
that and then choosing the color that we

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.940 
that and then choosing the color that we
want<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.180> change<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:58.799> we

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
want that to change to and then if we

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.560 
want that to change to and then if we
want<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.219> we<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.939> even<00:02:00.060> create<00:02:00.360> our<00:02:00.509> own

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
want to we can even create our own

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.600 
want to we can even create our own
themes<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:01.829> we<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.100> flick<00:02:02.430> between

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
themes and then we can flick between

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.270 
themes and then we can flick between
those<00:02:03.060> different<00:02:03.479> themes<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.649> let's<00:02:05.100> just

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
those different themes so let's just

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.399

well<00:02:27.329> and<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.349> say<00:02:28.590> if<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.890> want<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.280> you

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
well and like I say if you want to you

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.949 
well and like I say if you want to you
can<00:02:29.579> create<00:02:29.879> themes<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.569> can<00:02:30.720> easily

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
can create themes and you can easily

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.259 
can create themes and you can easily
flick<00:02:31.349> between<00:02:31.500> those<00:02:31.920> things<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.120> think

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
flick between those things so I think

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.300 
flick between those things so I think
this<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.659> a<00:02:33.689> really<00:02:33.989> quite<00:02:34.439> cool<00:02:34.769> feature<00:02:35.159> to
