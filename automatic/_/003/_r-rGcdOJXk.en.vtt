00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 as it is best known among the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.490
 friends entered for the first time in a 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.730
 swimming pool due to visual impairment 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.670
 able to see the activities offered but 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.300
 has clearly described what can be 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.980
 when you touch the water you are so afraid 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.199
 and now how are you feeling after 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.630
 a few hours and doing exercise was 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.039
 well even if a teacher by my side 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.410
 it's a wonder 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.949
 already had a displacement of the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.030
 retina and ten years ago lost his vision 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.300
 took the opportunity to show your skills 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.910
 and remember the times of child or 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.559
 to go to the river at the bar in the river 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.600
 after a while semac started to 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.910
 to go to the pool the project that 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.180
 will offer classes twice a week 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.399
 for the visually impaired 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.309
 semac municipal service center 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.770
 blind people is part of a 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.440
 project that has the financial support of 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.230
 ministry of sports through law 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.080
 of fiscal incentive with action partnership 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.850
 social network of rio clara sesi and a company 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.619
 that they get their 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.600
 Let them come to the meeting. 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.150
 that they can your easy swimming 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.189
 physical education and are ordinary citizens 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.590
 as we have opportunity to right 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.950
 according to the project coordinator o 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.630
 objective is to provide an alternative 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.390
 to physical education for the disabled 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.180
 because they do not have this 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.240
 opportunity to practice activities 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.070
 during the school period and the intention is 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.280
 offer a complete lesson to 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.159
 visually impaired exercises that were 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.229
 only tailored to them from the customer 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.360
 was the adapted the one where they have 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.930
 It's difficult to get so far. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.820
 was the sounds the tact and attached to the project but 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.409
 the method of nadai is the same as that of others 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.229
 the swimming project for the disabled 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.390
 should be developed in 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.479
 partnership with the state of sÃ£o 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.500
 within nine cores from the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.750
 next year 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.060
 the partnership that is already in 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.729
 activities that are developed within 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.140
 disability institution 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.149
 We have several other projects in 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.880
 multiple units already with other partners 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.300
 where they already exist 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.200
 for example, volleyball is basketball 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.630
 I enjoyed this activity and 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.740
 of the opportunity that God has given 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.420
 for us 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.860
 I think this is very important for the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.630
 socializing in society 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.630
 extremely important
