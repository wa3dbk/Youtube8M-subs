 show moderate günther jauch he wool 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.530
 but almost everything I do not think so 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.540
 the solution you have something else tv 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.450
 Quiz also there is a no there is 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.010
 Not 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.840
 the time has now expired 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.000
 yes yes you me too 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.040
 so you have the call joker 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.250
 consumed is not even available to them 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.830
 What are you doing now? 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.099
 not as if they had to go insane 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.099
 continue 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.989
 what do I do now 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.360
 you have two more joker you 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:14.040
 could question the audience 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.910
 he knows the audience at rtl 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:22.980
 but maybe they can talk 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:26.130
 them anyway 11 then makes her audience 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.739
 then I would like statistics now what 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:34.140
 after the audience is probably right 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.910
 Now so I think the vote unanimously 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.700
 If you ask me I know now 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:45.150
 which is due to what would rule miller 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:47.129
 Do you think it's still one? 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.290
 rtl audience I have you one more 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.359
 possibility 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.280
 yes you can now still the 50 50 joker 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.440
 but then we have none 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.440
 possibility more then you should have one 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.420
 Answer but I'll take that 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.230
 but before it gets bad 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.970
 then let's answer two times 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.250
 Johanna now they have consumed everything 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.340
 What you can consume is still there 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:16.419
 two answer options are left 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.400
 that or what do you think which ones 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.919
 successful tv quiz show moderated 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.889

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.280

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.280
 hermeler great 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.310
 they probably want to do that then 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.930
 actually know that choose 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:47.050
 Answer a 50 euro question everyone we do 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.320
 That's when they tell me so 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.850
 then I take that too okay me 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.850
 right after that, it's not an issue 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:06.850
 Gold question asking questions and answering betting 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:08.880

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.590
 we do that 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.360
 unfortunately they lost and 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.580
 go home with zero euros 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.990
 after all, someone can be fast 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.410
 different on the chair 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.229
 it also has advantages for mueller as we do 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.640
 no victory here now 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.770
 why you have that completely different 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.450
