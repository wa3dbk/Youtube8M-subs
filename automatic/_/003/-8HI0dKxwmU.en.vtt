00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
graphics and that helps them work their

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.180 
graphics and that helps them work their
way<00:01:36.300> first<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:37.290> graphics<00:01:37.830> but<00:01:37.980> then

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
way first to the graphics but then

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.290 
way first to the graphics but then
through<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.550> scriptures<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.000> we're

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
through the scriptures that we're

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.180 
through the scriptures that we're
talking<00:01:39.480> about<00:01:39.900> at<00:01:40.050> that<00:01:40.080> time<00:01:40.560> they're

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
talking about at that time they're

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.310 
talking about at that time they're
flexible<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.090> usable<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.690> so<00:01:42.930> many<00:01:43.080> different

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
flexible and usable in so many different

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.150 
flexible and usable in so many different
ways<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.980> they<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.910> timeless<00:01:46.160> non

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
ways and they have that timeless non

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.420 
ways and they have that timeless non
cultural<00:01:47.880> aspect<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.600> them<00:01:48.720> which<00:01:49.710> benefits

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
cultural aspect to them which benefits

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.510 
cultural aspect to them which benefits
not<00:01:50.670> only<00:01:50.730> the<00:01:51.630> international<00:01:52.440> use<00:01:53.250> of

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
not only the international use of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.970 
not only the international use of
material<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.300> think<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:55.200> what<00:01:55.500> makes

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
material but I think that's what makes

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.430 
material but I think that's what makes
them<00:01:56.870> ageless<00:01:57.870> also<00:01:58.560> within<00:01:58.890> our<00:01:59.190> own<00:01:59.220> culture

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
them ageless also within our own culture

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.520 
them ageless also within our own culture
