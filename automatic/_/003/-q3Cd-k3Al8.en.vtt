00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.910
 meal and welcome here 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.630
 with us in the red bull x-fighters track 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.369
 they would be around a bit now 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.720
 the air and I are ready for 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.730
 Any questions you have mine 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.189
 my page will answer on the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.529
 give a professional part and lukas him 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.000
 responsible for the sporty part 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.560
 my name is the boss i am the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.359
 miserable director of the whole tour that is 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.890
 we are with our sport event 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.280
 on the move internationally 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.949
 and here for the first time the second time 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.540
 Munich but the first time on one 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.089
 the first floating lake on water 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.940
 all have now heard 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.610
 and I'm curious today, the first 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.479
 trainings this all went wonderfully 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.960
 better than expected shows times like this and 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.220
 the water out when we build ourselves 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.320
 completely built into the water 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.699
 we have four positions 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.350
 you do not have to build up at the same time 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.470
 moderately imagine a bit of assembly line 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.369
 the 62 ponto are with 70 taxi 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.549
 been delivered 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.080
 then put in three places in the water 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.210
 driven on a production for the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.850
 scaffolding next production next 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.440
 driven for the dortmund then from there 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.130
 over there from the corner, so to speak 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.690
 Position 1 parked is so strong and 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.160
 really actually on the centimeter 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.470
 measuring it exactly sounds pretty 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.880
 unlikely but we have one 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.890
 goal we have what per gps the course 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.990
 she planned to do exactly that before 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.909
 running around it on the same 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.040
 Concrete blocks in the water that are quasi 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.159
 without any points on those these are the ones 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.650
 landing exactly so everything up 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.400
 There is no water in the water here 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.250
 been reduced 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.250
 but everything in the 70s 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.920
 for the front were made the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.750
 Probability that in front of the water 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.910
 Lands probability is great 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.590
 less there are times invited further reading 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.340
 you from the driver side us yes me 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.440
 my name 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.420
 we do the whole thing every day 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.130
 that for several years and always 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.710
 and know what we are doing exactly 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.300
 that's why it's pretty 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.540
 unlikely because you are too extreme 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.180
 has a lot of leakage and this can be believed 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.370
 me that we have no chance that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.790
 here and driver in the water lands except 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.990
 the motorcycle some problem and man 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.770
 really can not stop it though 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.680
 I think that pretty much 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.980
 unlikely and on the curve can 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.930
 you also see there are such blue a 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.760
 as you say limitations 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.400
 and then they would 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.930
 stop and prevent 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.810
 this is not a show that is one 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.750
 serious sports gazzettes followed by 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.580
 champion enters this fall fit 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.540
 hold both together the pds into the water 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.830
 to build 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.170
 for years in our team 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.900
 Posing here was the first time she is 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.970
 possibility to do what in munich 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.950
 Do us why I fit everything in hand 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.920
 hand with let's all the sport 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.630
 Time simply simply offers everyone 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.580
 possibilities all athletic 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.920
 possibilities are virtually given here 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.200
 that is, it really is a chance 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.870
 as many tricks or all at 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.900
 show we have two big pope that 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:22.280
 is probably his bike club 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.380
 show we have all the ramps so the 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.900
 the larger ramps are here on 23 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.730
 meter and over if we too 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.380
 Show everything it is a ramp lead 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.890
 double backflip to do another 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.870
 can 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.610
 we already have a lot of training 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.500
 and therefore I would too 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.500
 say everything here 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.180
 tricks
