00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
round pick up you can't see it because

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.639 
round pick up you can't see it because
of<00:00:26.570> course<00:00:26.750> it's<00:00:26.930> embedded<00:00:27.230> in<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:27.529> guitar

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:27.649 
of course it's embedded in the guitar

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.760 
of course it's embedded in the guitar
but<00:00:28.040> these<00:00:28.610> are<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.210> four<00:00:29.540> screws<00:00:29.810> which

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
but these are the four screws which

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.460 
but these are the four screws which
serve<00:00:31.579> as<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:31.910> pole<00:00:32.119> pieces<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:32.750> pick<00:00:33.079> up<00:00:33.230> the

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
serve as the pole pieces and pick up the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.790 
serve as the pole pieces and pick up the
vibrations<00:00:33.920> from<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.059> strings<00:00:35.450> and<00:00:35.720> if<00:00:36.710> you

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
vibrations from the strings and if you

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.700 
vibrations from the strings and if you
can<00:00:36.920> see<00:00:37.130> that<00:00:39.010> low<00:00:40.010> light<00:00:40.570> video<00:00:41.570> there<00:00:41.960> you

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
can see that low light video there you

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.060 
can see that low light video there you
see<00:00:42.950> that<00:00:43.129> it<00:00:43.250> has<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:44.800> regular<00:00:45.800> bolt<00:00:46.960> for<00:00:47.960> a

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
see that it has a regular bolt for a

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.090 
see that it has a regular bolt for a
bridge<00:00:49.070> on<00:00:49.429> a<00:00:49.699> small<00:00:50.420> piece<00:00:50.719> of<00:00:50.749> metal<00:00:51.199> which

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
bridge on a small piece of metal which

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.229 
bridge on a small piece of metal which
gives<00:00:52.339> it<00:00:52.460> basically<00:00:52.879> a<00:00:53.530> steel<00:00:54.789> /<00:00:55.789> metal

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
gives it basically a steel / metal

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.049 
gives it basically a steel / metal
bridge<00:00:57.070> that<00:00:58.070> really<00:00:58.489> improves<00:00:58.850> the

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
bridge that really improves the

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.470 
bridge that really improves the
