probably be a better round drink for the

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.289 
probably be a better round drink for the
general<00:04:15.519> audience<00:04:15.670> because<00:04:16.060> you're<00:04:16.180> getting

general audience because you're getting

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.289 
general audience because you're getting
that<00:04:16.570> whiskey<00:04:16.900> taste

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299

you're getting the amaretto in there

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.640 
you're getting the amaretto in there
like<00:04:19.160> that<00:04:19.190> neat<00:04:19.639> almond<00:04:20.120> flavor<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:21.319> almost

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
like that neat almond flavor and almost

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.070 
like that neat almond flavor and almost

as I know but it's got some really neat
flavors<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.389> it<00:04:32.509> so<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.409> bring<00:04:33.650> those

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830
