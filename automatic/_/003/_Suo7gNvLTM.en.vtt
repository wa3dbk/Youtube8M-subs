little more difficult to get to the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.440 
little more difficult to get to the
stuff<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:43.050> wrench<00:01:44.050> in<00:01:44.260> there<00:01:48.180> starts<00:01:49.180> coming

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
stuff the wrench in there starts coming

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.640 
stuff the wrench in there starts coming
out<00:01:49.650> and<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:51.070> can<00:01:51.250> disconnect<00:01:51.820> your<00:01:52.030> wrench

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
out and you can disconnect your wrench

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:19.950 
out and you can disconnect your wrench
and<00:01:53.650> just<00:01:53.680> use<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.190> socket<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:19.450> excavator

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
and just use the socket the excavator

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.290 
and just use the socket the excavator
then<00:02:21.900> come<00:02:22.900> down<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.710> out<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.240> there's<00:02:25.240> a

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
then come down and out and there's a

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.949 
then come down and out and there's a
little<00:02:25.390> connect<00:02:26.140> right<00:02:26.410> here<00:02:26.740> just<00:02:27.730> push<00:02:28.090> and

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
little connect right here just push and

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.970 
little connect right here just push and
disconnect<00:02:30.900> very<00:02:31.900> important<00:02:32.260> when<00:02:32.410> replacing

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
disconnect very important when replacing

disconnect very important when replacing
one<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.310> these<00:02:33.400> actuators<00:02:33.670> make<00:02:34.420> sure<00:02:34.630> that

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
one of these actuators make sure that

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.740 
one of these actuators make sure that
you<00:02:34.959> do<00:02:35.200> not<00:02:35.230> power<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.640> actuator<00:02:37.120> up<00:02:37.270> before

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
you do not power the actuator up before

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.320 
you do not power the actuator up before
it's<00:02:37.870> installed<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:39.400> make<00:02:39.550> sure<00:02:39.580> your<00:02:39.880> key<00:02:40.180> is
