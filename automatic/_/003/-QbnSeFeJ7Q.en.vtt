00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.180 
like a they're way better quality than a
Barbie<00:00:47.430> obviously<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.539> they<00:00:48.750> weigh<00:00:48.930> like

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
Barbie obviously because they weigh like

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.060 
Barbie obviously because they weigh like
four<00:00:50.190> times<00:00:50.520> as<00:00:50.760> much<00:00:50.879> or<00:00:51.180> five<00:00:51.510> even<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.770> um

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
four times as much or five even but um

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.279 
four times as much or five even but um
she's<00:00:53.760> kind<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.270> kind<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.260> I

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
she's kind of like kind of like that I

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.049 
she's kind of like kind of like that I
guess<00:00:55.620> there's<00:00:56.039> no<00:00:56.219> way<00:00:56.399> she<00:00:56.579> would<00:00:56.699> fit<00:00:56.910> into

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
guess there's no way she would fit into

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.740 
guess there's no way she would fit into
Barbie<00:00:57.480> clothes<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.820> don't<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.329> I'm

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
don't really do a lot a lot but they

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.770 
don't really do a lot a lot but they
could<00:02:04.700> once<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:05.969> them<00:02:06.090> different<00:02:06.450> hands

I think that they will look better and
she<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> bunch<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.030> different<00:02:12.420> like
