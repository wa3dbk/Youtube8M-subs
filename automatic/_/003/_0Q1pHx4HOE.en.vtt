00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
how many bubbles I can get from it or if

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:16.570 
how many bubbles I can get from it or if
I<00:02:54.790> need<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:54.970> little<00:02:55.209> more<00:02:55.420> so

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.490 

it's<00:03:16.850> good<00:03:17.090> pretty<00:03:17.420> good

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.710 

and<00:03:21.010> I<00:03:21.160> could<00:03:21.430> just<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.760> little<00:03:22.180> bit<00:03:22.390> more<00:03:22.660> and

smaller bathtub than mine you definitely
only<00:04:20.489> need<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.880> use<00:04:20.910> like<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.269> fourth<00:04:21.720> um<00:04:22.169> for

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
only need to use like a fourth um for

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.840 
only need to use like a fourth um for
sure<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:23.910> if<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:24.510> notice<00:04:24.690> what<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.139> did<00:04:25.169> with

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
sure and if you notice what I did with

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.640 
sure and if you notice what I did with
running<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.880> bubbles<00:04:27.419> with<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.870> water<00:04:28.110> was<00:04:28.470> I

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
running the bubbles with the water was I

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.219 
running the bubbles with the water was I
had<00:04:28.860> just<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.370> few<00:04:29.400> inches<00:04:29.669> of<00:04:30.000> water<00:04:30.330> in<00:04:30.660> the

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
had just a few inches of water in the

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.100 
had just a few inches of water in the
tub<00:04:31.470> at<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.770> beginning<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.520> then<00:04:33.389> I<00:04:33.419> started

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
tub at the beginning and then I started

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.190 
tub at the beginning and then I started
running<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.620> water<00:04:34.860> with<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.460> crumbled<00:04:35.910> in

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
running the water with the crumbled in

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.500 
running the water with the crumbled in
bubble<00:04:37.200> bar<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:37.560> on<00:04:37.650> top<00:04:38.040> of<00:04:38.070> it<00:04:38.400> so<00:04:39.150> that

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
bubble bar and on top of it so that

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.990 
bubble bar and on top of it so that
tends<00:04:40.440> to<00:04:40.560> work<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.070> best<00:04:41.280> as<00:04:41.550> far<00:04:41.729> as<00:04:41.880> getting

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
tends to work the best as far as getting

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.140 
tends to work the best as far as getting
a<00:04:42.240> lot<00:04:42.389> of<00:04:42.419> friction<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:44.220> that's<00:04:44.669> probably<00:04:44.940> the

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
a lot of friction so that's probably the

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.719 
a lot of friction so that's probably the
best<00:04:45.330> way<00:04:47.150> to<00:04:48.150> do<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.800> bubble<00:04:49.800> bath<00:04:50.010> bars<00:04:50.340> I

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
best way to do the bubble bath bars I

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.520 
best way to do the bubble bath bars I
forgot<00:04:51.510> to<00:04:51.660> tell<00:04:51.780> you<00:04:51.840> how<00:04:52.020> much<00:04:52.139> they<00:04:52.350> cost
