00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.920 
not exactly perfect you know but it's a
lot<00:04:51.950> of<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.190> little<00:04:52.610> unevenness<00:04:53.420> and<00:04:53.480> there

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
lot of the little unevenness and there

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.140 
lot of the little unevenness and there
was<00:04:54.080> some<00:04:54.230> dents<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:54.770> some<00:04:55.430> rest<00:04:55.669> pits<00:04:55.970> and

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
was some dents and some rest pits and

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.180 
was some dents and some rest pits and
stuff<00:04:56.330> in<00:04:56.480> it<00:04:56.570> got<00:04:57.260> all<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.410> smoothed<00:04:57.800> out<00:04:57.980> so

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
stuff in it got all that smoothed out so

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.480 
stuff in it got all that smoothed out so
it's<00:04:58.310> got<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.460> good<00:04:58.760> good<00:04:59.600> surface<00:04:59.960> on<00:05:00.110> it<00:05:00.200> now

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
it's got a good good surface on it now

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.350 
it's got a good good surface on it now
should<00:05:01.490> look<00:05:01.730> pretty<00:05:01.760> good<00:05:02.030> in<00:05:02.180> a

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
should look pretty good in a

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.150 
should look pretty good in a
single-stage<00:05:02.810> paint<00:05:03.140> we<00:05:03.260> got<00:05:03.410> going<00:05:03.890> for<00:05:03.919> it

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
single-stage paint we got going for it

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.200 
single-stage paint we got going for it
and<00:05:05.290> got<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.410> frame<00:05:06.650> all<00:05:07.340> blasted<00:05:07.640> up<00:05:08.000> and

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
and got the frame all blasted up and

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.360 
and got the frame all blasted up and
cleaned<00:05:08.900> up<00:05:09.050> all<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.260> painting<00:05:09.710> off<00:05:09.980> of<00:05:10.250> it

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
cleaned up all the painting off of it

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.430 
cleaned up all the painting off of it
and<00:05:10.760> it's<00:05:11.300> a<00:05:11.450> pretty<00:05:11.660> good<00:05:11.840> shape<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.320> know

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
and it's a pretty good shape you know

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.930 
and it's a pretty good shape you know
for<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.650> most<00:05:12.710> part<00:05:13.040> but<00:05:13.220> I<00:05:13.280> guess<00:05:13.460> maybe<00:05:13.760> at

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
for the most part but I guess maybe at

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.360 
for the most part but I guess maybe at
some<00:05:13.970> point<00:05:14.180> it<00:05:14.510> sat<00:05:14.750> down<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.169> some<00:05:16.010> water<00:05:16.250> or

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
some point it sat down and some water or

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.159 
some point it sat down and some water or
sat<00:05:16.760> down<00:05:16.940> on<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.090> wet<00:05:17.330> ground<00:05:17.570> or<00:05:17.840> something

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
sat down on the wet ground or something

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.370 
sat down on the wet ground or something
and<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:20.270> part<00:05:20.510> of<00:05:20.570> the<00:05:20.630> frame<00:05:20.870> that<00:05:21.110> you<00:05:21.140> want

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
and the part of the frame that you want

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.090 
and the part of the frame that you want
to<00:05:21.500> be<00:05:21.620> the<00:05:21.800> strongest<00:05:22.250> has<00:05:23.680> got<00:05:24.680> some<00:05:24.860> pretty

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
to be the strongest has got some pretty

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.010 
to be the strongest has got some pretty
strong<00:05:25.310> pitting<00:05:25.730> in<00:05:25.820> it<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.690> good<00:05:26.840> news<00:05:26.990> is

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
strong pitting in it the good news is

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.219 
strong pitting in it the good news is
this<00:05:27.380> plate<00:05:27.860> back<00:05:28.100> here's<00:05:28.400> you<00:05:29.270> know<00:05:29.390> like

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
this plate back here's you know like

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.170 
this plate back here's you know like
three<00:05:30.470> sixteenth<00:05:30.860> of<00:05:30.979> an<00:05:31.100> inch<00:05:31.190> thick<00:05:31.580> and

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
three sixteenth of an inch thick and

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.820 
three sixteenth of an inch thick and
it's<00:05:32.390> kind<00:05:32.600> of<00:05:32.660> tying<00:05:32.900> all<00:05:33.080> this<00:05:33.229> together<00:05:33.410> and

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
it's kind of tying all this together and

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.400 
it's kind of tying all this together and
you<00:05:34.820> know<00:05:34.910> basically<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.390> points<00:05:35.750> here<00:05:36.380> and

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
you know basically the points here and

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.100 
you know basically the points here and
here<00:05:36.710> are<00:05:36.740> strong<00:05:37.160> but<00:05:37.970> and<00:05:38.300> it's<00:05:38.840> just<00:05:39.020> the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
here are strong but and it's just the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.810 
here are strong but and it's just the
bottom<00:05:39.380> half<00:05:39.560> of<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:39.800> pipe<00:05:40.010> that's<00:05:40.550> got

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
bottom half of the pipe that's got

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.600 
bottom half of the pipe that's got
issues<00:05:41.180> so<00:05:41.419> I'll<00:05:42.020> cut<00:05:42.320> that<00:05:42.440> out<00:05:42.500> you<00:05:42.860> know<00:05:43.280> all

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
issues so I'll cut that out you know all

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.210 
issues so I'll cut that out you know all
the<00:05:43.970> really<00:05:44.419> heavy<00:05:44.630> pitting<00:05:45.110> out<00:05:45.229> on<00:05:45.800> both

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
the really heavy pitting out on both

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.340 
the really heavy pitting out on both
sides<00:05:46.490> and<00:05:46.820> I've<00:05:47.270> got<00:05:47.450> some<00:05:47.690> one<00:05:47.960> inch<00:05:48.110> pipe

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
sides and I've got some one inch pipe

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.300 
sides and I've got some one inch pipe
board<00:05:48.650> and<00:05:49.310> I'll<00:05:49.520> section<00:05:50.000> out<00:05:50.150> the<00:05:50.300> pipe<00:05:50.540> and

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
board and I'll section out the pipe and

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.860 
board and I'll section out the pipe and
try<00:05:52.310> to<00:05:52.370> get<00:05:52.520> it<00:05:52.550> to<00:05:52.760> match<00:05:53.120> as<00:05:53.390> close<00:05:53.570> as<00:05:53.720> I<00:05:53.810> can

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
try to get it to match as close as I can

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.700 
try to get it to match as close as I can
and<00:05:54.169> will<00:05:54.350> it<00:05:54.590> back<00:05:54.740> in<00:05:54.919> there<00:05:55.100> and<00:05:56.410> so<00:05:57.410> we<00:05:57.560> get

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
and will it back in there and so we get

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.730 
and will it back in there and so we get
it<00:05:57.800> all<00:05:58.150> stripped<00:05:59.150> down<00:05:59.330> and<00:05:59.390> got<00:05:59.930> it<00:06:00.050> treated

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
it all stripped down and got it treated

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.440 
it all stripped down and got it treated
with<00:06:00.919> some<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:02.360> pic<00:06:02.540> licks<00:06:02.810> stuff<00:06:03.680> and<00:06:04.450> this

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
with some the pic licks stuff and this

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.530 
with some the pic licks stuff and this
guy<00:06:06.050> right<00:06:06.290> here<00:06:06.350> the<00:06:07.190> rack<00:06:07.550> goes<00:06:08.090> on<00:06:08.270> the<00:06:08.360> back

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
guy right here the rack goes on the back

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.469 
guy right here the rack goes on the back
is<00:06:09.160> it's<00:06:10.160> not<00:06:10.280> rotted<00:06:10.640> out<00:06:10.729> anywhere<00:06:11.120> but<00:06:11.360> it's

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
is it's not rotted out anywhere but it's

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.350 
is it's not rotted out anywhere but it's
heavily<00:06:12.320> pitted<00:06:12.710> up<00:06:12.860> as<00:06:13.040> well<00:06:13.250> you<00:06:14.060> can<00:06:14.210> see

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
heavily pitted up as well you can see

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.030 
heavily pitted up as well you can see
the<00:06:14.479> pitting<00:06:14.750> in<00:06:14.870> it<00:06:14.990> and<00:06:15.620> I<00:06:15.710> was<00:06:15.800> kind<00:06:16.010> of

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
the pitting in it and I was kind of

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.950 
the pitting in it and I was kind of
hoping<00:06:16.100> to<00:06:16.370> have<00:06:16.460> this<00:06:16.720> chrome<00:06:17.720> plated<00:06:18.200> but

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
hoping to have this chrome plated but

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.060 
hoping to have this chrome plated but
that'd<00:06:20.960> be<00:06:20.990> a<00:06:21.110> lot<00:06:21.290> of<00:06:21.320> work<00:06:21.530> for<00:06:21.560> the<00:06:21.860> chrome

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
that'd be a lot of work for the chrome

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.010 
that'd be a lot of work for the chrome
later<00:06:22.460> to<00:06:22.669> get<00:06:22.760> that<00:06:23.000> all<00:06:23.210> that's<00:06:23.479> those<00:06:23.720> pits

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
later to get that all that's those pits

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.010 
later to get that all that's those pits
smoothed<00:06:24.740> out<00:06:25.419> so<00:06:26.419> we'll<00:06:26.630> just<00:06:26.660> do<00:06:26.870> the<00:06:26.930> same

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
smoothed out so we'll just do the same

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.310 
smoothed out so we'll just do the same
thing<00:06:27.380> we're<00:06:27.530> doing<00:06:28.150> with<00:06:29.150> other<00:06:29.750> areas<00:06:30.080> this

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
thing we're doing with other areas this

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.870 
thing we're doing with other areas this
is<00:06:30.470> not<00:06:30.650> rotted<00:06:31.130> out<00:06:31.220> anywhere<00:06:31.580> it's<00:06:31.729> just

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
is not rotted out anywhere it's just

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.909 
is not rotted out anywhere it's just
really<00:06:32.090> heavy<00:06:32.330> pitting<00:06:32.720> and<00:06:32.990> it's<00:06:33.590> all<00:06:33.740> been

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
really heavy pitting and it's all been

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.880 
really heavy pitting and it's all been
blasted<00:06:34.310> out<00:06:34.460> in<00:06:35.300> treated<00:06:35.750> so<00:06:35.990> we'll<00:06:36.440> epoxy

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
blasted out in treated so we'll epoxy

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:43.870 
blasted out in treated so we'll epoxy
prom<00:06:37.099> it<00:06:37.250> and<00:06:39.099> hit<00:06:40.099> it<00:06:40.130> with<00:06:40.400> the<00:06:42.610> the<00:06:43.610> feather

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
prom it and hit it with the the feather
