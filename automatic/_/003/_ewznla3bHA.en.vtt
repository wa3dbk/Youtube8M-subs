and what's up YouTube I'm going to be
talking<00:00:04.210> about<00:00:04.299> the<00:00:05.289> fuel<00:00:05.919> filter<00:00:06.279> that<00:00:06.490> Honda

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029 
talking about the fuel filter that Honda

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.330 
talking about the fuel filter that Honda
Civics<00:00:07.390> have<00:00:07.569> this<00:00:07.869> is<00:00:07.990> a<00:00:08.019> 1994<00:00:08.680> Honda<00:00:09.010> Civic

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340 
Civics have this is a 1994 Honda Civic

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.410 
Civics have this is a 1994 Honda Civic
which<00:00:09.490> is<00:00:09.750> similar<00:00:10.750> between<00:00:11.490> 1992<00:00:12.490> and<00:00:12.880> 2000

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
which is similar between 1992 and 2000

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.299 
which is similar between 1992 and 2000
civics<00:00:13.840> and<00:00:14.050> how<00:00:14.500> the<00:00:14.560> engine<00:00:14.920> and<00:00:15.010> everything

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
civics and how the engine and everything

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.609 
civics and how the engine and everything
is<00:00:15.400> placed<00:00:15.519> around<00:00:15.700> the<00:00:15.880> engine<00:00:16.029> bay<00:00:16.349> so<00:00:17.349> this

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
is placed around the engine bay so this

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.950 
is placed around the engine bay so this
is<00:00:17.769> your<00:00:17.919> fuel<00:00:18.160> filter<00:00:18.310> right<00:00:18.609> here<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.869> one

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
is your fuel filter right here the one

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.230 
is your fuel filter right here the one
that<00:00:20.050> has<00:00:20.169> a<00:00:20.199> two<00:00:20.499> metal<00:00:20.829> fill<00:00:21.039> fittings<00:00:21.789> going

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
that has a two metal fill fittings going

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.319 
that has a two metal fill fittings going
into<00:00:22.449> it<00:00:22.599> that<00:00:23.289> has<00:00:23.529> to<00:00:23.560> be<00:00:23.769> replaced<00:00:24.329> most

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:25.329 
into it that has to be replaced most

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.700 
into it that has to be replaced most
like<00:00:25.689> usually<00:00:26.199> once<00:00:27.159> a<00:00:27.369> year<00:00:27.669> if<00:00:28.169> if<00:00:29.169> even<00:00:29.529> that

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
like usually once a year if if even that

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.570 
like usually once a year if if even that
just<00:00:30.550> try<00:00:31.089> to<00:00:31.149> replace<00:00:31.390> it<00:00:31.920> once<00:00:32.920> a<00:00:33.100> year<00:00:33.370> and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
just try to replace it once a year and

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.760 
just try to replace it once a year and
the<00:00:33.730> way<00:00:33.850> you<00:00:33.910> do<00:00:34.150> that<00:00:34.300> is<00:00:34.570> it's<00:00:35.560> pretty

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
the way you do that is it's pretty

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.850 
the way you do that is it's pretty
simple<00:00:36.130> so<00:00:36.790> you<00:00:36.850> loosen<00:00:37.450> this<00:00:37.570> up<00:00:37.810> and<00:00:37.990> this<00:00:38.500> up

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
simple so you loosen this up and this up

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.130 
simple so you loosen this up and this up
just<00:00:39.130> find<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.180> correct<00:00:40.330> size<00:00:40.870> for<00:00:40.900> the

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
just find the correct size for the

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.710 
just find the correct size for the
fittings<00:00:41.440> and<00:00:41.680> then<00:00:42.520> loosen<00:00:43.180> those<00:00:43.390> up<00:00:43.450> but

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
fittings and then loosen those up but

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.880 
fittings and then loosen those up but
before<00:00:43.990> you<00:00:44.110> do<00:00:44.230> that<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.440> have<00:00:44.470> to<00:00:44.590> relieve

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
before you do that you have to relieve

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.010 
before you do that you have to relieve
the<00:00:45.010> pressure<00:00:45.130> from<00:00:45.310> the<00:00:45.520> system<00:00:45.550> so<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.660> way

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
the pressure from the system so the way

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.930 
the pressure from the system so the way
you<00:00:47.080> do<00:00:47.290> that<00:00:47.440> is<00:00:47.710> you<00:00:48.070> go<00:00:48.190> over<00:00:48.460> here<00:00:48.490> to<00:00:48.820> your

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
you do that is you go over here to your

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.540 
you do that is you go over here to your
door<00:00:49.470> pop<00:00:50.470> your<00:00:50.680> gas<00:00:50.980> cap<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:52.510> your<00:00:52.870> gas<00:00:53.050> door

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
door pop your gas cap or your gas door

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.660 
door pop your gas cap or your gas door
open<00:00:55.440> perfect<00:00:56.440> just<00:00:56.620> like<00:00:56.740> this<00:00:56.950> and<00:00:57.190> then<00:00:57.520> to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
open perfect just like this and then to

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.120 
open perfect just like this and then to
really<00:00:57.820> relieve<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.570> pressure<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:59.770> loosen

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
really relieve the pressure you loosen

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.950 
really relieve the pressure you loosen
up<00:01:00.420> your<00:01:02.430> your<00:01:03.430> gas<00:01:03.610> cap<00:01:03.880> and<00:01:03.910> then<00:01:04.210> just<00:01:04.420> put

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
up your your gas cap and then just put

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
up your your gas cap and then just put
it<00:01:05.050> here<00:01:05.080> to<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:05.350> side<00:01:05.500> while<00:01:05.650> you<00:01:05.800> do<00:01:05.950> that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
it here to the side while you do that

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.860

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.010 
loosen it up and then just put it right
there<00:01:15.640> while<00:01:16.060> you<00:01:16.210> come<00:01:16.479> and<00:01:16.600> listen<00:01:16.900> these

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
there while you come and listen these

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.740 
there while you come and listen these
other<00:01:17.260> fittings<00:01:17.530> on<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.909> you<00:01:19.330> loosen<00:01:19.659> both

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
other fittings on so you loosen both

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.750 
other fittings on so you loosen both
both<00:01:20.260> of<00:01:20.380> those<00:01:20.470> up<00:01:20.710> just<00:01:20.950> have<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.400> little<00:01:21.610> rag

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
both of those up just have a little rag

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.760 
both of those up just have a little rag
next<00:01:22.180> to<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.360> because<00:01:23.200> there<00:01:23.320> will<00:01:23.440> be<00:01:23.500> some

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
next to you because there will be some

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.050 
next to you because there will be some
fuel<00:01:24.070> that's<00:01:24.400> going<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.640> be<00:01:24.700> coming<00:01:24.880> out

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
fuel that's going to be coming out

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.580 
fuel that's going to be coming out
leaking<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.659> little<00:01:25.750> bit<00:01:25.960> out<00:01:26.080> of<00:01:26.229> these<00:01:26.350> lines

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
leaking a little bit out of these lines

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.149 
leaking a little bit out of these lines
but<00:01:27.220> so<00:01:27.670> basically<00:01:28.030> all<00:01:28.300> you<00:01:28.390> do<00:01:28.720> is<00:01:29.350> loosen

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
but so basically all you do is loosen

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.510 
but so basically all you do is loosen
this<00:01:30.490> up<00:01:30.760> loosen<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:31.330> up<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.810> then<00:01:32.520> there

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
this up loosen that up and then there

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.330 
this up loosen that up and then there
should<00:01:33.760> be<00:01:33.940> a<00:01:34.200> 10<00:01:35.200> milliliter<00:01:35.530> 10<00:01:35.950> millimeter

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
should be a 10 milliliter 10 millimeter

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.130 
should be a 10 milliliter 10 millimeter
bolt<00:01:36.580> on<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:37.120> backside<00:01:37.479> of<00:01:37.510> it<00:01:37.659> right<00:01:37.810> here

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
bolt on the backside of it right here

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.080 
bolt on the backside of it right here
and<00:01:38.500> that'll<00:01:38.799> loosen<00:01:38.890> up<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.640> little<00:01:39.820> brace

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
and that'll loosen up the little brace

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.610 
and that'll loosen up the little brace
right<00:01:40.479> here<00:01:40.600> that<00:01:40.780> holds<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.110> whole<00:01:41.260> fuel

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
right here that holds the whole fuel

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.160 
right here that holds the whole fuel
filter<00:01:41.979> so<00:01:42.850> that's<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:43.510> then<00:01:43.600> you<00:01:43.750> just<00:01:43.990> I

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
filter so that's it and then you just I

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.980 
filter so that's it and then you just I
get<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.710> new<00:01:44.890> one<00:01:45.070> just<00:01:45.280> tighten<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.090> up<00:01:46.210> then

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
get a new one just tighten it up then

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.080 
get a new one just tighten it up then
close<00:01:47.290> your<00:01:47.320> gas<00:01:47.619> cap<00:01:47.650> and<00:01:48.280> then<00:01:48.670> just<00:01:48.909> start

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
close your gas cap and then just start
