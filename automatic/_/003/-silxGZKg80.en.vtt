stock one that I'm going to put in on
the<00:00:14.420> right<00:00:14.599> and<00:00:14.929> the<00:00:15.080> one<00:00:15.259> that<00:00:15.440> came<00:00:15.590> out<00:00:15.679> of

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
the right and the one that came out of

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
the right and the one that came out of
the<00:00:15.889> car<00:00:16.099> on<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:16.460> left<00:00:17.060> if<00:00:17.660> you<00:00:17.810> notice<00:00:18.850> this

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
the car on the left if you notice this

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.230 
the car on the left if you notice this
piece<00:00:20.210> is<00:00:20.770> not<00:00:21.770> attached<00:00:22.190> the<00:00:22.550> welds<00:00:23.060> have

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
piece is not attached the welds have

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.580 
piece is not attached the welds have
broken<00:00:23.539> off<00:00:23.869> and<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:26.000> end<00:00:26.240> of<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:26.750> shock<00:00:27.289> has

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.509 
broken off and the end of the shock has
been<00:00:27.769> ripped<00:00:27.980> apart<00:00:28.570> which<00:00:29.570> means<00:00:29.930> that<00:00:30.260> now

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
been ripped apart which means that now

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.770 
been ripped apart which means that now
this<00:00:31.539> has<00:00:32.539> absolutely<00:00:34.210> no<00:00:35.210> resistance

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
this has absolutely no resistance

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.899 
this has absolutely no resistance
whatsoever<00:00:35.839> I<00:00:36.409> should<00:00:36.710> not<00:00:37.190> be<00:00:37.219> able<00:00:37.429> to<00:00:37.670> just

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:37.909 
whatsoever I should not be able to just

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:39.759 
whatsoever I should not be able to just
do<00:00:38.089> this<00:00:38.440> at<00:00:39.440> all

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
do this at all

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.729 
do this at all
and<00:00:39.979> so<00:00:40.879> this<00:00:41.059> was<00:00:41.269> providing<00:00:41.809> absolutely<00:00:42.530> no

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
and so this was providing absolutely no

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.360 
and so this was providing absolutely no
damping<00:00:43.600> whatsoever<00:00:44.979> which<00:00:45.979> is<00:00:46.159> why<00:00:46.309> this

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
damping whatsoever which is why this

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.379 
damping whatsoever which is why this
bump<00:00:46.909> stop<00:00:47.239> is<00:00:47.600> all<00:00:48.409> smashed<00:00:49.039> and<00:00:49.399> soft<00:00:50.030> and

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:50.389 
bump stop is all smashed and soft and

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:52.779 
bump stop is all smashed and soft and
ruined<00:00:50.780> if<00:00:51.469> you<00:00:51.589> compare<00:00:51.949> that<00:00:51.979> to<00:00:52.339> this<00:00:52.579> new

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
ruined if you compare that to this new

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.379 
ruined if you compare that to this new
one<00:00:53.799> you<00:00:54.799> know<00:00:54.920> I<00:00:54.949> can<00:00:55.190> I<00:00:55.399> cannot<00:00:55.850> squish<00:00:56.179> this

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:56.389 
one you know I can I cannot squish this

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.889 
one you know I can I cannot squish this
by<00:00:56.600> hand<00:00:57.190> so<00:00:58.190> this<00:00:58.639> also<00:00:58.909> comes<00:00:59.389> with<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.659> nice
