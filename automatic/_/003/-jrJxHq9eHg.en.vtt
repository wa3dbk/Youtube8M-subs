the<00:02:35.690> king<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.110> changeable<00:02:36.530> conditions<00:02:36.769> but

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
the king of changeable conditions but

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.400 
the king of changeable conditions but

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
maybe his window is starting to close

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.319 
maybe his window is starting to close
maybe<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:39.920> was<00:02:40.040> Lewis<00:02:40.280> Hamilton's<00:02:40.850> influence

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
maybe it was Lewis Hamilton's influence

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.430 
maybe it was Lewis Hamilton's influence

the league and poles seven of them yet

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.960 
the league and poles seven of them yet
you<00:06:22.410> only<00:06:22.530> 14<00:06:23.040> times<00:06:23.280> this<00:06:23.520> year<00:06:23.669> because<00:06:23.820> he

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
you only 14 times this year because he

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.420 
you only 14 times this year because he
had<00:06:24.000> two<00:06:24.450> taken<00:06:24.900> away<00:06:25.140> from<00:06:25.200> him<00:06:25.530> due<00:06:26.400> to

had two taken away from him due to
mechanical<00:06:26.729> issues<00:06:27.600> and<00:06:28.250> ultimately<00:06:29.250> that's

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
mechanical issues and ultimately that's

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.100 
mechanical issues and ultimately that's
what<00:06:29.520> i<00:06:29.669> think<00:06:29.760> that's<00:06:30.060> what<00:06:30.210> costs<00:06:30.660> mclaren

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
what i think that's what costs mclaren

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.810 
what i think that's what costs mclaren
in<00:06:31.229> the<00:06:31.320> end<00:06:31.470> they<00:06:31.620> blew<00:06:31.860> it<00:06:31.890> they<00:06:32.280> blew<00:06:32.520> it<00:06:32.550> on

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
in the end they blew it they blew it on

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.600 
in the end they blew it they blew it on
mechanical<00:06:33.690> retirements<00:06:34.050> and<00:06:34.470> drew<00:06:34.860> nope<00:06:35.340> its

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
mechanical retirements and drew nope its

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.730 
mechanical retirements and drew nope its
lockers<00:06:35.970> and<00:06:36.240> I'm<00:06:36.330> not<00:06:36.450> gonna<00:06:36.570> criticize<00:06:37.290> them

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740

to<00:06:37.979> back<00:06:38.160> as<00:06:38.340> the<00:06:38.460> end<00:06:38.580> of<00:06:38.640> the<00:06:38.700> day<00:06:38.760> they're

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
to back as the end of the day they're

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
to back as the end of the day they're
only<00:06:39.090> human<00:06:39.419> but<00:06:40.380> ultimately<00:06:41.720> when<00:06:42.720> you<00:06:42.750> put

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
only human but ultimately when you put

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.320 
only human but ultimately when you put
it<00:06:43.050> all<00:06:43.140> together<00:06:43.350> it<00:06:43.800> probably<00:06:44.370> cost<00:06:44.700> McLaren

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
it all together it probably cost McLaren

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.620 
it all together it probably cost McLaren
a<00:06:45.510> shot<00:06:45.810> of<00:06:46.020> both<00:06:46.350> titles<00:06:46.650> and<00:06:47.190> that<00:06:48.000> is<00:06:48.270> not

a shot of both titles and that is not

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.540 
a shot of both titles and that is not
good<00:06:48.870> enough<00:06:49.110> for<00:06:49.140> a<00:06:49.350> team<00:06:49.620> of<00:06:49.650> their<00:06:50.040> prestige

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
good enough for a team of their prestige
