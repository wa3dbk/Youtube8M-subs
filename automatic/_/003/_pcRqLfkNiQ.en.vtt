00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 very good everyone welcome again 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.089
 to the sting in this video we will see 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.480
 how to get spiritual flowers from 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.730
 a very fast and super easy way well 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.650
 we take the patrol as we see there in 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.990
 venus and we do well in the video 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.250
 previous we get and that's 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.109
 relic and now we're going to get 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.960
 spiritual envelopes that even up 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.699
 easier and faster to get it by 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.730
 at least what I have seen 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.740
 how we see we leave the beginning and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.739
 we have to go through here to the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.329
 right to where the first start 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.420
 missions I think the first or the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.270
 second here from Venus where was the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.460
 statue is there we have to get 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.950
 pass these enemies that is super 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.440
 simple, we have to pass it 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.629
 around here and where is the statue is 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.329
 that we see it there is worth no loss 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.949
 is to get to the left well 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.719
 I have for the cave is where is the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.140
 golden chest we keep going forward 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.000
 around here in the library you're 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.920
 we went through here all this is very 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.840
 We have no losses 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.390
 impossible to get lost we continue to 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.180
 go ahead and there in the door that she 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.860
 There is the area 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.340
 where are we going to get it right here 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.080
 where is the plane crashed one 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.440
 kind of plane is where we are is a 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.540
 enclosure closed and we start our route 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.950
 as in the video above here there 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.050
 we have seen the first flower 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.840
 spiritual here there are enough flowers 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.900
 spiritual flowers of these distributed 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.580
 apart from the chests we went to the 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.100
 left as we said and we enter 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.080
 the first cave is that we see here in 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.040
 this case or anything but I 'm telling you here 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.720
 the chests are quite abundant here 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.740
 we find the second flower that we have 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.140
 seen worth I was about 14 minutes can 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.850
 be 14 15 I think the video lasts 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.220
 and get around 45 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.350
 46th about 50 spiritual envelopes in 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.479
 less than a quarter of an hour so here 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.880
 we have another chest up couple in 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.009
 order that there are enough cars in one place 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.500
 pretty good I've tried many places 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.580
 many places here on menus and the truth 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.490
 is that is the one that has convinced me the most 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.420
 the others or it was a pretty big site 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.070
 or not enough chests left in 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.500
 Finally this is the one that has convinced me the most 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.780
 as we see here in 7 the first round and 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.440
 we already have a pair of chest we have a 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.320
 couple of flowers so each round can 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.840
 last not a couple of minutes or so 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.720
 but I know it's pretty enough 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.640
 cortito is a short requirement and it 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.390
 they regenerate pretty fast enough the 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.650
 I was really surprised because 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.400
 because it is very very fast is much more 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.910
 fast that in Mars you 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.910
 you will check 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.860
 there in that in that hole also usually 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.209
 leave the chests and this area here 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.400
 you can grab it because I've 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.050
 entered many times is this 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.880
 from here and they did not find 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.370
 never chest so has a whole thing and 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.660
 an area that you can save well 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.630
 we follow here on the left 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.140
 bordering and we enter the next 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.300
 route here on it 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.880
 on the next string I say the 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.890
 room will leave me here the only 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.150
 drawback in inconvenience in 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.250
 in quotes that can not be invoked 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.060
 the hummingbird we have to walk but 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.890
 come back we do a little exercise 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.810
 and we go into the next one hangs on 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.420
 this case there is nothing and they are spiritual 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.850
 they are much easier to see than the 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.640
 religious leader for example 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.040
 what is more or less the same color and is 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.480
 more complicated to see it worth it here is it 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.210
 distinguishes a little more because it shines in 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.880
 pretty good here behind here just 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.270
 behind that we have seen is often 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.920
 leave later we will see a chest and 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.070
 by which arribita the best can that 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.180
 come out something but it's not very weird I think 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.550
 that this video has not come out 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.810
 none up here so good 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.130
 I said the most usual there in the 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.810
 entry in between the two sunsets 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.520
 behind done here on the right yes that 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.070
 it has come out to me and here we find 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.170
 another one I'm just going to leave another second 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.120
 back as I said before so you can see 2 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.890
 turns in a row and see how it 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.810
 the chests regenerate how the 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.660
 spiritual flowers including flowers 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.110
 has been entering a cave is not in 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.170
 the flower outside and when leaving it is made 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.470
 outside is super super fast how it 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.150
 regenerates in while we can go catching 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.340
 missions we can go killing enemies 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.240
 to pat is that some perfect areas 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.650
 I loved it and the truth that came out 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.660
 super satisfied with her 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.500
 up here we find you before a chest 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.020
 and let's take the other list quoted as 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.610
 I say the Xunta is in round we left 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.510
 there from the door 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.570
 skirted around him 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.640
 the whole area and we go back to the beginning and 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.250
 also looking because in the middle 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.380
 can appear are the enemies and 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.150
 others may seem like spiritual envelopes 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.420
 and then and with a little more 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.400
 looks 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.950
 as I said we have subscribed I am the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.780
 most clumsy in the world to find these 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.760
 objects here accompany me with a 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.220
 partner who is the one who pretty much 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.520
 it also gives me a little bit of the north 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.259
 all right 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.409
 and we found something else here in this 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.869
 area and let's go 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.019
 let's eliminate enemies and here in this 

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:35.710
 in these holes here, it usually comes out 

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:38.500
 that in the elevator area 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.000
 and we continue around here we see 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.330
 this enemy here that is covered and he 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.240
 try to heal or cover and here I go back to 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.190
 enter because it 's what is said in the video 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.780
 I started to go in to see to stop 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.130
 try to see if it came out but that goes here 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.620
 enter today a few times and 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.240
 none of the times has the 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.370
 car if someone enters someone against the 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.590
 car please tell me because I already 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.480
 it's personal already I stayed with the 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.660
 I doubt that the partner told me that 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.970
 I was going to go out with him going out and it did not come out 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.910
 so nothing next chest and no longer 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.840
 we are going to shoot by team 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.009
 the left 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.210
 here there are enough enemies 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.210
 let's remove it 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.469
 perfect 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.350
 and as we see here we enter this cave 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:27.120
 that there is no 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.440
 there are chests but there at the end we see 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.409
 You see how it looks 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.750
 quite pretty well is one thing that 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:38.349
 look away we go that does not have to 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.349
 approach even 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:46.449
 here is the beginning and we're going here I'm going 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.280
 I'm going to show you a few of 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:50.350
 locations so you can see more or less 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.240
 there we see a city ​​now in the background 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.550
 so you can see more or less where you can 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.900
 leave and others can leave more site worth 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.259
 what happens in all the caves that 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:03.639
 it rains that I have shown can come out 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:05.289
 but I'm going to show you from 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.660
 as I did in the previous video one of 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:10.660
 here is the principle as I said that 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.460
 we were going to see and nothing guys this this has 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.919
 been everything I hope you liked it 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.349
 I hope it helped you to help you 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:19.690
 when you need to get the 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:21.550
 materials that you subscribe to say for 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:24.490
 see the following video that tomorrow 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:27.610
 will already from the Moon 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:31.139
 helium filaments and what we said see you 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.139
 in the next one until then
