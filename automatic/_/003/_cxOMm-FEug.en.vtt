 and then you have a drink 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.119
 comes from the tube 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.570
 and I have added what comes from and that is that is the unique offer it is 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.570
 like it is 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.750
 well this grass will be a lot more expensive for apple 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.490
 and because the compensates can learn in this course 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.490
 and he can also make it and after they visit 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.240
 producing a lot of the process sometimes 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.800
 that starts with the wheels of the vehicle 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.450
 have knowledge of a customer-oriented way moreover must be the best 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.530
 belgian vsv 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.860
 which and the influence on the quality of stars when we have to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.700
 but once 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.570
 to concentrate prorail and then 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.790
 to that cake 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.510
 the ration was appropriate in woerden 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.540
 that only works on the feeding of the corner of it is still about the 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.740
 health about the care of the bow for the health of the neighbors 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.690
 We must try to manage all that variable, that's it 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.690
 complex to the farmer 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.770
 on the basis of data frank the farmer the means used in the laboratory 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.460
 examined be calculated a perfect look 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.780
 the two decimal places 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.630
 but the beauty of being a farmer 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.000
 There is that he could finally tell you what is going on and together 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.790
 Central to that figure is the moment to judge is limited perception and 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.790
 to look change in a room 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.760
 yes there are that people have to leave 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.560
 the strike that the end contract is still on the other side of the world 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.750
 that made liverpool
