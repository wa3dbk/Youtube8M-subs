strut<00:00:42.480> supports<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.589> guess<00:00:43.890> how<00:00:44.039> good<00:00:44.280> they

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:44.429 
strut supports and guess how good they

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.439 
strut supports and guess how good they
work<00:00:44.640> let's<00:00:45.569> get<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> demonstration<00:00:47.449> that's

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
work let's get a demonstration that's

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.689 
work let's get a demonstration that's
not<00:00:48.659> good<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.800> are<00:00:49.859> we<00:00:49.920> gonna<00:00:50.039> do<00:00:50.190> glad<00:00:50.519> of

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
not good so what are we gonna do glad of

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.809 
not good so what are we gonna do glad of
it<00:00:50.819> from<00:00:50.999> that<00:00:51.059> high<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:52.819> it's

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:53.819 
it from that high but that's just it's

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.700 
it from that high but that's just it's
very<00:00:53.999> dramatic<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:55.170> we're<00:00:55.319> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.499> take

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
very dramatic so we're going to take

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.819 
very dramatic so we're going to take
some<00:00:55.979> half-inch<00:00:56.460> PVC<00:00:56.729> and<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:58.319> got<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.559> marked

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
some half-inch PVC and we got it marked

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.469 
some half-inch PVC and we got it marked
off<00:00:59.010> at<00:00:59.309> four<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.760> quarter<00:00:59.969> because<00:01:00.299> that's

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
off at four and a quarter because that's

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.619 
off at four and a quarter because that's
how<00:01:00.629> long<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.109> span<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.969> exposed<00:01:03.299> rod

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
how long the span is the exposed rod

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.180 
how long the span is the exposed rod
then<00:01:04.199> we're<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.440> to<00:01:04.470> cut<00:01:04.710> down<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.040> middle

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
then we're going to cut down the middle

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.890 
then we're going to cut down the middle
of<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.820> click<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.240> stuff<00:01:06.480> on<00:01:06.660> there
