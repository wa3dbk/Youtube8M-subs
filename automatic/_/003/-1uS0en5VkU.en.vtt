00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 look effectively about 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.220
 an average 140 thousand contrast and a magnifying glass 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.270
 it's pretty striking 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.970
 in the region this is associated or is 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.440
 is associating to the fall of an object 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.810
 that is not identified until -2 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.310
 our meteorite can or can be 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.680
 some other some some other kind of 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.259
 elements unfortunately the radars 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.770
 of strength since this look of the 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.650
 region we did not see anything they did not register 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.200
 nothing we communicate with the dga ce that 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.400
 would be the technical body 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.210
 associate who can help us with this 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.880
 information they also did not see or 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.650
 they recorded something therefore we are 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.810
 trying now to communicate for some 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.880
 observatory or with some other place that 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.270
 can help us to elucidate 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.680
 what was really what happened to see how 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.540
 is going to be achieved then determine if 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.890
 that air force radar does not 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.270
 they manage to observe nothing what will be the 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.850
 research that is going to be done 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.680
 knows the direction in which it fell 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.809
 no antecedent is requested and that's why 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.729
 we are already discarding the other 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.110
 information we are dedicating 100% to 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.240
 try to communicate with a center 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.640
 as some observatory that can 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.170
 help to see if it was real 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.820
 and what is being speculated until the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.130
 minute that can be a meteor or something 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.270
 like that you know the address is not 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.880
 know the address there is no 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.090
 information still from where it fell not be 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.369
 know if you exist disintegrated when falling 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.810
 or stayed somewhere else those are 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.100
 the only background that is handled 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.509
 the investigation is expected then and 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.190
 support to other organizations and 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.960
 institutions 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.490
 exactly we want we want 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.820
 have obviously technical support 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.460
 of some 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.260
 from some observatory and let's wait 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.790
 a detailed report called milk 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.530
 in this minute now that has been reported 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.510
 beyond this incident because 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.370
 I understand that people also sector 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.260
 who managed to use this has been very 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.610
 alert also calling you to the 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.040
 radio only means of communication 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.950
 carabineros etcetera exactly look 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.270
 many people who saw it what it was was 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.910
 a pretty striking light like you 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.490
 I was commenting but I do not know has not registered 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.650
 no other no other event of these 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.600
 characteristics that have fallen in some 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.320
 part that has generated some other 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.320
 some other version
