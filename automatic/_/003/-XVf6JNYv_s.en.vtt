looked it up Optifine because I didn't

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.430

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
and minecraft language means better HD

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.640 
and minecraft language means better HD
textures<00:00:58.080> and<00:00:58.379> more<00:00:59.159> of<00:00:59.549> a<00:01:00.210> wide<00:01:00.449> vibrant<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.320> a

feel of Minecraft so basically this

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.550 
feel of Minecraft so basically this
optifine<00:01:06.030> mod<00:01:06.240> makes<00:01:06.510> MCPE<00:01:08.479> mcpc<00:01:09.479> i<00:01:09.869> don't

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
optifine mod makes MCPE mcpc i don't

think<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.830> tell<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.520> little

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
think you can tell that it's a little

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.210 
think you can tell that it's a little
bit<00:01:11.790> more<00:01:12.090> HD<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> graphics<00:01:13.350> wise<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.070> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
bit more HD and the graphics wise but it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.620 
bit more HD and the graphics wise but it
changes<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> textures<00:01:14.940> of<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.150> grass<00:01:15.360> which

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
changes the textures of the grass which

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
changes the textures of the grass which
is<00:01:15.750> pretty<00:01:15.900> cool<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.350> really<00:01:17.070> don't<00:01:17.220> understand

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
is pretty cool I really don't understand

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.790 
is pretty cool I really don't understand
how<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.760> is<00:01:17.910> a<00:01:17.940> mod<00:01:18.240> though<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.500> sucks

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
how this is a mod though so that sucks

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.460 
how this is a mod though so that sucks
you<00:01:19.890> can't<00:01:19.980> use<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.460> form<00:01:21.260> servers<00:01:22.260> and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
you can't use this form servers and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.740 
you can't use this form servers and
stuff<00:01:22.590> because<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> script<00:01:23.250> mod<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.750> I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
stuff because it's a script mod and I

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.690
