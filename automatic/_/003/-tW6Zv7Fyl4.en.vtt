I<00:00:44.870> drew<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> circle<00:00:46.230> creating<00:00:46.860> myself<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.370> guide

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
I drew a circle creating myself a guide

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.729 
I drew a circle creating myself a guide
to<00:00:47.910> where<00:00:48.090> I'll<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.390> cutting<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> 45

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
to where I'll be cutting it at a 45

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.069 
to where I'll be cutting it at a 45
degree<00:00:49.920> angle<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.760> want<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.510> make<00:00:51.660> sure<00:00:51.870> that

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
degree angle you want to make sure that

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.049 
degree angle you want to make sure that
when<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.559> cut<00:00:52.829> open<00:00:53.129> your<00:00:53.309> lid<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
when you do cut open your lid that it is

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.240 
when you do cut open your lid that it is
at<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> 45<00:00:54.809> degree<00:00:54.840> angle<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.010> lid

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
at a 45 degree angle so that the lid

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.290 
at a 45 degree angle so that the lid
doesn't<00:00:56.399> fall<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:58.309> once<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.579> lid<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.879> finished

being<00:01:00.539> cut<00:01:00.809> open<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:02.430> ahead<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
being cut open you want to go ahead and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.520

start<00:01:02.969> removing<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> seeds<00:01:03.899> starting<00:01:04.350> from

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
start removing the seeds starting from

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.340 
start removing the seeds starting from
the<00:01:04.680> bottom<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> lid<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.939> also<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.110> keep

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the bottom of the lid and also to keep

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.020 
the bottom of the lid and also to keep
in<00:01:07.530> mind<00:01:07.799> when<00:01:08.010> you're<00:01:08.130> first<00:01:08.430> initially

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
in mind when you're first initially

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.000 
in mind when you're first initially
creating<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.720> opening<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.590> pumpkin

creating the opening to your pumpkin

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.280 
creating the opening to your pumpkin
make<00:01:11.909> sure<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.420> big<00:01:12.630> enough<00:01:12.750> where<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
make sure that it's big enough where you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.130 
make sure that it's big enough where you
can<00:01:13.470> scoop<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> seeds

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.980 

if<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.340> plan<00:01:18.610> on<00:01:18.640> seeming<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.270> seeds<00:01:19.690> for

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
if you plan on seeming the seeds for

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.380 
if you plan on seeming the seeds for
later<00:01:20.200> for<00:01:20.590> possibly<00:01:21.370> making<00:01:21.730> some<00:01:21.940> roasted

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
later for possibly making some roasted

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.620 
later for possibly making some roasted
pumpkin<00:01:22.570> seeds<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.980> best<00:01:24.250> trick<00:01:24.700> is<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.120> soak

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
pumpkin seeds the best trick is to soak

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.280 
pumpkin seeds the best trick is to soak
seeds<00:01:26.200> in<00:01:26.440> warm<00:01:26.830> water<00:01:27.130> for<00:01:27.460> about<00:01:27.580> 20<00:01:28.090> minutes

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
seeds in warm water for about 20 minutes

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.470 
seeds in warm water for about 20 minutes
after<00:01:29.290> 20<00:01:29.500> minutes<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.430> seeds<00:01:30.700> will<00:01:30.970> begin<00:01:31.300> to

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
after 20 minutes the seeds will begin to

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.080 
after 20 minutes the seeds will begin to
rise<00:01:31.750> at<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.080> top<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:33.280> remainder<00:01:33.640> of<00:01:33.820> the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
rise at the top and the remainder of the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.670 
rise at the top and the remainder of the
pumpkin<00:01:34.540> guts<00:01:34.690> will<00:01:34.990> fall<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.590> bottom

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
pumpkin guts will fall to the bottom

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.150 
pumpkin guts will fall to the bottom
making<00:01:36.400> it<00:01:36.640> easier<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.180> separate<00:01:37.900> if<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:38.950> do

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
making it easier to separate if you do

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.860 
making it easier to separate if you do
want<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.430> see<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.670> tutorial<00:01:39.910> video<00:01:40.540> on<00:01:40.600> how<00:01:40.690> to

I cut a few slits around my drawing to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.570 
I cut a few slits around my drawing to
make<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.720> easier<00:01:54.320> when<00:01:54.500> I<00:01:54.560> tape<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.070> down<00:01:55.250> on<00:01:55.460> my

with a carving kit

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.830 
with a carving kit
I<00:02:03.230> began<00:02:03.950> poking<00:02:04.340> little<00:02:04.790> holes<00:02:05.090> around<00:02:05.480> the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
I began poking little holes around the

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
drawing after it was done with that I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.850 
drawing after it was done with that I
was<00:02:10.820> left<00:02:11.090> with<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.330> perforated<00:02:12.080> guide<00:02:12.290> line
