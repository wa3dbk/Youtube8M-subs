00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.610
 and there are boys and girls welcome 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.200
 one more video of animus necandi I am 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.760
 stop today can no longer accompany me or 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.550
 Robert neither almost manu nor of 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.619
 youtube but today you are a tip 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.840
 for all of you halo players 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.430
 halo 4 specifically because this type 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.840
 well these jumps are not going to do 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.920
 well to another halo because this map does not 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.490
 is in another halo 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.740
 so as you already know this these balances 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.689
 these balances not these jumps are 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.600
 specific to this map that is called 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.519
 alone that first of all we are going to 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.630
 differentiate the two parts of the map to 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.210
 that you can know which of the two 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.399
 is that base this base here for example 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.350
 it's the red base because it's the red base 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.239
 because here exposes the red team and how 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.100
 I know I'm in the red base good 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.469
 because it's the basis that has these things 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.750
 green plants or whatever the base 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.129
 the red team is a pig like that 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.260
 who already know if you're on the red team 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.460
 you will appear in the vast filth and if 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.340
 are you in the insurance team appear 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.940
 at the clean base where yes yes he knows 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.860
 clean your rooms we will learn 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.259
 a few jumps to get from the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.819
 half towards the red base eye towards the 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.550
 blue base is a bit harder to 

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:13.620
 they can do 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.900
 and mainly we are going to teach them 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.940
 from first from here down 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.730
 towards the red base one thing that 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.910
 they need yes or yes for these jumps is 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.920
 the storage room link I'm here because what 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.710
 they need because this is going they're going to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.100
 help with this with this bimestre ray 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.890
 of the medium will help them to be able to jump 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.780
 very high and reach towards the base that is 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.160
 the balcony that is what we are going to do and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.430
 we are at our first jump what 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.920
 they also need to run for 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.330
 the first jump we're going to make 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.150
 They need to run a little while jumping 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.310
 run and press the trust button 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.750
 erpac once you have fallen in this ray 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.010
 so it's pretty easy really 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.380
 You can make this commission with closed 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.780
 so it's simple and you're even 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.470
 can steal sniper and ping in the chimba 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.990
 the people that easy 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.230
 that's the easiest jump of all so 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.320
 that they do not need to practice it much 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.650
 we go now with the second jump that already 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.860
 it's not from down here but from here 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.840
 above that if for some reason it does not give them 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.060
 time to get off can try but 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.080
 eye this is a little harder what 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.740
 what they have to do is the following 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.040
 to run around here, to jump 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.980
 while they run and there they do not have to 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.570
 press the button after climbing just fall 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.730
 to lightning if you do not have to wait for 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.250
 go up a little bit with the lightning and then 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.140
 just there press the button of the transfer 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.870
 pack so you can take them to the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.220
 base let's do it I hope I get the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.410
 first if you are not going to watch this video 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.850
 cut but good come on 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.620
 running we jump while we run 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.990
 we wait a while and then we give the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.470
 transfer pack and we should fall into the 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.270
 base right now you have seen that I have fallen 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.980
 out but if they have 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.490
 practicing it really is such a thing 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.920
 to know the timing well you know they run 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.810
 they jump wait here for a little while 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.390
 Look around here with the storage room and you can 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.860
 be 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.750
 if there are people obviously because if 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.190
 they are not going to look stupid like me and 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.250
 now let's see a couple of more jumps 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:19.300
 we are here in front of the red base and 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.760
 as we see has this wall here and that 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.350
 wall of a column wall I do not know how to 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.000
 want to call him, I really do not care 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.959
 as you carry it the thing is that 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.510
 is there 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.270
 and there is also this thing here that 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.550
 we can use to upload and from here 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.440
 we can get to this wall 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.700
 column or whatever you want to call it I think 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.280
 which is more a column than a wall but 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.450
 it does not matter the thing is that you have 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.209
 to do the jump from here to here 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.160
 running or they have to in this little 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.830
 space that they have run jumping 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.570
 while they run at the last minute or the 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.750
 last second better said and then 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.900
 stay here and then to the balcony we're going to 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.900
 do 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.700
 we bring here and then on the balcony and already 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.280
 you know and you can also do it for this 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.520
 another side because we have exactly the 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.710
 same the same architecture for this 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.360
 side that 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.280
 it's pretty good because we can do 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.630
 the same to enter by any of 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.630
 both sides so let's do it 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.340
 we arrived here and then from here you know 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.500
 pin but eye for this side I have been 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.750
 made a bit more difficult than for this 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.389
 I do not know if it will be more difficult 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.949
 jump from here to here the 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.900
 difference since he's here but 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.990
 this one has made me a little more 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.479
 difficult maybe it's me but you guys 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.669
 they also seem the same, notify me now 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.020
 we have seen all the jumps towards 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.240
 red base that already as 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.580
 As I told you, it is the one below here that of 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.289
 up here and both sides and 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.750
 now you will ask yourself and how did you get 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.060
 to the blue base there is a little niggle 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.379
 for the blue base can also be 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.449
 do the highs but it's a little more 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.849
 difficult first of all if we want to go 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.340
 from below from here down to the 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:07.099
 blue balcony there is a small problem that 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.020
 the architect of this map did not notice 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.580
 this giant shit that is here 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.659
 you always collide with this when 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.750
 you want to make the jump we're going to 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.910
 teach them 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.190
 we are here and we want to make the jump 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.260
 the transfer farc and I put but it hit me 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.910
 it just did not arrive or is it a 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.210
 trash is one thing it's really a 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.670
 thing that can be done but it is not 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.980
 skill is not taken into account 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.280
 the player does not depend on how 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.810
 good you are because it is a thing is like 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.630
 flipping a coin can work well for you 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.060
 can go wrong and I do not know why 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.100
 simply no no we are not entering 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.780
 very thoroughly and on the other hand here is another 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.030
 I jump but this one is pretty 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.650
 difficult to me I could not leave but 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.690
 if any of you get out it would be 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.669
 incredible have to jump here and 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.410
 from here jumping either there is a 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.710
 shit is hard it's like a jump that 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.150
 come narrows in halo 3 if that 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.770
 someone sent me a video of him 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.270
 doing it, I'm really going to put it and 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.610
 I'm going to give them all the possible credit 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.250
 but if both on this side and for 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.130
 this other let's show him one more time 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.720
 before finishing the video here and here 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.970
 we have to center but we can not because 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.680
 we are stupid but well you know 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.169
 boys most these jumps are 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.840
 all are rather towards the red base 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:22.900
 because it's easier 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.280
 it makes red but it can also rise 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.860
 south we go inter one more time before 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.600
 finishing the video really made me that 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.400
 I go to any other side as not 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.580
 is happening now but you know more to 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.180
 the red base if they have to be the team 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.360
 blue are lucky because it's going to be a lot 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.729
 easier to get to the red base that 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.139
 viceversa good guys hope you 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:46.960
 have liked it if you have any 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:49.090
 another some other interesting jump here 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.229
 on this map or on some other map put 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.910
 in the comments and also put in 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:54.220
 comments if it has already come out 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.530
 this jump from here the costadito because 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.249
 it's quite difficult and we'll see you in the 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:03.929
 next video I speak 

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:04.919
 I run jump I wait a little while and flynn and 

00:07:03.929 --> 00:07:06.719
 I get it wrong 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.199
 Higher slut while splits but 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:12.239
 I repeat and give it a high 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:16.919
 I jump while I run and here we give the 

00:07:12.239 --> 00:07:18.539
 fret farc and we jump while we run 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:23.299
 we wait a little while and we give to the fret 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:23.299
 pack and we will drop or a chat 

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:33.649
 well we are talking to you, come on let's talk 

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:33.649
 a little about
