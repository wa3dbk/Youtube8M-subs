information up on it if you're not
familiar<00:01:34.300> with<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:34.840> it's<00:01:35.730> got<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:36.940> Fuller's

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
familiar with it it's got the Fuller's

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.590 
familiar with it it's got the Fuller's
like<00:01:38.050> an<00:01:38.200> ideal<00:01:38.470> has

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.080 

those<00:01:43.170> aren't<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:43.650> blood<00:01:44.189> grooves<00:01:44.460> or<00:01:44.670> for

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
those aren't for blood grooves or for

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.510 
those aren't for blood grooves or for
strength<00:01:45.420> therefore<00:01:46.229> looks<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.710> possibly

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
strength therefore looks and possibly

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.210 
strength therefore looks and possibly
the<00:01:47.670> Lightning<00:01:48.000> blade<00:01:48.170> that's<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:50.070> they

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220

the Lightning blade that's it but they
do<00:01:50.280> look<00:01:50.430> cool<00:01:50.759> don't<00:01:51.000> they<00:01:51.150> I<00:01:52.640> think<00:01:53.640> they<00:01:53.729> do

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
do look cool don't they I think they do

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.539 
do look cool don't they I think they do
anyway<00:01:55.080> this<00:01:55.259> has<00:01:55.409> got<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> hollow<00:01:56.159> aluminum

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
anyway this has got a hollow aluminum

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.310 
anyway this has got a hollow aluminum
handling<00:01:56.940> a<00:01:57.000> twist-off<00:01:57.540> cap<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> back

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
handling a twist-off cap on the back

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.410 
handling a twist-off cap on the back
this<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> first<00:01:59.580> of<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.970> kind<00:02:00.360> of

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
this is the first of the kind of

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.029 
this is the first of the kind of
survival<00:02:01.049> knives<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.530> think<00:02:01.770> these<00:02:01.860> were

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
survival knives I think these were

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.149 
survival knives I think these were
actually<00:02:02.340> made<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.759> fishing<00:02:03.210> knives<00:02:04.130> has<00:02:05.130> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
actually made as fishing knives has a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.460 
actually made as fishing knives has a
rubber<00:02:05.460> seal<00:02:05.789> on<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.210> end<00:02:06.390> some<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.110> them<00:02:07.200> came

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
rubber seal on the end some of them came

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.840 
rubber seal on the end some of them came
with<00:02:07.770> compasses<00:02:08.580> inside<00:02:09.000> from<00:02:09.300> what<00:02:09.479> i<00:02:09.509> read

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
with compasses inside from what i read

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.430 
with compasses inside from what i read
but<00:02:11.850> i<00:02:11.880> think<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.420> was<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.630> just<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.020> cavity<00:02:13.350> to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
but i think it was a just a cavity to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.460 
but i think it was a just a cavity to
put<00:02:13.680> your<00:02:13.890> ear<00:02:14.310> hooks<00:02:14.670> sinkers<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:16.380> know

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.650 

wasn't<00:02:22.140> necessarily<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:23.640> i<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:24.060> find

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660

what you get the other thing is is

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.180 
what you get the other thing is is
twisting<00:06:12.840> these<00:06:13.740> knives<00:06:14.750> not<00:06:15.750> real<00:06:16.260> not<00:06:17.130> a

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
really good idea all the points where a

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:26.720 
really good idea all the points where a
week<00:06:21.650> crying<00:06:22.650> is<00:06:23.270> absolutely<00:06:25.490> definitely<00:06:26.490> not

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730

a<00:06:26.760> good<00:06:26.970> idea<00:06:27.000> but<00:06:27.720> notice<00:06:28.140> I'm<00:06:28.290> twisting<00:06:28.710> the

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
a good idea but notice I'm twisting the

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.160 
a good idea but notice I'm twisting the
wood<00:06:28.980> instead<00:06:29.220> of<00:06:29.400> the<00:06:29.460> night<00:06:30.020> not<00:06:31.020> as<00:06:31.140> a

wood instead of the night not as a

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.770 
wood instead of the night not as a
powerful<00:06:31.530> technique<00:06:32.250> but<00:06:32.550> for<00:06:33.300> this<00:06:33.390> would<00:06:33.630> it

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
powerful technique but for this would it

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:41.150 
powerful technique but for this would it
gets<00:06:33.960> the<00:06:34.080> job<00:06:34.110> done

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.350 

those<00:06:42.160> aren't<00:06:42.400> the<00:06:42.490> greatest<00:06:42.610> in<00:06:43.240> the<00:06:43.300> world
