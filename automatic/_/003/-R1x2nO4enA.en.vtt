00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.130
 Hello dear friends with you me and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.160
 crane and today we have another issue 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.410
 headings deer inadequate in the randomness world 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.800
 of tanks I hope you miss 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.960
 do not forget to use the services 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.080
 promotion and advertising channels if you 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.050
 novice author date you this anyway 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.510
 useful, see the links in the description and 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.260
 Today we have several such interesting 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.050
 picking chick moments epic with deer and 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.010
 inadequate minus by itself is a map 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.890
 swamp and 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.399
 and as we see the seizure begins with 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.129
 that friends account 13 7 enemies do not at all 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.949
 see all flank busy with allies 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.680
 polomando ride around enemy base 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.160
 polkomandy near ally well how then 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.680
 the enemy snuck in but it seems 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.010
 which looks through the center and drove 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.100
 just starting to take the base of our hero 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.000
 being on slow tanks understands that 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.710
 he does not have time and the funniest friends then 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.100
 that not at all half allies them 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.340
 just do not give a damn about a hundred battle 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.970
 percent win well what's stopping you 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.180
 come and shoot down that principle t 67 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.720
 ally and makes mu our allies started 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.020
 he is rude to chat and know what he did 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.570
 drove up to capture remains literally 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.409
 metrics to drive up light beaten and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.810
 he's writing 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.119
 Well, since you guys are all trendy 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.270
 rude me ordering there to beat that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.600
 shoot down and start rolling back 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.909
 back well now and see this bow with 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.079
 which stands in the crater and takes the base 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.020
 but nobody cares and he takes it successfully 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.100
 friends with the score 13:07 when the allies 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.100
 the whole map as he drove as he took and 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.860
 t67 allied is simply gorgeous therefore better 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.789
 not a game 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:13.510
 beat and and do not drive from the allies further 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:17.590
 we again have problems with the capture of the base 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.650
 11:06 account it's even more epic than in 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.080
 last time a map of el hulluf and you immediately 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.390
 can note the fact that the mini 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.370
 map we see the last enemies shone 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.650
 near the ally base but look how much 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.260
 allies swirl near reds then 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.050
 now all we have to do is for 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.630
 go to grab in 3 snout and start 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.760
 take the base and in any way the victory is already in 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.130
 arm our hero on artillery this 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.590
 understands to finish off the last enemy and 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.200
 you need to go already to take the base two 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.720
 become enemies by the way too two 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.280
 so you just need three of us to lean 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.130
 to capture everything 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.970
 victory is already up the enemies only 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.000
 two people score 13 6 well, lose 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.030
 it is simply impossible here 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.520
 that in time the margin is huge and 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.989
 but what will happen next and that 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.769
 which of kills ally t 34 and thereby 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.200
 downing capture occurs and a gap 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:24.070
 already literally 5 seconds which means that 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.070
 at best, now we are waiting for a draw in 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.070
 In principle, this is what happens and thanks to the court 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.700
 by the way it is in backup ally you wear but 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.709
 still a draw with such an account 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.650
 ok enough already with grief with invaders and 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:42.070
 look at the mount stuntmen pull out 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.049
 the battle has but 50 become so not 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.900
 thinks he just takes and lashes at 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.010
 open and self destruct but nothing 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:55.989
 terrible 6 left one artillery 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:58.120
 British wardrobe 183 well up to 215 183 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.480
 there are a whole bunch of numbers there but generally you 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.680
 broads understand the enemy in the meantime not 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.110
 5 waffle and artillery 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.120
 keep flank just a flash drive control 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.980
 lower moving art naturally 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.470
 hid behind the bushes and shine 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.810
 seizure and just if that light 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.880
 the enemy and annihilate well what will happen 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.910
 happen next it's just some 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.820
 nightmare here pvs flashes the enemy 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.160
 wafer which he misses from behind 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.620
 shines artillery which takes the base 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.040
 Yes, I said the same without grief invaders 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.250
 Currently you will without tower 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.919
 naturally dressed as artillery 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.470
 which takes base while 261 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:46.340
 our object is to lose almost everyone and n and 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.010
 our British pt remains here 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.979
 sees what else is lit e 5 0 5 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.500
 afraid he highlights apparently for 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.850
 allied their artillery at that time well 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.370
 yes to while art 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.410
 takes the base and can with ease here 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.300
 to come down but not fall for her 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.010
 It turns out here goes to the CDR, then our hero 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.370
 go out and tries trying to come down and 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:13.340
 still kills and our dow miracle 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.760
 artillery takes away and drunk all the victory 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.760
 already in the pocket behind the wafer goes 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.930
 easy to whisper with bombs because we have in 215b 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.060
 183 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.000
 Hurray won still remain even more 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.479
 seconds but what do you think 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.599
 make our hero yes you guessed just 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:36.050
 off the cliff and self-destructed well 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:38.090
 damn it okay so victory is broken off 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.450
 Well, at least there will be a draw artillery yet 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.710
 far away there is still more than 10 seconds of battle 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:48.430
 end and all draw but not so insulting 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:51.380
 friends but not in the last seconds 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.289
 go out waffle and gets artillery and 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.050
 just a shame lower drain I would have 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:00.830
 just tore a bunch I wouldn't know 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:03.880
 cried would clean when cried don't know 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.500
 like you, but my mind is just not 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.660
 stand watching such files 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.140
 deer 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.570
 and just inadequate me but further such 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.940
 at last 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.250
 not just funny a little relaxing 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.630
 replaych immediately see that this map 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:25.450
 top and we have a platoon of our hero borscht 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:28.410
 yagdpanthery 2 and yagi 88 but the bottom line is that 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:31.120
 our then Borschik five kills and 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.820
 allies return sovzvvodnye deigned 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.300
 our hero still take the warrior gun 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:40.030
 he has from and yagdtigra that is ultra-precise 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.380
 and over dpm on i over punch in general 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.470
 cannon just 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.600
 but enjoyment but what happens next you 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.050
 just admire 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.460
 first shot and see what happens 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.560
 a miss just didn't hit the winning 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.870
 artillery which is a little tiny 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.110
 Well, not surprisingly, there are two grandmothers 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.420
 but our hero thinks well 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.730
 here he is a warrior no friends 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.000
 punches the guns shoots and 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:09.010
 just no damage this artillery 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.240
 low-level some shameful 270 hbp 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:16.210
 the third shot too, the damage is not our 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.010
 the hero still can not take his warrior 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.770
 but he thinks he ’s got the gold right now 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:24.400
 charge must kill love 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.650
 friends just look gold soup with 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.390
 so accurate piercing tool where did he 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.450
 shoots the barrel is not clear what is happening 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:34.180
 on the last he finally cures 

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.250
 and kills a warrior thank God in your pocket 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.540
 such a funny moment I hope you 

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.070
 liked friends do not forget 

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.890

 hotter because after that I don’t
