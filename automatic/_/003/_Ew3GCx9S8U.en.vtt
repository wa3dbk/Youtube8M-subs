00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
look at the actual hardware install all

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.359 
look at the actual hardware install all
right<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.640> first<00:02:02.819> step<00:02:03.179> to<00:02:03.840> installing<00:02:04.369> a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
right so the first step to installing a

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.389 
right so the first step to installing a
new<00:02:05.429> Wi-Fi<00:02:06.030> card<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.720> laptop<00:02:06.929> is<00:02:07.560> to

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
is just one big panel for everything so

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.300 
is just one big panel for everything so
you<00:02:47.849> remove<00:02:48.120> those<00:02:48.360> screws<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.110> then<00:02:49.889> make

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
sure you put them in a container so that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.020 
sure you put them in a container so that
you<00:02:52.859> don't<00:02:53.010> lose<00:02:53.190> them<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.790> put<00:02:53.940> them

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
you don't lose them you can put them

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.569 
you don't lose them you can put them

back when you're done then you want to
get<00:02:56.730> under<00:02:56.850> here<00:02:57.350> sometimes<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.470> will<00:02:58.560> help<00:02:58.769> to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
get under here sometimes it will help to

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.750 
get under here sometimes it will help to
use<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.569> flathead<00:03:00.569> screwdriver<00:03:01.670> depends<00:03:02.670> on

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
use a flathead screwdriver depends on

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.490 
use a flathead screwdriver depends on
the<00:03:02.880> type<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:05.120> laptop<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.420> how<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.049> works

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
the type of laptop and how it works

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.229 
the type of laptop and how it works
usually<00:03:08.190> if<00:03:08.250> you'll<00:03:08.370> have<00:03:08.549> little<00:03:08.850> catches

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
usually if you'll have little catches

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.920 
usually if you'll have little catches
along<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.630> sides<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.290> then<00:03:10.970> one<00:03:11.970> end<00:03:12.209> will

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
along the sides and then one end will

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.009 
along the sides and then one end will
have<00:03:12.959> some<00:03:13.889> slightly<00:03:14.160> larger<00:03:14.850> barbs<00:03:15.750> on<00:03:15.989> them

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
have some slightly larger barbs on them

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.610 
have some slightly larger barbs on them
and<00:03:16.549> those<00:03:17.549> will<00:03:17.880> slide<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.560> then

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
and those will slide it in and then

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.759 
and those will slide it in and then
you'll<00:03:20.280> go<00:03:20.519> down<00:03:20.730> when<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.480> replace<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:21.959> so

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
you'll go down when you replace it so

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.000 
you'll go down when you replace it so
take<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.340> set<00:03:23.519> it<00:03:23.639> aside<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.859> now<00:03:25.859> what

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
take that and set it aside so now what

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.750 
take that and set it aside so now what
we're<00:03:26.160> going<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.310> look<00:03:26.430> for<00:03:26.730> here<00:03:28.519> this<00:03:29.519> little

we're going to look for here this little

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.559 
we're going to look for here this little
port<00:03:30.060> right<00:03:30.269> there

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
port right there

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.490 
port right there
that'd<00:03:31.440> be<00:03:32.420> that'd<00:03:33.420> be<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.630> Wi-Fi<00:03:33.989> card<00:03:34.290> right

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
that'd be that'd be the Wi-Fi card right

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.789 
that'd be that'd be the Wi-Fi card right
there<00:03:35.329> so<00:03:36.329> here's<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.690> port<00:03:37.410> we're<00:03:37.560> looking

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
there so here's the port we're looking

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
in snap it into place everywhere else as

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.320 
in snap it into place everywhere else as
it<00:05:57.770> goes<00:05:57.980> if<00:05:58.310> you<00:05:58.400> feel<00:05:58.610> any<00:05:58.820> bumps<00:05:59.240> or

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
easy on it these things are easy to

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.469
