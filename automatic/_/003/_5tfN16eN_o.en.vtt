all over the world in the United States
basically<00:00:39.760> Kansas<00:00:40.760> is<00:00:40.969> really<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.390> number

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
basically Kansas is really the number

basically Kansas is really the number
one<00:00:41.899> producer<00:00:42.590> of<00:00:42.950> sorghum<00:00:43.280> now<00:00:44.030> in<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.360> u.s.

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
one producer of sorghum now in the u.s.

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.900 
one producer of sorghum now in the u.s.
it<00:00:44.899> was<00:00:45.110> used<00:00:45.680> mostly<00:00:46.010> as<00:00:47.020> field<00:00:48.020> but<00:00:48.860> with<00:00:49.760> the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
it was used mostly as field but with the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.680 
it was used mostly as field but with the
growth<00:00:50.149> in<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.750> gluten<00:00:51.410> free<00:00:51.680> market<00:00:52.520> and<00:00:53.510> the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
growth in the gluten free market and the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.740 
growth in the gluten free market and the
availability<00:00:53.930> of<00:00:54.410> food<00:00:54.739> sorghum<00:00:55.340> we<00:00:56.120> have<00:00:56.300> now

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
availability of food sorghum we have now

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.110 
availability of food sorghum we have now
started<00:00:57.140> seeing<00:00:57.559> a<00:00:57.770> lot<00:00:57.949> more<00:00:57.980> sorghum<00:00:58.940> is

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
started seeing a lot more sorghum is

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.670 
started seeing a lot more sorghum is
being<00:00:59.360> used<00:00:59.629> in<00:00:59.930> these<00:01:00.170> types<00:01:00.469> of

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
being used in these types of

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.729 
being used in these types of
formulations<00:01:01.430> we've<00:01:01.969> started<00:01:02.270> from<00:01:03.140> the

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
formulations we've started from the

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.160 
formulations we've started from the
bottom<00:01:03.890> up<00:01:04.280> basically<00:01:04.729> looking<00:01:05.509> at<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.990> best

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
bottom up basically looking at the best

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.789 
bottom up basically looking at the best
variety<00:01:06.950> among<00:01:07.660> six<00:01:08.660> varieties<00:01:08.869> that<00:01:09.259> we<00:01:09.590> had

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
variety among six varieties that we had

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.130 
variety among six varieties that we had
that<00:01:09.979> are<00:01:10.130> grown<00:01:10.369> in<00:01:10.400> cancers<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.689> look<00:01:11.869> at

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
that are grown in cancers to look at

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.340 
that are grown in cancers to look at
what<00:01:13.010> would<00:01:13.159> be<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.460> best<00:01:13.610> variety<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.510> work

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
what would be the best variety to work

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.580 
what would be the best variety to work
in<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.650> simple<00:01:16.040> system<00:01:16.250> like<00:01:16.729> tortilla<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.590> we

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
in a simple system like tortilla and we

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.280 
in a simple system like tortilla and we
looked<00:01:18.770> at<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.950> variety<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.600> physical<00:01:20.600> and

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
looked at a variety of physical and

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.070 
looked at a variety of physical and
sensory<00:01:21.799> properties<00:01:22.509> things<00:01:23.509> like<00:01:23.720> how<00:01:23.900> much

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
sensory properties things like how much

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.380 
sensory properties things like how much
does<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.530> stretch<00:01:24.890> how<00:01:25.189> what<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.150> role

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
does it stretch how what is the role

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.200 
does it stretch how what is the role
ability<00:01:26.990> of<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:27.380> how<00:01:28.100> does<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.520> public<00:01:29.000> or

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
ability of it how does the public or

ability of it how does the public or
consumers<00:01:29.810> perceive<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.530> in<00:01:30.710> terms<00:01:30.979> of<00:01:31.250> taste

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
consumers perceive it in terms of taste

more experience in tasting what what

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.550 
more experience in tasting what what
gluten-free<00:01:44.360> people<00:01:44.750> who<00:01:44.930> eat<00:01:45.079> gluten<00:01:45.380> free

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
gluten-free people who eat gluten free

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.499 
gluten-free people who eat gluten free
all<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.799> time<00:01:45.829> are<00:01:46.490> expecting<00:01:47.119> from<00:01:47.299> their

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
all the time are expecting from their

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.469 
all the time are expecting from their
food<00:01:47.720> from<00:01:48.259> that<00:01:48.560> first<00:01:48.970> piece<00:01:49.970> of<00:01:50.240> research

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
food from that first piece of research

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.560 
food from that first piece of research
we<00:01:50.720> realize<00:01:51.560> that<00:01:51.920> there's<00:01:52.189> a<00:01:52.250> lot<00:01:52.549> more<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:53.390> be

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
we realize that there's a lot more to be

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.440 
we realize that there's a lot more to be
done<00:01:53.840> at<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.890> milling<00:01:55.189> stage<00:01:55.939> of<00:01:56.270> this

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
done at the milling stage of this

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.440 
done at the milling stage of this
because<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:57.140> turns<00:01:57.380> out<00:01:57.619> that<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:58.759> particle

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
because it turns out that the particle

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.039 
because it turns out that the particle
size<00:02:00.100> during<00:02:01.100> milling<00:02:01.729> will<00:02:02.329> affect<00:02:02.780> the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
size during milling will affect the

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.950 
size during milling will affect the
properties<00:02:03.409> of<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.219> sorghum<00:02:04.670> flour<00:02:04.850> then<00:02:05.689> in

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
properties of the sorghum flour then in

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.400 
properties of the sorghum flour then in
terms<00:02:06.259> of<00:02:06.590> nutrition<00:02:07.490> effect<00:02:08.360> we<00:02:08.869> discovered

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
terms of nutrition effect we discovered

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.029 
terms of nutrition effect we discovered
that<00:02:09.590> possibly

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that possibly

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.699 
that possibly
could<00:02:11.189> be<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.629> specific<00:02:12.629> particle<00:02:12.959> size<00:02:13.349> of

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
could be a specific particle size of

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.520 
could be a specific particle size of
sorghum<00:02:13.980> flour<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.730> will<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.349> best
