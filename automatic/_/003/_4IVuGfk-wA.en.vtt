00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.570 
fret ok now as far as the finger-picking
pattern<00:02:18.420> goes<00:02:18.959> it's<00:02:19.590> almost<00:02:19.800> random<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.550> a

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
pattern goes it's almost random to a

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.400 
pattern goes it's almost random to a
certain<00:02:20.940> extent<00:02:21.239> there<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.510> sort<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.319> a

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
certain extent there is sort of a

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.130 
certain extent there is sort of a
pattern<00:02:22.560> i<00:02:22.830> use<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:23.450> it's<00:02:24.450> random<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:24.959> that

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
pattern i use but it's random in that

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.020 
pattern i use but it's random in that
each<00:02:25.410> time<00:02:25.470> i<00:02:25.800> play<00:02:26.129> this<00:02:26.310> song<00:02:26.489> it<00:02:26.730> sounds<00:02:26.879> a

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
each time i play this song it sounds a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.690 
each time i play this song it sounds a
little<00:02:27.209> different<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.810> why<00:02:28.349> usually<00:02:28.680> do<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.980> at

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
little different so why usually do is at

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.150 
little different so why usually do is at
least<00:02:29.879> in<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.060> beginning<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:31.069> i'll<00:02:32.069> either

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
least in the beginning so i'll either

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.559 
least in the beginning so i'll either
strong<00:02:32.519> or<00:02:32.780> I'll<00:02:33.780> just<00:02:33.930> kind<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.200> roll<00:02:35.569> fingers

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
strong or I'll just kind of roll fingers

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.970 
strong or I'll just kind of roll fingers
like<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.810> don't<00:02:37.739> do<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> hammer<00:02:38.190> on<00:02:39.739> there<00:02:40.739> is

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
like that don't do a hammer on there is

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.009 
like that don't do a hammer on there is
a<00:02:41.010> good<00:02:41.220> hammer<00:02:42.560> ok<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.769> then<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.870> sometimes<00:02:45.870> do

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
a good hammer ok and then I sometimes do

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.930 
a good hammer ok and then I sometimes do
it<00:02:46.140> or<00:02:46.590> what<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.160> usually<00:02:47.340> do<00:02:47.550> is<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.700> little

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
it or what I usually do is a little

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.430 
it or what I usually do is a little
flick<00:02:49.069> where<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.099> kind<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.870> do<00:02:52.290> a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
flick where I kind of and I do a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.720 
flick where I kind of and I do a
tutorial<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.980> how<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.160> do<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.340> on<00:02:53.580> guitar

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
tutorial on how to do this on guitar

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.390 
tutorial on how to do this on guitar
which<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.209> think<00:02:54.420> I'll<00:02:55.230> include<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.680> link<00:02:55.739> maybe

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
which I think I'll include a link maybe

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.940 
which I think I'll include a link maybe
somewhere<00:02:56.640> over<00:02:56.819> here<00:02:56.849> but<00:02:57.780> um<00:02:57.989> I<00:03:00.409> do<00:03:01.409> is<00:03:01.830> I

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
somewhere over here but um I do is I

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.309 
somewhere over here but um I do is I
flick<00:03:02.250> out<00:03:02.400> with<00:03:02.610> my<00:03:02.730> index<00:03:03.060> finger<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.810> my

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
flick out with my index finger and my

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.250 
flick out with my index finger and my
thumb<00:03:04.349> might<00:03:05.159> make<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> little<00:03:05.430> tab<00:03:08.569> ok<00:03:09.569> so<00:03:09.629> that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
thumb might make a little tab ok so that

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.619 
thumb might make a little tab ok so that
cito<00:03:10.530> might<00:03:10.680> help<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.420> figure<00:03:12.420> out<00:03:12.569> that

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
cito might help you figure out that

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.690 
cito might help you figure out that
technique<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.409> then<00:03:13.680> after<00:03:14.099> that<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.489> the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
technique and then after that is the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.350 
technique and then after that is the
random<00:03:15.030> part<00:03:15.300> more<00:03:16.080> or<00:03:16.170> less<00:03:16.230> what<00:03:19.879> I<00:03:20.879> do<00:03:21.000> here

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
random part more or less what I do here

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.420 
random part more or less what I do here
is<00:03:21.510> I'm<00:03:21.629> just<00:03:21.810> kind<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.050> alternating<00:03:22.590> with

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
is I'm just kind of alternating with

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.920 
is I'm just kind of alternating with
this<00:03:23.580> fourth<00:03:23.879> string<00:03:29.450> just<00:03:30.450> kind<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.750> in

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
this fourth string just kind of in

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.640 
this fourth string just kind of in
random<00:03:31.349> order<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:32.459> I'm<00:03:32.670> always<00:03:32.819> playing<00:03:33.209> a

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
random order but I'm always playing a

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.550 
random order but I'm always playing a
this<00:03:34.650> fourth<00:03:34.950> string<00:03:35.510> alternating<00:03:36.510> with<00:03:36.629> one

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
this fourth string alternating with one

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:50.119 
this fourth string alternating with one
of<00:03:37.650> these<00:03:37.769> three<00:03:37.950> strings<00:03:38.360> so<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.810> sounds<00:03:40.110> like

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.009 

sort<00:03:51.129> of<00:03:51.219> the<00:03:51.280> pattern<00:03:51.609> ok<00:03:52.060> I'm<00:03:52.599> going<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.900> play

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
sort of the pattern ok I'm going to play

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.470 
sort of the pattern ok I'm going to play
through<00:03:53.230> it<00:03:53.319> very<00:03:53.349> slowly<00:03:53.829> now<00:03:54.269> I'm<00:03:55.269> going<00:03:55.420> to

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
through it very slowly now I'm going to

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.640 
through it very slowly now I'm going to
try<00:03:55.599> to<00:03:55.629> go<00:03:55.840> slow<00:03:56.079> enough<00:03:56.109> that<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:56.530> can

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
try to go slow enough that you can

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.509 
try to go slow enough that you can
follow<00:03:56.890> along<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:58.540> get<00:03:59.079> your<00:03:59.260> fingers<00:03:59.650> to

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
follow along and get your fingers to

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:48.860 
follow along and get your fingers to
match<00:04:00.700> mine<00:04:01.950> all<00:04:02.950> right<00:04:03.099> here<00:04:03.310> we<00:04:03.340> go

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.000 

that<00:04:49.870> cord<00:04:50.140> it's<00:04:50.290> kind<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.470> hard<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.680> see<00:04:50.860> but

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
that cord it's kind of hard to see but

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.430 
that cord it's kind of hard to see but
its<00:04:51.300> second<00:04:52.300> fret<00:04:52.450> second<00:04:52.810> fret<00:04:52.900> second<00:04:53.350> fret

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
its second fret second fret second fret

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.540 
its second fret second fret second fret
open<00:04:57.870> then<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:59.020> next<00:04:59.170> part<00:04:59.440> so<00:05:00.280> it's<00:05:00.370> with<00:05:00.490> a

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
open then the next part so it's with a

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:36.990 
open then the next part so it's with a
hammer<00:05:00.730> on<00:05:33.900> okay<00:05:34.900> and<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:36.340> second<00:05:36.880> part

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
hammer on okay and that second part

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.630 
hammer on okay and that second part
repeats<00:05:37.390> itself<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:38.110> then<00:05:39.010> we<00:05:39.310> go<00:05:39.430> through

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
repeats itself and then we go through

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.340 
repeats itself and then we go through
the<00:05:39.760> song<00:05:40.000> again<00:05:40.450> just<00:05:40.810> repeating<00:05:41.140> everything

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
the song again just repeating everything

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.350 
the song again just repeating everything
I<00:05:41.650> kind<00:05:41.890> of<00:05:42.040> the<00:05:42.340> second<00:05:42.669> time<00:05:42.790> around<00:05:42.880> I<00:05:43.150> kind

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
I kind of the second time around I kind

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:53.580 
I kind of the second time around I kind
of<00:05:43.480> extent<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.560> taps<00:05:45.280> more

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.710 

so<00:05:54.590> I'm<00:05:54.710> just<00:05:54.920> getting<00:05:55.790> that<00:05:55.850> tap<00:05:56.150> end<00:05:56.480> with

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
so I'm just getting that tap end with

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.780 
so I'm just getting that tap end with
the<00:05:56.840> flick<00:05:57.080> once<00:05:58.010> again<00:05:58.130> that<00:05:58.280> tutorial<00:05:58.700> will

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
the flick once again that tutorial will

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.170 
the flick once again that tutorial will
be<00:05:58.850> really<00:05:59.060> helpful<00:05:59.240> to<00:05:59.870> develop<00:06:00.380> that

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
be really helpful to develop that

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.840 
be really helpful to develop that
percussive<00:06:02.180> playing<00:06:03.050> skill<00:06:03.380> and<00:06:04.130> so<00:06:04.760> it

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
percussive playing skill and so it

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.840 
percussive playing skill and so it
repeats<00:06:05.090> again<00:06:05.240> and<00:06:05.690> then<00:06:05.990> at<00:06:06.200> the<00:06:06.290> very<00:06:06.320> end<00:06:06.850> I

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
repeats again and then at the very end I

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.560 
repeats again and then at the very end I
just<00:06:08.480> mix<00:06:08.690> it<00:06:08.780> up<00:06:08.930> a<00:06:09.200> little<00:06:09.470> bit<00:06:10.010> where<00:06:10.570> this

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
just mix it up a little bit where this

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.620 
just mix it up a little bit where this
is<00:06:11.780> the<00:06:12.110> same<00:06:12.350> to<00:06:12.950> this<00:06:13.070> forward<00:06:13.510> to<00:06:14.510> this

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
there I'm borrowing both of these

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.960 
there I'm borrowing both of these
strings<00:06:44.240> and<00:06:44.570> I'm<00:06:44.810> holding<00:06:45.490> just<00:06:46.490> that<00:06:46.700> fret

00:06:46.970 --> 00:07:00.230 
strings and I'm holding just that fret
also<00:06:48.970> so<00:06:49.970> the<00:06:50.060> very<00:06:50.240> end<00:06:50.450> is

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.779 

okay<00:07:01.240> um<00:07:01.649> best<00:07:02.649> of<00:07:02.800> luck<00:07:02.860> i'll<00:07:03.129> try<00:07:03.309> to<00:07:03.369> make<00:07:03.759> a

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:03.789 
okay um best of luck i'll try to make a

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.959 
okay um best of luck i'll try to make a
tab<00:07:04.059> like<00:07:04.270> this<00:07:04.449> as<00:07:04.659> i<00:07:04.779> said<00:07:05.399> i'll<00:07:06.399> make<00:07:06.699> a<00:07:06.729> tab

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:06.969 
tab like this as i said i'll make a tab

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.879 
tab like this as i said i'll make a tab
for<00:07:07.179> this<00:07:07.270> eventually<00:07:07.599> but<00:07:08.110> i<00:07:08.259> think<00:07:08.709> you<00:07:08.770> can

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:08.889 
for this eventually but i think you can

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.519 
for this eventually but i think you can
learn<00:07:08.979> from<00:07:09.099> the<00:07:09.249> video<00:07:09.490> and<00:07:09.819> don't<00:07:10.689> worry<00:07:11.439> if

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:11.529 
learn from the video and don't worry if

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:13.980 
learn from the video and don't worry if
it<00:07:11.740> doesn't<00:07:12.009> sound<00:07:12.159> exactly<00:07:12.520> like<00:07:12.969> how<00:07:13.629> I<00:07:13.659> play

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
it doesn't sound exactly like how I play

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.350 
it doesn't sound exactly like how I play
it<00:07:14.139> because<00:07:14.319> as<00:07:14.860> I<00:07:15.129> said<00:07:15.189> it's<00:07:15.490> almost<00:07:15.789> random

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 
it because as I said it's almost random

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.029 
it because as I said it's almost random
to<00:07:16.599> a<00:07:16.629> certain<00:07:16.899> extent<00:07:17.110> the<00:07:17.259> way<00:07:17.349> I<00:07:17.379> play<00:07:17.709> it<00:07:17.740> so

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 
to a certain extent the way I play it so

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:19.559 
to a certain extent the way I play it so
when<00:07:18.490> I<00:07:18.520> either<00:07:18.729> play<00:07:18.969> it<00:07:19.029> it<00:07:19.270> doesn't<00:07:19.449> sound

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:19.569 
when I either play it it doesn't sound

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:22.949 
when I either play it it doesn't sound
like<00:07:20.339> you<00:07:21.339> know<00:07:21.429> that<00:07:21.580> video<00:07:21.909> i<00:07:22.149> posted<00:07:22.689> every
