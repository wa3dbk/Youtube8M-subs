these stepping stones into a real method

these stepping stones into a real method
it's<00:03:04.900> where<00:03:05.079> you<00:03:05.170> add<00:03:05.350> your<00:03:05.530> backside<00:03:05.920> shifty

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
it's where you add your backside shifty

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.340 
it's where you add your backside shifty
into<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.579> trip<00:03:06.910> so<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.540> base<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.989> your<00:03:08.019> board

closely<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:52.569> you'll<00:03:52.720> see<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.019> my<00:03:53.079> upper

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
closely and you'll see that my upper

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.289 
closely and you'll see that my upper
body<00:03:53.470> is<00:03:53.620> wound<00:03:54.069> slightly<00:03:54.609> towards<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.000> tail

rear leg while on the method adds even

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.170 
rear leg while on the method adds even
more<00:04:09.070> style<00:04:09.490> to<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.730> trick

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
more style to the trick

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.080 
more style to the trick
giving<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:10.600> more<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.780> a<00:04:10.930> boned<00:04:11.260> out<00:04:11.500> look<00:04:12.090> try

giving it more of a boned out look try
kicking<00:04:13.570> out<00:04:13.690> your<00:04:13.840> back<00:04:14.170> foot<00:04:14.470> like<00:04:14.710> you're

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
kicking out your back foot like you're

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.729 
kicking out your back foot like you're

trying to tap something your back leg

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.440 
trying to tap something your back leg
should<00:04:17.950> be<00:04:18.220> parallel<00:04:18.790> with<00:04:18.910> your<00:04:19.000> front<00:04:19.270> leg

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
should be parallel with your front leg

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.210
