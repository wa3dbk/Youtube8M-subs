00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.690
 Also 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.410
 Recently popular ae technology is available 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.640
 So immediately raised by 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.450
 Let First Substitution 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.980

 Make it famous 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:59.970
 Spot I am the main body- 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.470
 Let's see what has been posted for now 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.239
 It's body First 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.239
 When Japan hatch is opened 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.860
 This is 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.090
 Another water case 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.659
 The horizontal line is a housing 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.560
 And now this body 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.649
 It was entered in a state in which the tft monitor is stuck 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.110
 I wonder if this is So out of 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:32.270
 Opposite and tft lcd juni 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.630
 I and I'm Terry enters here is 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.780
 Is another this magnitude to be wearing either a monitor car 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:44.060
 Even just the size here 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:49.040
 It works as a camera, but this is a standard battery. 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:55.520
 And it is cherry bag of backup battery expansion 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:58.250
 Just as very or properly length Te Saddle as the previous tft pack the body behind 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.770
 It says that it corresponds to time photography 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.159
 There 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.420
 Well, it says flat mount assembly , but it is flat. 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.670
 It is a mount 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.200
 It is part of it and pedestal 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.530
 But with the members 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:25.010
 Now it is not possible to come to various mount Te Cachan Do's and Saddle 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:29.989
 It's hard to say that it's hard to say that it's over here with this rubber 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:37.090
 Tteyuu does not come off because not press here also by doing so it is mentioned as the lid 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:37.090
 I have one more flat mount 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:55.590
 Buber 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:58.680
 Concern tee short mosquitoes to e 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:04.010
 Even with the Fachley Park of watermelon attached 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:08.510
 It is a folder when using it without putting it in a housing that can be used by a hotel 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.480
 Gay v output cable usb cave 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.520
 It is plastic case yeah 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.090
 Comes with a case, such as can be stored all these options GOODS 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:23.819
 Surgery and spray wrap 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:29.760
 Fixing with a screw with some strap 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:32.490
 Maybe I wound it like an arm and I fixed it by winding it like this arm 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.770
 I think that it is mount say this 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:43.950
 And this is a bike mart This can be fixed to the steering wheel 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:47.820
 It is a mount to be attached to those of'll I often'm ne So this kind of rod-like is to say, 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:52.480
 I heard it after putting it on the steering wheel 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:57.340
 After I put this in the handle I wound it 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.489
 It is firmly You should see this remote control can be fixed in this 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:06.400
 Like putting in a clip 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:14.370
 It is in this is probably Neri also corn that was Well I I was by Toseru fill both Bonner 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.370
 Block the turn c after this hat type like fixing with Velcro 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:36.249
 Boo Boo said Nyoka Next 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:40.899
 There is something like a sheet on Wednesday 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:47.139
 Although this is a lid on the back of the housing though 

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:53.979
 The one that came with the standard is a state with a backup battery or tft pack 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:56.270
 This is when used in a compact form that does not put what was said so but I'm hot Kana 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.690
 Can be used in a thin housing 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:05.690
 That's right Nechotto cd Theory 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:11.270
 I wonder if this is also a spare mount because with a tripod screw Do it there is this 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:16.260
 And this part of the case with the user manual and 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.330
 The part of this mount is also stopped with a screw and it can be used if you take off here too 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.699
 It is- 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:26.389
 Because it is such mon Mon which is roughly such a mon Go there is full of sungi now 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:31.069
 What is loaded as standard is now, but 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:37.320
 Mount fixed to this tripod this time 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:42.840
 Tripod screw it to the housing of Tteyuu I was wearing one this 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.930
 In the previous version the housing itself is correct but the hole in the tripod screw is correct 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.289
 You 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:51.160
 In in that mean this version it was unusable 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:56.080
 It's amazing that you have one here 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:06:00.460
 It is sb 21 which is full set of optional parts but this 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:03.950
 After all, I think that the place you care about is the comparison with go pro 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.830
 Let's try using it while checking for a moment 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.070
 I think 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.760
 It's plenty Ow 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:16.380
 Great 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.380
 I think you have is becoming want really to Toka comparison with the go pro after all 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.850
 Is completely different unfortunately and here i m mount z The magnitude of this mount 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.570
 I will 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:33.680
 It is this mount of the same ae 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:39.110
 It seems that the size of go pro and no sound 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.810
 I don't think it's a separate project, but I 'm going to use a pro mount 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.810
 you know 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.810
 Hmm
