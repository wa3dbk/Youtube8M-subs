the foot wearing flip-flops can also

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
cause what dr. Rowland calls bony

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.090 
cause what dr. Rowland calls bony
problems<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.300> long<00:00:48.540> term<00:00:48.840> arch<00:00:49.740> pain

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
problems if you have long term arch pain

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100 
problems if you have long term arch pain
or<00:00:50.400> heel<00:00:50.610> pain<00:00:50.880> then<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.960> actually

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
or heel pain then that can actually

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.190 
or heel pain then that can actually
cause<00:00:52.440> bone<00:00:52.800> spurs<00:00:53.240> then<00:00:54.240> adding<00:00:54.630> more<00:00:54.810> to

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
cause bone spurs then adding more to

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.560 
cause bone spurs then adding more to
pain<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:55.980> also<00:00:56.160> cause<00:00:56.520> some<00:00:56.790> ankle<00:00:57.240> pain

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
pain it can also cause some ankle pain

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.030 
pain it can also cause some ankle pain
because<00:00:58.170> you're<00:00:58.290> not<00:00:58.410> getting<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.740> support

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
because you're not getting the support

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.800 
because you're not getting the support
of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> foot<00:00:59.400> so<00:00:59.610> then<00:00:59.940> your<00:01:00.060> ankle<00:01:00.360> tends<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
of the foot so then your ankle tends to

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.860 
of the foot so then your ankle tends to
roll<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.680> no<00:01:02.010> support<00:01:02.490> as<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:03.240> soft<00:01:03.450> tissue<00:01:03.540> you

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
roll so no support as to soft tissue you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.899 
roll so no support as to soft tissue you
pain<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.140> then<00:01:04.589> ultimately<00:01:04.829> bony<00:01:05.369> pain<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
pain and then ultimately bony pain and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.819 
pain and then ultimately bony pain and
believe<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.539> or<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:06.750> wearing<00:01:07.530> flip-flops

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
believe it or not wearing flip-flops

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.550 
believe it or not wearing flip-flops
actually<00:01:08.700> makes<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.149> walk<00:01:09.479> differently<00:01:10.109> it's

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
actually makes you walk differently it's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.940 
actually makes you walk differently it's
actually<00:01:10.979> called<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.520> flip-flop<00:01:12.390> shuffle<00:01:13.109> we

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
actually called the flip-flop shuffle we

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.980 
actually called the flip-flop shuffle we
take<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.219> shorter<00:01:14.820> stride<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:15.929> a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
take a shorter stride so we have a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.440 
take a shorter stride so we have a
shorter<00:01:16.350> gait<00:01:16.679> and<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.969> that<00:01:17.999> our

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
shorter gait and when we do that our

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.260 
shorter gait and when we do that our
toes<00:01:18.960> crunch<00:01:19.469> up<00:01:19.679> very<00:01:20.159> tightly<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.850> hold<00:01:21.149> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
toes crunch up very tightly to hold that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.840 
toes crunch up very tightly to hold that
flip-flop<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.890> we're<00:01:23.159> taking<00:01:23.310> shorter

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
flip-flop on so we're taking shorter

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.969 
flip-flop on so we're taking shorter
strides<00:01:24.210> causing<00:01:25.049> more<00:01:25.289> knee<00:01:25.499> and<00:01:25.649> hip<00:01:25.829> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
strides causing more knee and hip and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
strides causing more knee and hip and
ultimately<00:01:26.579> back<00:01:26.789> pain<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.329> then<00:01:27.780> also<00:01:27.929> to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
ultimately back pain and then also to

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.660 
ultimately back pain and then also to
with<00:01:28.380> those<00:01:28.469> toes<00:01:28.740> crunched<00:01:29.249> all<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.399> time

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
with those toes crunched all the time

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.609 
with those toes crunched all the time
you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.569> shortening<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.170> tendons

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you can get shortening of the tendons

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.230 
you can get shortening of the tendons
causing<00:01:32.009> hammertoes<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.609> long<00:01:32.729> term<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
causing hammertoes of long term and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.300 
causing hammertoes of long term and
since<00:01:33.689> flip-flops<00:01:34.200> are<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> mainstay<00:01:34.679> for<00:01:34.950> so
