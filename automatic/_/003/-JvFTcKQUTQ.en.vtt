00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
say about it weight distribution is

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.290 
say about it weight distribution is
great<00:01:11.580> drives<00:01:12.580> great<00:01:12.910> jumps<00:01:13.450> great<00:01:13.720> um<00:01:15.300> don't

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
nuts those are a character controller

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.440 
nuts those are a character controller
it's<00:01:44.680> really<00:01:44.860> good<00:01:45.100> controller<00:01:45.490> my<00:01:46.150> uncle

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
it's really good controller my uncle

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.940 
it's really good controller my uncle
program<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:47.080> he<00:01:47.229> said<00:01:47.409> it's<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.620> really<00:01:47.860> easy

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
program that he said it's a really easy

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.740 
program that he said it's a really easy
to<00:01:48.280> program<00:01:48.460> it<00:01:48.790> looked<00:01:49.030> like<00:01:49.120> a<00:01:49.180> painted<00:01:49.540> ass

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
to program it looked like a painted ass

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.320 
to program it looked like a painted ass
but<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.380> guess<00:01:50.920> I'll<00:01:51.130> she<00:01:51.250> read<00:01:51.460> on<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.760> really

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
but I guess I'll she read on it really

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.500 
but I guess I'll she read on it really
easy<00:01:52.510> program<00:01:53.580> karralys<00:01:54.580> ain't<00:01:54.909> bad<00:01:55.210> about

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
easy program karralys ain't bad about

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.510 
easy program karralys ain't bad about
the<00:01:55.690> servo<00:01:56.080> it's<00:01:56.260> just<00:01:56.500> under<00:01:56.710> steered<00:01:57.159> really

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
the servo it's just under steered really

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.719 
the servo it's just under steered really
bad<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:58.030> would<00:01:58.570> recommend<00:01:58.930> sway<00:01:59.409> bars<00:02:02.400> so<00:02:03.400> new

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
bad I would recommend sway bars so new

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.330 
bad I would recommend sway bars so new
tires<00:02:04.030> new<00:02:04.450> sway<00:02:04.990> bar<00:02:05.260> sway<00:02:05.770> bars<00:02:06.010> and

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
tires new sway bar sway bars and

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.910 
tires new sway bar sway bars and
possibly<00:02:06.760> a<00:02:06.850> higher<00:02:07.060> torque<00:02:07.450> servo<00:02:07.900> on<00:02:08.739> this

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
possibly a higher torque servo on this

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.550 
possibly a higher torque servo on this
truck<00:02:09.159> would<00:02:09.369> be<00:02:09.929> great<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.860> speed<00:02:12.220> control

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
truck would be great the speed control

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.069 
truck would be great the speed control
the<00:02:14.560> esc<00:02:15.129> in<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.549> motor<00:02:15.730> on<00:02:15.819> it's<00:02:16.090> good<00:02:16.329> the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
the esc in the motor on it's good the

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:23.809 
the esc in the motor on it's good the
way<00:02:17.110> they<00:02:17.459> know<00:02:21.359> everyone<00:02:22.359> says<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.659> badass
