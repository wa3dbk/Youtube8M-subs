honest<00:04:04.620> there's<00:04:05.160> some<00:04:05.280> people<00:04:05.520> who<00:04:05.610> might

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
prefer the sound of this because I think

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.320 
prefer the sound of this because I think
the<00:04:08.040> squire<00:04:08.310> sounds<00:04:08.700> in<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.850> way<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:08.970> bit<00:04:09.150> more

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
the squire sounds in a way a bit more

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.480 
the squire sounds in a way a bit more
pure<00:04:09.600> s<00:04:09.720> ish<00:04:09.930> which<00:04:10.890> means<00:04:11.100> it<00:04:11.190> doesn't<00:04:11.400> have

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
pure s ish which means it doesn't have

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.340 
pure s ish which means it doesn't have
as<00:04:11.610> much<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:12.060> I<00:04:12.360> guess<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.900> put<00:04:13.050> it<00:04:13.140> doesn't

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
as much of I guess to put it doesn't

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.759 
as much of I guess to put it doesn't
have<00:04:13.440> as<00:04:13.500> much<00:04:13.650> balls<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.819> as<00:04:15.209> um<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.780> mean
