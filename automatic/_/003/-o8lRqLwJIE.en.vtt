00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
their product so let's take a look at

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.710 
their product so let's take a look at
speakers<00:03:44.470> themselves<00:03:46.150> try<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.209> pull<00:03:47.510> this<00:03:47.660> off

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
speakers themselves try to pull this off

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:55.190 
speakers themselves try to pull this off
here<00:03:48.970> there's<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.090> pretty

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.810 

okay<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:57.750> cardboard<00:03:58.750> packaging<00:03:59.590> this<00:04:00.250> fits<00:04:00.610> on

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
okay so cardboard packaging this fits on

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.940 
okay so cardboard packaging this fits on
the<00:04:01.000> really<00:04:01.360> nice<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.840> snug<00:04:02.140> in<00:04:02.320> its<00:04:02.500> tight<00:04:02.800> in

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
the really nice and snug in its tight in

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.500 
the really nice and snug in its tight in
the<00:04:03.070> box<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.490> can<00:04:03.640> shake<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:03.880> doesn't<00:04:04.390> move

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
the box you can shake it doesn't move

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.960 
the box you can shake it doesn't move
around<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:05.410> it's<00:04:05.560> extremely<00:04:05.800> safely<00:04:06.430> packaged

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
around so it's extremely safely packaged

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.360 
around so it's extremely safely packaged
like<00:04:07.120> most<00:04:07.480> likely<00:04:07.990> products<00:04:08.380> are<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.810> way<00:04:11.370> so

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
like most likely products are the way so

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.410 
like most likely products are the way so
let's<00:04:12.490> take<00:04:12.580> a<00:04:12.640> look<00:04:12.790> at<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:12.940> speakers<00:04:13.210> for

they're they feel pretty sturdy they
feel<00:05:19.240> solid<00:05:19.720> and<00:05:19.840> not<00:05:19.990> flimsy<00:05:20.320> so<00:05:21.220> take<00:05:21.940> a<00:05:21.970> look

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
feel solid and not flimsy so take a look

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.030 
feel solid and not flimsy so take a look
at<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.480> club<00:05:23.470> here<00:05:25.560> this<00:05:26.560> looks<00:05:26.770> like<00:05:26.890> your

standard plug to plug it in your
headphone<00:05:30.040> jack<00:05:31.740> goes<00:05:32.740> to<00:05:32.890> the<00:05:32.980> side<00:05:33.220> for<00:05:33.250> a

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
headphone jack goes to the side for a

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.590 
headphone jack goes to the side for a
minute<00:05:34.140> now<00:05:35.140> take<00:05:35.470> a<00:05:35.500> look<00:05:35.590> at<00:05:36.270> this<00:05:37.270> is<00:05:37.450> what

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
minute now take a look at this is what

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.840 
minute now take a look at this is what
I'm<00:05:37.690> really<00:05:38.050> excited<00:05:38.530> about

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:50.980 

now<00:05:43.850> some<00:05:44.389> hooker<00:05:45.669> does<00:05:47.199> require<00:05:49.750> extra<00:05:50.750> power

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
now some hooker does require extra power

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.990 
now some hooker does require extra power
so<00:05:51.320> you<00:05:51.410> have<00:05:51.530> to<00:05:51.650> plug<00:05:51.889> it<00:05:52.040> into<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:52.610> wall

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.170 

okay<00:05:56.000> so<00:05:56.240> looks<00:05:57.139> from<00:05:57.680> the<00:05:57.710> front<00:05:58.150> basically<00:05:59.150> a

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
okay so looks from the front basically a

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.439 
okay so looks from the front basically a
pretty<00:05:59.510> basic<00:05:59.690> design<00:06:00.199> this<00:06:00.830> the<00:06:01.100> square<00:06:01.580> knot

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
pretty basic design this the square knot

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.230 
pretty basic design this the square knot
rubberized<00:06:03.020> finish<00:06:03.460> let<00:06:04.460> me<00:06:04.580> think<00:06:04.729> crazy

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
rubberized finish let me think crazy

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.950 
rubberized finish let me think crazy
like<00:06:05.510> that<00:06:05.860> on<00:06:06.860> the<00:06:07.070> back<00:06:07.310> we<00:06:07.699> have<00:06:08.270> speaker

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
like that on the back we have speaker

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.659 
like that on the back we have speaker
output<00:06:10.180> kind<00:06:11.180> of<00:06:11.240> like<00:06:11.360> a<00:06:11.389> felt<00:06:12.400> kind<00:06:13.400> of<00:06:13.520> not

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
output kind of like a felt kind of not

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.610 
output kind of like a felt kind of not
exactly<00:06:14.060> felt<00:06:14.360> but<00:06:14.540> that<00:06:14.720> kind<00:06:14.960> of<00:06:15.050> feel<00:06:15.320> here

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
exactly felt but that kind of feel here

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.670 
exactly felt but that kind of feel here
on<00:06:15.800> the<00:06:16.610> back<00:06:17.830> how<00:06:18.830> much<00:06:19.010> bass<00:06:19.280> you<00:06:19.910> want

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
on the back how much bass you want

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.810 
on the back how much bass you want
probably<00:06:21.680> basically<00:06:22.190> controls<00:06:22.550> the<00:06:22.669> volume

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
probably basically controls the volume

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:28.350 
probably basically controls the volume
as<00:06:23.270> well<00:06:23.300> but<00:06:24.190> labeled<00:06:25.190> base<00:06:26.410> audio<00:06:27.410> line-in

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
as well but labeled base audio line-in

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:38.110 
as well but labeled base audio line-in
and<00:06:30.729> this<00:06:31.729> is<00:06:32.030> just<00:06:32.210> your<00:06:32.389> power<00:06:32.840> cord<00:06:35.919> so<00:06:37.120> okay

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
and this is just your power cord so okay

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.060 
and this is just your power cord so okay
this<00:06:38.270> is<00:06:38.419> cool<00:06:38.630> um<00:06:38.810> this<00:06:39.440> is<00:06:39.680> the<00:06:39.850> little<00:06:40.850> pod

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
this is cool um this is the little pod

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.879 
this is cool um this is the little pod
your<00:06:43.070> control<00:06:43.430> volume<00:06:43.880> and<00:06:44.150> the<00:06:44.210> other<00:06:44.330> things

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 
your control volume and the other things

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.700 
your control volume and the other things
I'll<00:06:45.889> oh<00:06:46.130> I<00:06:46.340> guess<00:06:46.610> these<00:06:47.320> somehow<00:06:48.320> connect

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
I'll oh I guess these somehow connect

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.570 
I'll oh I guess these somehow connect
this<00:06:48.950> as<00:06:49.490> well<00:06:50.979> so<00:06:51.979> let's<00:06:52.130> take<00:06:52.220> a<00:06:52.280> look<00:06:52.400> at<00:06:52.520> the

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
this as well so let's take a look at the

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.770 
this as well so let's take a look at the
driver<00:06:52.729> on<00:06:53.210> the<00:06:53.750> bottom<00:06:54.080> a<00:06:55.330> four-inch<00:06:56.330> driver

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
driver on the bottom a four-inch driver

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.629 
driver on the bottom a four-inch driver
now<00:06:57.620> I<00:06:58.120> don't<00:06:59.120> know<00:06:59.210> about<00:06:59.300> you<00:06:59.419> but<00:07:00.460> there<00:07:01.460> is

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 
now I don't know about you but there is

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.510 
now I don't know about you but there is
looks<00:07:02.090> like<00:07:02.240> there's<00:07:02.419> some<00:07:02.479> glue<00:07:03.020> like<00:07:03.800> little

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
looks like there's some glue like little

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.510 
looks like there's some glue like little
strings<00:07:05.030> of<00:07:05.210> glue<00:07:05.510> similar<00:07:06.200> like<00:07:06.440> when<00:07:07.430> you

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
strings of glue similar like when you

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.860 
strings of glue similar like when you
HOT<00:07:07.880> do<00:07:08.090> something<00:07:08.479> you<00:07:08.539> get<00:07:08.660> the<00:07:08.750> little

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
HOT do something you get the little

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.010 
HOT do something you get the little
strings<00:07:09.310> coming<00:07:10.310> from<00:07:11.000> around<00:07:11.389> the<00:07:11.630> speaker

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
strings coming from around the speaker

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.560 
strings coming from around the speaker
but<00:07:12.289> I<00:07:12.500> guess<00:07:13.039> it's<00:07:13.220> no<00:07:13.370> big<00:07:13.580> deal<00:07:13.610> a<00:07:14.000> little

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
but I guess it's no big deal a little

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.820 
but I guess it's no big deal a little
feet<00:07:14.870> to<00:07:16.240> right<00:07:17.240> I'll<00:07:17.389> just<00:07:17.840> hold<00:07:18.470> it<00:07:18.560> off<00:07:18.680> the

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830 
feet to right I'll just hold it off the

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.610 
feet to right I'll just hold it off the
ground<00:07:19.039> and<00:07:19.720> looks<00:07:20.720> like<00:07:20.870> a<00:07:20.960> nice<00:07:21.169> high

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:21.620 
ground and looks like a nice high

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.089
