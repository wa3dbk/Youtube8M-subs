00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.390
 the imax selection is for 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.199
 children who will spend a reading 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.779
 accompanied with a standalone reading 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.230
 so this is a phase for transition 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.779
 so this selection accompanies everything 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.439
 in fact this moment of transition since 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.560
 we will have both albums they 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.820
 will gain density gaining text 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.960
 compared to the albums they 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.690
 already know 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.120
 we are going to have some objects 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.079
 identified who are really hybrid 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.089
 between the album and the comic that 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.179
 are going very quietly to take them 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:54.629
 to graphic narrative readings 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:56.910
 more complex then his two albums 1 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.469
 on a text of carl norac of 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.089
 illustrations by anne catherine de 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.609
 beautiful we have big case where is small 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.370
 man is an album of the author 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.470
 illustrator inga moore the schapi ten 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.880
 so these are two of books that are going 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.380
 rely on the accounts especially for 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.630
 big chaos and small sums and then 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.250
 yes stories except for accounts 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.210
 any case a narrative 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.550
 adventures with a dimension of fable 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.850
 for the schapi ten with a lot 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.490
 humor for for one and one dimension 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.080
 of initiatory tale for the other the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.750
 two albums from one of the most varied 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.310
 thomas bretonneau that we already knew 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.520
 with the three cruel tales 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.240
 here are the three worst stories of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.910
 pirates 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.590
 we are fully in the story of 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.340
 pirates but in a very narration 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.290
 dynamic very disheveled almost with 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.869
 a lot of humor especially in the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.759
 falls from these three three stories that 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.310
 stage both very 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.710
 young pirates boys but also challenges 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.440
 who will lead adventures absolutely 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.290
 cheerful and ducks too weird 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.440
 by Cecile Castellucci and Sara Veyron 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.709
 so this is really a very 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.860
 singular very funny that puts us in 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.400
 presence of two characters including one 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.350
 cane and a duck that have 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.340
 personalities totally opposite and well 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.310
 heard that they go before after being 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.709
 hate to turn out to be two big 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.690
 friends who will also face the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.239
 community together but all of this is 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.790
 very very fresh with a lot of humor 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.010
 dogpourri we already know who this 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.900
 time is going to school so on a text 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.799
 of male colleagues and on drawings of 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.150
 Marc before this character at once 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.820
 ludicrous 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.680
 sometimes a little silly and at the same time 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.880
 terribly endearing I think that's 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.400
 are these qualities that make it all sound 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.180
 success with children and we attend 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:14.299
 there the first day of dog school 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:18.570
 rots while shifts and humor 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:22.250
 the living creatures of alice de poncheville 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.740
 renews with the Anglo Saxon tradition 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.340
 what I would call 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.780
 the small natural storytelling it's up to 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.910
 to say that we are in the presence of a 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.550
 community that has all of a community 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.740
 human being a community of animals that 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.700
 are facing attacks on 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.850
 their natural environment and who will have to 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.720
 outsmart the keys of this enigma for 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.930
 to uncover the reasons for this 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.820
 growing threat and then we have two 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.190
 texts of great authors 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.960
 christian oster and florence evos who have 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.780
 the habit of speaking to young people 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.770
 readers through the fly collection 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.020
 the main problem of the cautious prince 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.370
 like christian oster it's really the 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.840
 do with a lot of virtuosity he 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.709
 resumes the scheme of the account and he 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.220
 gives it an extremely dimension 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:21.260
 humorous modern all this very well 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.260
 supported by the illustrations in 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.600
 color with contrasts and 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.360
 rather daring hues that also plunges 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.250
 this story in the modernity of adrien 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.030
 albert so the illustrator and then 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.340
 florence seyvos she puts us in 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.290
 presence of charlotte and mona two 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.240
 sisters who move into their 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.630
 apartment we will almost not left 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.450
 this apartment through three stories 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.210
 which at the time really relies on the 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.030
 daily life of his two sisters and at the same time 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.760
 time gives an imaginary dimension 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:00.650
 dream 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:04.910
 then little adventure between sisters of 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:09.860
 little story radio adventures to 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:12.289
 read and that benevolence that florence 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.449
 seyvos develops in this narrative is 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.240
 admirably supported by the work of 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.610
 matty woerth who has a way 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.520
 extremely tender and warm 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.380
 to draw to represent his two children 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.620
 in their room 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.700
 so here we have a selection 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.050
 relatively eclectic in terms of 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.570
 types of stories one has both 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.840
 deep narratives the report to the accounts 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.090
 who is very present and at the same time 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.690
 a lot of humor a lot of 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.570
 singularity in those titles that are going 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.600
 allow I really think about 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.000
 readers of 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.800
 to turn to this autonomous reading 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.610
 with great ease and at the same time 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.610
 of pleasure
