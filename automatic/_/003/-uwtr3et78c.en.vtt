00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.260 
actually read am here a little more but
I<00:02:06.810> don't<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.799> um<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> really<00:02:09.119> use

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
I don't do that um what I really use

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.300 
I don't do that um what I really use
braided<00:02:09.899> shade<00:02:10.500> off<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.649> bat<00:02:10.890> because<00:02:11.039> my

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
braided shade off the bat because my

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.070 
braided shade off the bat because my
hair<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:12.180> actually<00:02:12.420> listened

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
hair it actually listened

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.990 
hair it actually listened
me<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.500> actually<00:02:13.950> obey<00:02:14.160> what<00:02:14.400> i<00:02:14.460> want<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.880> do

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
me and actually obey what i want to do

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.400 
me and actually obey what i want to do
so<00:02:15.330> i<00:02:15.360> don't<00:02:15.570> really<00:02:15.600> have<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.020> use<00:02:16.170> too<00:02:16.320> much

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
so i don't really have to use too much

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.980 
so i don't really have to use too much
products<00:02:16.950> on<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:18.060> maybe<00:02:18.300> after<00:02:18.780> those

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
products on it but maybe after those

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.520 
products on it but maybe after those
depending<00:02:19.560> on<00:02:19.680> how<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.670> know<00:02:21.170> how<00:02:22.170> big<00:02:22.350> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
depending on how you know how big it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.040 
depending on how you know how big it
gets<00:02:22.560> or<00:02:22.890> whatnot<00:02:23.160> um<00:02:23.760> perhaps<00:02:24.300> i<00:02:24.630> might<00:02:24.840> have

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
gets or whatnot um perhaps i might have

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.950
