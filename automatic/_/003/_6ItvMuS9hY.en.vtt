00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.460
 yes 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.090
 hi youtube i'm pete seeger and 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.100
 Welcome to the grenade guide here 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.780
 you will find the scope damage and other data 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.119
 more about all the bleachers of the game 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.150
 even non-lethal ones without saying more 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.529
 let's start at the beginning with the ms 67 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.080
 what is the grenade that gets the 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.960
 principle of this they only have one and 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.390
 his damage is the highest among all 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.610
 grenades with 112 points of damage inside 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.530
 of the first 1.5 meters of the 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.239
 explosion coming out of there low little to 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.920
 little damage but it's still 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.449
 a death of a single in a single 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.700
 explosion within the first 2 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.890
 meters and the whole explosion finishes after 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.260
 seven meters you can throw the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.970
 about 35 meters is the same as 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.090
 all the other grenades except 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.410
 the mini with a moderate reach this 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.420
 grenade regardless of whether it 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.910
 crash with something will not explode after 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.559
 of 3 seconds after being released more 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.989
 that there is nothing to remember this grenade 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.570
 as the most damaging and the basic 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.850
 then we will go to the 40 mini that 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.710
 extend those 3 these grenades 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.540
 statistically they are less affected by 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.159
 gravity so to speak and that's why 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.850
 that can launch the more or less 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.580
 about 45 meters at a 45 degree angle 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.119
 is low it actually has 60 points of 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.920
 damage within 2.5 to 3 meters 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.680
 approximately is when he does that damage 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.840
 a maximum of 60 points and after that 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.880
 begins to fall gradually to 7 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.380
 meters where it does not do any harm 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.390
 It is also noticeable that some 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.820
 non-explosive elements of the map as 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.740
 are the terraces are not affected by 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.420
 this grenade for the little damage this 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.909
 Granada will explode independently of 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.340
 that makes contact or not after 2.75 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.470
 seconds what does that also if the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.060
 they are going to throw further obviously 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.460
 that little time of explosion the most 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.659
 probable is that it reaches the opponent 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.950
 exactly when it's exploding by 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.830
 what could sometimes seem to be more 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.530
 surprise that the ms 67 after we can 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.119
 move to the impact rg about 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.679
 this grenade you can load a 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.840
 maximum of 2 and has a reach 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.490
 approximately 35 meters according to the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.409
 statistics although the experience 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.929
 own it might seem that it is even 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.019
 lower the throwing range where you calculated 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.190
 that are about 30 meters empirically 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.650
 this is different from pomegranates 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.410
 above will only explode after the 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.930
 impact no matter how much time passes 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.150
 in the air that both after the impact 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.700
 one tenth of a second or one second point 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.170
 then yes, if they throw it with panic 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.030
 towards the ground is the opponent who is 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.500
 two meters of you will not explode 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.969
 immediately after a point 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.450
 second but it takes a little longer 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:33.920
 approximately almost half a second in what 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.659
 particular considered that they should 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.299
 reduce the damage a little more since 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.670
 within the first 1.5 to 2 meters of 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.590
 the explosion does a maximum damage of 80 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.420
 meters and like the other grenades 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.099
 begins to lower its explosion until the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.829
 Explosion limit that is 7 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.599
 meters then we pass the weirdo or the 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.220
 I do not think that someone uses it 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.010
 in his right mind that is the 34 m 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.599
 incendiary here their damage is different already 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.209
 that is not an explosion as such but 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.519
 rather how much time the fire spends 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.370
 about you for every half second that 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.980
 pass will deal 10 damage a second 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.750
 it's 20 points of damage this grenade can 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.669
 be launched and until it makes an impact and 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.219
 it sits well on the floor pretty much 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:15.620
 after 1.5 seconds or 500 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:19.370
 milliseconds will explode and create a cloud 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.280
 that will last 3.5 seconds that cloud of 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.500
 fire has a radius of 3 meters if 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.980
 you approach it and reach 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.260
 burn 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.760
 little you fix up in flames though not 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.500
 are touching the fire for two 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.840
 seconds which means they were for 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.760
 at least 40 points of damage if you 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.769
 are left for some strange reason on the 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.700
 explosion there is no initial damage of the 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.069
 explosion as such 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.720
 only the fire that reaches them and 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.580
 some strange reason even though they are 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.830
 more than 5 seconds of continuous fire that 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.019
 could suffer only becomes a 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.549
 maximum of 90 points of damage though 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.900
 let's be honest who is going to stay in 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.370
 a cloud so long 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.290
 they can also throw it more or less 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.629
 about 35 meters like the others 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.400
 standard grenades and they only have the 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.049
 amount of one 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.690
 I understand that this has been done so 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.129
 bad because who would like that 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.480
 everything was covered fire by 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.859
 where you could not walk 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.840
 equally a popular question that 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.609
 it could appear is that if it goes out 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.470
 with water I leave them homework and for 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.640
 please leave me in the comments your 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.799
 discoveries 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.500
 then let's move on to a not mainly 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.199
 lethal that is the m 84 to read now 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.220
 it will do its maximum effect of both damage 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.750
 as flash 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.550
 if you are among the first 3 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.100
 meters of the explosion the damage that 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.870
 causes is 5 points although you can 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.000
 explode for example 4 or some ago 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.860
 other sources of explosives nearby 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.350
 it also depends if they are 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.120
 looking directly at the explosion of the 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.580
 granada to read now or if they are from 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.080
 back to it how is the effect so 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.170
 powerful or as minimal as it has been 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.210
 will last five seconds and half for 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.460
 your allies obviously with an effect 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.380
 totally diminished if you stun 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.060
 themselves is how to stun the 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.710
 opponent try to throw it when the 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.300
 enemy is seeing where they are going to 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.210
 throw the grenade like the others 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.250
 it does not explode until after almost 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.170
 half a second after he has 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.240
 contact with the ground as to 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.310
 amount can charge a maximum of three 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.110
 at the same time and in the end that effect 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.050
 leave a small smoke curtain that 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.780
 could be useful after we move to the 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.360
 that are nothing lethal that is the smoke and 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.760
 the flares the smoke m-18 has a 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.860
 damage obviously zero and your curtain is 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.190
 of approximately three to five meters 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.680
 radio for about five to six meters of 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.120
 height between more pomegranates 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.640
 of this type that they throw to a same place 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.650
 the smoke will be denser and in theory between 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.540
 denser the smoke you can not 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.000
 mark the enemies that are behind 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.050
 of her can throw a maximum of 35 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 meters as well as those of 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.509
 grenades including the mower and 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.620
 also explodes or activates after 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.569
 about half a second of that 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.550
 make contact with the ground a tactic 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.860
 good is to use vision measurements 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.080
 nightly or infrared and in that way 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.639
 can see through the smoke easily 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.409
 but for that you can also 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.690
 counteract that night vision with 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.340
 the flares that do not have much 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.129
 utility but they are great 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.400
 then the flares obviously their damage 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:09.860
 its radio is null because what matters is a 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.330
 Bengal is a light on the ground that is going to 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.430
 start very bright and it will go 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.020
 vanishing little by little can the 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.819
 throw a little more than the grenades 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.039
 conventional because the spear more 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:21.080
 strong to be a flare for some 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.569
 strange reason and has a more scope or 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.840
 less than 40 meters the duration that 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:28.550
 can see on screen is 90 seconds 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.379
 yes but that can only put three 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.180
 flares at the same time the first 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:34.610
 Bengal will disappear if you throw 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.500
 a fourth 90 seconds is a time 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.020
 long the maximum amount that can 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.729
 charge at the same time is 3 and it 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.139
 forgot to mention at the beginning of the video 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.600
 is that all these grenades look 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.430
 modified by specialization 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.950
 wood or any that includes the 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.230
 advantage of grenades increasing by one 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.660
 any of them could be useful 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.150
 to block night vision point 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.890
 objectives some vehicles for some 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.680
 reason if they expect it and in my 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.330
 experience I have not been able to light pastures 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.280
 or some other similar things and 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.110
 you can do it, let me know 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.580
 please while this was the guide more 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.680
 quick I can do about all 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.480
 the grenades available in banfield 4 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.250
 I hope it serves you that all these 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.840
 data will help you find the 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.790
 adequate grenade for each situation 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.260
 If you want this guide to be useful or 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.270
 could I serve someone else please 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.980

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.270
 subscribe to the channel if they are new by 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.190
 here so you never miss any 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.480
 video when it comes out and if you do not know if 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.770
 subscribe or can not review the 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.570
 other videos that I have to the channel so that 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.940
 facebook social networks are convinced 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:35.080
 and twitter is in the description and we 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.680
