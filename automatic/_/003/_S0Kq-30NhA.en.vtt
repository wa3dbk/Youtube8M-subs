use this battery as a standard in terms
of<00:00:35.610> cell<00:00:35.850> batteries<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.020> really

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
of cell batteries so it's really

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.930 
of cell batteries so it's really
interesting<00:00:37.530> because<00:00:37.829> CR<00:00:38.370> 2<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:38.610> 3<00:00:38.790> 2

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940

purchased for about $2 per battery which
can<00:00:49.289> get<00:00:49.559> expensive<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> lot<00:00:51.000> of

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
can get expensive if you have a lot of

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.180 
can get expensive if you have a lot of

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the downsides you might get them

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.520 
the downsides you might get them
confused

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
confused

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.590 
confused
but<00:01:16.860> they<00:01:16.979> are<00:01:17.280> rechargeable<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.420> say

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
but they are rechargeable and they say

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.039 
but they are rechargeable and they say

are Li feom ion rechargeable batteries
which<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.409> something<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.860> need<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.009> take

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
which is something that you need to take

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.670 
which is something that you need to take
note<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.490> instead<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.240> CR<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.380> on

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
note of instead of just CR and so on

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.200 
note of instead of just CR and so on
this<00:01:28.860> allows<00:01:29.040> devices<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.549> charged<00:01:29.970> back

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
this allows devices to be charged back

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.940 
this allows devices to be charged back
and<00:01:30.509> forth<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> compatible

makes it pretty easy to take and travel

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.580 
makes it pretty easy to take and travel
with<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.659> go<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.990> case<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.439> some

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
with you on the go in case you have some

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.130 
with you on the go in case you have some
cell<00:02:01.860> devices<00:02:02.729> jesuits<00:02:03.270> such<00:02:03.420> as<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> Wi-Fi

detector keychain that runs out of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.789 
detector keychain that runs out of
battery<00:02:05.909> pretty<00:02:06.149> fast<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.780> after<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> device

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
battery pretty fast so after the device

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.919 
battery pretty fast so after the device
are<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.610> know<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:09.030> turned<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:09.899> then

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
are you know is turned on you can then

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.240 
are you know is turned on you can then
quickly<00:02:10.920> use<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.550> by<00:02:11.910> putting<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.510> bad

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
quickly use it by putting the bad

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.800 
quickly use it by putting the bad
you<00:02:13.280> enter<00:02:13.610> these<00:02:13.760> two<00:02:13.970> compartments<00:02:14.630> to

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
you enter these two compartments to

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.780 
you enter these two compartments to
charge<00:02:15.140> them<00:02:15.410> back<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.250> actually<00:02:16.580> works

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
charge them back and that actually works

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.730 
charge them back and that actually works
pretty<00:02:16.910> well<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.540> for<00:02:17.960> example<00:02:18.350> if<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.530> want

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
pretty well so for example if you want

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.890 
pretty well so for example if you want
to<00:02:18.830> take<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.070> battery<00:02:19.550> out<00:02:19.580> right<00:02:20.210> now<00:02:20.360> from<00:02:20.750> the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
to take a battery out right now from the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.620 
to take a battery out right now from the
back<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.410> particular<00:02:21.920> unit<00:02:22.220> let<00:02:23.150> us<00:02:23.330> go

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
back of this particular unit let us go

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.300 
back of this particular unit let us go
and<00:02:23.870> do<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:26.200> by<00:02:27.200> taking<00:02:27.350> out<00:02:27.680> these<00:02:28.040> two

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
and do that by taking out these two

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.440 
and do that by taking out these two
batteries<00:02:30.430> we<00:02:31.430> can<00:02:31.580> then<00:02:31.730> take<00:02:31.970> these<00:02:32.270> two

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
batteries we can then take these two

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.390 
batteries we can then take these two
batteries<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.080> then<00:02:33.530> plot<00:02:33.770> them<00:02:33.950> into<00:02:34.280> these

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
batteries and then plot them into these

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.310 
batteries and then plot them into these
centers<00:02:34.790> over<00:02:35.000> here<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.930> can<00:02:36.050> see<00:02:36.290> a

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
centers over here and you can see a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.530 
centers over here and you can see a
faint<00:02:36.740> LED<00:02:37.160> lights<00:02:37.370> being<00:02:37.670> turned<00:02:37.730> on<00:02:38.209> and

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
faint LED lights being turned on and

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.840 
faint LED lights being turned on and
illuminated<00:02:39.140> which<00:02:39.650> tells<00:02:39.950> us<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.340> the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
illuminated which tells us that the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.270 
illuminated which tells us that the
battery<00:02:41.209> actually<00:02:41.390> has<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.720> charge<00:02:42.200> for<00:02:43.130> this

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
battery actually has a charge for this

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.720 
battery actually has a charge for this
particular<00:02:43.820> one<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:46.040> means<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.430> again

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
particular one and that means that again

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.420 
particular one and that means that again
we<00:02:46.940> can<00:02:47.090> either<00:02:47.630> plug<00:02:48.350> into<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.680> wall<00:02:48.739> or<00:02:49.100> test

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
we can either plug into a wall or test

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.250 
we can either plug into a wall or test
the<00:02:49.580> batteries<00:02:49.880> themselves<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.510> see<00:02:51.020> if<00:02:51.140> they

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
the batteries themselves and see if they

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.560 
the batteries themselves and see if they
have<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.440> charge<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.160> them<00:02:52.430> already<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.030> so

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
have a charge in them already and so

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.000 
have a charge in them already and so
again<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:53.959> can<00:02:54.020> put<00:02:54.080> them<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.500> here<00:02:54.530> we<00:02:54.860> see<00:02:54.980> a

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
again we can put them in here we see a

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.650 
again we can put them in here we see a
faint<00:02:55.340> red<00:02:55.520> charge<00:02:55.790> on<00:02:56.000> this<00:02:56.150> one<00:02:56.360> which<00:02:56.510> means

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
faint red charge on this one which means

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.390 
faint red charge on this one which means
there<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:56.989> a<00:02:57.020> little<00:02:57.290> bit<00:02:57.410> of<00:02:57.470> power<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.980> then

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
there is a little bit of power and then

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.770 
there is a little bit of power and then
we<00:02:58.520> can<00:02:58.610> also<00:02:58.730> plug<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.120> into<00:02:59.239> a<00:02:59.390> wall<00:02:59.540> to

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
we can also plug it into a wall to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.600 
we can also plug it into a wall to
directly<00:03:00.230> start<00:03:00.560> charging<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.130> particular

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
directly start charging this particular

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.090 
directly start charging this particular
battery<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.840> then<00:03:03.110> plug<00:03:03.350> additional<00:03:03.770> efforts

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
battery and then plug additional efforts

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.860 
battery and then plug additional efforts
done<00:03:04.280> it's<00:03:04.489> going<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.670> illuminate<00:03:05.060> green<00:03:05.300> and

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
done it's going to illuminate green and

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.510 
done it's going to illuminate green and
then<00:03:06.260> we<00:03:06.320> can<00:03:06.440> pluck<00:03:06.590> them<00:03:06.739> off<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.160> use<00:03:07.370> them

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
then we can pluck them off and use them

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.610 
then we can pluck them off and use them
again<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:07.880> again<00:03:08.239> again<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:09.140> cell<00:03:09.440> based
