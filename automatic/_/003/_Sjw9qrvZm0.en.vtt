 what is a program here 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.950
 probably the majority of users of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.140
 windows will have this program already the nero 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.510
 is not a program that comes with a 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.500
 computer that is installed in the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.840
 computer 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.149

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.740
 point of contact with milk and a 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.140
 doubt for my site 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.960
 the site's most punctuated posts 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.990
 Good day, come on, my step is 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.420
 insert the blank CD into the recorder 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.939
 from cd 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.640
 then open windows media player 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.520
 for those who do not have a shortcut look here 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.670
 then go in the digital locate field 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.049
 Windows 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.460
 I do not want to look for windows 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.460
 media player 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.500
 the media player that will happen to me 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.149
 You will have to do 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.829
 I'm is something else I'm 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.570
 using version 12 on windows media 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.320
 player then the case of you being 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:02.130
 different if 11 is the previous version 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.930
 with 11 will change some more things 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.580
 in general the elements are in the same 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.709
 local we are a bit in the visual part 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.240
 well you're going to put it in the guide now 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.000
 record here has three tabs 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.290
 play to synchronize only country in 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.290
 agre on the tab record then it will be 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.580
 need to add the songs in this 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.100
 area here just drag the items here 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.020
 I can drag and drop item by item or 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.150
 be music by music 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.970
 the songs we're going to have to take a 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.970
 computer in mp3 format 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.700
 so coming back here I can drag 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.030
 a song to see this or several of a 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:54.340
 Just to get easier, I would recommend 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.770
 before doing it from here the show 'about not 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.710
 is how you create a folder with the 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.710
 name may be the name you want 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.240
 in the case of dancing and within that folder 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.290
 put the songs you want 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.590
 record because the embassy do this 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.590
 here o 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:29.040
 I take the folder and drag it down a 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:30.760
 A little more here to get easier 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.970
 here o 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.610
 the folder almost music dealership 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.780
 previously drags into that area 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.950
 here the system already creates the list of 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.930
 University graduate 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.880
 another option I'll close the program 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.400
 to show how the other option does 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.650
 put again to record a 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.060
 another option is this one drag music 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:02.830
 musician think the first and the second 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.940
 third to fourth and was dragged to the 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.940
 selection of you there 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.320
 here is going to take the time of the disk 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:18.190
 usually it records 80 minutes of 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.190
 music will follow there 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:33.080
 add only from here 73 minutes of 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:34.790
 music from the general cd moves and here 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.370
 time passes from a cd 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.790
 it is already another disc two flights with 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.650
 this here to choose any song the 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.780
 procedure is simple click on it pink 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.230
 which was repeated curriculum tightening of the 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:52.010
 alerj to change the oil that the songs 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.560
 will appear on a CD my case that I am 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:05:02.800
 more than the first I want says the 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:02.800
 Master and I put hours of the day. 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:19.790
 drag and go to make me go up 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.980
 so make the order you want done 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.570
 to the order reminding you to delete 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.230
 some clinic for example I want 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.690
 this clinic near the made- to-order 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:33.590
 You're all okay, just click on the 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.420
 best record button on the Start button 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.640
 recording 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.640
 in my case it will give an error because 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.740
 You have no cd inserting recording but 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.200
 Yes, a dream from you, will grant 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.530
 all right inserted a blank cd 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.430
 recorded and take that initial moment to 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.410
 recording 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.890
 you follow the whole procedure of 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.890
 recording 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.660
 just close say this must have engraved 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.400
 a ready to listen on any cd 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:07.280
 dvd player or any device that 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.170
 able to play CDs 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.910
 this expectation of being understood has 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.570
 any doubt back video at 16 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:18.400
 again put a pass band pass 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.400
 to watch too closely
