up<00:02:35.360> they<00:02:35.480> give<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:36.610> it's<00:02:37.610> paradox<00:02:38.330> but<00:02:38.510> they

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
up they give you it's paradox but they

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.180 
up they give you it's paradox but they
don't<00:02:38.840> give<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.140> like<00:02:39.680> it<00:02:39.800> doesn't<00:02:40.070> have<00:02:40.160> the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190

around<00:02:42.490> here<00:02:42.790> but<00:02:43.630> yeah<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:45.340> board<00:02:45.610> top

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
around here but yeah this the board top

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.900 
around here but yeah this the board top
super<00:02:46.330> good<00:02:46.510> concave<00:02:47.080> um<00:02:47.500> it's<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.340> nice<00:02:48.550> clean

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
super good concave um it's a nice clean

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.050 
super good concave um it's a nice clean
graphic<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.660> they<00:02:49.870> have<00:02:50.130> it's<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.430> good<00:02:51.670> draft

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
graphic that they have it's a good draft
