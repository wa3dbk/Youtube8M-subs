00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.410 
hairpiece in order to duplicate human
hair<00:01:50.500> growth<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:51.369> hairline<00:01:51.760> is<00:01:51.940> never<00:01:52.299> a

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
hair growth the hairline is never a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.240 
hair growth the hairline is never a
straight<00:01:52.810> hairline<00:01:53.200> like<00:01:53.350> somebody<00:01:53.680> draw<00:01:54.190> it

straight hairline like somebody draw it
with<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.490> line<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:55.540> I<00:01:55.570> had<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.170> develop<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.860> lace

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
with a line so I had to develop a lace

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.640 
with a line so I had to develop a lace
where<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.790> hair<00:01:58.060> comes<00:01:58.330> out<00:01:58.510> not<00:01:59.380> in<00:01:59.530> a

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
where the hair comes out not in a

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.550 
where the hair comes out not in a
straight<00:01:59.920> line<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.490> very<00:02:01.420> fine<00:02:01.840> in<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.260> front

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
straight line and very fine in the front

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.920 
straight line and very fine in the front
so<00:02:02.830> when<00:02:03.130> people<00:02:03.430> look<00:02:03.580> at<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:03.790> close<00:02:04.060> it

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
so when people look at you close it

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.440 
so when people look at you close it
doesn't<00:02:05.619> look<00:02:05.740> like<00:02:05.950> it's<00:02:06.790> a<00:02:06.909> hairpiece<00:02:07.119> and

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
doesn't look like it's a hairpiece and

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.320 
doesn't look like it's a hairpiece and
plus<00:02:08.290> when<00:02:09.100> people<00:02:09.489> look<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.940> back<00:02:10.149> of

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
plus when people look in the back of

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.030 
plus when people look in the back of
your<00:02:10.450> head<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.810> seeing<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.350> bunch<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:11.799> hair

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
your head and seeing a bunch of hair

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.250 
your head and seeing a bunch of hair
coming<00:02:12.430> on<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.760> lace<00:02:13.000> or<00:02:13.390> something<00:02:14.170> that

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
coming on the lace or something that

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.110 
coming on the lace or something that
look<00:02:14.410> like<00:02:14.530> chicken<00:02:14.920> wire<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.700> doesn't<00:02:16.030> look

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
look like chicken wire that doesn't look

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.210 
look like chicken wire that doesn't look
natural<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.600> me<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.049> I<00:02:17.080> had<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.440> develop<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.920> skin

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220

lightweight is it flexible maybe tell us

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.210 
lightweight is it flexible maybe tell us
a<00:04:30.690> little<00:04:30.780> bit<00:04:30.990> about<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.440> they're<00:04:32.070> going<00:04:32.160> to

a little bit about that they're going to

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.880 
a little bit about that they're going to
think<00:04:32.280> about<00:04:32.550> those<00:04:32.760> this<00:04:33.210> system<00:04:33.740> when<00:04:34.740> you

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
think about those this system when you

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.590 
think about those this system when you
put<00:04:35.370> your<00:04:35.520> finger<00:04:35.790> through<00:04:35.820> them<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.390> feels

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
put your finger through them it feels

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.650 
put your finger through them it feels
like<00:04:36.840> your<00:04:36.990> own<00:04:37.110> skin<00:04:38.060> so<00:04:39.060> when<00:04:39.240> people<00:04:39.510> run

like<00:04:42.150> your<00:04:42.270> own<00:04:42.300> skin<00:04:42.570> because<00:04:43.170> I<00:04:43.320> got<00:04:43.530> the

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
like your own skin because I got the

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.550 
head right and also the good thing about
this<00:04:55.500> system<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:56.100> it's<00:04:56.940> transparent<00:04:57.600> so

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
this system is it's transparent so

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.690 
this system is it's transparent so
whatever<00:04:58.890> color<00:04:59.270> you<00:05:00.270> have<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:01.830> know<00:05:01.980> of<00:05:02.220> skin

natural hair or the gone hair we develop

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.960 
natural hair or the gone hair we develop
a<00:05:17.220> system<00:05:17.420> with<00:05:18.420> human<00:05:18.780> hair<00:05:18.960> that<00:05:18.990> never<00:05:19.410> been

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
a system with human hair that never been

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.580 
a system with human hair that never been
processed<00:05:20.970> this<00:05:21.540> is<00:05:21.750> a<00:05:21.780> virgin<00:05:22.260> hair<00:05:22.410> that

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
processed this is a virgin hair that

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.590 
processed this is a virgin hair that
never<00:05:22.740> be<00:05:22.890> prosecuted<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:24.030> minute<00:05:24.300> you<00:05:24.390> stop

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
never be prosecuted the minute you stop

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.719 
never be prosecuted the minute you stop
processing<00:05:25.140> you<00:05:25.380> and

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
processing you and

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.559 
processing you and
it<00:05:26.689> would<00:05:26.809> be<00:05:26.990> dry<00:05:27.289> and<00:05:27.650> tangled<00:05:28.430> this<00:05:29.389> is<00:05:29.539> a

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569 
it would be dry and tangled this is a

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.420 
it would be dry and tangled this is a
virgin<00:05:29.990> hair<00:05:30.169> that<00:05:30.409> never<00:05:30.589> been<00:05:30.800> processed<00:05:31.279> so

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
virgin hair that never been processed so

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.420 
virgin hair that never been processed so
you<00:05:31.639> can<00:05:31.819> use<00:05:32.389> any<00:05:32.689> shampoo<00:05:33.229> I<00:05:33.710> would

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
you can use any shampoo I would

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.969 
you can use any shampoo I would
recommend<00:05:34.939> maybe<00:05:35.439> shampoo<00:05:36.439> with<00:05:36.589> less

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
recommend maybe shampoo with less

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.829 
recommend maybe shampoo with less
chemicals<00:05:37.430> so<00:05:37.580> the<00:05:37.819> system<00:05:38.150> would<00:05:38.210> last<00:05:38.389> a<00:05:38.629> lot

00:05:38.829 --> 00:05:38.839 
chemicals so the system would last a lot

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.369 
chemicals so the system would last a lot
longer<00:05:38.900> than<00:05:39.499> how<00:05:40.099> long<00:05:40.279> are<00:05:40.460> they<00:05:40.669> last

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:41.379 
longer than how long are they last

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:43.600 
longer than how long are they last
system<00:05:42.379> usually<00:05:42.710> if<00:05:42.830> you<00:05:42.979> take<00:05:43.159> care<00:05:43.400> of<00:05:43.490> him

system usually if you take care of him
that<00:05:43.789> could<00:05:43.939> last<00:05:44.089> anywhere<00:05:44.300> between<00:05:44.569> six

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
that could last anywhere between six
