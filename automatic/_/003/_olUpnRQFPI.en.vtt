00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.710
 all the Spanish people 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.590
 taxes in Spain has gone up two points 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.060
 but those who earn the most have paid 100 billion less 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.760
 to the majority Aznar does not come out expensive but also budgetary 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.580
 all efforts necessary to improve the quality of teaching 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.089
 evidently now and 25 thousand university scholarships less 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:43.630
 that four years ago 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.350
 to aznar there classes and classes we believe the wealth we can distribute that is what

 purchasing power with the right you know you always win the same we are 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.730
 growing more than double 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.010
 other European countries 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.910

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.390
 Spain has descended to the last place of the European Union 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.280
 You can not fall lower 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.120
 we can not continue with a right-wing president who lies is far from the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.280
 ideas and the interests of the majority 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.440
 who only wants to increase his power while qualifying for Spain 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.680

 a president is solid and reliable 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.070

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.770
 all Spanish and Spanish 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.680
