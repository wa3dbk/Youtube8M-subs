00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.370
 Hello, I want to tell you about 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.490
 basics of picking 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.150
 and finger positioning on indian 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.779
 flutes 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.890
 yes indian is it ban quarrel and so on 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.369
 about sound or 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.560
 his extraction here we have an ear cushion 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:28.810
 such a large slightly oval 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:32.100
 hole for a start to learn 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.870
 correctly retrieve and 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.780
 more or less achieve more me cleaner 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.540
 sound we won't cover your fingers and 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.730
 fingers and holes just learn and 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.330
 blowing the right sound for this what 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:52.420
 we need to present when 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:56.369
 flute pipes like that deploy it here 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.650
 so it is done in order to 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:02.220
 determine with lips exactly the center of the hole 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.460
 when we blow we blow on 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.450
 opposite edge of the hole is she 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.450
 acute with us and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:19.590
 the air get in here cut through due 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:22.140
 it turns out the sound from the hands up first 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.069
 we do not close but just learn 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.509
 blowing grandfather we do you can come to 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.740
 mirror and see what we have 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.060
 the hole is formed because we are so 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.000
 we may not feel first 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.789
 just blow how tea feel the studios 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.810
 something else so slightly as if doing 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:48.479
 a smile is not very straining lips 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.560
 a little bit their stretching and then we will 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.009
 minimum spend air and maximum 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.939
 achieve the frequency of the sound he watch 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:02.149
 hear I identified the center pushed here 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.149
 and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.990
 and here it sounds to me if you all did 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.580
 as I said, but still did not work 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.010
 tooth we try type 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.410
 and find a clear sound like this 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.620
 way check turning the flute on 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.620
 I scroll chest akulinu on his save and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.600
 when heard so fix and 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 train 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.379
 here 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.680
 it concerns the first octave from the second 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:57.010
 octaves a little harder because well this 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.340
 only later will be exploring the possibility of 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.249
 take a video about it there need to double 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.129
 blow harder and more stretch 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:08.650
 this clown smile like this 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:12.159
 achieve maximum concentration and 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.459
 accuracy and airflow i will now say 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.489
 a couple of words she's putting fingers 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.669
 initially and before the exchanges the flute would be desirable 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:26.290
 close it with slippers 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:30.189
 you can you 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.980
 do and so but here it is the technique 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:35.889
 putting her fingers on principle is possible 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.319
 but it does not allow to achieve and 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:41.019
 technical moments in the game she can 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.719
 as if holding down movement and you ca n't 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.120
 open and and quickly open and quickly 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.609
 close here is the last hole here 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.009
 and there is still more or less that's left hand 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:57.310
 especially because traditionally staging 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:04:01.419
 hands like this done at the finger rests 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.909
 here here and the bows are closed 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.939
 phalanxes of the middle part of here 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.129
 index average so the middle part 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:13.620
 both land but it already turns out 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:20.370
 pad here and here and so 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:26.490
 respectively right hand so so and 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:29.949
 played trucks what else I want to say that 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.699
 this moment is very important 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.550
 staging 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:38.330
 because you need to feel very 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:44.330
 strongly holes holes and but with time 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:46.790
 especially we will come and if they are minimal 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.240
 and that's about myself slits appear if 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.520
 you for sure 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.090
 unless you close very so plump 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.700
 this is all holes titan the force of the hole 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.450
 how and what generally use or three 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.000
 or and love or all 6 yes well it will not 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.440
 get the sound it will be this type 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.920
 error you just will not work 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.320
 because if you blow and feel that 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.240
 different that does not work then look for 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.470
 The problem is that somewhere looking here 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.160
 preferably initially when you study 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:26.540
 just like that nut Kate said first 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:29.090
 just let the sound then set 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.620
 the correct setting of the fingers will 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.420
 a little boil because you need more 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.440
 a little stretching we need a flute not 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:40.400
 the smallest flutes like that 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.150
 and then one hole at a time 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.150
 sound is extracted 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
 but 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.009
 Well, I think he said to start it 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.370
 enough or enough well naturally what 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:18.380
 need preferably before playing there and so 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.229
 have free time stretch your fingers 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.910
 stretch them a little bit because it's not 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.880
 and diagonal pasting how when 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.789
 especially stretching is not necessary transverse where 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:32.320
 need to substitute fingers and 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:34.820
 to not have the flexibility and move and 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:40.940
 closes the screen open and still say 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:43.460
 a few words about what moments of the game 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.979
 happen to be taking halftones 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.800
 on this flute slider taken floor 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:49.340
 opening at any of the holes 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.060
 turns out and 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:56.000
 for example now listen as determined 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.870
 one note and hopping with 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.870
 half tone to tone 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.410
 but 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:13.440
 this is done a little while opening 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:16.990
 like and or play this sound effect 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.130
 which is also traditional for this type 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.760
 flute and 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:24.490
 given to indian music which is played 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.720
 Well, thank you for such years. 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.720
 attention to all bye
