just lower their perks down on the
second<00:03:48.020> mark<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.440> evening<00:03:48.860> it's<00:03:49.190> 10<00:03:49.520> to<00:03:49.700> 11

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.279 
the perk and just peck at it and you
looked<00:05:37.759> it<00:05:37.940> just<00:05:38.150> does<00:05:38.569> this<00:05:38.779> this<00:05:38.990> in<00:05:39.139> this

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
looked it just does this this in this

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.930 
looked it just does this this in this
and<00:05:39.620> then<00:05:39.770> all<00:05:39.860> of<00:05:40.159> a<00:05:40.250> sudden<00:05:40.490> it<00:05:40.550> will<00:05:40.639> go<00:05:40.759> and

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
and then all of a sudden it will go and

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.490 
and then all of a sudden it will go and
other<00:05:41.090> times<00:05:41.389> they'll<00:05:41.569> just<00:05:41.750> grab<00:05:42.080> it<00:05:42.110> and<00:05:42.259> run

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
other times they'll just grab it and run

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.029 
other times they'll just grab it and run
so<00:05:43.460> you<00:05:43.580> really<00:05:43.849> don't<00:05:43.969> know<00:05:44.210> what<00:05:44.419> to<00:05:44.449> expect

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
so you really don't know what to expect

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.409 
so you really don't know what to expect
