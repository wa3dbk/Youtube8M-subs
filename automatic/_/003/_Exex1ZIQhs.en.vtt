00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
side of the fabric and place it so

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.020 
side of the fabric and place it so
you've<00:00:49.890> got<00:00:50.010> enough<00:00:50.280> turning<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> way

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you've got enough turning all the way

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.000 
you've got enough turning all the way
around<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> edge<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.110> pin<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.440> in

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
around the edge and then you pin it in

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.000 
around the edge and then you pin it in
the<00:00:53.190> center<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:53.870> secure<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.050> now<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.800> always

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the center just secure that now I always

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.060 
the center just secure that now I always
make<00:00:56.340> sure<00:00:56.570> that<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.840> get<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.410> grain<00:00:58.710> running

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
make sure that I get the grain running

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.860 
make sure that I get the grain running
in<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> right<00:00:59.579> direction<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> grain<00:01:00.690> of

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
in the right direction so the grain of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.410 
in the right direction so the grain of
the<00:01:00.899> fabric<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.859> actually<00:01:02.219> aligned<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the fabric is actually aligned with the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.500 
the fabric is actually aligned with the
edge<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> want<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.489> my<00:01:06.920> pattern<00:01:07.920> piece

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
edge that I want on my pattern piece

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.570 
edge that I want on my pattern piece
you're<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.780> start<00:01:10.080> near<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:11.220> corner

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
you're going to start near one corner

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.090 
you're going to start near one corner
some<00:01:11.990> patterns<00:01:12.990> actually<00:01:13.170> require<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.920> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
some patterns actually require that you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.370 
some patterns actually require that you
start<00:01:14.549> stitching<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> middle<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:15.750> in

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
start stitching in the middle but in

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
start stitching in the middle but in
this<00:01:16.530> case<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:16.950> putting<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.820> through

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
this case I'm just putting it through

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.530 
this case I'm just putting it through
