00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.770
 hello very good everyone I'm a blacksmith and 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.450
 let's do a tutorial he has 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.280
 asked for a subscriber that did not get 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.170
 install the kraft signature mold 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.789
 so well I'm going to do it despite 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.550
 that is enough to facilitate the web in the 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.350
 wiki such but good as it is in English 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.940
 I will do it myself from the beginning as 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.020
 it would be done and so you see it so good what 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.310
 first thing you have to do is go to the 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.020
 wiki of the mod this would be the page of 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.210
 the download I'm going to give you back already 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.250
 you will arrive here giving him here enter signature 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.470
 dotcom wiki bar main page 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.840
 you come to the wiki the way I will leave you 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.270
 the link in the description and you have it already 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.500
 in other descriptions you go here where 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.500
 install installation guide 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.070

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.420
 the links and everything you need to 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.690
 Although it is the I will also leave them in the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.309
 description to install it before 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.199
 nothing I would like to say that this is for 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.059
 premium accounts or accounts that 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.170
 you have against bought the license of 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.640
 minecraft if you do not have it I do not know if it 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.909
 can do so or will have to do it from 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.580
 another way I have no idea I'm worth the 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.170
 I really have to buy and I tried 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.030
 minecraft without buying the license and 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.450
 when I saw that I like it and such a 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.219
 I bought then 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.219
 ok I just came out this why 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.670
 I'm going to give it here and then we'll see what 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.369
 Well, what I bought it, I have the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.250
 legal license and all that so I do not know 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.380
 if we do a little research it is 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.200
 Google 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.869
 It is worth everything here as I have 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.909
 said so good let's start 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.799
 from the beginning we have to go to the 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.009
 minecraft launcher ok we booted the 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.009
 launcher 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.570
 to see if it starts 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.380
 and here I have 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.740
 and minecraft launcher and you have to go 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.500
 to your launch profile in our 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.110
 profile of 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.870
 of your minecraft account you give to 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:19.820
 profile and this is where you put your version 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.260
 selection eyes 1.6 point 2 ok I do not 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.560

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.760

 Y 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.980
 and start is the game worth 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.080
 once you start it and all the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.720
 necessary folders with which once 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.790
 is already the typical entry of 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.250
 minecraft play I do not know what I do not know how many 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.330

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.090
 next vale 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.550
 then we go to the page where 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.390
 we were here and we come where he puts 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.550
 download to install minecraft force 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.930
 this is necessary before the mortal and 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.230
 install the forge 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.060
 then I'll leave the link of this 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.280
 this download but good if you come here 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.030
 what you have here where it says to speak the 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.370
 selection eyes 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.849
 ok you give to download 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.319
 where you download jce and once you have it 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.599
 from here or from where you get off 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.340
 depends on the best q 6 etcetera initial 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:27.000
 it's the heart point 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.709
 to see if it starts is the option of the point 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.810
 heart and you give urges to the client you mark 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:38.810
 this option neither this nor this one 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.790
 and you put the path of your more folder 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.330

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:48.319
 and all that where you have it 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.370
 give to accept and then start 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.190
 I will not put because I already have it 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.750

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:02.360
 the wiki page you give to ok and now 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.630
 you have it perfect then you come here and 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.769

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.700
 I have it started but you 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.930
 closed london you start it and there will be 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.500
 created a new profile called 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:19.150
 forza vale you already have it perfectly 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.570
 then you start it again 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.509
 yeah good put the data that you ask what 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.150
 we start and once we have started 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.289
 minecraft we can close it again it's worth 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.600
 we have already created the archives 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.150
 necessary for the forge 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.520
 and well let's go there the last thing that is 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.260
 mode installation we come here where 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.230
 put table so install land firm 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.640

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.890
 Click on this link that I will also 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:50.980
 in the description worth and download is what 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.480
 what comes out is worth it comes out this will take 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.790
 a ratillo to me it took me now a 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.330
 I canceled it because I already have it 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.240
 Discharged 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.419
 and you are already downloaded it once ye 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.870
 you have to go to the page to the folder 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:09.110
 where are you download in the archives 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:13.490
 copy this this file is worth 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:16.759
 decompress it very important is worth it and we 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.090
 let's go to the page from point to that 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:23.060
 minecraft point that I already have here 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.710
 ok we come to point minecraft and here 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.740
 inside we select the folder mods 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.729
 As you can see , I have already put it on and 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.120
 is then installed by jce 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.400
 you put it 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.710
 Now I can not give to play because 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.940
 You sing, I do not recognize the little window 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.699
 of minecraft is worth then can not 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.590
 teach what but you would give to play 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.000
 with the profile force always very 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.470
 important whenever you are going to start 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.090
 the mod with the force profile 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.090
 fuck me out again this 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.110
 the truth I have no fucking idea that 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.110
 is this error 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.820
 ok i'm going to give you to change the 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:07.660
 configuration here is 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.520
 and I'll change something good and it's worth 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.000
 Well what you said start with the profile 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.090
 because we always went to where once 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.370
 we start where you put mods is it worth to us 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.980
 comes out nothing more than the typical little window 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.520
 play options and then there you have monts 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.220
 ok and we should leave something like this 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.100
 what we have here 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.570
 ok well then once I have done already 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.790
 had installed can play ground 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.530
 signature kraft I hope it has served you 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.960
 It was a short video if I did not 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:40.300
 I mistake a very short tutorial 6 minutes 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.389
 does not have much loss and the truth is that 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:47.590
 with the guide here on the wiki I did it 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:49.569
 right away but good I know what I 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.310
 I asked for a subscriber and as I have 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.259
 I ask, I also do not have any 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.389
 tutor on the internet in Spanish if I do not 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.230
 I 'm wrong so I probably know 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:07:00.380
 I sent 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.210
 to the owners of the way to see if sneaks 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.780
 ok it's not hanging the point folder 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:08.690
 minecraft because if I'm not wrong 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.370
 you have to give the downloads of which 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.640
 he has hung it up because I do not know if 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:16.130
 will have something to make money with 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.200
 downloads or whatever I know are their 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.850
 links I do not want to upload is the folder 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.340
 minecraft point that you have to download 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:25.040
 the links of the official website of the world 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.340
 It's worth if one day you have a problem already 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.510
 you know barrero videos I'm on youtube 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:34.280

 comments and so on, I think it's 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:45.889
 pretty clear that between the tutorial 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.300
 I've done and that you are going to support 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:50.060
 pretty good and you can install it but 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:52.370
 well, doubts always arise and there are things 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.090
 that is not easy for everyone 

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.440
