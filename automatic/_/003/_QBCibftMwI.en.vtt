Ball<00:01:03.640> Z<00:01:03.670> title<00:01:04.330> that<00:01:04.900> they<00:01:05.260> are<00:01:05.590> hopefully

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220

going to announce and release by the end

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.460 
going to announce and release by the end
of<00:01:08.799> this<00:01:09.070> year<00:01:09.310> now<00:01:10.180> already<00:01:10.960> being<00:01:11.140> halfway

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
of this year now already being halfway

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.490 
of this year now already being halfway
through<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:11.979> year<00:01:12.010> I<00:01:12.720> think<00:01:13.720> that<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:14.260> would

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
through the year I think that this would

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.020 
through the year I think that this would
be<00:01:14.530> around<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.250> time<00:01:15.490> that<00:01:15.520> they<00:01:15.850> would

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
be around the time that they would

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.740 
be around the time that they would
announce<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.750> new<00:01:16.780> dragon<00:01:17.680> ball<00:01:17.829> game<00:01:18.570> I'm<00:01:19.570> not

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
announce a new dragon ball game I'm not

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.690

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
sure when they announced previous dragon

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.850 
sure when they announced previous dragon
ball<00:01:21.820> games<00:01:22.090> in<00:01:22.509> amongst<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.409> years<00:01:23.680> before

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
game but we can only assume that another

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
under 3 or something like that the

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.170 
under 3 or something like that the

so<00:04:02.330> I'm<00:04:02.390> so<00:04:02.600> assuming<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:03.049> it's<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.410> four

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
so I'm so assuming that it's the four

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.360 
so I'm so assuming that it's the four
days<00:04:04.250> from<00:04:05.090> Japan<00:04:05.510> time<00:04:05.780> I'm<00:04:05.989> not<00:04:06.110> quite<00:04:06.320> sure

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
days from Japan time I'm not quite sure

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.979

what<00:04:07.370> time<00:04:07.790> zone<00:04:07.820> they're<00:04:08.330> on<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:08.720> should

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
what time zone they're on I should

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.310 
what time zone they're on I should
probably<00:04:09.110> have<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.799> look<00:04:10.060> but<00:04:11.060> yeah<00:04:11.870> if<00:04:12.080> it's<00:04:12.230> a

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
probably have a look but yeah if it's a

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.070 
probably have a look but yeah if it's a
