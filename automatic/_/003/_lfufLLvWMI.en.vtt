political<00:01:23.909> thing<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> time

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.530 

yeah<00:01:29.310> that's<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.850> guess<00:01:30.060> that's<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.420> we're<00:01:30.509> up

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
yeah that's I guess that's what we're up

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.030 
yeah that's I guess that's what we're up
against<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.079> are<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> lot<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.380> people<00:01:31.770> who

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
against there are a lot of people who

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.410 
against there are a lot of people who
just<00:01:32.280> don't<00:01:32.460> think<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.880> animals<00:01:33.119> have

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
just don't think that animals have

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.620 
just don't think that animals have
feelings<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.579> or<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.970> they're<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.270> smart

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
feelings and or that they're not smart

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.450 
feelings and or that they're not smart
like<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.079> has<00:01:37.409> some<00:01:37.649> basis<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.159> how<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.369> treat

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
like that has some basis on how we treat

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
like that has some basis on how we treat
something<00:01:38.909> because<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.990> was<00:01:40.619> then

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
something because if it if it was then

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.190 
something because if it if it was then
we<00:01:41.250> would<00:01:41.399> treat<00:01:41.850> some<00:01:42.090> people<00:01:42.119> badly<00:01:42.630> too

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
we would treat some people badly too

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.029 
we would treat some people badly too
because<00:01:43.679> they're<00:01:43.860> stupid<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.950> don't<00:01:46.950> know
