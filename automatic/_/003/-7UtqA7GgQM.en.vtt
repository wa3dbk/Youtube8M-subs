i<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> keep<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.240> view<00:01:45.509> count<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.439> my

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
i like to keep the view count up on my

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.880 
i like to keep the view count up on my
videos<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.610> my<00:01:47.759> main<00:01:47.970> channel<00:01:48.000> how<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.570> know

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
videos on my main channel how to know

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.260 
videos on my main channel how to know
just<00:01:49.890> how<00:01:49.979> i<00:01:50.070> roll

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.150 

and<00:01:56.270> I<00:01:56.840> think<00:01:57.080> this<00:01:57.200> battle<00:01:57.500> is<00:01:57.590> almost<00:01:57.770> over

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
and I think this battle is almost over

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.780 
and I think this battle is almost over
actually<00:01:58.670> these<00:01:59.030> are<00:01:59.090> quite<00:01:59.750> short<00:02:00.440> I<00:02:00.790> don't

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
actually these are quite short I don't

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.250 
actually these are quite short I don't
know<00:02:01.850> I<00:02:02.120> guess<00:02:02.450> it's<00:02:02.810> better<00:02:02.990> than<00:02:03.110> having

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
know I guess it's better than having

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.290 
know I guess it's better than having
like<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.590> really<00:02:03.830> long<00:02:04.250> video<00:02:04.550> just<00:02:05.090> a

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
like a really long video just a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.750 
like a really long video just a
three-on-three<00:02:06.520> little<00:02:07.520> mini<00:02:07.970> battle<00:02:08.450> oh<00:02:08.630> yes
