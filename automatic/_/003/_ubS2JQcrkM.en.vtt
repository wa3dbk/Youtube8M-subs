00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
down that's the proper way to reinstall

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.010 
down that's the proper way to reinstall
if<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:12.730> start<00:02:12.970> at<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> bottom<00:02:13.330> hinge<00:02:13.750> you're

fighting<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.680> middle<00:02:14.980> hinge<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.580> top

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
fighting the middle hinge and the top

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.680

hinge<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.819> just<00:02:19.000> doesn't<00:02:19.270> work<00:02:19.330> as<00:02:19.510> easy

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
hinge and it just doesn't work as easy

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.470 
hinge and it just doesn't work as easy
now<00:02:19.989> you<00:02:20.020> just<00:02:20.349> tap<00:02:20.530> those<00:02:20.739> into<00:02:21.010> place

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
now you just tap those into place

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.460 
now you just tap those into place
tastes<00:02:23.480> an<00:02:23.630> easy<00:02:25.780> try<00:02:26.780> not<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.020> hit<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.260> door

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470
