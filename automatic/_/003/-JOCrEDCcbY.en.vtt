clear<00:00:26.699> makes<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.090> think<00:00:27.240> three<00:00:27.449> or<00:00:27.480> four<00:00:27.779> of

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
clear makes it think three or four of

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.230 
clear makes it think three or four of
these<00:00:28.050> different<00:00:28.349> colors<00:00:28.800> there's<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:29.760> which

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
these different colors there's one which

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.670 
these different colors there's one which
is<00:00:30.269> um<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:31.769> blue<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.579> think<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.210> anti

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
is um it's blue and I think that is anti

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.229 
is um it's blue and I think that is anti
oxidizing<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.399> kind<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.640> takes<00:00:35.820> away<00:00:35.910> all<00:00:36.030> your

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
oxidizing so kind of takes away all your

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.690 
oxidizing so kind of takes away all your
dirt<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.630> grime<00:00:36.899> there's<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.219> there's<00:00:38.640> an

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
dirt and grime there's a there's an

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.549 
dirt and grime there's a there's an
orangish<00:00:39.300> red<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.140> they<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:40.290> basically

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
orangish red one and they all basically

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.590 
orangish red one and they all basically
do<00:00:40.860> different<00:00:41.190> things<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.300> reason<00:00:42.540> i

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.110 
all your oil will not have to go through
a<00:03:31.300> couple<00:03:31.540> of<00:03:31.810> barriers<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.680> get<00:03:32.980> out<00:03:33.130> right<00:03:33.460> so

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
a couple of barriers to get out right so

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.840 
a couple of barriers to get out right so
we've<00:03:34.210> already<00:03:34.330> got<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.780> oil<00:03:34.810> control<00:03:35.170> ocean

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
we've already got the oil control ocean

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.610 
we've already got the oil control ocean
we've<00:03:36.850> got<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.150> matte<00:03:37.330> cream<00:03:37.720> now<00:03:38.320> we've<00:03:38.470> got

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
we've got the matte cream now we've got

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.230 
we've got the matte cream now we've got
this<00:03:38.860> oh<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.610> first<00:03:39.790> step<00:03:39.970> we've<00:03:40.090> got

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
this oh and the first step we've got

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.240 
this oh and the first step we've got
this<00:03:40.390> too<00:03:40.630> so<00:03:41.320> it<00:03:41.440> has<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.590> go<00:03:41.800> through<00:03:41.830> four

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
this too so it has to go through four

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.270 
this too so it has to go through four
barriers<00:03:42.760> to<00:03:42.790> come<00:03:43.150> out<00:03:43.360> so<00:03:43.800> this<00:03:44.800> is<00:03:44.830> amazing

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
barriers to come out so this is amazing

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.820 
barriers to come out so this is amazing
only<00:03:45.820> for<00:03:46.000> very<00:03:46.120> very<00:03:46.300> oily<00:03:46.750> skin<00:03:47.200> or<00:03:47.470> if<00:03:47.710> you

no matter what you do to your skin if
you<00:04:49.900> have<00:04:50.050> oily<00:04:50.260> skin<00:04:50.410> your<00:04:50.890> oil<00:04:51.070> will<00:04:51.280> come

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
you have oily skin your oil will come

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.210 
you have oily skin your oil will come
out<00:04:51.550> at<00:04:51.670> some<00:04:51.700> point<00:04:52.120> but<00:04:52.810> this<00:04:53.110> only<00:04:53.560> helps<00:04:53.890> to

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
out at some point but this only helps to

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.450 
out at some point but this only helps to
come<00:04:54.370> out<00:04:54.490> a<00:04:54.520> little<00:04:54.610> bit<00:04:54.790> later<00:04:55.890> so<00:04:56.890> after

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
come out a little bit later so after

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.880 
come out a little bit later so after
five<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:58.330> seven<00:04:58.540> hours<00:04:58.660> maybe<00:04:59.200> nine<00:04:59.470> for<00:04:59.770> some

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
five to seven hours maybe nine for some

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.950 
five to seven hours maybe nine for some
of<00:05:00.040> you<00:05:00.190> your<00:05:00.730> oil<00:05:00.910> will<00:05:01.180> start<00:05:01.420> to<00:05:01.510> reappear

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
of you your oil will start to reappear

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.920 
of you your oil will start to reappear
so<00:05:02.230> then<00:05:02.350> what<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:02.530> do<00:05:02.650> is<00:05:02.800> I<00:05:03.430> use<00:05:03.880> my<00:05:04.450> matte

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
so then what I do is I use my matte

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.790 
so then what I do is I use my matte
black<00:05:05.290> powder<00:05:05.790> no<00:05:06.790> just<00:05:07.000> this<00:05:07.150> I<00:05:07.450> think<00:05:08.320> they

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
black powder no just this I think they

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.530 
black powder no just this I think they
have<00:05:08.830> four<00:05:09.250> different<00:05:09.430> colors<00:05:09.760> but<00:05:09.970> you<00:05:10.390> can

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
have four different colors but you can

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.510 
have four different colors but you can
honestly<00:05:10.660> use<00:05:11.080> any<00:05:11.350> color<00:05:11.650> because<00:05:12.040> these<00:05:12.340> are

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
honestly use any color because these are

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.130 
honestly use any color because these are
not<00:05:12.730> very<00:05:12.970> pigmented<00:05:13.420> and<00:05:13.750> therefore

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
not very pigmented and therefore

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.110 
not very pigmented and therefore
