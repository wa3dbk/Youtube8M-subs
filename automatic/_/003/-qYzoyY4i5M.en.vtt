00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.489
 sweet la espumita is a dessert 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.000
 traditional Ecuadorian 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.280
 with egg sugar and fruit pulp the most 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.200
 used is the guava but also 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.780
 You can prepare with other fruits like 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.100
 banana strawberries blackberries naranjilla maracuy치 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.590
 among others he puts 20 guavas and 2 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.930
 pounds of sugar and 4 eggs 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.750
 first I take the water already peeled and I 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.610
 I put to cook it makes a boil and 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.770
 I put to squeeze left half an hour 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.540
 scola all the water and there I can 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.540
 squeeze him because if water enters 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.580
 it is loose it took out all the juice first 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.100
 I put the sugar then I put the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.550
 egg whites I'm missing I'll separate 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.040
 the whites of the yolks apart because 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.350
 only the whites are used and then 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.060
 that are already put the mixing costs 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.909
 he formulates footprint 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.880
 the first set and I put through 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:40.159
 half an hour already I see that it is removed 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.140
 I put the second place as I see 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.030
 that the second bet is already dry and 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.159
 I put the third putting is the final the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.720
 that I should approach more and this one stops 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.659
 alone in the shin and there is already 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.969
 well dry 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.140
 only I start to beat and I have to 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:58.119
 finish if I kill stronger says that 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.369
 grows more but I have no more strength 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.369
 do not lift more I lift what I can 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.520
 how late the process since you 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.440
 already begins to mix we try a 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.780

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.750

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.190
 however you can also elaborate 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.800
 this fun dessert at home with the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.990
 help of an electric mixer the same 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.850
 that will streamline the process and allow you 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.430
 Mix the ingredients in a way 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.260
 easier but that we do assure you that 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.480
