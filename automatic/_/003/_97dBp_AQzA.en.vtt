 Hi, I'm Pablo Matron on this occasion 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.740
 is not found in other movies that 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.900
 they premiere on the movie theaters and 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.849
 of the world and that Argentina does not reach a 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.619
 little late but good not for that 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.110
 I wanted to see her because the truth is that 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.259
 great movie is about the chronicles 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.930
 Fear or vhs as it was known at all 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.350
 the world the chronicles of fear bring a 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.390
 story with scratches there are six stories 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.210
 or five stories within oneself 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.790
 history 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.610
 good the metamessage inside the metal 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.020
 half goal 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.810

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.620
 good 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.490
 a little more of that terror led to 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.880
 cameras 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.450

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.160
 I do not know if much of the new 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.350
 generations will know see jokes 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.680
 are these cassettes that you could see in 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.750
 the big videocassettes and good what 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.619
 that does not want the tv of this was the one of 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.580
 before 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.680
 more or less as good times is that the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.950
 main story is a group of 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.370
 malvivientes that break a house for 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.159
 good 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.869
 sent to look for a vhs a single vhs 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.760
 they find that in a room 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:51.370
 there is a dead man 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.530
 the days maybe a month that is sitting 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.260
 in an armchair in front of several televisions 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.530
 and a lot of 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.440
 of these vhs cassette what they do 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.140
 these malvivientes is to check one for 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.690
 the good one realize casettes 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.690
 that inside each house there are stories 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.800
 pretty rough creepy about 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.620
 all this ghostly paranormal with 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.550
 blood of everything 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.550
 and that's what the most striking of this 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.830
 the chronicles of fear 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.370
 if you want these cassettes and every time 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.960
 check one of these vhs one of the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.530
 brave disappears and good this 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.390
 how 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.970
 take of this 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.980
 the brother camera if you do not like the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.410
 brother film camera in bed if he hates 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.170
 this paranormal activity 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.900
 these movies in which one to 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.530
 Sometimes you wonder if that is happening 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.360
 because he keeps filming or where he is from 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.510
 filming these and if the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.510
 deal with good things have that or if not 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.250
 you like the camera to move a lot 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.670
 it's not the painting for you if you like the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.710
 outside this innovative design is 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.170
 well I think you'll be able to continue 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:17.220
 enjoying this 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.349
 the fear vhs I think the stories the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.150
 five stories that are told within 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.879
 this story 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.750
 the most interesting are the second 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:32.240
 it's night Matteo and the last one is 10 31 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.310
 98 especially the last I recommend this 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.880
 in almost two hours we get two hours of 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.390
 movie the oit and the last short that 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.630
 has the seasoning of very good 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.470
 special effects a story I think that 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.300
 of the most credible and good after 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.860
 the others are also 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.959
 interesting but I think that the many 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:00.810
 session the plan of ardonés 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:04.470
 these 10 31 98 6 electors among them to 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.790
 the woman who also acts within one 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:13.260
 gay movies mike weir radio silence 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.890

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:21.650
 are the directors called for this 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:25.860
 the chronicles of fear here of hs 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.240
 it also seems they raised quite as 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:34.320
 to do a second part and that's why 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:40.160
 is going to be super vhs-2 the images of 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.160
 more scares and more suspense blood 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.150
 ghosts 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.990
 no doors that close with the wind 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.560
 but good yes 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.020
 enjoy the beer gas pochoclo 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.290

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.480
 the chronicles of fear to give a pair 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.810
 of scares as a step to me that already with 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.520
 a single scare and the movie this happens 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.430
 the test so good the chronicles of 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.570
