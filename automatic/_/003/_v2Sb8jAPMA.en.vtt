that's it I guess I'll go ahead to do
the<00:04:59.730> ringside<00:05:00.150> area<00:05:00.210> where<00:05:00.720> for<00:05:01.169> the

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
feel like the this tributed ramp so

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.100 
feel like the this tributed ramp so
let's<00:05:08.100> go<00:05:08.250> ahead<00:05:08.370> and<00:05:10.400> break<00:05:11.400> wait<00:05:11.669> Ram<00:05:12.240> one

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
let's go ahead and break wait Ram one

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.020 
let's go ahead and break wait Ram one
two<00:05:13.530> three<00:05:14.280> four<00:05:14.970> damn<00:05:15.960> is<00:05:16.230> that<00:05:16.410> lined<00:05:16.620> up<00:05:17.030> no

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.320 

that<00:05:30.190> is<00:05:30.400> way<00:05:31.330> too<00:05:31.360> big<00:05:32.520> but<00:05:33.520> I<00:05:33.550> guess<00:05:33.910> I'll<00:05:34.120> do

all<00:05:37.110> three<00:05:38.110> I<00:05:38.140> guess<00:05:40.560> does<00:05:41.560> it<00:05:41.650> always<00:05:41.800> seem

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
all three I guess does it always seem

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.000 
all three I guess does it always seem
like<00:05:42.130> enough<00:05:42.370> entrance<00:05:43.360> ramp<00:05:43.600> for<00:05:43.810> them

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:54.420

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
I guess that barricade and now we're

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.850 
I guess that barricade and now we're
going<00:05:56.860> to<00:05:56.920> come<00:05:57.130> over<00:05:57.250> here<00:05:58.230> and<00:05:59.230> break<00:05:59.530> this

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
going to come over here and break this

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.500 
going to come over here and break this
it<00:06:00.220> rip<00:06:00.430> break<00:06:01.650> down<00:06:02.650> here<00:06:04.230> put<00:06:05.230> that<00:06:05.260> there

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
it rip break down here put that there

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:13.700 
it rip break down here put that there
yeah<00:06:07.510> we<00:06:07.720> need<00:06:07.900> the<00:06:08.050> things<00:06:08.380> for<00:06:08.770> the<00:06:09.570> the<00:06:10.570> UM

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710
