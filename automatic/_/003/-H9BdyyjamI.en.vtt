00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 pancakes breakfast i love them 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.720
 eat at all hours of the day with 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.340
 I'll show you a bit of imagination 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.260
 how they turn into a dessert 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.660
 refined to serve even after dinner 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.590
 you can't believe we make pancakes at 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.590
 almonds with orange cream 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.730
 Hey 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.610
 let's begin 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.450
 I have to share the pancake dough 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.450
 egg yolks from egg whites 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.780
 add the sugar 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.500
 I whisk it 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:12.330
 I add a little almond aroma together 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.330
 the milk 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.090
 flour 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.090
 I'm going to sift 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.430
 I can also add yeast 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.950
 almond flour 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.080
 finally a nice pinch of salt 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.550
 and now I can dedicate myself to editing 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.550
 egg whites 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.060
 to avoid getting dirty with some advice 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.060
 film 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.450
 here are our egg whites 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.720
 perfection I have to do nothing but 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.720
 incorporate them to the rest of the ingredients 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.939
 cover the mixture with film and then it 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.110
 bring to rest for at least one 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.110
 half an hour in the refrigerator 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.850
 to flavor my cream I put 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.650
 the small pot of milk with the inside of the 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.450
 orange peel and obviously I removed 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.890
 the only colored part of the rancia 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.540
 leaving the white one attached to the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.980
 fruit that is a bit more bitter 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.560
 I brought the milk to a boil 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.930
 off the fire so I leave soaking 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.070
 the rinds that will release all their 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.860
 perfume 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:43.390
 in the meantime I'm going to split the egg whites 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:45.960
 from the yolks I add it in the eggs 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.960
 caster sugar 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.190
 and the potato starch I go to 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.190
 sift 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.099
 perfect a smooth cream like you see e 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.349
 now I'm going to turn on the 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.260
 fire and before introducing this 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.409
 compound in milk I remove the peels 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.409
 orange 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.910
 I can say the compound in art 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.229
 continue cooking over low heat and heat 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.660
 I will wait for some boil 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:35.610
 minute the cream will not be very dense 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.610
 because it is a pancake accompaniment 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.970
 I put a pan on the stove 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:54.039
 non-stick to warm up because we will go to 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:56.280
 cook the punks and the pan and beautiful 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.280
 hot so i can take some 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.280
 composed 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.320
 and lay it on the pan 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.030
 I wait a few minutes until 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.390
 the mixture will solidify at least on 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.390
 on the base 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.779
 I'm ready to shoot the pancake like 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:27.939
 see this is just the color that must 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:29.769
 take your pancake and leave 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:31.209
 also cook on the other side and then 

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:34.169
 we can proceed like this until it ends 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:34.169
 the mixture 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.820
 our pancake is ready and me 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.990
