00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.579
 hello we are in a new video and good 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.709
 as you see today we are changing a 

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:10.260
 little bit of game and we 're going to 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.930
 start the series of let's play by clash 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.120
 of plants some have asked 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.449
 upload to this game and I have not had the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.480
 opportunity I will explain a little more 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.669
 go ahead because the good today as soon as 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.249
 this load that will take a little 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:29.460
 because it's going a little slow and 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:31.230
 we will start then with the basics that is the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.680
 introduction 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.900
 so good welcome to boss we take 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.650
 his return to which I give to cancel me 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.840
 ask for my other account but good 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.120
 this is your new village which is 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.690
 precious here life would be perfect 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.690
 not for 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:54.400
 what is this other pathetic human 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.060
 at the time of the elves fast 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.130
 let's put a cannon to defend ourselves 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.200
 Here he tells you to use gems in 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.900
 that are a gem I will not use it 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.050
 because I'm that stingy and good 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.720
 counting a bit because I could not 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.030
 go up before this game 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.820
 I started playing it long before 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.550
 record then I already had my 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.729
 town hall and had a town hall to 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.890
 level 9 as you will have seen some in 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.680
 the other videos that I have uploaded but it was 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.470
 a town hall that was too much or 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.660
 it was very little improved then what 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.450
 I had gone up the town hall too 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.880
 fast compared to the rest of buildings and 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.820
 so I do not make good attacks in the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.530
 that can get many resources neither 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.190
 I have good defenses because I have a 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.810
 city ​​a little bad then just 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.789
 that's why I have not wanted to record so far 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.649
 that I can start I have a city and 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.229
 Now that I know how to play, I know I have to 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.750
 improve all buildings before 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.550
 improve the town hall and how is it 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.550
 game that I really love you know 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.450
 is one of my most practically 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.100
 games more than minecraft then 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.319
 having the opportunity to start a 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.350
 city that I want to which I can 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:20.480
 really so that you really enjoy 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:24.580
 the game and because I like it and at the same 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.890
 time in the mouth 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.920
 the new guarantees are good for the 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.290
 ways 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.940
 then taking advantage of that I can finally 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.970
 have a 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.580
 I can start from scratch and make a series 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.060
 entertaining then why decided to leave me 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.060
 attack already 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.879
 and not attack from sama attacking the internet or 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.239
 what happens but good that simply 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.040
 to start from scratch and have a city 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.590
 curious 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.090
 well this to learn to attack with the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.090
 direct the mouse 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.019
 good the first episode of the videos 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.710
 of introduction to the beginning as os 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.600
 I say I say now what 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.700
 the first episodes may be 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.930
 more abundant because simply record 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.490
 and start building things a little 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.060
 go well done now we prepare the 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.250
 village to fight 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.250
 Now let's make another constructor 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.350
 in essence 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.490
 In a serious time you can go on doing another 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.740
 good thing then what else can I 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.410
 tell 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.760
 who does not know has simply summed up is 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.820
 a little bit because I have not been able to upload 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.010
 before and because it goes up now and also 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.010
 let's sing many 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.310
 like the other videos that uploaded this 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.569
 now of a plan and a plan that believes 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.090
 because I wanted to make a plan with 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.000
 subscribers but good not many people 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.590
 seems to follow the game or at least 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.319
 my channel 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.810
 so I think next month in 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.380
 February we are going to close that clan if not 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.210
 change the thing and well we will go to another 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.880
 site I say it especially for those who 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.870
 someone serves the video this video 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.860
 sport 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.840
 from the other clan video because 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.910
 you exist flat is inactive is 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.340
 simply because we are playing 5 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.889
 people and there are 20 people without doing 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.729
 nothing while we are going to look for another clan 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.729
 in what 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.819
 finish it uncle 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.230
 well this is what we have to finish what 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:55.360
 that is not 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.360
 15 minutes and I do not want 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.970
 yes 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:07.720
 then let me see what they are 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:11.320
 speaking we need to build the room 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.500
 in the end I spend more faith because it is 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.500
 waths up 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:23.620
 as I will not see if at some point he bought 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.070
 topics to put builders on 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.070
 all 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.340
 but they must shoot 10 is more than done 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.480
 some as I say this episode is a 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.480
 point a bit to 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.860
 to enter the game and know more or 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.860
 less how does it contain 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:54.380
 let's dig to attack our city 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.450
 and good with what I say in the 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.030
 next days I will upload that I suppose 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.610
 I'll upload more episodes because I'm more 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.560
 basic and not so much and the rest of the videos 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.790
 you can try that they are mostly of 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.240
 attacks and making cuts if 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.240
 that I am capable 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.300
 and well I do not know that there is much more than 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.580
 tell the game how you see it goes from this 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.740
 you have to build an activity and 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.880
 perform attacks in principle now only 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.950
 we are doing what is game 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:31.170
 individual or something like that is called after 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:32.969
 happens the individual singleplayer as 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:37.449
 translate 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:40.229
 it's almost a great battle to my name 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:40.229
 it gets 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.780
 and ready 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:53.820
 valcke telling him to build the 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.420
 City Hall in 2 but after two 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.420
 genders 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.320
 and this one of the 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:05.780
 of achievements 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:09.420
 I do not want to notify has or if the 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:12.770
 I want if I wanted them but not 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:16.520
 and it looks like they already leave me 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.889
 they leave me a little more freedom 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.069
 well I will leave some things 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:24.680
 building like in making me another 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:27.380
 barracks 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:32.780
 there is not no 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:35.870
 I'm going to leave another collector and another mine 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.550
 and the mine not to do it but good 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:41.210
 as I say I will try to move forward a bit 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:45.260
 the city and in one or two days I go 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:47.450
