00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.499 

pop<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.770> out<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.759> then<00:01:49.060> just<00:01:51.210> unplug<00:01:52.210> it<00:01:52.329> from

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
pop it out and then just unplug it from

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.600 
pop it out and then just unplug it from
right<00:01:52.630> there<00:01:52.869> I'll<00:01:53.280> go<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.460> grab<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:57.159> new<00:01:57.399> one

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
right there I'll go and grab the new one

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.340 
right there I'll go and grab the new one
first<00:01:57.909> okay<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.569> took<00:02:01.689> out<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.140> two<00:02:02.319> screws

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
first okay so I took out the two screws

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.169 
first okay so I took out the two screws
right<00:02:03.310> here<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:04.380> now<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:06.399> depends<00:02:06.789> on<00:02:06.880> your

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
right here and now it depends on your

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.109 
right here and now it depends on your
stove<00:02:08.110> they<00:02:09.039> might<00:02:09.220> be<00:02:09.310> secured<00:02:09.700> differently

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
stove they might be secured differently

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.460 
stove they might be secured differently
but<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.450> idea<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.989> same

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
but the idea is the same

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.280 
but the idea is the same
take<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.220> up<00:02:12.370> so<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.720> don't<00:02:13.989> know<00:02:14.049> if<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.170> can

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
take it up so I don't know if you can

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.860 
take it up so I don't know if you can
see<00:02:14.500> right<00:02:14.650> here<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.970> burned<00:02:18.970> out<00:02:19.180> kind<00:02:19.840> of

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
see right here it's a burned out kind of

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.420 
see right here it's a burned out kind of
like<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:21.930> lightbulb<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.739> trace<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.220> burned

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
like a a lightbulb the trace is burned

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.380 
like a a lightbulb the trace is burned
out<00:02:24.720> right<00:02:25.720> here<00:02:26.049> is<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.380> brand<00:02:26.709> new<00:02:26.860> one<00:02:27.040> and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
out right here is a brand new one and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.820 
out right here is a brand new one and
where<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.420> bought<00:02:28.630> this<00:02:28.870> well<00:02:29.290> there's<00:02:29.650> two

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
where I bought this well there's two

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.449 
where I bought this well there's two
places<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.340> buy<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.549> either<00:02:31.180> buy<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.510> online

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
places of buy it either buy it online

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.030 
places of buy it either buy it online
which<00:02:33.459> actually<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.090> found<00:02:34.329> more<00:02:34.840> expensive<00:02:35.440> or

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
which actually I found more expensive or

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.949 
which actually I found more expensive or
just<00:02:36.489> go<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.670> your<00:02:36.970> local<00:02:37.150> appliance<00:02:37.480> stores

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
just go to your local appliance stores

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.319 
just go to your local appliance stores
like<00:02:38.920> I'm<00:02:39.250> not<00:02:39.459> talking<00:02:39.700> about<00:02:39.760> those<00:02:40.030> big

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
like I'm not talking about those big

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.240 
like I'm not talking about those big
local<00:02:40.870> plant<00:02:41.079> stores<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.349> mean<00:02:41.380> really<00:02:41.739> local

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
local plant stores I mean really local

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.050 
local plant stores I mean really local
local<00:02:42.579> plant<00:02:42.819> stores<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.440> they<00:02:44.440> do<00:02:44.500> carry

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
local plant stores and they do carry

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.990 
local plant stores and they do carry
these<00:02:46.060> heat<00:02:46.390> elements<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.579> whole<00:02:48.700> idea<00:02:48.970> is

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
these heat elements so the whole idea is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.259 
these heat elements so the whole idea is
pretty<00:02:49.269> much<00:02:51.090> removing<00:02:52.090> these<00:02:52.209> two

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
pretty much removing these two

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.870 
pretty much removing these two
connectors<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.140> put<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.680> here<00:02:54.100> remove

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
connectors and put it on here remove

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.490 
connectors and put it on here remove
those<00:02:55.060> two<00:02:55.299> connectors<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.840> put<00:02:56.019> it<00:02:56.079> on<00:02:56.170> here

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
those two connectors and put it on here

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.490 
those two connectors and put it on here
so<00:02:57.430> let's<00:02:57.609> do<00:02:57.819> these<00:02:58.889> let's<00:02:59.889> do<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.130> one<00:03:00.280> by<00:03:00.310> one

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.220 

taking<00:03:05.500> out<00:03:05.590> one<00:03:07.650> bottom<00:03:08.650> one<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.900> put<00:03:11.139> it

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
taking out one bottom one and you put it

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:31.090 
taking out one bottom one and you put it
on<00:03:11.319> here<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.880> next<00:03:16.150> thing<00:03:17.310> take<00:03:18.310> out<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:18.670> one

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.670 

hmm<00:03:32.100> these<00:03:32.400> are<00:03:32.550> hard<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.030> thought<00:03:33.240> a

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680

before all right so this is a zoom up if
you<00:04:59.500> can<00:04:59.620> see<00:04:59.830> it<00:04:59.890> but<00:05:00.010> that's<00:05:00.070> where<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.430> was

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
you can see it but that's where it was

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:08.180 
you can see it but that's where it was
burnt<00:05:00.850> off<00:05:02.310> let<00:05:03.310> me<00:05:03.340> refocus<00:05:03.850> real<00:05:04.270> quick

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.850 

there<00:05:09.190> we<00:05:09.280> go<00:05:09.930> so<00:05:10.930> you<00:05:10.990> can<00:05:11.050> see<00:05:11.320> that's<00:05:11.440> burnt

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
there we go so you can see that's burnt

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.650 
there we go so you can see that's burnt
off<00:05:12.070> and<00:05:12.460> I'm<00:05:13.420> not<00:05:13.480> putting<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:13.900> screws<00:05:14.170> and

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
off and I'm not putting the screws and

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.430 
off and I'm not putting the screws and
would<00:05:16.660> try<00:05:17.230> it<00:05:17.290> out<00:05:18.510> so<00:05:19.510> my<00:05:19.630> wife<00:05:19.810> just<00:05:20.140> cleaned

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
would try it out so my wife just cleaned

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.830 
would try it out so my wife just cleaned
up<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.880> inside<00:05:21.880> of<00:05:21.910> the<00:05:22.090> oven<00:05:22.240> I<00:05:22.480> guess<00:05:22.660> that's

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
up the inside of the oven I guess that's

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.460 
up the inside of the oven I guess that's
a<00:05:22.960> good<00:05:23.200> idea<00:05:24.190> to<00:05:24.580> do<00:05:24.730> so<00:05:25.720> let's<00:05:25.900> continue<00:05:26.170> on

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
a good idea to do so let's continue on

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.740 
a good idea to do so let's continue on

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:47.190 
the only thing yes you just put back the
screws<00:05:28.870> on<00:05:42.360> all<00:05:43.360> right<00:05:45.330> now<00:05:46.330> just<00:05:46.660> close<00:05:46.930> this

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
screws on all right now just close this

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.030
