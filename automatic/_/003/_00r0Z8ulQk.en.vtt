idea what we're trying to do here is

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.800 
idea what we're trying to do here is
identify<00:02:19.020> products<00:02:19.470> within<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:20.010> store<00:02:20.370> that

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
identify products within that store that

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.390 
identify products within that store that
stand<00:02:21.810> out<00:02:22.020> we<00:02:22.590> want<00:02:22.800> products<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.190> are

stand out we want products that are
selling<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:23.790> then<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.330> can<00:02:24.540> create<00:02:24.750> little

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
selling so then we can create little

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.590 
selling so then we can create little
mini<00:02:25.500> sites<00:02:25.890> around<00:02:26.280> those<00:02:27.060> individual

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
mini sites around those individual

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.240 
mini sites around those individual
products<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.230> really<00:02:28.650> ramp<00:02:28.890> up<00:02:29.070> ourselves

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
products and really ramp up ourselves

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.580 
products and really ramp up ourselves
and<00:02:29.730> at<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.000> point<00:02:30.300> in<00:02:30.420> time<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:31.110> makes<00:02:31.350> sense

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
and at that point in time it makes sense

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.500 
and at that point in time it makes sense
to<00:02:31.740> do<00:02:31.980> some<00:02:32.190> media<00:02:32.490> buying<00:02:32.730> because<00:02:33.060> we
