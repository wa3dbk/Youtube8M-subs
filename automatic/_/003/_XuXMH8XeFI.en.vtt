00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:44.199
 come on crack jack you can i know 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:48.989
 come on crack jack come on kroger there 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.989
 and you can 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:05.960
 i believed in you croc jack you are super fish 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:14.450
 no coyote at all but shouting jack I'm her 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:20.780
 woke up the extraordinary circular 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.119
 wiring here you are in my capture but 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.080
 crack jack 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.080
 i love you croc g 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.080
 come on 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.119
 Well let's Che but you have to have to 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.460
 come on here I know come on 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.450
 there is already how I love you except jyk 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:15.920
 jyk jyk is power here's another block 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:30.230
 he took the flow handsome croc jack in 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.230
 work fifty eight millimeters 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:38.930
 scr depth depth well he's floating 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.890
 this wobbler 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.319
 so when he twitching pretty 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.230
 generally accepted let's say so fast 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.560
 twitching is not hard but fast it is 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.290
 the meter goes deep but we are completely 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.540
 here does not suit us 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.359
 wobbler is very good but necessary 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.140
 use it like that 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:08.260
 so that it passes because the depth is from 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.170
 water surface free space from 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.650
 jugs who grassroots lilies up to grassroots 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.579
 30 centimeters of grass no more 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.060
 and we came up for him wiring for 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:26.620
 this wonderful crank crack jack 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:31.840
 then do make a throw potyazhki 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.920
 with a rod centimeters well from half a meter 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.590
 about 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.040
 and then during the ascend and so not to us 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:43.889
 it was not boring not perch too we start 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.299
 twitching with the tip of the rod you can 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:50.439
 ten to twenty times so proud yet 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:53.109
 almost to the very ascent of it 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:55.169
 don't dislike taking it exactly during 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.450
 this twitching when we 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:03.060
 Brain bait actually stir 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:06.340
 this is twitching pike grabbed 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.239
 picked up then all the same feed 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.449
 there are objects although I donâ€™t see it today 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.819
 okay, i am actually talking about this 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:18.519
 the wiring I told you about 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.289
 works better when the wobbler goes against 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.889
 currents 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:26.289
 for the simple reason that during here 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.340
 this shake wobbler practically 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.560
 stands still and quietly pops up 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.970
 and the flow of such quality wiring 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.090
 It does not work because during 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.720
 stopping and twitching wobbler for 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.030
 demolishing 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:44.820
 and the perch reacts not so short 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:49.260
 catching today is better when the wobbler goes 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:52.790
 against the current in general we continue 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.590
 exploit all possibilities 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:02.790
 most wonderful wobbler from pontoon21 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:05.729
 crack jack 58 sr floating here at 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:10.590
 wiring harness stuck 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:13.979
 more often and that's why here's a water lily under water 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:17.250
 oriented with this sharp part 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.950
 its adrift 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.039
 and the wobbler falls between these two 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.430
 parts of the water lily here and here all 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.000
 time is stuck well against the current when you 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.699
 will present 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.350
 the blade bends and passes and then straight 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:37.289
 that's like a trap for not a strong wind and 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.120
 casting problems and the wind 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:44.370
 totally uninteresting he constantly changes 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.620
 the direction is probably already in an hour 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.750
 four times the change of direction in the matter 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.850
 not even in this 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.200
 somewhere a meter and a half from the water and the wind 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:59.810
 no or almost none 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:01.940
 one and a half meters from the subway so the wind is there 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.570
 strong wind changes speed and 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.770
 direction as a result of the adjustment 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.280
 when casting 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:13.130
 especially during it has a higher 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.040
 Paracelsus for example than a pinwheel do 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.130
 very difficult and therefore accounted for 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:23.930
 use all the wand capabilities 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:30.200
 which I catch today is st pro x 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:31.850
 and the type of 17 grams we build choose try 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.430
 as low as possible throw under 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.110
 water surface in order to avoid 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.680
 smeared postings because here 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.920
 duct 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.780
 but here is a little wider and if there 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.440
 go the other way there everything is already 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.500
 half a meter already then 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.480
 a lot of lubrication is due to the fact that 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.690
 for whim it is very difficult to perform 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.550
 say the leader pecks the biggest fish 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:03.010
 but I still do not see it only in the grass 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:06.780
 gone and i love you like jack crack jack 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:12.240
 this is love at first sight 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.240
 well who you get out of the grass that tree pal
