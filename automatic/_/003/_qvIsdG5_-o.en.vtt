00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.920
 one day you're going to talk about the 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.270
 lemon sorting machine made by 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.760
 Technological students of Monterrey 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.320
 Morelia campus focused on the solution 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.779
 of the problem for the apatzingÃ¡n area 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.610
 MichoacÃ¡n where lemons are classified 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.700
 here we are going to show the topics that 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.369
 they have to classify they classify what 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:32.169
 which is the defect of lemon party 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:35.410
 grated cloud type yellow 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.609
 and burned to leave only those that 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.909
 they are going to market that they are the 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:38.909
 green 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.160
 they are going to enter here through the hopper 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.720
 this prototype at the scale of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.760
 packers that are used in the area 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.460
 enter a vision system where the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.370
 light is controlled the images are taken 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.290
 in a camera and good to have a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.290
 control and then have a final actuated 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.399
 good 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.290
 the prototype of the classification of 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.869
 lemon in this part really take 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.610
 the three lanes that when sinking in a 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.740
 censused system with sensors 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.390
 infrared each one then comes the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.280
 part of acting here are found 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.869
 the linear actors that are activated or 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.740
 deactivate to make the classification 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.200
 of the lemon for this in this deposit is 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.479
 accumulate lemons that are damaged 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.430
 striped matches and on this side fall 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.090
 the green lemons that pass the test 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.090
 quality 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.420
 processing control of the system 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.509
 is made by a computer 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.790
 that uses the pgje and the software 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.560
 skin edition 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.100
 if we approach a little here the panel 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.310
 frontal 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.869
 we have a graph that shows us the 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.060
 history of the amount of lemons that 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.369
 they are passing all the lemons 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.630
 damaged and yellow lemons and lemons 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.600
 green 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.909
 the interface between the program and the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.009
 physical performance is this card 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.850
 national instruments that is the card 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.020
 usb data acquisition 6.008 which 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.690
 control 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.650
 the performance honors that the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.980
 signals from the sensors 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:19.560
 and optics of the system it seems that 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.290
 we have here was used only to 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.879
 use the timers this is nothing 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.269
 more so as not to consume resources to the 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.269
 computer 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.040
 well now let's put in 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.040
 running the band 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.950
 well let's observe the final state 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:44.060
 here you need the lemons 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.060
 damaged yellow matches soiled 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.550
 another yellow and in this part it 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.320
 they find the green lemons that they pass 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.880
 the quality test for its being many 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.540
 green lemons 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.659
 that the system was able to recognize 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.659
 ah 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.110
 well here nothing else is to see the panel 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.510
 frontal we see how 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.510
 from increasing the amount of 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.870
 lemons we do not have 8 green 3 yellows 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.880
 a total of 21 lemons and this window 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.000
 what we have here is going to show us 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.920
 how defects are identified in the 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.049
 lemons let's manually move the 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.300
 band 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.330
 to see how the effect of the 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.900
 lemons 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.900
 highlights its outline
