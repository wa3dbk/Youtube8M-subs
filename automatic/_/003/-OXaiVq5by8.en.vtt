00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.969
 it's very simple since we have a rice 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.530
 with milk at home many times in 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.719
 what we do with the rice we make with 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.230
 the rice since I have my rice with milk 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.990
 in a mold and either cake or otay 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.550
 it can be detachable it can also be 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.009
 of the same ones that are the sexual ones of 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.529
 aluminum if we are going to prepare it more 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.800
 be a rice pudding cake with 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.040
 fruits this normal day that is baked 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.110
 it can be also when they exceeded 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.940
 that is hard and a lot starting what 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.930
 consume a cake very well that is left 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.370
 whole body 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.430
 good to present here are the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.280
 exact ingredients rice with milk already 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.050
 totally cold as possible not 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.640
 you must add more milk because what 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.640
 want is to begin to cover my 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.430
 I'm like a little dry that sat dry 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.660
 exactly let's use what 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.550
 they are sheets of candles 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.500
 Kiwi 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.940
 and to decorate give a little bit of color 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.910
 cherries 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.400
 more is very simple I'm going to start 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.970
 empty 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.260
 to fill my mold with some rice 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.530
 and I will go extending yes it is very 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.860
 important to go extending so that 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.620
 go forming the cake on the cake 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.900
 exactly here they made us heras 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.700
 and baked golden brown will be the 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.100
 bottom part but we're going to be a 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.770
 little bit in the bottom of the oven 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.600
 in the oven about 150 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.330
 ladies degrees to whoever crusts and 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.760
 ready and afterwards if you proceed with 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.930
 everything you are going to do exactly 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.510
 let's realize that at the time of 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.740
 oven I have preheated my oven to 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:57.260
 150 degrees since I have formed my base 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.020
 or cost me rice pudding are given 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.660
 account is not liquid this is going to 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.760
 Serve a lot to be able to unmold without 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.430
 problem but neither is with the very 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.530
 dry and as stubborn as possible 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.190
 Now you have to leave it, so be 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.770
 good good good 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.260
 extended 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.530
 and since I have my mold as they say 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.060
 I put it in the oven when the ball 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.970
 one hour approximately the operator 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.630
 so that it has the firm consistency and 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.819
 start decorating it as it is cold what 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.780
 let's decorate for that are the 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.209
 our plates 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.490
 it's going to be very simple very fast it's going to 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.490
 realize that they can not get a hand 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.640
 you can also put pineapple 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.640
 this is much later 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.819
 they started to have 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.520
 to our economic saucer very 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.430
 economic because many times we say 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.540
 what we do with rice the only one 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.540
 we know is 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.920
 and that 's another way we have 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.350
 guests since those are also coming 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.600
 Christmas dinners we're going to go to some 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.420
 food is then very fast very 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.460
 simple very economical and all to 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.830
 prepare and they have rice pudding but 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.190
 at home 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.710
 and ready here increase the cost goes to 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.960
 increase will go down according to the fruit that 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.370
 it is currently being commented on 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:33.780
 give it a little touch of color 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.780
 green we are going to add our kiwi 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.239

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.700
