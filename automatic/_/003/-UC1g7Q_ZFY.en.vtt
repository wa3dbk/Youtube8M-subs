00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.760

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.890
 a set of fashion agencies 7 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.420
 this season is very relevant not 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.180
 classic smokey ice namely those in 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.190
 which lower eyelid more accentuated 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.879
 I will teach you how to do it and will reveal everything 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.879
 secrets 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.570
 our 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.430
 trend number one light glowing 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.830
 skin is not overloaded with any 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.270
 tonal means a lot of highlighter in 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.220
 I will use this makeup only 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.260
 cream texture that is also responsible 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.330
 the trend of this season is cream 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.110
 textures look more alive and much 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.110
 shines more 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.090
 I aim scouting with 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.670
 cream bronzer i put it 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.730
 on the temporal hollows on the basal part 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.950
 hair on the cheek line and and be sure to 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.410
 chin line a little bit on the edge 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.910
 spout in this case I do not use 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.070
 highlighter and because it's enough for me 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.450
 luminescence from conductive skulpturiruem 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.450
 creamy texture 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.370
 the most important thing is to choose a black pencil 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.220
 out more intense pigment so he 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.500
 was very very saturated fatter we 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.019
 apply it abundantly on the inner eyelid with 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.019
 using a brush all this we are shading 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.110
 one of my all-time favorite products is 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.300
 black creamy shadows using them 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.300
 i am dull the eyelids 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.170
 another creamy product which i 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.930
 I will use this makeup is 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.209
 shadows with very intense metallic i 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.459
 I apply it to the interior of the eyelid 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.459
 the middle and the inner corner of the eye 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.910
 I also twist my eyelashes a little 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.650
 and thickly thick mascara especially on 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.840
 lower lashes because in this 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.030
 make-up the whole emphasis goes to the lower eyelid 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.030
 this is another trend of this season 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.990
 Here I choose a gray brown shade 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.820
 light finger texture neat 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.240
 patting movements I put on 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.460
 lips 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.150
 because in this case a clear outline 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.150
