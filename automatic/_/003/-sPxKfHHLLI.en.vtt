00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.240
 hi biker band yeah I know 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.900
 it's a little different from the shop windows and 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.630
 so I'm here to talk about a 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.730
 hyper important topic as you could 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.770
 guess I had marc if not precisely 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.949
 before coming back to the accident I'm going 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.100
 come back for me what was causing the 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.239
 causes of the accident 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.190
 necessarily me I realize it and 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.840
 I hope I can take 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.270
 awareness to the people of the 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.670
 dangerousness of the motorcycle 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.930
 the problem of the bike and I think 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.940
 that a lot of bikers who are 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.260
 like me in my case I hope they 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.489
 are luckier than me who are 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.370
 still there but it is that it is exhilarating 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.739
 do you think you know your bike 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.149
 you can not know it's not 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.550
 possible that never know one but 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.140
 calm you think that the road study is 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.130
 paris is not possible you can not 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.090
 nature where parker will always have a 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.330
 crap on the road tutoring not 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.479
 produces a shit and of course you know 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.550
 your bike you know the turns so dark 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.069
 souls as a big competitor is 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.750
 necessarily a margin of maneuver 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:27.080
 reduced is reduced to 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.119
 when our members redid that you 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.179
 go to the month is what is mine 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.280
 I came back from a friend's house 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.869
 diebolt I took a road that I 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.310
 knew I told myself I 'd like 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.679
 make me a little pleasure by m 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.560
 I opened like a big cunt I'm 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.729
 arrived in a curve 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.899
 a car that I have not seen that they 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.670
 were completely stashed by m 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.679
 she surprised me yet stopped on her 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.420
 way but necessarily with the speed of a 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.039
 vision field that is much more 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.050
 reduced 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.970
 to my surprise I screwed a slight blow 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.099
 right handlebar except that in a 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.289
 curve at 110 km / hour light cut from 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.390
 right finger is not at all light 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.610
 will send on the far right side of 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.649
 turn because we're going to read and 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.120
 chippings gravel sent in the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.160
 ditch and then it's defined what cdc 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.420
 black out until I get 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.030
 wake up 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.599
 witnesses take over and called 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.700
 firefighters 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.140
 I'm doing very well because 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.510
 frankly I could have finished 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.660
 paraplegic or worse until berthe 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.130
 is to break which a cervical and 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.260
 that's where I thank in equipment 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.319
 that's where everything rolls without 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.319
 frankly suicidal equipment 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.540
 I planted my leather 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.680
 suffered my helmet the dead from home 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.769
 dead I've got this one cervical 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.830
 who is fractured at a fracture is at 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.090
 the limit that I end up paraplegic and 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.120
 yet I have my full face helmet 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.370
 tied up I looked at my full face helmet 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.500
 the back crashed so much that the 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.069
 shock was violent and that's what got me 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.049
 save the life 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.610
 it's my helmet avoided me the product the 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.290
 part of despite this headset 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.180
 I still have the cervical which is 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.530
 farted think for a bit anyway 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.510
 before riding without equipment because 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.190
 it's too hot 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.620
 on this I leave you the pictures of 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.810
 the accident hoping that it can serve 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.819
 of month lesson what is sure is that 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.200
 it served me are a little too late 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.450
 I hope it can serve as a lesson 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.459
 a little earlier what starts to 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.200
 to take confidence in ourselves because for 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.100
 me it's not the speed that kills on a motorcycle 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.350
 it's the trust 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.480
 go to all those who can still 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.900
 ride on two wheels and see you soon 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.900
 I hope
