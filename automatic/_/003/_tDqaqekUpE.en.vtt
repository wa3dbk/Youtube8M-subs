00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.630
 associative property of the sum 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.900
 Hi, my name is the reporters' lines 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.700

 if we change the order of the commands 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.600
 for the result it would give losses 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.390
 associative foam to add the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.940
 number first we add two of them and the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.940
 result we take with this 0 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.020
 he says not to explain expressions like 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.020
 combined operations 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.480
 hello semester to talk about the pressures 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.610
 as combined operations for 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.680
 calculate the recombined price what 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.540
 first that is done in the operation 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.659
 which is between the front 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.330
 after the multiplication and finally 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.360
 the united the straight 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.480
 Now Miguel Angel is going to apply the

 Hello 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.690
 the living beings differentiate the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:03:00.150
 things do not live because we have cells and 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:02.459
 three and we do vital function of avoiding 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.610
 the sun nutrition ratio of 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.990
 reproduction living beings we need 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.280
 live a substance called nutrient 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.620
 relationship we have peace organs that for 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.010
 relate it better before 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:25.610
 and playback of play 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:28.940
