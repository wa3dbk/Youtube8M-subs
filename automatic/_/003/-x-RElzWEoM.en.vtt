00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.779
 huge hello to all my subscribers 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.450
 today we will cook with you and I 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.639
 I want to show you a very special recipe 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.620
 simple and light salad which 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.299
 perfect for dinner especially when 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.759
 you come home from work or study 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.039
 tired but want to eat but reluctant 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.990
 somehow this salad will bother 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.779
 the perfect solution since it is very 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.269
 simple recipe for this salad I came up with 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.430
 I never read it myself 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:31.240
 of course something like that I saw somewhere 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.760
 but this way I was born such 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.890
 the idea of ​​this salad I cooked it and 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.600
 now I cook it very very often 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.239
 I hope that you my recipe, too 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.460
 will like also that whole will be pretty 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.840
 still cheap very cheap will cost you 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.789
 since products for his 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.789
 cooking will need very little 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.710
 so all horse products 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.080
 same as you understand it tomatoes and salad 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.090
 of course you had to wash it all 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.690
 understand and the first thing we will do 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:10.450
 this is chop lettuce take a few 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:25.750
 stuff and just then just chop up 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:28.770
 you are comfortable and what we cut 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.880
 salad we put it some sort of capacity 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.479
 a plate is desirable deep 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.630
 so next it will be with us tomatoes 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.330
 also cut as you like as you 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.619
 Generally used to 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:50.500
 everyone cuts like that 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.690
 cubed squares even salon stitching 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:59.880
 anyway i'm just like that 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.880
 cut can say dice probably 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:13.980
 Tomatoes also put on top of salad 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.860
 our plate you are in time 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.900
 the main and the very tasty 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.360
 It is of course pickled champignons 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.580
 Immediately I want to say what it is on 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.950
 lover i know what many for sure 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.960
 do not like pickled mushrooms 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.970
 and if you don’t like this one in principle 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.280
 can be replaced with ordinary champignons 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.140
 for example, roasting them to us pan 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.590
 the tide is exactly my salad in 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.790
 pickled so look yourself and so 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.910
 we just open them 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.690
 I’m pretty small already 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.060
 edema with small principle can be so 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.680
 and I can cut in general, I will 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.190
 Accelerator cut and that's it 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.790
 I get every champignon every 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.000
 mushroom 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.459
 and just cut it into two slices and 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.440
 then I paint his salad 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.050
 usually when if you buy by buying 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.209
 my new water tires are there at the bottom there 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.300
 remains or garlic or onions also 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.130
 marinated in these good fortune familiar to me not 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.470
 It was 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.230
 there is only a little bit of onion and 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.709
 a little carrot all of this, too, of course 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.950
 you can crumble the salad now of course 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.019
 do you need to mix it all up with your hands or 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.420
 Spoon as you are comfortable in general I already 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.230
 In principle, it all mixed up and so 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.690
 looks like a mixed salad 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.060
 Of course, you need Ivan during 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.140
 it interferes with the need of course salt 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.709
 add salt and 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:51.570
 to your taste here and of course if you 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.910
 think of your figure then better 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.140
 add nothing but if you 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.090
 In principle, the house is still better 2 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.030
 Of course, I have vegetable oil 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.810
 ordinary vegetable oil with the addition of 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.110
 olive 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.350
 Well, so this is at least a little on the watch for 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.940
 figure so I will add a little bit 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.060
 Well, you can already add in your 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:19.070
 taste, you can add them olive 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.109
 such as pure olive oil in order 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.030
 as we added vegetable oil well 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.270
 Generally any other butter our salad 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.070
 you can of course have it a little more 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.410
 mix general there neatly and 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.380
 the last thing you can add to it 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.000
 any spices to your taste honestly 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.070
 saying now at my house especially no 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.900
 no spices suitable for her salad 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.050
 so much spice for meat 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.600
 so I will add just plain pepper and 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.210
 I'll pepper your salad a little 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.640
 can add any spices that are 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.580
 Generally to your taste 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:57.200
 Well, maybe it's all like that 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.810
