00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
game wasn't finished anyway but I can't

know hundreds and confirm that and they

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.530 
know hundreds and confirm that and they
decided<00:00:37.170> not<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.770> release<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.520> because<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
decided not to release it because of the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.160 
decided not to release it because of the
lower<00:00:40.050> user<00:00:40.590> base<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.969> poor<00:00:42.390> reviews<00:00:42.690> of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
lower user base and the poor reviews of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.130 
lower user base and the poor reviews of
belief<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.180> definite<00:00:45.899> no-no

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
no official date and it was been very

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.090 
no official date and it was been very
well<00:01:18.180> received<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.689> all<00:01:18.810> formats<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.920> it's

well received on all formats and it's
very<00:01:20.340> similar<00:01:20.700> though<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.570> wii<00:01:21.810> version

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
very similar though to the wii version

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.580 
very similar though to the wii version
obviously<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.790> got<00:01:23.970> extensive<00:01:24.900> use<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
obviously it's got extensive use of the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.710 
obviously it's got extensive use of the
gamepad<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.820> don't<00:01:27.090> think<00:01:27.270> he's<00:01:27.360> got<00:01:27.509> any

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
gamepad but don't think he's got any

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.260 
gamepad but don't think he's got any
additional<00:01:28.350> content<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.549> obviously<00:01:30.119> if

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
additional content so obviously if

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.670
