00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.640 
hello so a tutorial Tuesday and I've
been<00:00:10.880> playing<00:00:11.090> a<00:00:11.180> lot

this is a pretty cool right here you can
only<00:00:22.720> do<00:00:22.900> it<00:00:22.960> with<00:00:23.050> a<00:00:23.080> mini<00:00:23.320> hoop<00:00:23.500> you<00:00:23.860> have<00:00:24.130> to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
only do it with a mini hoop you have to

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.010 
only do it with a mini hoop you have to
have<00:00:24.340> two<00:00:24.520> points<00:00:24.849> of<00:00:24.939> contact<00:00:24.970> on<00:00:25.630> your<00:00:25.779> arm

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
have two points of contact on your arm

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.139 
have two points of contact on your arm
like<00:00:26.140> this<00:00:26.380> it's<00:00:27.099> basically<00:00:27.250> a<00:00:27.640> mini<00:00:27.970> hoop

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:28.149 
like this it's basically a mini hoop

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:34.530 
like this it's basically a mini hoop
conveyor<00:00:28.689> belt<00:00:29.050> so<00:00:29.649> it<00:00:29.739> goes<00:00:29.919> like<00:00:30.160> this

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.820 

just<00:00:36.510> okay<00:00:37.510> so<00:00:38.550> we're<00:00:39.550> going<00:00:39.760> about<00:00:40.000> this<00:00:40.210> move

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
just okay so we're going about this move

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.490 
just okay so we're going about this move
what<00:00:41.830> I'd<00:00:42.100> like<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.670> think<00:00:42.820> about<00:00:43.120> is<00:00:43.500> putting

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
what I'd like to think about is putting

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.940 
what I'd like to think about is putting
my<00:00:44.710> arm<00:00:45.010> right<00:00:45.910> below<00:00:46.630> where<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.440> center<00:00:47.740> line

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
my arm right below where the center line

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.050 
my arm right below where the center line
is<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:49.270> if<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.780> center<00:00:50.110> line<00:00:50.380> of<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.890> hoop<00:00:51.850> is

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
is so if the center line of the hoop is

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.660 
is so if the center line of the hoop is
right<00:00:52.390> here<00:00:52.780> then<00:00:53.110> I<00:00:53.200> want<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.410> put<00:00:53.560> my<00:00:53.739> my<00:00:54.400> arm

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
right here then I want to put my my arm

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.290 
right here then I want to put my my arm
right<00:00:55.060> below<00:00:55.540> that<00:00:55.570> that<00:00:56.410> way<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:57.700> the<00:00:58.090> top

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
right below that that way the the top

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.690 
right below that that way the the top
heaviness<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.110> hoop<00:00:59.440> carries<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:00.580> over

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
heaviness of the hoop carries it over

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.530 
heaviness of the hoop carries it over
now<00:01:01.660> once<00:01:02.410> it<00:01:02.890> has<00:01:03.100> rolled<00:01:03.489> over<00:01:03.640> this<00:01:03.970> arm<00:01:04.239> I

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
now once it has rolled over this arm I

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.260 
now once it has rolled over this arm I
wait<00:01:05.260> until<00:01:05.680> right<00:01:05.710> about<00:01:06.340> where<00:01:06.700> it's<00:01:06.970> about

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
wait until right about where it's about

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.620 
wait until right about where it's about
to<00:01:07.330> fall<00:01:07.570> off<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.110> my<00:01:08.500> arm<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:08.979> then<00:01:09.729> I<00:01:10.030> place

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
to fall off of my arm and then I place

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.620 
to fall off of my arm and then I place
my<00:01:10.930> other<00:01:11.229> arm<00:01:11.530> right<00:01:12.430> in<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.330> same<00:01:13.570> spot

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
my other arm right in the same spot

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.109 
my other arm right in the same spot
right<00:01:14.380> below<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.830> center<00:01:15.100> line<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.729> it<00:01:16.030> will

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
right below the center line and it will

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.150 
right below the center line and it will
go<00:01:16.240> over<00:01:16.479> my<00:01:16.600> other<00:01:16.750> arm<00:01:16.990> as<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.800> rolls<00:01:18.009> over

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
go over my other arm as it rolls over

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.400 
go over my other arm as it rolls over
this<00:01:18.460> arm<00:01:18.700> my<00:01:18.850> fingers<00:01:19.180> are<00:01:19.330> right<00:01:19.509> here<00:01:19.840> ready

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
this arm my fingers are right here ready

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.710 
this arm my fingers are right here ready
to<00:01:20.560> catch<00:01:20.830> up<00:01:21.009> here<00:01:21.340> sometimes<00:01:22.210> I<00:01:22.300> like<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.570> end

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
to catch up here sometimes I like to end

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.840 
to catch up here sometimes I like to end
with<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.930> tool<00:01:23.259> like<00:01:23.400> flipped<00:01:24.400> over<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.759> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
with a tool like flipped over to the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.170 
with a tool like flipped over to the
other<00:01:24.970> arm<00:01:25.560> something<00:01:26.560> cool<00:01:26.830> like<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:27.310> so

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
other arm something cool like that so

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.420 
other arm something cool like that so
once<00:01:28.810> again<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:29.110> looks<00:01:29.229> like<00:01:29.350> this<00:01:29.619> I<00:01:29.890> get<00:01:30.400> a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
once again it looks like this I get a

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.460 
once again it looks like this I get a
nice<00:01:30.670> swinging<00:01:31.030> motion<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.350> the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
nice swinging motion so that the

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:42.060 
nice swinging motion so that the
momentum<00:01:32.740> is<00:01:33.100> carrying<00:01:33.820> it<00:01:33.940> over<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:41.070> one

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
momentum is carrying it over and one

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.830 
momentum is carrying it over and one
other<00:01:42.250> thing<00:01:42.640> with<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.330> same<00:01:43.570> little

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
other thing with the same little

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.480 
other thing with the same little
phenomenon<00:01:44.409> that<00:01:45.010> I've<00:01:45.280> been<00:01:45.760> exploring<00:01:46.300> is<00:01:46.630> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
phenomenon that I've been exploring is a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.520 
phenomenon that I've been exploring is a
continuous<00:01:48.490> version<00:01:49.240> so<00:01:49.780> I'll<00:01:49.960> grab<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.229> like

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
continuous version so I'll grab it like

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.230 
continuous version so I'll grab it like
a<00:01:50.680> little<00:01:50.979> bit<00:01:51.100> below<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.549> center<00:01:51.820> line<00:01:52.030> and

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
a little bit below the center line and

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.120 
a little bit below the center line and
then<00:01:52.570> I'll<00:01:52.690> twist<00:01:52.960> it<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.500> rolls<00:01:53.740> over<00:01:53.890> my

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
then I'll twist it so it rolls over my

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.510 
then I'll twist it so it rolls over my
arm<00:01:54.340> like<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.600> recatch<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.260> and<00:01:56.500> if<00:01:57.340> you

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
arm like that and recatch it and if you

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.710 
arm like that and recatch it and if you
get<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:57.820> just<00:01:57.850> right

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
get it just right

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.080 
get it just right
you<00:01:59.049> can<00:01:59.229> twist<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.799> recatch<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.549> twist<00:02:00.909> and

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
you can twist and recatch and twist and

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.760 
you can twist and recatch and twist and
we<00:02:01.210> catch<00:02:01.510> it

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.610
