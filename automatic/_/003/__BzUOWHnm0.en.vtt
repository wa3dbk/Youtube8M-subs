00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:39.969

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:44.250
 so now what to show about 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.250
 we find that we close 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.829
 now here to fix this problem 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:57.570
 will have to be changed for this all the wires 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.320
 to get him out we need to take off 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:07.350
 this bundle cap is movable 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:09.270
 pay attention in essence he so he so 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.640
 not pulled out here inside there 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.280
 rod we him 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.039
 and looked on the Internet could not find 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.920
 how do we disassemble it 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:22.320
 then everyone cleaned found see about 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.890
 little rod is not there not really not 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.899
 I went out even here such a point in the house 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:42.090
 there is here this Bryce cap 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:44.149
 Here is such a formula where to go on summer 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.869
 grilled like a pre grease 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:51.899
 then called yes then covered him 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:02:01.189
 a soldering iron and little by little chateau de chateau and 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:01.189
 We pulled him out here is going to show the width 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.670
 after this cap 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:17.000
 calmly removed and you can already disassemble 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:19.079
 and free to change rocks such tubular 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.260
 similar steel color can also 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.260
 look here he is here he is not visible 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.810
 switch janitors work 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.120
 because from the same system there 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.329
 inside the rod here it opens 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.709
 brush it off 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.740
 so how can we explain it to you 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:49.970
 pull out but if there is a problem 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:51.650
 we have four problems here 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.860

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.860
