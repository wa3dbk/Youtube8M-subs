are<00:01:50.880> interacting<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:52.350> professor<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
are interacting with this professor so I

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.060 
are interacting with this professor so I
actually<00:01:54.899> learned<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.409> become<00:01:55.560> very

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
actually learned to become very

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.789 
actually learned to become very
organized<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.420> specific<00:01:58.350> professor

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
organized with that specific professor

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.340 
organized with that specific professor
that<00:01:59.070> I

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
that I

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.370 
that I
no<00:01:59.439> problem<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.540> what<00:02:01.540> I<00:02:01.570> realized<00:02:02.049> was<00:02:02.259> that

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
no problem and what I realized was that

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.710 
no problem and what I realized was that
I<00:02:02.530> was<00:02:02.860> going<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:03.490> professor<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.299> I

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
I was going to this professor and I

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.899 
I was going to this professor and I
wasn't<00:02:05.140> organized<00:02:05.619> and<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.430> was<00:02:06.580> just<00:02:06.700> kind<00:02:06.880> of

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
wasn't organized and I was just kind of

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.449 
wasn't organized and I was just kind of
asking<00:02:07.299> general<00:02:08.200> questions<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.130> she<00:02:09.310> was

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
asking general questions and she was

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.760 
asking general questions and she was
getting<00:02:09.580> annoyed<00:02:09.940> with<00:02:09.970> me<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.630> then<00:02:11.140> after<00:02:11.709> I

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
getting annoyed with me and then after I

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.800 
getting annoyed with me and then after I
got<00:02:12.010> kind<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.400> over<00:02:12.819> myself<00:02:13.000> when<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.569> was<00:02:13.690> like

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
got kind of over myself when I was like

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.170 
got kind of over myself when I was like
okay<00:02:14.080> well<00:02:14.380> maybe<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.310> should<00:02:15.700> approach<00:02:15.970> this

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
okay well maybe I should approach this

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.270 
okay well maybe I should approach this
differently<00:02:16.390> then<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.350> thought<00:02:17.800> about<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.190> and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
differently then I thought about it and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.610 
differently then I thought about it and
I<00:02:18.340> was<00:02:18.489> like<00:02:18.640> well<00:02:18.880> what<00:02:19.270> if<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:19.569> went<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.440> her

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
I was like well what if I went to her

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.960 
I was like well what if I went to her
and<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.970> had<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> very<00:02:23.200> organized<00:02:23.709> fashion<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.940> I

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and I had a very organized fashion so I

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.000 
and I had a very organized fashion so I
did<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.110> did<00:02:26.319> this<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.800> I'm<00:02:26.890> a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
did and I did this in and I'm a

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.620 
did and I did this in and I'm a
physiology<00:02:27.550> but<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:27.730> had<00:02:27.880> just<00:02:28.000> forgotten<00:02:28.180> to

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
physiology but I had just forgotten to

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.620 
physiology but I had just forgotten to
do<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.440> what<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:29.920> did<00:02:30.280> was<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.880> took<00:02:31.330> all<00:02:31.600> of

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
do it and what I did was I took all of

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.420 
do it and what I did was I took all of
the<00:02:31.959> material<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.500> she<00:02:32.739> gave<00:02:32.950> us<00:02:32.980> she<00:02:33.280> gave

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
the material that she gave us she gave

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.470 
the material that she gave us she gave
us<00:02:33.610> on<00:02:34.290> notes<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.739> slides<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.790> then<00:02:37.300> we<00:02:37.360> also

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
us on notes and slides and then we also

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.050 
us on notes and slides and then we also
had<00:02:37.750> our<00:02:37.780> text<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.040> took<00:02:39.190> three<00:02:39.519> questions

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
had our text so I took three questions

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.910 
had our text so I took three questions
specific<00:02:40.780> questions<00:02:41.080> from<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.440> notes<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.860> took

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
specific questions from the notes I took

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.979 
specific questions from the notes I took
three<00:02:42.340> specific<00:02:42.610> questions<00:02:42.850> from<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.720> slides

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
three specific questions from the slides

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.809 
three specific questions from the slides
and<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.319> took<00:02:44.620> three<00:02:44.890> specific<00:02:45.160> questions<00:02:45.700> from

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
and I took three specific questions from

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.720 
and I took three specific questions from
the<00:02:45.940> test<00:02:46.200> all<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.440> those<00:02:47.560> questions<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.400> did<00:02:48.700> a

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
the test all of those questions I did a

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.550 
the test all of those questions I did a
little<00:02:48.940> bit<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.300> research<00:02:49.630> on<00:02:49.870> but<00:02:50.140> I<00:02:50.170> didn't

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
little bit of research on but I didn't

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.009 
little bit of research on but I didn't
know<00:02:50.680> everything<00:02:50.860> about<00:02:51.250> them<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.880> went<00:02:52.569> to<00:02:52.810> her

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
know everything about them I went to her

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.259 
know everything about them I went to her
and<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:53.920> was<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.220> very<00:02:54.430> organized<00:02:54.910> i<00:02:55.030> sat<00:02:55.239> down

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
and I was a very organized i sat down

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.289 
and I was a very organized i sat down
and<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.739> would<00:02:57.040> just<00:02:57.160> ask<00:02:57.340> his<00:02:57.519> questions<00:02:57.970> and

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
and I would just ask his questions and

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.240 
and I would just ask his questions and
then<00:02:58.540> after<00:02:59.019> she<00:02:59.049> answered<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.590> question<00:03:00.010> I

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
then after she answered the question I

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.190 
then after she answered the question I
would<00:03:00.400> ask<00:03:00.430> where<00:03:01.090> she<00:03:01.360> found<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:01.720> material

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
would ask where she found that material

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.670 
would ask where she found that material
so<00:03:02.380> what<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.549> did<00:03:03.850> was<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.090> helped<00:03:05.019> her

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
so what this did was it helped her

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.850 
so what this did was it helped her
realize<00:03:06.070> that<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.970> was<00:03:07.540> using<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.470> time

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
realize that I was using it this time

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.819 
realize that I was using it this time
very<00:03:09.579> specifically<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.360> wasn't<00:03:10.989> you<00:03:11.799> know

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
very specifically I wasn't you know

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.979 
very specifically I wasn't you know
going<00:03:12.130> there<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.519> whine<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.209> complain<00:03:13.299> or<00:03:13.959> to

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
going there to whine and complain or to

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.349 
going there to whine and complain or to
tell<00:03:14.380> her<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.859> last<00:03:15.070> test<00:03:15.400> wasn't<00:03:16.000> there

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
tell her that the last test wasn't there

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.050 
tell her that the last test wasn't there
I<00:03:16.720> was<00:03:17.290> going<00:03:17.470> there<00:03:17.769> genuinely<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.880> get

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
I was going there genuinely to get

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.720 
I was going there genuinely to get
information<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.170> do<00:03:20.470> better<00:03:21.220> on<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.700> next

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
information and to do better on the next

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.569 
information and to do better on the next
test<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.200> other<00:03:23.470> thing<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:23.829> I<00:03:23.950> was<00:03:24.220> doing

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
test so the other thing that I was doing

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.789 
test so the other thing that I was doing
which<00:03:24.850> maybe<00:03:25.090> she<00:03:25.510> didn't<00:03:25.900> know<00:03:25.959> but<00:03:26.620> what<00:03:26.769> I

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
which maybe she didn't know but what I

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.280 
which maybe she didn't know but what I
was<00:03:27.070> doing<00:03:27.310> was<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.730> was<00:03:27.760> trying<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.810> figure<00:03:29.049> out

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
was doing was I was trying to figure out

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.890 
was doing was I was trying to figure out
this<00:03:29.680> specific<00:03:30.579> professor's<00:03:31.299> testing

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
this specific professor's testing

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.920 
this specific professor's testing
strategy<00:03:32.530> now<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:33.609> nursing<00:03:34.000> school<00:03:34.209> I<00:03:34.750> don't

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
strategy now in nursing school I don't

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.720 
strategy now in nursing school I don't
know<00:03:34.989> how<00:03:35.260> they<00:03:35.440> get<00:03:35.560> away<00:03:35.650> with<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.070> but

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
know how they get away with this but

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.880 
know how they get away with this but
they<00:03:36.880> do<00:03:36.940> not<00:03:37.269> have<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.660> test<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.170> on<00:03:38.440> any<00:03:38.680> of

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
they do not have to test you on any of

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.640 
they do not have to test you on any of
the<00:03:38.980> material<00:03:39.400> they<00:03:39.519> give<00:03:39.700> you<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:41.140> guess<00:03:41.440> it's

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
the material they give you I guess it's

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.110 
the material they give you I guess it's
because<00:03:41.739> that's<00:03:42.010> how<00:03:42.250> it<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.459> in<00:03:42.579> nursing<00:03:42.970> in

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
because that's how it is in nursing in

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.090 
because that's how it is in nursing in
real<00:03:43.299> life<00:03:43.450> but<00:03:43.780> basically<00:03:44.320> what<00:03:44.470> happens<00:03:44.829> is

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
real life but basically what happens is

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.729 
real life but basically what happens is
you<00:03:45.700> have<00:03:45.730> your<00:03:46.030> test<00:03:46.329> you<00:03:47.200> have<00:03:47.380> your<00:03:47.560> notes

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
you have your test you have your notes

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.310 
you have your test you have your notes
you<00:03:47.980> have<00:03:48.010> your<00:03:48.310> slides<00:03:48.549> and<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.510> could<00:03:49.780> study

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
you have your slides and you could study

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.290 
you have your slides and you could study
your<00:03:50.530> butt<00:03:50.739> off<00:03:50.859> on<00:03:50.890> all<00:03:51.340> of<00:03:51.370> those<00:03:51.640> and

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
your butt off on all of those and

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.140 
your butt off on all of those and
that's<00:03:53.140> literally<00:03:53.500> how<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.890> is<00:03:54.010> because<00:03:54.820> you

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
that's literally how it is because you

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.290 
that's literally how it is because you
have<00:03:55.420> to<00:03:55.450> know<00:03:56.020> real-life<00:03:56.950> situations<00:03:57.760> but

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
have to know real-life situations but

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.970 
have to know real-life situations but
how<00:03:58.510> would<00:03:58.570> you<00:03:58.750> possibly<00:03:59.230> know<00:03:59.740> that

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
how would you possibly know that

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.790 
how would you possibly know that
unless<00:04:00.660> you've<00:04:01.660> spent<00:04:02.200> a<00:04:02.290> lot<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.440> time<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:02.740> a

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
unless you've spent a lot of time in a

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.640 
unless you've spent a lot of time in a
hospital<00:04:03.340> or<00:04:03.750> have<00:04:04.750> a<00:04:04.810> family<00:04:05.110> member<00:04:05.320> with

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
hospital or have a family member with

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.100 
hospital or have a family member with
that<00:04:05.860> disease<00:04:06.430> so<00:04:06.730> it's<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:07.150> very<00:04:07.600> difficult

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
that disease so it's a very difficult

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.070 
that disease so it's a very difficult
you<00:04:09.070> know<00:04:09.190> way<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:10.410> test<00:04:11.410> however<00:04:13.080> professors

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
you know way to test however professors

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.110 
you know way to test however professors
are<00:04:14.200> professors<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:14.770> they<00:04:14.890> can<00:04:15.130> create<00:04:15.430> exams

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
are professors and they can create exams

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.810 
are professors and they can create exams
so<00:04:16.360> sometimes<00:04:17.050> they<00:04:17.320> create<00:04:17.680> exams<00:04:18.100> that<00:04:18.489> are

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
so sometimes they create exams that are

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.910 
so sometimes they create exams that are
from<00:04:19.360> the<00:04:19.480> text<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:19.870> are<00:04:20.170> from<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.530> notes<00:04:20.709> and

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
from the text and are from the notes and

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.310 
from the text and are from the notes and
aren't<00:04:21.220> from<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.459> lectures<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.060> so<00:04:22.870> when

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
aren't from the lectures and so when

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.840 
aren't from the lectures and so when
your<00:04:23.530> professors<00:04:24.100> answering<00:04:24.730> those

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
your professors answering those

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.120 
your professors answering those
questions<00:04:25.440> ask<00:04:26.440> them<00:04:26.770> where<00:04:26.890> they're<00:04:27.010> getting

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
questions ask them where they're getting

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.670 
questions ask them where they're getting
the<00:04:27.340> material<00:04:27.790> from<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.330> if<00:04:28.570> they<00:04:28.750> can't<00:04:29.230> give

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
the material from and if they can't give

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.480 
the material from and if they can't give
you<00:04:29.830> specific<00:04:30.730> pages<00:04:31.390> or<00:04:31.780> specific<00:04:32.560> slides

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
you specific pages or specific slides

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.060 
you specific pages or specific slides
that<00:04:34.150> gives<00:04:34.540> you<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.690> key<00:04:35.020> that<00:04:35.560> you<00:04:35.710> need<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:35.950> go

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
that gives you a key that you need to go

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.740 
that gives you a key that you need to go
above<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.640> beyond<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.000> book<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.390> what<00:04:37.600> that

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
above and beyond the book and what that

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.240 
above and beyond the book and what that
means<00:04:38.020> going<00:04:38.290> above<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.620> beyond<00:04:38.920> the<00:04:39.070> book

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
means going above and beyond the book

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.970 
means going above and beyond the book
it's<00:04:39.850> finding<00:04:40.180> as<00:04:40.300> many<00:04:40.330> NCLEX<00:04:41.230> questions<00:04:41.680> as

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
it's finding as many NCLEX questions as

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.700 
it's finding as many NCLEX questions as
you<00:04:42.190> possibly<00:04:42.580> can<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.290> that's<00:04:44.290> what<00:04:44.440> about

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
you possibly can and that's what about

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
we have look means okay so the third

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.360 
we have look means okay so the third

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
thing that you kind of have to

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.990 
thing that you kind of have to
understand<00:04:52.030> is<00:04:52.390> that<00:04:53.010> being<00:04:54.010> favored<00:04:54.730> or

you know things only easier or maybe
