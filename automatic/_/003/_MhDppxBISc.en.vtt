00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.680
 goo 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.299
 Whoa 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.299
 Have 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.550
 The influence is 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.289
 Side job 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.120
 The 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.490
 Let us introduce 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.310
 Hmm 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.810
 This is 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.760
 It is today e Cannon no core 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.780
 5 d mark ii 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.780
 With this 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.980
 I think that I want to 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.980
 Take a photo of food 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.390
 This is not the flash itself becomes straw stick with this kind of feeling 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.150
 I wonder if one side of the diameter is about 1 meter 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.800
 90 cm 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.610
 I think it was about 90 cm by 90 cm square 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.670
 In a 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.470
 This is light 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.470
 Tracing paper for soft 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.200
 In using this 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.520
 Huh 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.320
 Is this is not supposed to without the adjustment of the light 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.270
 What 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:25.109
 The flash meter has a sensitivity of 100 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.070
 A number of the throttle when the primary set of sometimes shutter speed 60 minutes of 100 people sensitivity 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:30.479
 To do 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:34.310
 For example, if you make it f 8 or f 11 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.320
 whether the proposed I Toka turn around 4 f 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.330
 The attempt to throttle acceleration as the light 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.500
 Use for 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.500
 Of this SEKONIC's 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:53.540
 You are the solo 某 flash meter 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.159
 Even though for another one that I'm the same manufacturer SEKONIC 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.740
 this is 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.159
 Color meter 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.370
 Now that has been said to be known as color thermometer 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.840
 Brightness outside Pika 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.310
 this 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.580
 I measure the color temperature 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.600
 Take a picture well and catch reddish fish on the front 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.160
 This is the unreasonable temperature 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:24.880
 High or low or such adjustments often occur when vomiting comes 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:27.069
 Adjust this with a manual instead of Otsu and take a picture 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.480
 It is this opportunity 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.480
 Let's try a now 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.410
 Huh 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.120
 Current 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.200
 In the set state 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.420
 How much color temperature etc 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.740
 Do you adjust the aperture 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.740
 I will try to figure out 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.580
 In ne sensitivity 100'm now 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.450
 a Shutter speed may be good 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:15.010
 The aperture is f 8 at 1/60 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.010
 to f 8 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.540
 It has become a clean take color enter dominating 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.579
 Although in Are You a color temperature 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.590
 Since this also is by the camera will be supported by manual 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:33.989
 5220 So 5200 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.030
 This also has a sensitivity of 100 and a shutter speed of 1/60. 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.800
 so 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:44.560
 Please adjust the color temperature 5200 when copying 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.510
 Now the preparation is an emotion 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:53.269
 Overall setting 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:56.319
 Set the color temperature and set the shutter speed to shoot 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.750
 It's too bright without cracks 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.200
 You can take such a picture 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.810
 This is yeah I the camera 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.569
 Of manual graduation necessary tool when to shoot 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:15.010
 Part 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:15.010
 Now I will try to make a listing and actually shoot it 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.720
 See you from now 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.490
 I think I will try to make East second-hand first 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.560
 Chilled Chinese 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.460
 Commercially available 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.210
 It is a footprint thing 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.110
 Material Guzai the bean sprouts 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.110
 No way 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.349
 Clan game 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.409
 Ham 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.090
 then 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:52.870
 It's a chicken, for the money and the light of the sun 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:56.180
 Then after that with silkworm egg 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.630
 It is a baseball game like this 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.870
 I will try to cook in the day 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.870
 It is 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.760
 It has been 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.800
 Four days 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.389
 There Huh 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.529
 Had 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.529
 Hmm 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.440
 Hmm 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.380
 Follow 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.030
 Hmm 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.800
 Hmm 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.770
 Oops 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.750
 Toshi 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.160
 Hmm 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.160
 Can not you remain 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.710
 voodoo 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.520
 Hmm 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.520
 Bach 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.689
 Well 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.289
 Since the cooking was completed 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:47.969
 I think to actually shoot 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:47.969
 Actually it looks like this 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:07:00.230
 Put ingredients in various ways 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:04.900
 In addition to fruit desserts in order to give a cool image 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.900
 I will try to set it up
