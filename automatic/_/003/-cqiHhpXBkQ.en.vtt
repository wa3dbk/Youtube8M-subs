00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
different settings on how the amp can

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.770 
different settings on how the amp can
break<00:00:38.070> up<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.490> how<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:38.880> take<00:00:39.090> drives<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
break up and how it can take drives and

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.270 
break up and how it can take drives and
how<00:00:39.840> saturated<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.620> get<00:00:40.770> even<00:00:40.830> at<00:00:41.100> lower

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
how saturated it can get even at lower

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.280 
how saturated it can get even at lower
levels<00:00:41.580> I've<00:00:42.360> got<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> amps<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.930> are<00:00:43.140> pretty

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
levels I've got the amps that are pretty

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.990 
levels I've got the amps that are pretty
conservative<00:00:43.620> volume<00:00:44.130> so<00:00:44.310> that<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.730> hear

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
conservative volume so that you can hear

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.750 
conservative volume so that you can hear
how<00:00:45.180> clean<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.720> is<00:00:45.810> and<00:00:46.080> how<00:00:46.110> usable<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.740> is<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
how clean it is and how usable it is and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.460 
how clean it is and how usable it is and
then<00:00:48.000> we're<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.720> getting<00:00:49.140> some<00:00:49.260> over

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
then we're going to be getting some over

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.069 
then we're going to be getting some over
different<00:00:49.770> tones<00:00:49.950> out<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:51.960> go

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
different tones out of it so here we go

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:41.590 
different tones out of it so here we go
this<00:00:52.290> is<00:00:52.410> silvertone<00:00:52.650> 1484

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.410 

so<00:01:42.229> if<00:01:42.619> you've<00:01:43.130> ever<00:01:43.340> done<00:01:43.850> any<00:01:44.030> work<00:01:44.180> with<00:01:44.390> a

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
so if you've ever done any work with a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.130 
so if you've ever done any work with a
Fender<00:01:45.020> Bassman<00:01:45.259> it<00:01:45.740> has<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.040> similar<00:01:47.140> initial

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
Fender Bassman it has a similar initial

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.810 
Fender Bassman it has a similar initial
tone<00:01:48.350> as<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.590> basement<00:01:49.040> in<00:01:49.070> my<00:01:49.220> opinion<00:01:49.549> it's

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
tone as a basement in my opinion it's

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.640 
tone as a basement in my opinion it's
very<00:01:50.000> very<00:01:50.210> clean<00:01:50.570> very<00:01:50.600> smooth<00:01:51.170> got<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.470> lot<00:01:51.619> of

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
very very clean very smooth got a lot of

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.490 
very very clean very smooth got a lot of
low-end<00:01:51.860> on<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:53.240> base<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.049> trouble<00:01:54.380> are

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
low-end on the base and the trouble are

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.560 
low-end on the base and the trouble are
straight<00:01:54.740> up<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:54.979> down<00:01:55.009> at<00:01:55.280> noon<00:01:55.490> on<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.270> amp

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
straight up and down at noon on the amp

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.530 
straight up and down at noon on the amp
so<00:01:56.899> it's<00:01:57.259> very<00:01:57.500> very<00:01:57.590> reactive<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.540> responds

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
so it's very very reactive it responds

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.180 
so it's very very reactive it responds
great<00:01:59.810> to<00:02:00.049> lots<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.470> different<00:02:00.530> environments
