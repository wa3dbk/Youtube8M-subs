00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 hello people my name is marion and 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.470
 welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:13.230
 issue of video review 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:14.910
 today, chili and jake are the usa 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.940
 then we'll start right here 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.609
 jimmy choo so the hec money is here 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.859
 little different than he has here his 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.279
 mouth wide open teeth 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.230
 are extremely well done and showed 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.939
 because his tongue is on Facebook 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.820
 Every case that I really cool 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.430
 think because very well modeled hair there 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.920
 You can not complain , either 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.579
 long as you know it and so must 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.160
 also be 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.430
 Although I find this open mouth face 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.170
 may not be that great but it fits 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.149
 but I still do not think so 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.030
 nice from our own opinion then we have 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.879
 here are the tattoos of him on one 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.690
 page and here are also a few 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:03.719
 days have clearly risen and have 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.310
 We also painted the wrist 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.500
 countries means in german and i have 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.090
 the two now still the title now 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.850
 there is one for you here are one 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.590
 small compilation that's the basic day 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.720
 team title so there are two 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.490
 different once these seem and 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.049
 once this planks version is called 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.540
 I think that's a bare one here 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.840
 So that's not the version 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.360
 really good color has for basic 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.590
 But it's still about me 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.329
 I want to show you that too 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.150
 always the differences in the titles 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.280
 looks then you stand on it 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.670
 pant is like her we are yellow 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.290
 Here's a blue white black design 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.930
 with the us household next to each other 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.520
 on it and graffiti looks quite cool 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.619
 In any case, no more came from 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.759
 we have this on the backside that is 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.009
 Already well done for one 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.540
 first of this pants pocket and the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.620
 other depends here a so 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.540
 and it says that's for basic 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.550
 already extremely detailed that can 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.790
 you just can not say otherwise have 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.520
 here are two mopeds and because of course 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.820
 the boots again with kickbacks from 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.280
 car bare is extremely cool mine 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.020
 opinion for the basics figure or 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.180
 many battle pack figures just what 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.210
 only 2 basic figures are quite 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.760
 his brother John sees it cool 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.010
 so in principle not great different 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.600
 facebook is just different so I think 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.820
 that's just cool somehow it looks 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.760
 Keep a little better 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.650
 a little fancier than the brother has 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.030
 So Jamie has both tattooed poor 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.070
 one can believe that one 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.640
 bit apart and he has 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.670
 a tattoo on the breast too 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.459
 and yakar are basically one too 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.500
 a little different but almost similar 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.959
 with his brother 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.790
 So you can not complain and 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.160
 Here you see , that's how it is 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.480
 shiny world comes mostly member 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.070
 figurines so if you here the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.200
 difference see that's really real 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.360
 how day and night the parts stop 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.680
 really much higher quality and 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.140
 That's why I can only recommend you 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.120
 if you title yourself as separately again 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.239
 buy then get this sham world 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.280
 And here are the clothes are yes 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.480
 right there right there so there are already 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.350
 no differences 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.230
 but in principle it is so that is 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.870
 So it's pretty much the same 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.320
 nothing else to do 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.750
 So matter so good job delivered 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.820
 at twin that's just really always 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.230
 relatively easy if you have the body in the 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.970
 have to take principle are only the poor 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.420
 otherwise you can actually here 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.489
 to use completely the same as in the 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.320
 other figure 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.299
 these are the jusos as always the question 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.060
 what do you think of the zambranos? 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.769
 descend from the day team champions die 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.420
 jusos just write me in the 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.760
 comments I celebrate the two 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.220
 in any case extremely blatant because the two 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.960
 really has 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.790
 really good team are and has also for 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.350
 the crowd with this a whole lot 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.860
 offer entertainment and that's just 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.330
 extremely cool what the two show there and 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.040
 so I like you in any case 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.750

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.700

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.260
 both figures and then I hope that 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.030

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.630
 is then give me where a thumb after 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.489
