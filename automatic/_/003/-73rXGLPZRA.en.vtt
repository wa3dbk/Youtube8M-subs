loads of users stoplight so it's

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.010 
loads of users stoplight so it's

power what they've done they've actually

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.040 
power what they've done they've actually
so<00:03:23.610> completely<00:03:24.060> different<00:03:24.360> exhaust<00:03:24.630> system

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
so completely different exhaust system

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.170 
so completely different exhaust system
on<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.590> Vettel<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.190> they've<00:03:26.400> also<00:03:26.580> remapped

on the Vettel and they've also remapped

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.880 
on the Vettel and they've also remapped
the<00:03:27.300> engine<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.020> they<00:03:28.170> say<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.530> gives<00:03:28.680> an

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
the engine and they say it gives an

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.070 
the engine and they say it gives an
extra<00:03:29.190> sort<00:03:29.640> of<00:03:29.700> 30<00:03:29.910> horsepower<00:03:30.390> or<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:30.870> so

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
extra sort of 30 horsepower or so so

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.250 
extra sort of 30 horsepower or so so
we're<00:03:31.230> up<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.820> 420<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.840> sort<00:03:34.020> of<00:03:34.080> matches

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
we're up to 420 so it sort of matches

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.220 
we're up to 420 so it sort of matches
something<00:03:34.950> like<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.220> KN<00:03:35.610> GTS<00:03:36.210> and<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:37.020> think

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
something like the KN GTS and I think

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.770 
something like the KN GTS and I think
that's<00:03:37.380> sort<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:37.860> its<00:03:38.010> closest<00:03:38.490> rival<00:03:38.780> I'm

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
that's sort of its closest rival I'm

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.090 
that's sort of its closest rival I'm
running<00:03:40.110> around<00:03:40.170> in<00:03:40.470> one<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.710> those<00:03:40.860> at<00:03:41.070> the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
running around in one of those at the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.180 
running around in one of those at the
moment<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:42.240> always<00:03:42.930> can't<00:03:43.710> get<00:03:43.860> over<00:03:44.040> how

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
moment and I always can't get over how

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.010 
moment and I always can't get over how
sort<00:03:44.460> of<00:03:44.520> heavy<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.120> behind<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.780> wheel

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
sort of heavy it is behind the wheel

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.960 
sort of heavy it is behind the wheel
there<00:03:46.260> with<00:03:46.350> all<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.620> little<00:03:46.920> systems<00:03:47.670> or<00:03:47.880> the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
there with all the little systems or the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.880 
there with all the little systems or the
steering<00:03:48.270> is<00:03:48.570> much<00:03:48.750> heavier<00:03:49.020> than<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:49.440> expect

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
steering is much heavier than you expect

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.000 
steering is much heavier than you expect
in<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.400> KN<00:03:50.790> but<00:03:51.270> this<00:03:51.390> car<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:52.530> Infinity<00:03:52.890> has

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
in the KN but this car the Infinity has

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.530 
in the KN but this car the Infinity has
always<00:03:53.130> felt<00:03:53.520> a<00:03:53.790> little<00:03:54.150> bit<00:03:54.300> more<00:03:54.480> nimble

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
always felt a little bit more nimble

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.420 
always felt a little bit more nimble
they<00:03:57.349> haven't<00:03:57.530> always<00:03:57.709> sounded<00:03:58.129> like<00:03:58.250> that

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
they haven't always sounded like that

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.270 
they haven't always sounded like that
though

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.699 

it<00:04:02.760> just<00:04:03.060> feels<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.480> little<00:04:03.510> bit<00:04:03.840> more<00:04:03.900> car<00:04:04.410> like

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
it just feels a little bit more car like

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.820 
it just feels a little bit more car like
this<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.209> KN<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:07.170> weights<00:04:07.410> are<00:04:07.620> about

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
this to the KN the weights are about

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.520 
this to the KN the weights are about
saying<00:04:08.130> it's<00:04:08.310> just<00:04:08.490> over<00:04:09.030> two<00:04:09.840> tons<00:04:10.140> they

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
saying it's just over two tons they

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.090 
saying it's just over two tons they
still<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:10.830> big<00:04:11.160> car<00:04:12.050> but<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.319> better<00:04:13.800> version

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
still a big car but the better version

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.300 
still a big car but the better version
they<00:04:14.490> say<00:04:14.700> they've<00:04:14.880> saved<00:04:15.060> about<00:04:15.889> forty<00:04:16.889> six

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
they say they've saved about forty six

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.940 
they say they've saved about forty six
kilos<00:04:17.820> I<00:04:17.850> think<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.269> is<00:04:18.419> part<00:04:19.200> of<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.500> is<00:04:19.709> the

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
kilos I think it is part of that is the

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.039 
kilos I think it is part of that is the
the<00:04:20.370> wheels<00:04:20.609> three<00:04:21.389> and<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.570> half<00:04:21.720> kilos

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
the wheels three and a half kilos

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.500 
the wheels three and a half kilos
lighter<00:04:22.470> per<00:04:23.040> corner<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:24.120> then<00:04:24.240> all<00:04:24.360> the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
lighter per corner and then all the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.600 
lighter per corner and then all the
carbon<00:04:24.930> pieces<00:04:25.500> have<00:04:25.650> all<00:04:25.770> sort<00:04:26.100> of<00:04:26.130> stacked

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
carbon pieces have all sort of stacked

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.870 
carbon pieces have all sort of stacked
up<00:04:26.850> forty<00:04:27.419> six<00:04:27.630> kilos<00:04:27.960> saves<00:04:28.260> quite<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.740> lot<00:04:29.010> the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
up forty six kilos saves quite a lot the

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.670 
up forty six kilos saves quite a lot the
other<00:04:29.940> thing<00:04:30.240> they've<00:04:30.389> done<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:30.810> gearbox

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
other thing they've done the gearbox

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.460 
other thing they've done the gearbox
blips<00:04:32.070> down<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:32.460> put<00:04:32.820> it<00:04:32.970> in<00:04:33.180> sport<00:04:33.840> mode<00:04:33.960> at<00:04:34.380> the

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
blips down I put it in sport mode at the

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.980 
blips down I put it in sport mode at the
moment<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:35.910> does<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.060> nice<00:04:36.270> little<00:04:36.480> blip<00:04:36.840> is

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
moment and it does a nice little blip is

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.580 
moment and it does a nice little blip is
he<00:04:37.110> had<00:04:37.200> breaking<00:04:37.590> into<00:04:37.830> corners<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:40.350> rides

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
he had breaking into corners the rides

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.680 
he had breaking into corners the rides
very<00:04:40.890> good<00:04:41.100> as<00:04:41.250> well<00:04:41.280> you'd<00:04:42.090> sort<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:42.450> worry

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
very good as well you'd sort of worry

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.150 
very good as well you'd sort of worry
because<00:04:42.870> they<00:04:43.020> saw<00:04:43.140> we've<00:04:43.470> lowered<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.950> by

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
because they saw we've lowered it by

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.250 
because they saw we've lowered it by
twenty<00:04:45.030> mill<00:04:45.240> but<00:04:45.600> they've<00:04:45.720> actually<00:04:45.810> kept

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
twenty mill but they've actually kept

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.770 
twenty mill but they've actually kept
the<00:04:46.350> spring<00:04:46.830> rate<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.190> same<00:04:47.460> so<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.330> ride<00:04:48.540> is

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
the spring rate the same so the ride is

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.870 
the spring rate the same so the ride is
near<00:04:49.230> identical<00:04:49.770> to<00:04:49.980> a<00:04:50.010> standard<00:04:50.490> version

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
near identical to a standard version

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.690 
near identical to a standard version
just<00:04:51.450> bit<00:04:52.140> lower<00:04:52.380> just<00:04:52.650> means<00:04:53.100> it<00:04:53.310> doesn't

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
just bit lower just means it doesn't

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.120 
just bit lower just means it doesn't
roll<00:04:53.850> quite<00:04:54.150> as<00:04:54.270> much<00:04:54.419> on<00:04:54.630> corners<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:56.070> it

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
roll quite as much on corners so it

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.020 
roll quite as much on corners so it
feels<00:04:56.280> pretty<00:04:56.520> good<00:04:56.729> behind<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.150> wheel

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
feels pretty good behind the wheel

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.200 
feels pretty good behind the wheel
going<00:04:58.660> through<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:58.960> basics<00:04:59.410> of<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.680> car

you'd expect and the talking about a

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
find the difference between 420 and 390

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.620 
find the difference between 420 and 390
horsepower<00:05:28.120> you<00:05:28.840> don't<00:05:29.020> really<00:05:29.320> notice<00:05:29.650> it<00:05:30.630> so

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
horsepower you don't really notice it so

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.020 
horsepower you don't really notice it so
there<00:05:31.750> are<00:05:31.810> some<00:05:32.020> downsides<00:05:32.290> to<00:05:32.770> this<00:05:32.860> car

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
there are some downsides to this car

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.740 
there are some downsides to this car
I'm<00:05:34.480> surprised<00:05:35.110> also<00:05:35.890> that<00:05:36.300> they<00:05:37.300> were<00:05:37.450> saying

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
I'm surprised also that they were saying

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.240 
I'm surprised also that they were saying
that<00:05:38.050> it<00:05:38.200> doesn't<00:05:38.350> actually<00:05:38.590> do<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:39.070> top

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
that it doesn't actually do the top

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.550 
that it doesn't actually do the top
speed<00:05:39.640> and<00:05:39.910> I'll<00:05:40.480> point<00:05:40.750> to<00:05:40.900> this<00:05:41.050> car<00:05:41.350> which

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
speed and I'll point to this car which

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.190 
speed and I'll point to this car which
is<00:05:41.590> a<00:05:41.740> 300<00:05:42.340> kilometer<00:05:43.120> an<00:05:43.390> hour<00:05:43.570> car<00:05:43.960> well

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
is a 300 kilometer an hour car well

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.230 
is a 300 kilometer an hour car well
they're<00:05:44.290> actually<00:05:44.410> admitting<00:05:45.040> it's<00:05:45.240> only

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
they're actually admitting it's only

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.440 
they're actually admitting it's only
about<00:05:46.770> 275<00:05:48.000> kilometres<00:05:49.000> an<00:05:49.120> hour<00:05:49.210> which<00:05:49.420> is

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
about 275 kilometres an hour which is

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.570 
about 275 kilometres an hour which is
still<00:05:49.690> pretty<00:05:49.990> quick<00:05:50.290> but<00:05:50.590> not<00:05:50.800> quite<00:05:51.430> as

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
still pretty quick but not quite as

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.850 
still pretty quick but not quite as
quick<00:05:51.820> as<00:05:51.970> they'd<00:05:52.180> hoped<00:05:52.440> good<00:05:53.440> job<00:05:53.650> really

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
quick as they'd hoped good job really

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.250 
quick as they'd hoped good job really
because<00:05:54.070> the<00:05:54.130> speed<00:05:54.370> only<00:05:54.520> goes<00:05:54.880> up<00:05:54.910> to<00:05:55.120> 218<00:05:55.870> so

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
because the speed only goes up to 218 so

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.470 
because the speed only goes up to 218 so
300<00:05:56.770> be<00:05:56.920> well<00:05:57.130> off<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.520> clock<00:05:59.010> so<00:06:00.010> I<00:06:00.420> wanted<00:06:01.420> to

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
300 be well off the clock so I wanted to

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.290 
300 be well off the clock so I wanted to
love<00:06:01.720> this<00:06:01.930> car<00:06:02.260> but<00:06:02.800> I'm<00:06:02.920> starting<00:06:03.580> to<00:06:03.610> couple

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
love this car but I'm starting to couple

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.620 
love this car but I'm starting to couple
sort<00:06:04.930> of<00:06:04.990> waver<00:06:05.230> I<00:06:05.730> think<00:06:06.730> you<00:06:07.030> know<00:06:07.150> you<00:06:07.210> throw

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
sort of waver I think you know you throw

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.000 
sort of waver I think you know you throw
that<00:06:07.840> price<00:06:08.230> a<00:06:08.260> hundred<00:06:08.950> thousand<00:06:09.670> pound<00:06:10.030> car

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
that price a hundred thousand pound car

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.240 
that price a hundred thousand pound car
you<00:06:12.010> expect<00:06:12.460> more<00:06:12.790> and<00:06:13.210> it<00:06:14.110> did<00:06:14.680> slightly

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
you expect more and it did slightly

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.750 
you expect more and it did slightly
better<00:06:15.460> than<00:06:15.640> the<00:06:15.820> standard<00:06:16.180> car<00:06:16.660> but<00:06:17.760> say

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
better than the standard car but say

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.900 
better than the standard car but say
it's<00:06:18.970> some<00:06:19.270> fifty<00:06:19.840> thousand<00:06:20.290> pounds<00:06:20.470> better

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
it's some fifty thousand pounds better

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.490 
it's some fifty thousand pounds better
no<00:06:21.910> no<00:06:22.690> not<00:06:23.020> if<00:06:23.770> your<00:06:23.980> name's<00:06:24.220> Vettel<00:06:24.850> all<00:06:25.500> then

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
no no not if your name's Vettel all then

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.050 
no no not if your name's Vettel all then
I<00:06:26.620> can<00:06:26.770> understand<00:06:27.130> why<00:06:27.280> you<00:06:27.340> buy<00:06:27.580> one<00:06:27.850> or<00:06:28.000> if

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
I can understand why you buy one or if

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.030 
I can understand why you buy one or if
you<00:06:28.150> want<00:06:28.330> to<00:06:28.390> be<00:06:28.510> different<00:06:28.780> well<00:06:29.560> I<00:06:29.590> can<00:06:29.890> also

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
you want to be different well I can also

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.700 
you want to be different well I can also
understand<00:06:30.580> because<00:06:30.760> it<00:06:30.880> does<00:06:31.090> look

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
understand because it does look

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.660 
understand because it does look
distinctive<00:06:32.710> should<00:06:32.920> we<00:06:33.010> say<00:06:33.300> but<00:06:34.800> fx50<00:06:35.800> needs

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
distinctive should we say but fx50 needs

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.160 
distinctive should we say but fx50 needs
more<00:06:36.820> help<00:06:37.000> than<00:06:37.150> that<00:06:37.210> it's<00:06:37.540> not<00:06:37.750> a<00:06:37.780> pretty

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
more help than that it's not a pretty

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.980 
more help than that it's not a pretty
car<00:06:38.500> from<00:06:38.740> the<00:06:38.860> outside<00:06:39.310> and<00:06:39.610> I<00:06:40.510> feel

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
car from the outside and I feel

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.410 
car from the outside and I feel
everything<00:06:41.470> they<00:06:42.190> put<00:06:42.430> on<00:06:42.580> this<00:06:42.730> car<00:06:42.970> hasn't

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.420 
everything they put on this car hasn't

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.189 
everything they put on this car hasn't
really<00:06:43.870> held

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 
really held

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.990 
really held
so<00:06:46.199> no<00:06:46.530> I<00:06:46.830> can't<00:06:47.220> see<00:06:47.400> I'm<00:06:47.490> going<00:06:47.639> to<00:06:47.669> be<00:06:47.790> buying

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
so no I can't see I'm going to be buying

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.419 
so no I can't see I'm going to be buying
one<00:06:48.180> of<00:06:48.210> these
