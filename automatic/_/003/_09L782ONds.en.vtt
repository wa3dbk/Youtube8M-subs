anything<00:00:57.360> about<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.840> because<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:59.070> certain

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
anything about that because the certain

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.240 
anything about that because the certain
settings<00:00:59.760> they<00:00:59.879> give<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.680> aren't<00:01:01.680> perfect
