00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hey i want you in the video once 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.710
 show how to fold your eyes fold 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.840
 I could've got one eye ever 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.500
 before made-up and the other not much 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.690
 you can see here is just now 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.940
 but no concealer as well 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.689
 what is it just that here once the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.250
 difference detects lye fold yes am 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.010
 keep your eyes open 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.689
 In any case, always take an eye cream 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.939
 It does not necessarily have to be used now 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.040
 be expensive 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.960
 but not so cheap that the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.820
 Middle class to really always in the morning 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.680
 and use a good excuse in the evening 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.600
 that the eyes settle down a bit 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.579
 have moisture and become one 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.010
 they can fix that bit 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.320
 a little bit careful anke and yes again 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.230
 to regenerate 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.620
 I have two products for you here 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.180
 Every one of you must know if that's good 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.640
 place or not in my opinion 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.250
 do the products that stop for 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.829
 really really good and they are showing 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.130
 I'll tell you these are products of 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:11.700
 benefit once from the hula lift and the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.710
 Racebets room for that I show in front of you 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.689
 you have to keep your eyes closed 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.600
 that user can do the other thing 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.720
 use 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.590
 I applied my eyes cream 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:34.579
 and then we give this or 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:37.200
 lift here and knock something 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:41.790
 like an eye cream or like a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.189
 concealer and this is a little bit 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.470
 puffed up it has a lot alot 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.770
 Feel the moisture also released 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.299
 move in shortly 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.820
 you have to go over it even me 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.790
 if you just hide the folds now 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.939
 Nobody wants to adhere to that 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.230
 just a great alternative really 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.270
 apply 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.070
 and you really notice a difference 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.000
 You can still do it with a loose powder 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.500
 row from 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.150
 but I want a little later 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.030
 concealer give that we do 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.720
 now again not common 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.020
 then we'll go in now 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.520
 concealer over it you can do that too 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.500
 the other way around do the concealer 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.290
 and then the clerks with me then 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.640
 even too moisturizing 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.630
 so if you really dry too 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:37.340
 have eyes again and make your eyes 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:42.680
 Do it the other way and we'll knock it 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.760
 now again nice with it 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.470
 be hidden behind the entire eye shadow 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.380
 and it does not go too much in the folds 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.170
 we do not take any fight live no 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.240
 meat eats too tight and straight in one 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.470
 certain age around the eyes really 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.390
 not so long , we have between 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.800
 I am still very young when you are now 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.660
 Maybe that's the way 30 might end 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.580
 It is almost not the eyes anymore 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.910
 look if you want I show it 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.330
 once you should on panzers keep that 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.580
 does not know how to use a camouflage 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.390
 we are really too tight and this one here 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.500
 is really a super is a great 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.220
 Product is a mix of it 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.500
 concealer and camouflage really great 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.650
 That's how you see it and you notice everyone 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.180
 in my opinion, the difference 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.180
 I might even make a girl 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.720
 time I have also just does that fit 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.950
 demonstrate 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.950
 with shadow 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.010
 everything completely covered what still 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.040
 should be considered 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.230
 please do not use solid in any case 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.569
 Brothers if you keep your eyes open 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.510
 have and used a solid powder and 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.190
 The on here there continues 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.760
 really pure in the folds 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.220
 best used no powder or 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.160
 if you really have to use it 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:31.340
 would like to take loses then one 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:34.370
 Brush off and just lightly 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.090
 about that by that just not 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.090
 can settle 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.160
 and I think you could see it and 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.800
 I hope I could do that too 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.470
 could help that are really times one 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.740
 two favorites against dark circles 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.780
 Eyeshadows unfold in front of everything 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.830
 this alone would be the product 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.229
 rich and cream really in the morning and 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.560
 Drink a lot in the evening, whatever it is 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.229
 very important and yes i hope that i will 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.880
 could help you with that 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.880
 until next time maybe teams
