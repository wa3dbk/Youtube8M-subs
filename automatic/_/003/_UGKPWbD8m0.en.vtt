rifle<00:01:55.180> floating<00:01:56.170> free<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:56.800> to<00:01:56.860> speak<00:01:57.190> in<00:01:57.370> the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
rifle floating free so to speak in the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.730 
rifle floating free so to speak in the
safe<00:01:57.930> because<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.140> doesn't<00:01:59.350> actually<00:01:59.440> have<00:01:59.710> to

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
safe because it doesn't actually have to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.180 
safe because it doesn't actually have to
lean<00:02:00.010> up<00:02:00.040> against<00:02:00.610> anything<00:02:01.620> so<00:02:02.620> all<00:02:02.830> we<00:02:03.010> did

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
lean up against anything so all we did

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.880 
lean up against anything so all we did
was<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:03.820> made<00:02:04.570> my<00:02:04.870> wife<00:02:05.050> help<00:02:05.380> me<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:05.770> she

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
was I made my wife help me and she

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.140 
was I made my wife help me and she
didn't<00:02:06.070> want<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.280> be<00:02:06.370> filmed<00:02:06.640> so<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.000> guys

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
didn't want to be filmed so you guys

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.990 
didn't want to be filmed so you guys
don't<00:02:07.390> get<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.780> how-to<00:02:08.229> video<00:02:08.769> we<00:02:09.610> just<00:02:09.640> laid

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
don't get the how-to video we just laid

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.809 
don't get the how-to video we just laid
the<00:02:10.209> piece<00:02:10.420> out<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:11.019> stapled<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:11.920> down<00:02:12.099> using

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
the piece out I stapled it down using

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.099 
the piece out I stapled it down using
the<00:02:12.939> staple<00:02:13.389> gun<00:02:13.420> doesn't<00:02:13.749> have<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.019> be

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.109 
the staple gun doesn't have to be

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.470 
the staple gun doesn't have to be
perfect<00:02:14.730> nobody's<00:02:15.730> ever<00:02:15.790> gonna<00:02:15.969> see<00:02:16.239> it<00:02:16.329> it's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
perfect nobody's ever gonna see it it's

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.300 
perfect nobody's ever gonna see it it's
on<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.659> bottom<00:02:16.989> of<00:02:17.079> a<00:02:17.170> shelf

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
on the bottom of a shelf

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.970 
on the bottom of a shelf
then<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.790> obviously<00:02:19.120> use<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.660> 3m<00:02:20.560> spray

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
then I obviously use this 3m spray

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.059 
then I obviously use this 3m spray
adhesive<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:23.080> hopefully<00:02:23.470> keep<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.920> from

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
adhesive to hopefully keep it from

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.800 
adhesive to hopefully keep it from
peeling<00:02:24.459> up<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.850> middle<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.330> everything

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
peeling up in the middle and everything

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.170 
peeling up in the middle and everything
I<00:02:26.160> used<00:02:27.160> my<00:02:27.400> trusty<00:02:28.090> Spyderco<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:30.610> cut<00:02:30.819> out<00:02:30.940> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
I used my trusty Spyderco to cut out the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.990 
I used my trusty Spyderco to cut out the
slots<00:02:31.690> right<00:02:32.050> here<00:02:32.319> which<00:02:32.950> do<00:02:33.160> get<00:02:33.400> used<00:02:33.670> as

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
slots right here which do get used as

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.760 
slots right here which do get used as
well<00:02:34.180> as<00:02:34.300> tall<00:02:34.569> guns<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:35.140> go<00:02:35.290> up<00:02:35.440> through<00:02:35.680> the

the<00:02:59.980> final<00:03:00.610> video<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.450> install<00:03:02.140> video<00:03:02.560> I'm

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
the final video the install video I'm

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.580 
the final video the install video I'm
hand-holding<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.600> video<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.140> hopefully

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
hand-holding this video so hopefully

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.759 
hand-holding this video so hopefully
nobody<00:03:05.860> gets<00:03:05.920> dizzy<00:03:06.340> for<00:03:06.790> me<00:03:06.970> uh

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
nobody gets dizzy for me uh

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.770 
nobody gets dizzy for me uh
shaking<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.860> camera<00:03:09.069> too<00:03:09.459> much<00:03:09.700> but<00:03:10.540> that's

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
shaking the camera too much but that's

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.290 
shaking the camera too much but that's
what<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.319> looks<00:03:11.350> like<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:12.640> can<00:03:12.819> see<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.030> made

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
what it looks like you can see I made

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.210 
what it looks like you can see I made
quite<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.780> bit<00:03:14.110> more<00:03:14.350> room<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:14.830> could<00:03:15.010> probably

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
quite a bit more room I could probably

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.190 
quite a bit more room I could probably
easily<00:03:15.730> get<00:03:16.060> at<00:03:16.150> least<00:03:16.269> one<00:03:16.510> more<00:03:16.540> gun<00:03:16.930> right

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
easily get at least one more gun right

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.550 
easily get at least one more gun right
there<00:03:17.819> probably<00:03:18.819> two<00:03:19.450> or<00:03:19.480> three<00:03:19.660> guns<00:03:20.170> right

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
there probably two or three guns right

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.949 
there probably two or three guns right
here<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:21.670> then<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:21.880> could<00:03:22.060> probably<00:03:22.329> even<00:03:22.660> if<00:03:22.870> I

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
here and then I could probably even if I

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.710 
here and then I could probably even if I
needed<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.260> run<00:03:23.709> two<00:03:24.070> or<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:24.519> sideways<00:03:25.420> right

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
needed to run two or so sideways right

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.370 
needed to run two or so sideways right
there<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:27.730> works<00:03:27.940> really<00:03:28.329> well<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:29.019> can<00:03:29.049> see

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
there it works really well you can see

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.370 
there it works really well you can see
the<00:03:29.590> guns<00:03:29.829> are<00:03:30.190> staying<00:03:31.180> up<00:03:31.299> nice<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:32.140> stay

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
the guns are staying up nice to stay

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.800 
the guns are staying up nice to stay
right<00:03:32.620> in<00:03:32.680> their<00:03:32.920> spot<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:34.299> can<00:03:34.480> see<00:03:34.660> with

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
right in their spot you can see with

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.810 
right in their spot you can see with
these<00:03:34.959> ARS<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:35.739> stuff<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.190> pistol<00:03:36.579> grips

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
these ARS and stuff the pistol grips

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.810 
these ARS and stuff the pistol grips
make<00:03:37.000> them<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.209> pain<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.660> butt<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.820> actually

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
make them a pain in the butt to actually

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.449 
make them a pain in the butt to actually
store<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:40.360> can<00:03:40.450> see<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.660> can<00:03:40.870> kind<00:03:41.079> of

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
store and you can see I can kind of

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.289 
store and you can see I can kind of
intertwine<00:03:42.459> them<00:03:42.700> weave<00:03:42.970> them<00:03:44.910> we<00:03:45.910> will<00:03:46.120> min

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
intertwine them weave them we will min

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.289 
intertwine them weave them we will min
there<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:46.870> they<00:03:47.130> store<00:03:48.130> stack<00:03:48.670> a<00:03:48.700> little<00:03:49.030> bit

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
there so they store stack a little bit

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.319 
there so they store stack a little bit
more<00:03:50.200> efficiently<00:03:50.829> pistol<00:03:51.700> grips<00:03:51.910> are<00:03:52.090> just

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
more efficiently pistol grips are just
