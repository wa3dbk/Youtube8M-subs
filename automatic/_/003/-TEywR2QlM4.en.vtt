was like I said I ordered these almost a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.060 
was like I said I ordered these almost a
month<00:01:10.409> ago<00:01:11.210> but<00:01:12.530> instead<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.650> paying<00:01:13.830> for

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
month ago but instead of paying for

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.740 
month ago but instead of paying for
eighty<00:01:14.670> dollars<00:01:15.000> from<00:01:15.119> them<00:01:15.270> at<00:01:15.390> best<00:01:15.570> buy<00:01:15.720> i

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
eighty dollars from them at best buy i

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.240

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.580 
it's a little cushioned up here and then
here<00:02:23.240> you<00:02:23.390> can<00:02:23.600> see<00:02:23.780> it's<00:02:23.900> like<00:02:23.990> an<00:02:24.170> entire

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
here you can see it's like an entire

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.580 
here you can see it's like an entire
cushion<00:02:25.130> or<00:02:25.220> running<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:26.239> thing<00:02:27.250> around<00:02:28.250> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
cushion or running the thing around the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.860 
cushion or running the thing around the
the<00:02:30.590> earpiece<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.370> guess<00:02:31.610> then<00:02:32.330> here<00:02:32.570> it's<00:02:32.690> got

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
the earpiece I guess then here it's got

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.710 
the earpiece I guess then here it's got
like<00:02:33.050> they're<00:02:33.200> rectangular<00:02:33.970> noodle<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.209> guess

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
like they're rectangular noodle I guess

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.430 
like they're rectangular noodle I guess
a<00:02:36.940> cord<00:02:37.940> rather<00:02:38.209> than<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.570> circle<00:02:38.930> ones<00:02:39.110> on

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
a cord rather than the circle ones on

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.060 
a cord rather than the circle ones on
most<00:02:40.220> headphones<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.810> then<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:45.860> just

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
most headphones and and then it just

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.760 
most headphones and and then it just
leads<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.430> standard<00:02:47.000> 3.5<00:02:47.959> millimeter

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
leads to standard 3.5 millimeter

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.759 
leads to standard 3.5 millimeter
headphone<00:02:49.070> jack<00:02:50.049> it<00:02:51.049> doesn't<00:02:51.350> have<00:02:51.470> like<00:02:51.680> a

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
headphone jack it doesn't have like a

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.910 
headphone jack it doesn't have like a
microphone<00:02:52.070> or<00:02:52.280> anything<00:02:52.640> like<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:53.920> but

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
microphone or anything like that but

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.560 
microphone or anything like that but
yeah<00:02:55.070> sorry<00:02:55.519> that<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:55.940> wasn't<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.360> full

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570

unboxing<00:02:57.170> like<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.560> wished<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.100> would<00:02:58.250> be

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
unboxing like I wished it would be

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.430 
unboxing like I wished it would be
because<00:03:00.890> my<00:03:01.850> stupid<00:03:02.420> phone<00:03:02.750> ran<00:03:03.019> out<00:03:03.049> of<00:03:03.230> space

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
because my stupid phone ran out of space

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.490 
because my stupid phone ran out of space
um<00:03:04.450> just<00:03:05.450> barely<00:03:05.780> like<00:03:06.760> five<00:03:07.760> seconds<00:03:08.380> if<00:03:09.380> I

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
um just barely like five seconds if I

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.750 
um just barely like five seconds if I
would<00:03:09.620> have<00:03:09.680> had<00:03:09.769> five<00:03:10.040> more<00:03:10.280> seconds<00:03:10.610> of

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
would have had five more seconds of

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.940 
would have had five more seconds of
space<00:03:10.970> that<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.480> could<00:03:12.019> have<00:03:12.140> done<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.320> but<00:03:12.709> I

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
space that I could have done it but I

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.140 
space that I could have done it but I
didn't<00:03:13.910> um<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:15.709> yeah<00:03:16.190> next<00:03:16.430> time<00:03:16.670> I<00:03:16.880> do<00:03:16.940> an

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
didn't um so yeah next time I do an

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.520 
didn't um so yeah next time I do an
unboxing<00:03:17.269> I'll<00:03:17.720> make<00:03:17.900> sure<00:03:18.080> that<00:03:18.110> i<00:03:18.320> actually

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
unboxing I'll make sure that i actually

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.190 
unboxing I'll make sure that i actually
have<00:03:19.090> enough<00:03:20.090> space<00:03:20.330> on<00:03:20.540> my<00:03:20.690> phone<00:03:20.900> for

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
have enough space on my phone for

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.130 
have enough space on my phone for
however<00:03:21.590> long<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.190> would<00:03:22.310> take<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.989> I'll

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
however long it would take and I'll

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.350 
however long it would take and I'll
