this green foam humidifier unit that

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.560 
this green foam humidifier unit that
came<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.590> did<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.040> just

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
came with it and so what I did is I just

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.690 
came with it and so what I did is I just
put<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.750> right<00:00:36.899> there<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.350> then<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:38.309> put<00:00:38.550> one

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
put that right there and then I put one

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.280 
put that right there and then I put one
of<00:00:38.820> these<00:00:38.910> packets<00:00:39.629> that's<00:00:39.780> getting<00:00:40.050> low<00:00:40.260> and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
of these packets that's getting low and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.590 
of these packets that's getting low and
I<00:00:40.500> put<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.739> right<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.550> front<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.360> that

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
I put that right in front just like that

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.700 
I put that right in front just like that
and<00:00:43.940> what<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.120> does<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.719> recharges<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.469> so

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and what that does is it recharges it so

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.740 
and what that does is it recharges it so
for<00:00:47.370> instance<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> bottom<00:00:48.270> drawer<00:00:48.420> which<00:00:48.600> is

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
for instance the bottom drawer which is

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.799 
for instance the bottom drawer which is
farthest<00:00:49.230> away<00:00:49.820> it's<00:00:50.820> most<00:00:51.149> likely<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.539> get

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
farthest away it's most likely to get

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.110 
farthest away it's most likely to get
emptied<00:00:52.620> quicker<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.430> when<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.699> feel<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
emptied quicker so when I feel it

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.450 
emptied quicker so when I feel it
getting<00:00:54.329> empty<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.780> put<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.860> back<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> top

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
getting empty I put it back to the top

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.560 
getting empty I put it back to the top
put<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.600> up<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:58.010> put<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.039> down<00:00:59.340> there

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
put the one up here put that down there

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.360 
put the one up here put that down there
close<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.500> good<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.859> go<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
close it up and it's good to go and the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.619 
close it up and it's good to go and the
same<00:01:02.670> thing<00:01:02.879> goes<00:01:02.910> with<00:01:03.180> these<00:01:03.270> little<00:01:03.510> guys

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629

put that in front you should be fine
one<00:01:56.310> time<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.579> had<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:56.939> green<00:01:57.450> humidifier

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
one time I had this green humidifier

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.209 
one time I had this green humidifier
like<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.079> was<00:02:01.200> kind<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.469> cascaded<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
like this so it was kind of cascaded and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.130 
like this so it was kind of cascaded and
I<00:02:02.610> found<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.119> tiny<00:02:03.329> bit<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.750> mold<00:02:03.930> like

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
I found just a tiny bit of mold like

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.670 
I found just a tiny bit of mold like
right<00:02:04.350> here<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.340> was<00:02:05.520> not<00:02:06.000> good<00:02:06.299> because

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
right here so that was not good because

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.400 
right here so that was not good because
this<00:02:07.680> wasn't<00:02:08.099> sucking<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.610> humidity<00:02:09.410> so

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
this wasn't sucking up the humidity so

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.470 
this wasn't sucking up the humidity so
it<00:02:10.500> was<00:02:10.619> too<00:02:10.800> much<00:02:10.979> humidity<00:02:11.190> for<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.090> cigar

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
it was too much humidity for the cigar

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.220 
it was too much humidity for the cigar
so<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.200> just<00:02:13.319> wanna<00:02:13.500> make<00:02:13.620> sure<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.920> put
