00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.669 
if you're doing something just kind of
quick<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.270> easy<00:01:49.539> I<00:01:49.990> guess<00:01:50.049> they<00:01:50.349> would<00:01:50.469> work

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
quick and easy I guess they would work

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.510 
quick and easy I guess they would work
but<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.799> white<00:01:53.950> one<00:01:54.159> doesn't<00:01:54.490> really

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
but like the white one doesn't really

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.749 
but like the white one doesn't really
even<00:01:54.819> show<00:01:55.209> up<00:01:55.389> too<00:01:55.779> well<00:01:55.810> but<00:01:56.709> it<00:01:57.159> depends<00:01:57.700> on

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
even show up too well but it depends on

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.059 
even show up too well but it depends on
again<00:01:58.149> what<00:01:58.509> you<00:01:58.630> want<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.840> use<00:01:58.990> so<00:01:59.619> I<00:01:59.649> will<00:01:59.979> be

again what you want to use so I will be

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.309 
again what you want to use so I will be
