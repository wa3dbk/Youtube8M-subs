00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.680 
marks like right here and you can't see
it<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:39.660> would<00:02:40.500> say<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.520> only<00:02:41.550> difference<00:02:41.940> I

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
it so I would say the only difference I

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.260 
it so I would say the only difference I
see<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:43.530> just<00:02:44.480> coverage<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:47.550> obviously<00:02:47.880> I

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
see is just coverage and I obviously I

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.530 
see is just coverage and I obviously I
had<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.600> use<00:02:48.780> more<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:50.300> don't<00:02:51.300> know<00:02:51.510> I

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
had to use more of it but I don't know I

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.620 
had to use more of it but I don't know I
guess<00:02:52.280> if<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.430> didn't<00:02:53.700> know<00:02:53.790> any<00:02:53.940> better<00:02:54.030> I'd

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
guess if I didn't know any better I'd

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.190 
guess if I didn't know any better I'd
pick<00:02:55.050> I'd<00:02:55.290> go<00:02:55.500> with<00:02:55.650> either<00:02:55.860> one<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.660> since

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
pick I'd go with either one and since

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.440 
pick I'd go with either one and since
I've<00:02:58.470> had<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:59.010> NW<00:02:59.670> 45<00:03:00.210> for<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.870> longest<00:03:02.450> I'm

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
I've had the NW 45 for the longest I'm

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.850 
I've had the NW 45 for the longest I'm
probably<00:03:03.690> just<00:03:03.840> going<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.140> keep<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.590> one<00:03:04.650> I

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
probably just going to keep that one I

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.260 
probably just going to keep that one I
might<00:03:05.280> use<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.240> NC<00:03:06.810> 50<00:03:07.410> all<00:03:08.010> week<00:03:08.670> this<00:03:08.970> week

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
might use the NC 50 all week this week

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.990 
might use the NC 50 all week this week
just<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.690> see<00:03:10.250> what<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.370> looks<00:03:11.520> like<00:03:11.610> in

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000
