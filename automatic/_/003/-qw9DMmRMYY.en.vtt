00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
alright guys here it is the VB in

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:11.349 
amplifier eye and an O D 1500 I got it

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.640 
amplifier eye and an O D 1500 I got it
hooked<00:00:11.470> up<00:00:11.710> I<00:00:12.700> like<00:00:13.690> to<00:00:13.840> wait<00:00:13.990> a<00:00:14.019> logo<00:00:14.410> lights

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
hooked up I like to wait a logo lights

hooked up I like to wait a logo lights
up<00:00:14.830> in<00:00:14.950> the<00:00:15.010> middle<00:00:15.309> it's<00:00:15.880> nice<00:00:16.059> little<00:00:16.359> touch

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
up in the middle it's nice little touch

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.890 
up in the middle it's nice little touch
I<00:00:17.230> gave<00:00:18.130> it<00:00:18.250> an<00:00:18.340> overall<00:00:18.760> quick<00:00:19.180> test<00:00:19.449> and<00:00:19.720> it

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
I gave it an overall quick test and it

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.660 
I gave it an overall quick test and it
is<00:00:19.930> hitting<00:00:20.410> harder<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:23.260> is<00:00:23.320> on<00:00:23.560> to<00:00:23.949> our<00:00:24.189> D<00:00:24.369> 12

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.600 

I<00:02:43.010> gotta<00:02:43.700> set<00:02:44.060> up<00:02:44.319> right<00:02:45.319> before<00:02:45.620> clipping<00:02:46.370> I

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
I gotta set up right before clipping I

I gotta set up right before clipping I
hadn't<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.239> know<00:02:47.330> I<00:02:47.360> do<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.660> by<00:02:47.780> ear

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
hadn't you know I do it by ear

hadn't you know I do it by ear
old-school<00:02:48.650> style<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.310> would<00:02:50.000> like<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.450> get<00:02:50.569> the

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
old-school style I would like to get the

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.449 
old-school style I would like to get the

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
SMD DD one distortion detector it's

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.610 
SMD DD one distortion detector it's
pretty<00:02:55.730> darn<00:02:55.880> close<00:02:58.180> but<00:02:59.180> that's<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.620> I'll

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
pretty darn close but that's it I'll

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.140 
pretty darn close but that's it I'll
make<00:03:00.980> another<00:03:01.220> video<00:03:01.430> I'm<00:03:01.730> gonna<00:03:01.819> play<00:03:02.000> on

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
make another video I'm gonna play on

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.309 
make another video I'm gonna play on
some<00:03:02.510> deep<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:03.050> see<00:03:03.170> how<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.440> does<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:05.319> let

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
some deep and see how it does and let

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.280 
some deep and see how it does and let
you<00:03:06.440> see<00:03:06.560> how<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:06.890> sounds
