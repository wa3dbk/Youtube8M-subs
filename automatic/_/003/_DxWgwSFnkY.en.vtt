00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.899
 male 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:21.520
 Hi everyone who is watching the video The border is today The toy to introduce today has already seen this 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.520
 I think you understand, but if I shout, it will be the spring number 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.040
 Bandai Arms Change Series &amp; Lock Vehicle Kamen Rider Kurokage Ano 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.040
 It is a tulip hopper set 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.660
 The back is like this 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.730
 Then let's take it out of the box 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.370
 The 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.750
 Inside is a part from the body of the black Kamen Rider black shadow and ax part 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.230
 It says to wait for the weapon shadow which was impressive even in the play 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.980
 And 6 b-kun of tulip hopper contains 10 deep hopper 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:05.489
 Let's have a closer look at the review to you first the Soviet Union was a picture in the next video 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:11.000
 It has been black in silver paint is decorated with paintings were elements of black Kage 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.000
 It details of the up is something this side of the head is cool 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:22.870
 For the movement of the body, please refer to the reviews of the previous Arm's Change seeds 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.980
 To be able to take a pose that envisions to some extent freely, such as this feeling or such feeling 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.790
 I can 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.020
 The Tteyuu black body Te Arms change series Kedomo I thought they look this way 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.420
 There was not 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.170
 Something really 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.300
 I There is a sportiness that was ninja like a zing 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.360
 Sataya to Kuroko has a motif 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.660
 I thought it would be a recolor of the body of Samurai, though 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.660
 There is a lock seed holder on the outside body . 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:51.580
 The body of this Zangetsu does not have a lock seed holder 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.500
 There are 2 holes in the side of the belt in the body of the black hair and when this folder is removed 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.320
 Will be exactly the same 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.610
 It goods body of black Kage will be to re-color of the body of Zangetsu 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.840
 Just by changing the accent color to be the color to be added to the second color and so impressive 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.430
 It will change 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.420
 Next, we will prepare to mount the pinecone arms on the black shadow body 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:16.490
 The preparation will store the kite parts in the kite parts as usual 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:20.180
 First of all there are front and back parts of this part 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:25.250
 It looks like there is no difference if this looks behind you 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.880
 The part in front is a plane here, and the part in back is along this detail 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:33.720
 I draw a gentle curve 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.720
 How to expand the pot is very easy First open four 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.970
 Expand parts before hitting the chest 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:48.500
 This completes the deployment to expand the back parts 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:53.530
 We attach here of å…œ part here of back part 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.530
 Pale color before the earlier you back in the reverse order 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.780
 side 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.780
 This is completed 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.420
 Well then I'll keep you waiting arms Chin edit 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.020
 Hmm 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.850
 It becomes like this 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:19.569
 It is alle seen in the play 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.560
 N between the roller large lotus-chan was healthy 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.560
 Expand the cocoon 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.810
 It is Kansai now rider black shadow 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.370
 This cool 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.750
 dangerous 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.750
 It looks cool 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:56.200
 It is in the middle of the play as well as the new arm series so far . The quality is very high. 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.680
 Let's not immediately have a Kagematsu 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.690
 Well this is this this 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.380
 Cool cool 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:10.190
 Somewhere in black deer brutal and cunning 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.140
 I feel to do to really out to have it Hmm true 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.800
 It is a rider that suits 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.980
 Upper part of the head is up 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:24.070
 This clear part is so big 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:28.150
 Silver and red paint has been applied to the left Nakano compound eye it looks very beautiful 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:32.350
 Kai's motif has the same motif as the subject, right? 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.860
 Is this feeling that the general soldiers but I do not know What do you wonder there is a terminology say 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.790
 Ne 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.770
 Speak a little the content of the main story 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:43.040
 I think I but has appeared also as a black shadow trooper even in the play 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:46.430
 I wondered where the difference between the Kurokage troopers was 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.780
 Black shadow of the time when Hase had been mounted here in yellow 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:54.810
 At the time of the trooper, it was a different color, and after that the battle driver is the trooper child 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:59.760
 We war do you place that has become the very driver of 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.860
 This is my personal subjectivity to the end but it was blackish a little more than black 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:07.110
 I felt like that 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:11.580
 Well charred in the either the Arms change series it had looked black in the degree of light 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:14.830
 It is expressed in char and only this chest is painted black 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:21.240
 Some minor details aside, I will release this black shadow 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.240
 I was really looking forward to it and I can not forget that scene if I say black shadows. 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.409
 I am Armored Rider Kurokage and this is 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.039
 Grison 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:34.179
 Oh, this is all right for this 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:37.209
 Arms change series is very good, but like this the seismic isolation in a play like this 

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:42.249
 The Tteyuu can reproduce is I think one of the attractive 

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:46.400
 It is a comparison of the glyceraldehyde-Don earlier this Kedomo I was talking about the color of the black Kage 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:50.810
 I understand well that Tteyuu are blackish doing what no Well and arranging a green 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:54.790
 More than anything I thought that it makes sense that these two people are aligned in this way 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:58.980
 Hey There was also when I fought in the springboard at gree ThatLookLikeThis 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.980
 It is possible to hold both hands without problems 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.660
 So I would like to review this Arms Change Series Kamen Rider Kurokage 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.820
 Maybe 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:10.870
 It is very well done, but in the next video, it will be together with the previous arms change series 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.770
 Side by side or in 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:18.490
 I would like to wear this pinecone arms to other riders 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:22.690
 Thank you so much for your regular subscriptions and comments 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:24.650
 It will be a great encouragement From now on such as Kamen Rider Samurai and train squadron Tokyuger 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:29.200
 I would like to do a review, so please do it 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:32.070
