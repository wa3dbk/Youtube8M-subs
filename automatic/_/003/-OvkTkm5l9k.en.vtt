well we all know the cheat we use three
arc<00:01:02.609> unlock<00:01:03.090> right<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.660> mean<00:01:03.930> we've<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.820> used

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
arc unlock right I mean we've all used

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.440 
arc unlock right I mean we've all used
that<00:01:05.970> probably<00:01:06.619> for<00:01:07.619> most<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.189> us<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.700> um

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.109 

there<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.750> uh<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:14.000> did<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.299> right<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.320> did

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
there is uh I did this right here I did

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:27.550 
there is uh I did this right here I did
three<00:01:18.119> arc<00:01:20.240> space<00:01:22.790> unlock

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:38.289 

space<00:01:28.630> derives<00:01:30.220> D<00:01:31.220> or<00:01:31.580> space<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:37.250> this<00:01:37.430> so

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
space derives D or space so this so

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.230 
space derives D or space so this so
output<00:01:39.340> online<00:01:41.140> derive<00:01:42.140> right<00:01:42.560> there<00:01:42.799> so<00:01:43.250> you

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
output online derive right there so you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.270 
output online derive right there so you
know<00:01:44.390> I<00:01:44.420> go<00:01:44.780> ahead<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.020> over<00:01:45.409> here<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:47.119> enter

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
know I go ahead and over here to enter

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.190 
know I go ahead and over here to enter
and<00:01:49.280> it<00:01:49.909> goes<00:01:50.119> cheat<00:01:51.080> enabled<00:01:52.720> right<00:01:53.720> there<00:01:53.930> so

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
and it goes cheat enabled right there so

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.910 
and it goes cheat enabled right there so
