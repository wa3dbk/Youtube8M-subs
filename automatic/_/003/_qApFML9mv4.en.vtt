I'm pretty excited about these guys
we're<00:02:37.590> gonna<00:02:37.680> get<00:02:37.859> rid<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.040> all<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.640> other

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
we're gonna get rid of all the other

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.440 
we're gonna get rid of all the other
sippy<00:02:39.060> cups

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
sippy cups

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.390 
sippy cups
and<00:02:39.600> just<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:40.109> one<00:02:40.140> each<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:40.980> each<00:02:41.069> kid

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
and just have one each for each kid

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.009 
and just have one each for each kid
because<00:02:42.000> at<00:02:42.120> home<00:02:42.299> they<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:42.720> use<00:02:42.870> regular

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
because at home they just use regular

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.170 
because at home they just use regular
cups<00:02:43.440> most<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.859> time<00:02:44.040> they<00:02:44.370> even<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.970> 20

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
cups most of the time they even the 20

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.750 
cups most of the time they even the 20
month<00:02:45.329> old<00:02:45.450> goes<00:02:45.750> really<00:02:46.019> well<00:02:46.170> with<00:02:46.410> that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
month old goes really well with that

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.069 
month old goes really well with that
so<00:02:47.760> if<00:02:48.060> they'll<00:02:48.180> just<00:02:48.299> have<00:02:48.450> one<00:02:48.600> sippy<00:02:48.930> cup

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
so if they'll just have one sippy cup

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.319 
so if they'll just have one sippy cup
for<00:02:49.290> going<00:02:49.530> out<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.829> about<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.430> then<00:02:51.180> when

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
for going out and about and then when

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.590 
for going out and about and then when
they<00:02:51.450> get<00:02:51.600> bigger<00:02:51.810> all<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:53.000> lids<00:02:54.000> interchange

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
they get bigger all the lids interchange

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.720 
they get bigger all the lids interchange
so<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:54.959> can<00:02:55.109> just<00:02:55.260> get<00:02:55.410> regular<00:02:56.190> water<00:02:56.370> bottle

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
so we can just get regular water bottle

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
so we can just get regular water bottle
lids<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.090> these<00:02:57.209> can<00:02:57.389> be<00:02:57.480> their<00:02:57.600> water

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
lids and these can be their water

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.530 
lids and these can be their water
bottles<00:02:58.139> later<00:02:58.290> on
