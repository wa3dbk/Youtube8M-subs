it's not gonna be a massive pack if you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.010 
it's not gonna be a massive pack if you
guys<00:01:23.009> don't<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.340> what<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> mashup<00:01:23.820> pack

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
guys don't know what a mashup pack

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.060 
guys don't know what a mashup pack
mashup<00:01:25.020> packs<00:01:25.259> are<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:27.200> um<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.770> mix

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
mashup packs are a um it's it's a mix

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.700 
mashup packs are a um it's it's a mix
between<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.880> skin<00:01:30.360> pack<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.259> texture<00:01:31.590> pack

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
between a skin pack and a texture pack

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.789 
between a skin pack and a texture pack
so<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.430> get<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> default<00:01:33.420> world<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.590> made

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
so you get a default world that was made

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.990 
so you get a default world that was made
by<00:01:35.009> 4j<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.320> world<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.280> texture

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
by 4j and on the world it's the texture

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.899 
by 4j and on the world it's the texture
pack<00:01:39.229> say<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.380> example<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.250> was<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.579> space

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
pack say for example it was like a space

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.580 
pack say for example it was like a space
gaming<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.659> space<00:01:42.930> texture<00:01:43.380> pack<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
gaming if I can space texture pack a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.039 
gaming if I can space texture pack a
wheelie<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.399> spaceship<00:01:44.939> maybe<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.570> then

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
wheelie like a spaceship maybe and then

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.929 
wheelie like a spaceship maybe and then
like<00:01:46.290> you'll<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.500> kind<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> futuristic

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
like you'll be kind of like a futuristic

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.850 
like you'll be kind of like a futuristic
texture<00:01:48.509> pack<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.350> pretty<00:01:49.439> cool

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
texture pack so it's pretty cool

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.249 
texture pack so it's pretty cool
um<00:01:50.100> however<00:01:50.369> we<00:01:50.880> don't<00:01:50.970> know<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.689> texture

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
um however we don't know what texture

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.520 
um however we don't know what texture
pack<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.619> are<00:01:52.740> getting<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:54.030> could<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:55.259> that

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
pack we are getting it could be one that

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.819 
pack we are getting it could be one that
was<00:01:55.680> already<00:01:55.829> used<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:57.380> xbox360<00:01:58.380> maybe

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
was already used on the xbox360 maybe

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.249 
was already used on the xbox360 maybe
they're<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.549> testing<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.570> out<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.170> make

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
they're just testing it out just to make

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.639 
they're just testing it out just to make
sure<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> works<00:02:02.540> maybe<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.229> be<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> plastic

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
sure it works maybe it can be a plastic

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.679 
sure it works maybe it can be a plastic
texture<00:02:05.280> pack<00:02:05.460> or<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.729> natural<00:02:06.180> texture<00:02:06.509> pack

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
texture pack or a natural texture pack

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.180 
texture pack or a natural texture pack
we<00:02:06.899> really<00:02:07.229> don't<00:02:07.409> know<00:02:07.560> yet<00:02:07.710> or<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.009> could<00:02:08.129> be

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
we really don't know yet or it could be

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.160 
we really don't know yet or it could be
completely<00:02:08.640> different<00:02:08.759> completely<00:02:09.509> unique

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
completely different completely unique

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.280
