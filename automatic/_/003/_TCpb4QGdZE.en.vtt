the interface is particularly in series
with<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.240> combination<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:19.960> touchscreen<00:01:20.560> and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
with the combination of touchscreen and

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.649 
with the combination of touchscreen and
the<00:01:20.740> buses<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:21.580> did<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.909> touch<00:01:22.119> screen<00:01:22.270> and

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
the buses and did the touch screen and
