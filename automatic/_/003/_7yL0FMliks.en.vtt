00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.470
 with 40,000 new cases every year 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.719
 prostate cancer the first tumor 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.440
 in the male population and this 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.910
 number destined to grow 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.799
 further with the progressive 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.570
 population aging 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.430
 let's take stock of the therapy of 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.439
 prostate cancer especially for 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.600
 as regards the advanced forms ie 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.550
 the metastatic forms with Dr. Giario 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.189
 primary urology accounts at the hospital 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.340
 sant'anna di como and president of the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.199
 Italian society of oncological urology 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.510
 the time doctor counts there first 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.460
 explains that current cancer therapy 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.840
 indie metastatic prostate we talk 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.160
 only of the severe form 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.140
 what medications are yours today 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.940
 provision is the standard of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.239
 treatment for prostate cancer 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.579
 metastatic and hormonal therapy is that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.500
 is performed with the androgenic block with 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.840
 a drug that breaks down the level of 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.579
 This is the blood testosterone 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.469
 standard for the treatment of 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.829
 metastatic prostate cancer in the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.260
 so-called phase of sensitivity hormones 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.359
 what are the drugs you use 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.129
 basically the analogues of the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.680
 hacker eh which are injections that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.299
 are practiced periodically a 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.909
 once a month or once every three months 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.200
 depending on the formulation they can 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.750
 more or less matched with 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.820
 tablets that are taken instead for 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.420
 mouth to block the receptor for the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.090
 androgens 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.119
 and then the tumor develops some 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.690
 resistance to this type of treatment 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.450
 for which 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.060
 the psa which is a marker that is measured 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.980
 the blood begins to rise or the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.020
 metastases begin to grow by 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.040
 volume of number despite the patient 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.470
 both in hormone therapy 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.960
 until today the treatment of choice 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.880
 he was a chemotherapeutic called 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.710
 docetaxel ll a treatment of 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.280
 chemotherapy that is available at most o 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.380
 less since 2004 that allowed to give a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.480
 prolongation of survival and this 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.980
 it was up to standard until recently 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.480
 here today we fortunately have some 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.940
 what's new and what's new? 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.050
 are the results already available with 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.200
 this drug 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.960
 we have a couple of new features already encouraging 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.850
 arrive and many that must arrive at 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.190
 a second line of chemotherapy starts 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.560
 with a drug called cavate tax is the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.850
 news of these days and the commissioning 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.340
 trade in a drug together 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.990
 abiraterone which has a mechanism of 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.790
 particular action is an inhibitor 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.860
 enzymatic removes from cancer cells 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.840
 a feature they took with 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.540
 time cancer cells normally 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.770
 they do not produce their testosterone but 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.209
 they are stimulated by testosterone 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.880
 produced in the testicles 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.020
 as the disease progresses in the tumor 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.450
 metastatic 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.250
 as we say we castration resist the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.290
 templating tumor cells 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.280
 become able to do it on their own 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.730
 testosterone and then bypassing the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.440
 chemical castration that we commonly do 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.660
 we do with standard treatment 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.030
 this drug is capable of blocking one 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.489
 way of production for which the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.010
 testosterone also what the cells 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.590
 they are produced on their own come 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.659
 reset and then this and grow here 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.040
 what are the clinical data obtained with 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.470
 this drug also increases the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.629
 survival this drug increases the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.970
 survival we now have 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.040
 drugs that can each increase 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.430
 three four five months survival 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.430
 median 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.530
 the median survival of these of 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.510
 these patients and this will allow us 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.579
 with the arrival of new drugs that later 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.280
 should be available in the arc 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.489
 months or years it is hoped for more months than 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.430
 years basically enzo ruta ridet 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.090
 asquini move pack 700 there is a long one 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.390
 Theory of drugs that will be produced 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.709
 they should help us bring you yes 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.829
 pass the term a kind of 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.569
 chronicization to lengthen the time of 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.010
 disease control 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.319
 the ideal would be to be able to hold 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.420
 controlled metastatic disease 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.129
 prostatic until then the patient 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.569
 must die for other causes and not for 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.299
 the inter found here is no longer a 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.400
 diagnosis without appeal 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.200
 absolutely not now we have the 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.689
 possibility to check for times 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.700
 the disease is also very long 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.889
 metastatic cancer practice stands 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.239
 doing a little what had happened 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.620
 in previous years with control 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.599
 breast cancer that is now 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.840
 satisfactory for many women for many 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.840
 years
