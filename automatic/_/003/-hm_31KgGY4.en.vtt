giving<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> friend<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:20.640> exactly

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
giving it to a friend it's not exactly

square piece of random fabric this is

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.629 
square piece of random fabric this is
actually<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:20.989> dish<00:03:21.290> towel<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.310> got<00:03:22.519> at

Target and I cut it into lots of
different<00:03:24.769> squares<00:03:25.639> so<00:03:26.299> you<00:03:26.359> want<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.840> square

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
different squares so you want to square

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.809 
different squares so you want to square
about<00:03:27.349> that<00:03:27.590> big<00:03:27.829> and<00:03:28.069> then<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:28.370> just<00:03:28.549> put

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
about that big and then you just put

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.629 
about that big and then you just put
your<00:03:28.970> items<00:03:29.389> obviously<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.079> six<00:03:30.319> items

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
your items obviously the six items

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.059 
your items obviously the six items
inside<00:03:31.639> of<00:03:31.909> the<00:03:32.000> knapsack<00:03:32.599> or<00:03:33.560> inside<00:03:33.919> of<00:03:34.010> the

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
inside of the knapsack or inside of the

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.250 
inside of the knapsack or inside of the
fabric<00:03:34.459> I<00:03:34.579> guess<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.030> then<00:03:35.449> you<00:03:35.599> put<00:03:35.840> up<00:03:36.019> your

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
fabric I guess and then you put up your

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.439 
fabric I guess and then you put up your
card<00:03:36.560> so<00:03:36.859> that<00:03:37.040> this<00:03:37.340> jumbled<00:03:38.150> up<00:03:38.239> mess

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
card so that this jumbled up mess

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.659 
card so that this jumbled up mess
totally<00:03:39.169> makes<00:03:39.379> sense<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:39.829> your<00:03:39.919> friends<00:03:40.400> and

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
totally makes sense to your friends and

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.129 
totally makes sense to your friends and
then<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.000> want<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.269> take<00:03:41.419> another<00:03:41.900> elastic

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
then you want to take another elastic

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.460 
then you want to take another elastic
and<00:03:43.010> just<00:03:44.000> bring<00:03:44.389> all<00:03:44.659> the<00:03:44.870> edges<00:03:45.229> together

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
and just bring all the edges together

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.360 
and just bring all the edges together
and<00:03:46.280> then<00:03:46.579> tie<00:03:47.479> it<00:03:47.510> up<00:03:48.129> like<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:50.769> like<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:52.040> and

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
and then tie it up like so like this and

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.830 
and then tie it up like so like this and

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
just wrote to Amy from Blair so I wrote

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.120 
just wrote to Amy from Blair so I wrote
my<00:04:51.419> own<00:04:51.690> thing<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.139> I<00:04:52.260> kinda<00:04:52.680> hole<00:04:52.830> in<00:04:52.979> it<00:04:53.100> and

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
my own thing and I kinda hole in it and

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.010

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
I set it through the ribbon so I think

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.969
