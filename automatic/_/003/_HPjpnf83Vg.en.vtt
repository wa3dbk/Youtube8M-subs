00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hi i'm ryan from scotland and this is my

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.660 
hi i'm ryan from scotland and this is my
decimal<00:00:03.659> tutorial<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:04.980> is<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.520> number

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
decimal tutorial and this is the number

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.480 
decimal tutorial and this is the number
zero<00:00:06.089> now<00:00:06.960> as<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.560> may<00:00:07.649> know<00:00:07.799> in<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.309> normal

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
zero now as you may know in the normal

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.280 
zero now as you may know in the normal
counting<00:00:08.880> system<00:00:09.240> we<00:00:09.480> have<00:00:09.570> 10<00:00:09.840> numbers<00:00:10.170> we

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
counting system we have 10 numbers we

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.350 
counting system we have 10 numbers we
can<00:00:10.410> count<00:00:10.530> with<00:00:10.769> there<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.400> 0<00:00:11.639> which<00:00:12.059> we<00:00:12.210> see

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
can count with there is 0 which we see

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.140 
can count with there is 0 which we see
here<00:00:12.389> followed<00:00:13.320> by<00:00:13.349> one<00:00:13.710> two<00:00:13.889> three<00:00:14.790> four<00:00:15.089> five

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
here followed by one two three four five

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.349 
here followed by one two three four five
six<00:00:15.780> seven<00:00:16.260> eight<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.010> nine<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.580> that's

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
six seven eight and nine and that's

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.210 
six seven eight and nine and that's
basically<00:00:18.600> what<00:00:18.960> decimal<00:00:19.350> means<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:20.100> means

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
basically what decimal means it means

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.920 
basically what decimal means it means
that<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.609> using<00:00:20.760> ten<00:00:21.150> numbers<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.720> count

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
that we are using ten numbers to count

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.320 
that we are using ten numbers to count
with<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:23.039> yet<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.789> count<00:00:23.939> higher<00:00:24.300> than

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
with but yet we can count higher than

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.439 
with but yet we can count higher than
the<00:00:24.810> number<00:00:25.050> nine<00:00:25.260> what<00:00:25.769> about<00:00:25.830> 12<00:00:27.199> 23<00:00:28.310> 106

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
the number nine what about 12 23 106

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.440 
the number nine what about 12 23 106
well<00:00:30.449> indeed<00:00:30.960> we<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.579> this<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.730> because<00:00:33.000> not

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
well indeed we can this is because not

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.299 
well indeed we can this is because not
only<00:00:33.480> do<00:00:33.809> we<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:33.930> numbers<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:35.040> also<00:00:35.160> have

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
only do we have numbers but we also have

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.670 
only do we have numbers but we also have
positions<00:00:35.880> for<00:00:36.090> those<00:00:36.210> numbers<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:37.410> first

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
positions for those numbers the first

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.209 
positions for those numbers the first
position<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.550> units<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.960> tens<00:00:40.230> then

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
position is the units and the tens then

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.600 
position is the units and the tens then
the<00:00:41.399> hundreds<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.280> if<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.370> want<00:00:44.460> to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the hundreds and so on so if we want to

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.670 
the hundreds and so on so if we want to
count<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.969> number<00:00:45.180> higher<00:00:45.420> than<00:00:45.660> 9<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:46.140> we

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
count on number higher than 9 all we

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.650 
count on number higher than 9 all we
have<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.280> add<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> amount<00:00:48.480> in

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
have to do is add one to the amount in

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.479 
have to do is add one to the amount in
the<00:00:48.690> next<00:00:49.020> position<00:00:49.170> along<00:00:49.649> which<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.399> this

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the next position along which in this

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.090 
the next position along which in this
case<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> tens<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.770> start<00:00:53.010> from

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
case is the tens and then we start from

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400 
case is the tens and then we start from
0<00:00:53.460> again<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> units<00:00:54.210> all<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:55.079> way<00:00:55.170> back<00:00:55.350> up

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
0 again in the units all the way back up

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.639 
0 again in the units all the way back up
to<00:00:55.649> 90<00:00:56.300> repeating<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.390> process<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:58.410> can<00:00:58.559> go

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
to 90 repeating this process we can go

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.729 
to 90 repeating this process we can go
all<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.039> way<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.280> 99<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.710> add

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
all the way up to 99 and then if we add

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.200 
all the way up to 99 and then if we add
one<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> next<00:01:02.489> position<00:01:02.730> along<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
one to the next position along the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.140 
one to the next position along the
hundreds<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:04.949> start<00:01:05.159> from<00:01:05.280> 0<00:01:05.640> again<00:01:05.700> in

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
hundreds we can start from 0 again in

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.060 
hundreds we can start from 0 again in
both<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> other<00:01:06.600> positions<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.350> count<00:01:07.890> all

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
both the other positions and count all

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.760 
both the other positions and count all
the<00:01:08.250> way<00:01:08.340> up

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
the way up

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.859 
the way up
by<00:01:10.310> repeating<00:01:10.579> this<00:01:10.789> process<00:01:11.000> we<00:01:11.719> can

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
by repeating this process we can

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.120 
by repeating this process we can
continue<00:01:12.289> to<00:01:12.439> count<00:01:12.560> higher<00:01:12.859> and<00:01:13.100> higher

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
continue to count higher and higher

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.240 
continue to count higher and higher
until<00:01:13.460> we<00:01:13.939> get<00:01:14.090> bored<00:01:14.590> if<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.770> get<00:01:15.890> bored<00:01:16.070> or

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
until we get bored if you get bored or

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.219 
until we get bored if you get bored or
stuck<00:01:16.520> during<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:16.850> tutorial<00:01:17.030> now<00:01:17.899> why<00:01:18.079> not

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
stuck during this tutorial now why not

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.100 
stuck during this tutorial now why not
see<00:01:18.439> how<00:01:18.619> high<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:18.799> can<00:01:18.979> County<00:01:19.399> now<00:01:20.360> let's

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
see how high you can County now let's

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.410 
see how high you can County now let's
look<00:01:21.289> closer<00:01:21.560> at<00:01:21.799> those<00:01:21.920> positions<00:01:22.240> this<00:01:23.240> can

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
look closer at those positions this can

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.849 
look closer at those positions this can
be<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.509> little<00:01:23.659> tricky<00:01:23.780> at<00:01:24.020> first<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:24.829> don't

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
be a little tricky at first so don't

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.100 
be a little tricky at first so don't
worry<00:01:25.159> if<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:25.399> don't<00:01:25.520> get<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:26.840> first

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
worry if you don't get the first

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.219 
worry if you don't get the first
position<00:01:27.409> is<00:01:27.740> always<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.460> units<00:01:28.789> then<00:01:29.689> to<00:01:30.110> get

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
position is always the units then to get

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.289 
position is always the units then to get
the<00:01:30.350> value<00:01:30.649> of<00:01:30.709> the<00:01:30.799> next<00:01:31.039> edition<00:01:31.299> multiply

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
the value of the next edition multiply

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.059 
the value of the next edition multiply
the<00:01:32.360> current<00:01:32.780> value<00:01:32.959> by<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.679> amount<00:01:33.950> of

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
the current value by the amount of

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:35.590 
the current value by the amount of
numbers<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:34.549> have<00:01:34.579> available<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.209> count<00:01:35.420> with

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
numbers you have available to count with

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.249 
numbers you have available to count with
which<00:01:36.229> in<00:01:36.380> decimal<00:01:36.799> is<00:01:37.009> 10<00:01:37.659> this<00:01:38.659> means<00:01:38.929> the

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
which in decimal is 10 this means the

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.679 
which in decimal is 10 this means the
value<00:01:39.380> of<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.709> next<00:01:39.950> position<00:01:40.189> along<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:40.789> 1

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
value of the next position along is 1

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.179 
value of the next position along is 1
times<00:01:42.380> 10<00:01:42.649> which<00:01:43.610> gives<00:01:43.819> us<00:01:43.970> 10<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.920> get<00:01:46.069> the

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
times 10 which gives us 10 to get the

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.999 
times 10 which gives us 10 to get the
value<00:01:46.489> of<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:46.670> next<00:01:46.909> one<00:01:47.060> repeat<00:01:47.840> this<00:01:48.049> so<00:01:48.920> we

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
value of the next one repeat this so we

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.160 
value of the next one repeat this so we
multiply<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.880> current<00:01:50.209> value<00:01:50.360> which<00:01:50.780> is<00:01:50.929> 10

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
multiply the current value which is 10

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.109 
multiply the current value which is 10
by<00:01:52.069> the<00:01:52.130> amount<00:01:52.459> of<00:01:52.520> numbers<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:52.939> have<00:01:53.000> for

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
by the amount of numbers you have for

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.830 
by the amount of numbers you have for
counting<00:01:53.599> which<00:01:53.989> is<00:01:54.170> 10<00:01:54.380> giving<00:01:55.220> us<00:01:55.369> 100<00:01:56.060> to

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
counting which is 10 giving us 100 to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.330 
counting which is 10 giving us 100 to
get<00:01:56.989> the<00:01:57.110> value<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.560> next<00:01:57.799> position<00:01:57.950> along

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
get the value of the next position along

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.179 
get the value of the next position along
we<00:01:58.880> multiply<00:01:59.270> 100<00:01:59.899> by<00:02:00.530> them<00:02:00.679> out<00:02:00.829> of<00:02:00.860> numbers

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
we multiply 100 by them out of numbers

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.649 
we multiply 100 by them out of numbers
we<00:02:01.280> have<00:02:01.429> to<00:02:01.610> count<00:02:01.759> with<00:02:02.000> which<00:02:02.329> will<00:02:02.450> always

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
we have to count with which will always

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.870 
we have to count with which will always
be<00:02:02.929> tan<00:02:03.170> in<00:02:03.349> decimal<00:02:03.770> giving<00:02:04.459> us<00:02:04.579> the

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
be tan in decimal giving us the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.949 
be tan in decimal giving us the
thousands<00:02:06.250> still<00:02:07.250> with<00:02:07.369> me<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.670> far<00:02:07.959> right

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
thousands still with me so far right

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.400 
thousands still with me so far right
let's<00:02:09.470> keep<00:02:09.679> going<00:02:10.209> so<00:02:11.209> from<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:11.629> we<00:02:11.840> can<00:02:12.079> see

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
let's keep going so from this we can see

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.849 
let's keep going so from this we can see
that<00:02:12.890> each<00:02:13.040> number<00:02:13.519> is<00:02:13.700> worth<00:02:14.329> that<00:02:15.260> many<00:02:15.590> of

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
that each number is worth that many of

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.580 
that each number is worth that many of
the<00:02:15.920> value<00:02:16.549> of<00:02:16.790> its<00:02:16.970> position<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:18.109> example

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
the value of its position for example

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.890 
the value of its position for example
here<00:02:18.739> if<00:02:19.549> three<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.120> in<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.569> hundreds

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
here if three is in the hundreds

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.250 
here if three is in the hundreds
position<00:02:21.319> so<00:02:22.069> it's<00:02:22.280> worth<00:02:22.660> 300<00:02:23.660> s<00:02:23.750> which<00:02:24.230> is

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
position so it's worth 300 s which is

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.099 
position so it's worth 300 s which is
300<00:02:25.299> but<00:02:26.299> what<00:02:26.450> if<00:02:26.540> we<00:02:26.600> want<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.900> know<00:02:26.989> the

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
300 but what if we want to know the

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.039 
300 but what if we want to know the
value<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.560> six<00:02:27.859> in<00:02:28.130> this<00:02:28.489> number<00:02:29.049> well

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
value of the six in this number well

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.840 
value of the six in this number well
instead<00:02:30.739> of<00:02:30.799> multiplying<00:02:30.980> by<00:02:31.370> 10<00:02:31.549> for<00:02:31.760> each

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
instead of multiplying by 10 for each

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.970 
instead of multiplying by 10 for each
position<00:02:32.150> we<00:02:32.959> can<00:02:32.989> use<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.230> handy<00:02:33.530> little<00:02:33.560> trick

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
position we can use a handy little trick

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.860 
position we can use a handy little trick
which<00:02:34.340> allows<00:02:34.639> us<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.970> work<00:02:35.120> out<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.389> value<00:02:35.720> of

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
which allows us to work out the value of

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.490 
which allows us to work out the value of
any<00:02:36.109> number<00:02:36.319> at<00:02:36.709> any<00:02:36.950> position<00:02:38.049> first<00:02:39.049> you

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
any number at any position first you

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.809 
any number at any position first you
take<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.829> amount<00:02:40.040> you're<00:02:40.130> multiplying<00:02:40.400> by

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
take the amount you're multiplying by

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.699 
take the amount you're multiplying by
each<00:02:41.120> time<00:02:41.389> you<00:02:41.510> move<00:02:41.660> position<00:02:42.109> in<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.560> case

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
each time you move position in the case

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.220 
each time you move position in the case
of<00:02:42.739> dance<00:02:43.010> or<00:02:43.250> mole<00:02:43.370> it's<00:02:43.639> 10<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.690> multiply<00:02:45.200> it

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
of dance or mole it's 10 and multiply it

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.379 
of dance or mole it's 10 and multiply it
by<00:02:45.500> itself<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.310> same<00:02:46.549> amount<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:46.819> times<00:02:47.090> as<00:02:47.329> a

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
by itself the same amount of times as a

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.349 
by itself the same amount of times as a
position<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.049> want<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.349> know<00:02:48.500> minus<00:02:49.190> 1<00:02:49.400> it's

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
position you want to know minus 1 it's

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.449 
position you want to know minus 1 it's
uncomplicated<00:02:50.980> let's<00:02:51.980> work<00:02:52.160> through<00:02:52.340> the

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
uncomplicated let's work through the

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.530 
uncomplicated let's work through the
example

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
example

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.539 
example
I<00:02:53.599> want<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.349> know<00:02:54.469> the<00:02:54.620> value<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.099> six<00:02:55.370> in

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
I want to know the value of the six in

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.240 
I want to know the value of the six in
this<00:02:55.670> number<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:56.989> cut<00:02:57.230> along<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:57.950> see

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
this number so I cut along and I see

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.869 
this number so I cut along and I see
that<00:02:58.459> it's<00:02:58.730> at<00:02:58.849> the<00:02:58.939> seventh<00:02:59.359> position<00:02:59.569> along

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
that it's at the seventh position along

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.410 
that it's at the seventh position along
so<00:03:01.879> i<00:03:02.180> multiply<00:03:02.659> 10<00:03:03.170> by<00:03:03.739> 7<00:03:04.250> minus<00:03:04.609> 1<00:03:05.000> times

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
so i multiply 10 by 7 minus 1 times

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.250 
so i multiply 10 by 7 minus 1 times
which<00:03:06.349> gives<00:03:06.590> me<00:03:06.709> 10<00:03:07.750> multiplied<00:03:08.750> by<00:03:08.900> itself

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
which gives me 10 multiplied by itself

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.390 
which gives me 10 multiplied by itself
six<00:03:10.220> times<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:12.230> can<00:03:12.409> also<00:03:12.530> be<00:03:12.650> written<00:03:12.769> as<00:03:13.129> 10

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
six times this can also be written as 10

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.339 
six times this can also be written as 10
to<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.819> power<00:03:13.909> of<00:03:14.150> 6<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.659> mean<00:03:14.810> exactly<00:03:15.019> the

to the power of 6 I mean exactly the

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.289 
to the power of 6 I mean exactly the
same<00:03:15.439> thing<00:03:15.620> but<00:03:16.040> taking<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.609> lot<00:03:16.760> less<00:03:16.939> place

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
same thing but taking a lot less place

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.309 
same thing but taking a lot less place

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
windows calculator we can see the

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.240 
windows calculator we can see the
seventh<00:03:29.420> position<00:03:29.569> along<00:03:29.989> in<00:03:30.170> decimal<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:30.739> the

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
seventh position along in decimal is the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.789 
seventh position along in decimal is the
millions<00:03:31.639> so<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.450> value<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.900> six<00:03:33.169> at<00:03:33.439> this

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
millions so the value of the six at this

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.720 
millions so the value of the six at this
position<00:03:34.040> is<00:03:34.549> six<00:03:34.879> million<00:03:36.459> we<00:03:37.459> can<00:03:37.579> get<00:03:37.700> a

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
position is six million we can get a

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.309 
position is six million we can get a
formula<00:03:38.150> of<00:03:38.329> this<00:03:38.510> which<00:03:39.049> will<00:03:39.200> hopefully

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
formula of this which will hopefully

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.979 
formula of this which will hopefully
make<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:39.829> lot<00:03:39.980> easier<00:03:40.129> to<00:03:40.370> remember<00:03:40.989> the

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
make it a lot easier to remember the

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.129 
make it a lot easier to remember the
value<00:03:42.439> which<00:03:43.040> will<00:03:43.250> call<00:03:43.400> v<00:03:43.609> of<00:03:43.819> a<00:03:44.629> number<00:03:44.810> a

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
value which will call v of a number a

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.190 
value which will call v of a number a
position<00:03:45.769> which<00:03:46.250> will<00:03:46.400> call<00:03:46.579> p<00:03:47.139> equals<00:03:48.139> the

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
position which will call p equals the

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.960 
position which will call p equals the
amount<00:03:48.290> of<00:03:48.500> numbers<00:03:48.680> you<00:03:49.220> have<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.489> count<00:03:49.669> with

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
amount of numbers you have to count with

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.119 
amount of numbers you have to count with
which<00:03:50.540> is<00:03:50.659> known<00:03:50.810> as<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.049> base<00:03:51.230> in<00:03:51.500> decimal

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
which is known as the base in decimal

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.149 
which is known as the base in decimal
it's<00:03:52.250> 10<00:03:52.459> so<00:03:53.329> we'll<00:03:53.480> call<00:03:53.629> that<00:03:53.689> B<00:03:54.129> to<00:03:55.129> the

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
it's 10 so we'll call that B to the

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.250 
it's 10 so we'll call that B to the
power<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.609> position<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:56.209> want<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.480> know<00:03:56.599> p

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
power of the position you want to know p

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.930 
power of the position you want to know p
minus<00:03:57.979> 1<00:03:58.449> V<00:03:59.449> equals<00:04:00.199> B<00:04:00.409> to<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:00.919> power<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.459> p

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
minus 1 V equals B to the power of p

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.649 
minus 1 V equals B to the power of p
minus<00:04:02.120> 1<00:04:02.409> the<00:04:03.409> value<00:04:03.440> equals<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.519> base<00:04:04.729> to<00:04:05.629> the

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
minus 1 the value equals the base to the

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.800 
minus 1 the value equals the base to the
power<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.079> position<00:04:06.530> minus<00:04:07.069> 1<00:04:07.569> so<00:04:08.569> for<00:04:08.780> a

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
power of the position minus 1 so for a

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.159 
power of the position minus 1 so for a
decimal<00:04:09.229> number<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.709> third<00:04:10.280> position<00:04:11.169> the

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
decimal number a third position the

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.860 
decimal number a third position the
value<00:04:12.379> is<00:04:12.739> 10<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.790> power<00:04:13.879> of<00:04:14.120> 3<00:04:14.479> minus<00:04:14.720> 1

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
value is 10 to the power of 3 minus 1

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.830 
value is 10 to the power of 3 minus 1
which<00:04:15.199> is<00:04:15.799> 10<00:04:16.159> to<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.459> power<00:04:16.549> of<00:04:16.789> 2<00:04:17.030> or<00:04:17.269> 10

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
which is 10 to the power of 2 or 10

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.649 
which is 10 to the power of 2 or 10
squared<00:04:18.229> which<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:18.889> 100<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:20.269> third<00:04:20.479> position

to try and remember that anything to the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.430 
to try and remember that anything to the
power<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.860> 1<00:04:29.130> equals<00:04:29.340> itself<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.540> anything<00:04:31.350> to

it again in the future sometime and have
a<00:04:41.790> look<00:04:41.940> around<00:04:42.030> for<00:04:42.389> more<00:04:42.540> guides<00:04:42.810> because

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
a look around for more guides because

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.110 
a look around for more guides because
maybe<00:04:43.590> my<00:04:43.860> way<00:04:44.040> of<00:04:44.100> explaining<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.760> isn't<00:04:45.060> the

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
maybe my way of explaining it isn't the

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.640 
maybe my way of explaining it isn't the
way<00:04:45.240> you'll<00:04:45.419> understand<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.169> something

a tutorial on something else I'm quite
decided<00:05:02.130> yet<00:05:02.310> probably<00:05:03.140> binary<00:05:04.250> yeah<00:05:05.250> I<00:05:05.490> think

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
decided yet probably binary yeah I think

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.640 
decided yet probably binary yeah I think
so<00:05:06.169> so<00:05:07.169> hope<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.590> see<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:07.919> there<00:05:08.070> bye
