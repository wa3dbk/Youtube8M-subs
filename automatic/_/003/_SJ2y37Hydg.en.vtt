00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.520 
thing that I think is the first step
honesty<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:18.259> then<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.799> second<00:01:19.159> step<00:01:19.340> is<00:01:20.530> what

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
honesty and then the second step is what

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.010 
honesty and then the second step is what

piece<00:01:46.579> of<00:01:46.729> music<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.539> if<00:01:47.719> you<00:01:47.810> want<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.109> move

piece of music so if you want to move

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.139 
piece of music so if you want to move
somebody<00:01:49.009> if<00:01:49.310> that's<00:01:49.609> actually<00:01:50.030> what<00:01:50.119> you

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
somebody if that's actually what you

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.899 
somebody if that's actually what you
truly<00:01:50.479> want<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.810> do<00:01:51.219> then<00:01:52.219> think<00:01:52.670> about<00:01:52.759> how

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
truly want to do then think about how

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.050 
truly want to do then think about how
that<00:01:53.179> might<00:01:53.329> hit<00:01:53.659> them<00:01:53.920> so<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:54.979> know<00:01:55.280> what<00:01:55.909> I'm

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
that might hit them so you know what I'm

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.149 
that might hit them so you know what I'm
getting<00:01:56.179> in<00:01:56.420> is<00:01:56.569> I<00:01:56.689> think<00:01:56.749> very<00:01:57.020> globally<00:01:57.770> and

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
getting in is I think very globally and

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.660 
getting in is I think very globally and
you<00:01:59.119> gradually<00:01:59.509> work<00:01:59.840> towards<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.469> detail<00:02:00.890> I

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
you gradually work towards the detail I

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.249 
you gradually work towards the detail I
think<00:02:02.090> if<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.479> sit<00:02:02.659> down<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:03.020> have<00:02:03.170> an

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
think if you sit down and you have an

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.200 
think if you sit down and you have an
idea<00:02:03.560> at<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:03.920> piano<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.310> know<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:04.729> an<00:02:04.819> hour<00:02:04.999> if

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
different ideas that have good

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.559 
different ideas that have good
beginnings<00:02:08.840> for<00:02:09.080> pieces<00:02:09.940> but<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:10.970> want<00:02:11.390> about

those pieces you know I'm not motivated

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.120 
those pieces you know I'm not motivated
to<00:02:13.370> are<00:02:13.550> those<00:02:13.700> pieces<00:02:13.910> I'm<00:02:14.180> motivated<00:02:14.810> to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
to are those pieces I'm motivated to

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.309 
to are those pieces I'm motivated to
through<00:02:16.130> music<00:02:16.520> to

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
through music to

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.250 
through music to
things<00:02:18.329> are<00:02:19.329> a<00:02:19.359> really<00:02:19.780> important<00:02:20.140> thing<00:02:20.230> that

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
things are a really important thing that

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.500 
things are a really important thing that
I<00:02:20.409> was<00:02:20.560> saying<00:02:20.939> and<00:02:21.939> people<00:02:22.090> have<00:02:22.329> very

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
I was saying and people have very

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.059 
I was saying and people have very
different<00:02:22.599> opinions<00:02:22.870> about<00:02:23.109> this<00:02:23.409> but<00:02:23.739> my

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
different opinions about this but my

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.530 
different opinions about this but my
belief<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:26.909> comes<00:02:27.909> from<00:02:27.999> this<00:02:28.090> question

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
belief is that comes from this question

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.470 
belief is that comes from this question
should<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.260> composer<00:02:29.560> want<00:02:29.859> that<00:02:30.129> right<00:02:30.480> you

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
should the composer want that right you

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.059 
should the composer want that right you
know<00:02:31.599> should<00:02:31.989> they<00:02:32.109> like<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.560> music<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.889> their

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
know should they like the music of their

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.949 
know should they like the music of their
right<00:02:33.219> and<00:02:33.969> to<00:02:34.150> me<00:02:34.269> that<00:02:34.299> seems<00:02:34.659> such<00:02:34.930> a

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
right and to me that seems such a

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.929 
right and to me that seems such a
nonsensical<00:02:35.769> question<00:02:36.370> because<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:36.879> don't

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
nonsensical question because I don't

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.009 
nonsensical question because I don't
think<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.269> composers<00:02:37.629> should<00:02:37.750> like<00:02:37.870> what

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
think it composers should like what

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.449 
think it composers should like what
their<00:02:38.139> unofficial<00:02:38.379> you<00:02:38.739> love<00:02:38.889> or<00:02:39.069> that<00:02:39.250> right

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
their unofficial you love or that right

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.250 
their unofficial you love or that right
I<00:02:39.760> think<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.450> should<00:02:40.540> mean<00:02:40.750> everything<00:02:41.230> to

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260

I think it should mean everything to
them<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:42.129> know<00:02:42.280> it's<00:02:42.909> like<00:02:43.090> having<00:02:43.389> kids<00:02:43.629> yeah

work is going to be boring to do my way
of<00:03:43.720> writing<00:03:44.680> is<00:03:45.069> that<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.609> spent<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.359> really<00:03:46.840> long

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
of writing is that I spent a really long

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.640 
of writing is that I spent a really long
time<00:03:48.449> almost<00:03:49.449> one<00:03:49.780> third<00:03:50.019> of<00:03:50.169> the<00:03:50.290> entire

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
time almost one third of the entire

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.039 
time almost one third of the entire
composition<00:03:51.159> process<00:03:51.759> is<00:03:52.419> getting<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.959> the

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
composition process is getting to the

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:53.849 
composition process is getting to the
first<00:03:53.319> part

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
first part

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.009 
first part
it's<00:03:54.370> getting<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.000> first<00:03:55.299> few<00:03:55.599> notes<00:03:55.840> of

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
it's getting to the first few notes of

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.349 
it's getting to the first few notes of
the<00:03:56.109> piece<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.579> that's<00:03:57.579> because<00:03:57.939> there's<00:03:58.150> all

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
the piece and that's because there's all

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.920 
the piece and that's because there's all
of<00:03:58.389> this<00:03:58.540> time<00:03:58.870> working<00:03:59.199> towards<00:03:59.859> an<00:04:00.669> idea<00:04:01.599> or

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
of this time working towards an idea or

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.369 
of this time working towards an idea or
material<00:04:02.620> that<00:04:02.769> I<00:04:02.799> know<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:04.150> just<00:04:04.540> so<00:04:05.049> forth

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
material that I know is just so forth

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.679 
material that I know is just so forth
potential<00:04:06.009> there's<00:04:06.729> so<00:04:07.000> much<00:04:07.150> in<00:04:07.329> it<00:04:07.419> that<00:04:07.599> can

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:07.689 
potential there's so much in it that can

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.199 
potential there's so much in it that can
be<00:04:07.810> explored<00:04:08.169> or<00:04:08.349> realized<00:04:08.799> or<00:04:09.069> you<00:04:09.969> know<00:04:10.060> it's

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
be explored or realized or you know it's

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.030 
be explored or realized or you know it's
just<00:04:10.299> going<00:04:10.629> it's<00:04:11.019> like<00:04:11.079> a<00:04:11.199> seed<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:11.620> know

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
just going it's like a seed you know

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.679 
just going it's like a seed you know
that<00:04:12.250> you've<00:04:12.370> you've<00:04:12.609> created<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:13.030> seed<00:04:13.389> you

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
that you've you've created the seed you

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.990 
that you've you've created the seed you
finally<00:04:14.079> make<00:04:14.409> the<00:04:14.620> seed<00:04:14.859> and<00:04:15.609> you<00:04:15.729> know<00:04:15.879> that

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
finally make the seed and you know that

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.490 
finally make the seed and you know that
you<00:04:16.090> can<00:04:16.209> plant<00:04:16.509> it<00:04:16.719> and<00:04:16.900> this<00:04:17.049> incredible

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
you can plant it and this incredible

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.749 
you can plant it and this incredible
thing<00:04:17.680> will<00:04:17.829> grow<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:20.019> requires<00:04:20.440> time<00:04:20.859> you

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 
thing will grow that requires time you

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.370 
thing will grow that requires time you
can't<00:04:22.030> do<00:04:22.210> that<00:04:22.449> in<00:04:22.599> five<00:04:22.870> minutes<00:04:23.199> of<00:04:23.289> the

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
can't do that in five minutes of the

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.409 
can't do that in five minutes of the
piano<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:24.250> know<00:04:24.280> that's<00:04:24.490> a<00:04:24.610> really<00:04:24.789> big<00:04:25.090> part

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
piano you know that's a really big part

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:25.920 
piano you know that's a really big part
of<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.570> process

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
of the process

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.719 
of the process
and<00:04:26.500> there's<00:04:26.650> a<00:04:26.740> huge<00:04:26.889> part<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:27.460> is

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
and there's a huge part of that is

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.120 
and there's a huge part of that is
throwing<00:04:28.180> stuff<00:04:28.389> out<00:04:28.570> you<00:04:29.560> know<00:04:29.680> it's<00:04:29.800> knowing

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
throwing stuff out you know it's knowing

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.270 
throwing stuff out you know it's knowing
you<00:04:30.190> how<00:04:30.280> to<00:04:30.340> get<00:04:30.520> rid<00:04:31.120> of<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.509> trash<00:04:31.810> and

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
you how to get rid of the trash and

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.060 
you how to get rid of the trash and
finding<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:34.000> nuggets<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:34.479> the<00:04:34.630> gold

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
finding the the the nuggets and the gold

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.950 
finding the the the nuggets and the gold
and<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.160> think<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.610> lot<00:04:36.850> of<00:04:36.880> young<00:04:37.360> composers

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
and I think a lot of young composers

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.260 
and I think a lot of young composers
don't<00:04:38.380> put<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.710> time<00:04:38.889> into<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.340> what<00:04:40.150> they

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
don't put the time into that what they

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.670 
don't put the time into that what they
do<00:04:40.330> is<00:04:40.630> they<00:04:40.780> get<00:04:40.900> an<00:04:41.020> idea<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.410> I<00:04:41.440> think<00:04:41.530> this

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
do is they get an idea and I think this

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.379 
do is they get an idea and I think this
is<00:04:41.800> my<00:04:41.919> idea<00:04:41.979> I<00:04:42.430> got<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:42.910> side<00:04:43.030> here<00:04:43.180> it's<00:04:43.300> my

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
is my idea I got the side here it's my

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.270 
is my idea I got the side here it's my
idea<00:04:43.509> I'm<00:04:43.990> gonna<00:04:44.139> write<00:04:44.289> this<00:04:44.410> piece<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:45.160> then

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
idea I'm gonna write this piece and then

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.969 
idea I'm gonna write this piece and then
they<00:04:45.370> start<00:04:45.610> writing<00:04:45.759> the<00:04:45.910> piece<00:04:46.060> and<00:04:46.919> for<00:04:47.919> all

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
they start writing the piece and for all

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.580 
they start writing the piece and for all
sorts<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:48.310> reasons<00:04:48.490> time<00:04:49.030> or<00:04:49.539> whatever<00:04:49.750> they

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
idea I've got around my piece now and

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.430 
idea I've got around my piece now and
they<00:04:54.370> keep<00:04:54.550> sort<00:04:55.330> of<00:04:55.360> hammering<00:04:55.870> away<00:04:55.990> at<00:04:56.320> this

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
they keep sort of hammering away at this

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.000 
they keep sort of hammering away at this
thing<00:04:56.500> trying<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:57.550> extend<00:04:57.850> it<00:04:58.090> out<00:04:58.210> and<00:04:59.010> they

they<00:05:08.110> work<00:05:08.289> I<00:05:08.560> mean<00:05:09.160> it's<00:05:09.340> different<00:05:09.550> when<00:05:09.850> I

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
they work I mean it's different when I

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.750 
they work I mean it's different when I
lower<00:05:10.930> than<00:05:11.110> this<00:05:11.199> a<00:05:11.580> student<00:05:12.580> who's<00:05:12.729> a

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
songwriter who plays the guitar and

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.070 
songwriter who plays the guitar and

sings they always love what they do you
know<00:05:17.169> there's<00:05:17.349> a<00:05:17.410> really<00:05:17.590> powerful

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
know there's a really powerful

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.740 
know there's a really powerful
connection<00:05:18.370> admittedly<00:05:18.789> there<00:05:19.180> singing<00:05:19.449> in

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
connection admittedly there singing in

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.140 
connection admittedly there singing in
and<00:05:20.530> they<00:05:20.710> really<00:05:20.919> feel<00:05:20.949> emotional<00:05:21.669> and<00:05:21.880> put

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
and they really feel emotional and put

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.640 
and they really feel emotional and put
they're<00:05:22.270> performing<00:05:22.630> as<00:05:22.810> well<00:05:22.840> themselves

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
they're performing as well themselves

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.189 
they're performing as well themselves
but<00:05:24.460> I<00:05:24.729> think<00:05:24.940> that<00:05:25.270> that<00:05:25.419> feeling<00:05:25.930> that<00:05:26.050> they

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
but I think that that feeling that they

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.100 
but I think that that feeling that they
have<00:05:26.470> when<00:05:27.099> they<00:05:27.220> write<00:05:27.430> songs<00:05:27.669> like<00:05:28.030> that

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
have when they write songs like that

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.390 
have when they write songs like that
there's<00:05:29.110> what<00:05:29.320> other<00:05:29.590> composers<00:05:30.099> should<00:05:30.250> have

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
there's what other composers should have

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.710 
there's what other composers should have
when<00:05:30.580> they're<00:05:30.729> writing<00:05:30.880> instrumental<00:05:31.479> music

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
when they're writing instrumental music

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.850 
when they're writing instrumental music
you<00:05:31.780> know<00:05:31.840> they<00:05:31.900> should<00:05:32.020> have<00:05:32.169> that<00:05:32.199> really

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
you know they should have that really

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:42.999 
you know they should have that really
strong<00:05:33.099> emotional<00:05:33.669> bond<00:05:33.910> with<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.690> music

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.069
