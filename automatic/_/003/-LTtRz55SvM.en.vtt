7<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.739> take<00:00:40.890> away<00:00:41.010> from<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.219> is

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
7 so what we can take away from that is

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.709 
7 so what we can take away from that is
that<00:00:41.760> they're<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.059> start<00:00:42.180> building<00:00:42.629> in

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
that they're going to start building in

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.470 
that they're going to start building in
a<00:00:42.780> couple<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.079> weeks<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.489> sets<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:45.090> about

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
a couple of weeks so the sets are about

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.020 
a couple of weeks so the sets are about
to<00:00:45.660> be<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.870> production<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:47.250> only<00:00:47.489> set<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.879> can

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to be in production the only set I can

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.850 
to be in production the only set I can
think<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.510> almost<00:00:48.989> guaranteed<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
think of that's almost guaranteed is a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.549 
think of that's almost guaranteed is a
millennium<00:00:50.309> falcon<00:00:50.629> because<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.199> has

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
millennium falcon because that is has

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.170 
millennium falcon because that is has
been<00:00:52.590> seen<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> set<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.879> movie<00:00:54.000> i

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
been seen on the set of the movie i

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.959 
been seen on the set of the movie i
believe<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.079> hopefully<00:00:55.730> we<00:00:56.730> could<00:00:56.850> possibly

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
believe so hopefully we could possibly

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.810 
believe so hopefully we could possibly
get<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> new<00:00:57.480> millennium<00:00:57.629> falcon<00:00:58.640> but<00:00:59.640> other

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
get a new millennium falcon but other

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.950 
get a new millennium falcon but other
than<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.149> don't<00:01:00.239> know<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.539> other<00:01:00.600> sets

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
than that I don't know what other sets

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.049 
than that I don't know what other sets
we<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.199> get<00:01:01.320> around<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> circle<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:02.910> the

I gathered from the movies and that the
Empire<00:02:38.360> has<00:02:38.390> fallen<00:02:38.570> with<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.200> death<00:02:39.440> of

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
emperor palpatine Darth Vader and but

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.780 
emperor palpatine Darth Vader and but
they<00:02:42.350> still<00:02:42.620> have<00:02:42.830> their<00:02:42.980> logos<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:43.670> the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
they still have their logos in the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.300 
they still have their logos in the
background<00:02:44.270> which<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:45.050> interesting<00:02:45.890> unless

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
background which is interesting unless

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.890 
background which is interesting unless
they've<00:02:46.520> just<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.940> course<00:02:47.150> taken<00:02:47.630> the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900

Imperials supplies which is also another

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.260 
Imperials supplies which is also another
plausible<00:02:51.820> explanation<00:02:52.820> for<00:02:53.000> why<00:02:53.090> they're

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
plausible explanation for why they're

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.560 
plausible explanation for why they're
there<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:54.410> we<00:02:55.010> could<00:02:55.190> also<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.640> seeing<00:02:55.970> more
