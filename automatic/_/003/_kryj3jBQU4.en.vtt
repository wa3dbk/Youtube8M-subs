00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Y 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.380
 i 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.849
 hello today I bring you a hold the line 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.289
 coins has arrived this morning and what 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:19.570
 I asked so a little bit more than 20 days ago 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.919
 and I really wanted to see what 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.289
 I'm going to divide into two sections is 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:26.380
 doing electronics and the section of 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:31.480
 first cosmetic that I teach you is a 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.790
 mp3 that good has this format well and 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.120
 they want to imitate a bit the third 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.420
 generation of the ipod 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.730
 of apple but let's go inside does not have 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.710
 nothing to see 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.980
 We've been trying a little 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.360
 see how it sounded sounds pretty good and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.280
 we have not been able to put the music 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.320
 by folders we will have to inquire 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.940
 little bit more hopefully you can get 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.800
 by folders because if it's not going to be a 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.730
 It's a hassle to have music there all together and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.410
 good they came with helmets 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.410
 and they also came with 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.370
 with the charger 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.420
 to plug in and 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:21.780
 I also bought the black for my boy and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.310
 they came like this in this little bag came all 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.010
 super well packed as always 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.710
 mine with and you see that the cable is coming 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.740
 to load it 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.740
 helmets and the device 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.080
 and then I also bought other helmets are 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.180
 from here 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.330
 They also want to imitate the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.580
 helmets that have apple are better than 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.350
 those that come 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:55.590
 mp3 that you bought and good as the costs 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.270
 these then we took an adapter 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.600
 cable for hdmi these are for the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.480
 mac laptops and we took it 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.490
 Primarily so to use it 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.700
 along with the HDMI cable that also 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.940
 I bought 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.030
 to use it from the laptop to the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.370
 TV and movies and see there 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.940
 it also just good for us 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.590
 that you want to put the computer to another 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.769
 bigger screen 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.660
 and good the HDMI cable and also 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.730
 I bought that is this comes with its 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.730
 protectors comes all perfect 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.550
 plus 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.060
 The next thing that I'm going to teach you already 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:45.989
 belongs to the cosmetics theme and these are 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.880
 pointers that I bought that are to do 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.980
 drawings in the nails I really wanted 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.069
 of having them I already had one of essence 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.680
 but I already had a little bit left 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.989
 the tip and I wanted to have more pointers 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.030
 fat and good I bought these that come 5 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.040
 and they are pretty good they have pointers 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.660
 on both sides here are fatter 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.500
 since rather 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.750
 and then I also bought a good roulette 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.660
 a roulette comes in five a little pack 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.940
 of five to make the switches with the 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.440
 glazes that I have or with which I'm leaving 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.200
 buying because I think that here you see 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.270
 better than if I do it in heat or in 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.910
 anything else 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.390
 then this is going very well 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.150
 I teach you is a ribbon of these for 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.150
 brushes when you wash them you put this 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.060
 tape and it stays the way well of the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.970
 brush while it is drying brings 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.230
 a meter and I think that with a meter I will have 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.700
 enough because I do not have many 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.260
 brushes still the next one that you 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.930
 I teach are some socks that 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.290
 I did not like it very much because I think that 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.760
 they will not enter me because they throw us what 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.459
 that has to stretch and to me this as 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.310
 that I do not think I got between carving 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:04.000
 failed but both gives I say that already 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.840
 they will not enter me and they are heart-shaped 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.950
 or good that is not a little heart either 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.950
 see if you can see it 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:24.210
 and well what I say 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.919
 they were of hearts in the photo but it is that 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.810
 they look like droplets of water more than 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.439
 hearts because they do not have they do not have the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.569
 shape 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:36.560
 I took these and then I took other 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:40.320
 that those are polka dots 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.930
 same black with your little place that you're 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.700
 has not yet taken out of the package 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.070
 teach this that disappointed me enough 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.410
 because the page looks like it's 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.960
 quite bigger and when I opened 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.250
 the package I have taken the disappointment to say 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.569
 but good if I do not fit there what I 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.929
 I wanted to put 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.240
 is this box that is not bad for 

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:02.759
 put bracelets earrings those things 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.889
 but I wanted it for nail polish and I did not 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.919
 realized the measures 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:12.180
 and I thought it was going to be a box so 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.760
 less such a thing and so and found 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.270
 with this 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.500
 but good 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:24.400
 and I'll see where I use it and what it is 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:29.259
 what I wear I have to look 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.680
 because of supplements I bought this 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.380
 ring 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.040
 that's been a super nice mustache 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:40.130
 they are after double 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.320
 for which not 6 this type of rings 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.180
 they are a little uncomfortable at first 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.370
 but you end up getting used to me 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.300
 is quite liking 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.300
 and well, it's this 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:06.030
 the following is this bracelet 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.889
 which is an owl and is white 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.990
 life also in black and in 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.770
 Red color 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.669
 well it 's pretty good 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.669
 and it stays that way 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.440
 this necklace that is super nice 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:42.780

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.690
