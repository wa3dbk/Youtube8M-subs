pop it into the bag now you see as we're
doing<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.280> we're<00:00:14.759> leaving<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.120> V<00:00:15.299> structure

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
doing this we're leaving a V structure

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.130 
doing this we're leaving a V structure
that's<00:00:16.020> going<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.289> be<00:00:16.350> important<00:00:16.830> later<00:00:16.949> on

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
that's going to be important later on

that's going to be important later on
next<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.770> get<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.949> divider<00:00:20.310> pop<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:24.439> we<00:00:25.439> get

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
next we get a divider pop that in we get

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.050 
next we get a divider pop that in we get
our<00:00:25.740> skipper<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.250> now<00:00:26.430> I've<00:00:26.550> popped<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.939> couple

our skipper see now I've popped a couple
of<00:00:27.330> these<00:00:27.420> foam<00:00:27.720> covers<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.590> some<00:00:29.460> cases

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
of these foam covers on some cases

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.339 
of these foam covers on some cases
you've<00:00:29.939> got<00:00:30.150> them<00:00:30.300> other<00:00:30.570> cases<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.170> don't

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
you've got them other cases you don't

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.799 
you've got them other cases you don't
when<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.009> don't<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.700> sure<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.000> course<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
when you don't just be sure of course to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.810 
when you don't just be sure of course to
stack<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.559> here<00:00:34.890> which<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.489> facing

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
stack it as we do here which is facing

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.420 
stack it as we do here which is facing
the<00:00:36.000> foam<00:00:36.300> away<00:00:37.399> goes<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:40.430> creating

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the foam away goes in like so creating

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.729 
the foam away goes in like so creating
that<00:00:41.460> same<00:00:41.850> V<00:00:42.120> section<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:42.719> pop<00:00:43.559> our

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
that same V section there pop our

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.160 
that same V section there pop our
divider<00:00:44.040> in

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.110 

can<00:00:50.650> our<00:00:50.770> crewmembers<00:00:51.070> see<00:00:51.400> it's<00:00:51.880> got<00:00:52.030> the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
can our crewmembers see it's got the

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.350 
can our crewmembers see it's got the
same<00:00:52.270> dividers<00:00:52.750> on<00:00:53.640> now<00:00:54.640> you<00:00:54.700> want<00:00:54.970> to<00:00:55.030> be<00:00:55.120> sure

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
same dividers on now you want to be sure

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.750 
same dividers on now you want to be sure
when<00:00:55.810> you<00:00:55.840> go<00:00:55.990> to<00:00:56.050> push<00:00:56.260> this<00:00:56.410> in<00:00:56.650> let<00:00:57.430> these<00:00:57.610> to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
when you go to push this in let these to

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.690 
when you go to push this in let these to
bite<00:00:57.940> us<00:00:58.120> at<00:00:58.720> separating<00:00:59.310> because<00:01:00.310> as<00:01:00.490> they

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
bite us at separating because as they

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.079 
bite us at separating because as they
come<00:01:00.880> to<00:01:01.000> push<00:01:01.180> in<00:01:02.400> there<00:01:03.400> becomes<00:01:03.730> a<00:01:03.850> nice

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
come to push in there becomes a nice

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.450 
come to push in there becomes a nice
little<00:01:04.360> little<00:01:05.080> area<00:01:05.379> for<00:01:05.560> you<00:01:05.980> to<00:01:06.070> store<00:01:06.280> your

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
little little area for you to store your

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.500 
little little area for you to store your
other<00:01:06.580> structure<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:11.500> like<00:01:11.740> so<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.360> what

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
other structure just like so so what

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.540 
other structure just like so so what
we've<00:01:13.660> done<00:01:13.870> there<00:01:14.110> is<00:01:14.200> we've<00:01:14.229> we've<00:01:14.710> we've

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
we've done there is we've we've we've

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.969 
we've done there is we've we've we've
just<00:01:15.790> moved<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:16.180> so<00:01:16.570> it<00:01:16.660> fits<00:01:16.870> in<00:01:17.080> give<00:01:17.860> it<00:01:17.890> a

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
just moved it so it fits in give it a

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.140 
just moved it so it fits in give it a
little<00:01:18.130> push<00:01:18.370> there's<00:01:18.610> plenty<00:01:18.880> of<00:01:18.910> padding

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
little push there's plenty of padding

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.790 
little push there's plenty of padding
there<00:01:19.390> for<00:01:19.600> you<00:01:19.690> to<00:01:19.780> maneuver<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.740> around<00:01:22.800> get

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
there for you to maneuver it around get

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:39.950 
there for you to maneuver it around get
our<00:01:23.890> power<00:01:24.070> transfer<00:01:24.520> poles

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.720 

sometimes<00:01:40.800> I<00:01:40.920> pop<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.160> on<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.370> transom

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
sometimes I pop this on the transom

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.860 
sometimes I pop this on the transom
other<00:01:41.880> times<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.510> put<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.690> on<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
other times they can just put it on the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.020 
other times they can just put it on the
foredeck<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:43.830> it's<00:01:43.950> out<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.220> way

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.480 

this<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.180> your<00:01:48.330> cross<00:01:48.480> brace<00:01:48.950> this<00:01:49.950> area<00:01:50.310> that

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
this is your cross brace this area that

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.340 
this is your cross brace this area that
you'd<00:01:50.580> left<00:01:50.760> in<00:01:50.940> there<00:01:51.090> via<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.450> feed<00:01:51.750> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
you'd left in there via this feed you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.110 
you'd left in there via this feed you
then<00:01:53.900> put<00:01:54.900> that<00:01:55.050> into<00:01:55.729> this<00:01:56.729> goes<00:01:56.970> in<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
then put that into this goes in the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.290 
then put that into this goes in the
front<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.310> now<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.760> stacks<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.150> can

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
front and now that it's stacks you can

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.380 
front and now that it's stacks you can
use<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:01.369> straps<00:02:02.369> available<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.970> hold<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.240> real

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
use the straps available to hold a real

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:13.130 
use the straps available to hold a real
tight

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.309 

just<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.660> just<00:02:15.660> making<00:02:15.870> sure<00:02:16.020> that

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
just like so just making sure that

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.260 
just like so just making sure that
there's<00:02:16.700> there's<00:02:17.700> plenty<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.000> room<00:02:18.240> there

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
there's there's plenty of room there

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.030 
there's there's plenty of room there
however<00:02:18.810> not<00:02:19.140> too<00:02:19.319> much<00:02:19.500> room<00:02:19.740> because

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
however not too much room because

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.949 
however not too much room because
sometimes<00:02:20.430> if<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.760> doesn't<00:02:21.000> stack<00:02:21.209> right<00:02:21.450> it

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
sometimes if it doesn't stack right it

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.300 
sometimes if it doesn't stack right it
can<00:02:22.080> be<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> little<00:02:22.380> bit<00:02:22.530> wired<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.130> won't

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
can be a little bit wired and it won't

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:42.710 
can be a little bit wired and it won't
sleep<00:02:23.459> out<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.959> case<00:02:40.400> there<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.720> and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
sleep out in this case there it is and
