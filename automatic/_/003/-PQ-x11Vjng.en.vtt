check the fuse it's a 10 amp fuse
located<00:00:40.190> in<00:00:40.309> here<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:41.449> I<00:00:41.510> put<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.350> spare<00:00:42.710> in

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
located in here so I put the spare in

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.080 
located in here so I put the spare in
what<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:44.629> noticed<00:00:45.080> was<00:00:45.370> when<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:46.400> took<00:00:46.519> the<00:00:46.820> fuse

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
what I noticed was when I took the fuse

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.570 
what I noticed was when I took the fuse
out<00:00:47.300> I<00:00:47.629> I<00:00:48.760> put<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:49.940> ignition<00:00:50.840> on<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.550> both<00:00:52.550> of

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
out I I put the ignition on and both of

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.299 
out I I put the ignition on and both of
these<00:00:52.970> displays<00:00:53.750> are<00:00:54.110> run<00:00:54.320> off<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.680> same<00:00:54.920> fuse

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
these displays are run off the same fuse

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.090 
these displays are run off the same fuse
and<00:00:55.640> when<00:00:56.600> I<00:00:56.629> pulled<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.049> fuse<00:00:57.350> out<00:00:57.589> neither

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
and when I pulled the fuse out neither

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.640 
and when I pulled the fuse out neither
one<00:00:58.370> worked<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:59.449> y'all<00:00:59.629> just<00:00:59.659> saw<00:01:00.170> that<00:01:00.470> when

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
one worked and y'all just saw that when

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.250 
one worked and y'all just saw that when
the<00:01:00.769> fuse<00:01:01.040> is<00:01:01.220> in<00:01:01.430> this<00:01:02.330> will<00:01:02.540> work<00:01:02.720> so<00:01:03.080> it's

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
the fuse is in this will work so it's

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.730 
the fuse is in this will work so it's
not<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.589> fuse<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.729> I<00:01:04.760> went<00:01:05.180> ahead<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:05.740> pulled

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
not the fuse so I went ahead and pulled

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.030 
not the fuse so I went ahead and pulled
the<00:01:06.890> -<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:08.210> trim<00:01:08.780> cover<00:01:09.080> off<00:01:09.350> in<00:01:09.590> order<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.860> do

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
the - the trim cover off in order to do

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.440 
the - the trim cover off in order to do

whole<00:01:16.760> panel<00:01:17.030> just<00:01:17.299> pulls<00:01:17.630> off<00:01:17.900> but<00:01:18.409> it's

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
whole panel just pulls off but it's

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.340 
whole panel just pulls off but it's
looking<00:01:18.950> like<00:01:19.100> now<00:01:19.369> we<00:01:20.000> got<00:01:20.210> electrical<00:01:21.140> issue

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
looking like now we got electrical issue

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.010 
looking like now we got electrical issue
with<00:01:22.070> this<00:01:22.340> have<00:01:22.909> noticed<00:01:23.390> that<00:01:23.539> it<00:01:23.750> has

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
with this have noticed that it has

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.649 
with this have noticed that it has
intermittently<00:01:24.770> gone<00:01:25.159> out<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.700> then<00:01:26.119> back<00:01:26.390> on

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
intermittently gone out and then back on

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.080 
intermittently gone out and then back on
but<00:01:27.049> now<00:01:27.469> it's<00:01:27.740> completely<00:01:27.859> off<00:01:28.399> even<00:01:28.909> when<00:01:29.030> I

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
but now it's completely off even when I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.149 
but now it's completely off even when I
go<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.299> start<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.750> motor<00:01:29.960> it's<00:01:30.229> off<00:01:30.439> so<00:01:30.890> I

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
go to start the motor it's off so I

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.060 
go to start the motor it's off so I
think<00:01:31.430> it's<00:01:31.759> a<00:01:31.969> loose<00:01:32.539> connection<00:01:32.869> it<00:01:33.320> makes

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
think it's a loose connection it makes

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.219 
think it's a loose connection it makes
sense<00:01:34.280> to<00:01:34.490> me<00:01:34.700> because<00:01:35.000> it<00:01:35.659> was<00:01:35.719> doing<00:01:36.109> it

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
sense to me because it was doing it

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.200 
sense to me because it was doing it
intermittently<00:01:36.950> for<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:37.579> it's<00:01:37.729> not<00:01:37.820> like<00:01:38.030> it

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
intermittently for so it's not like it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.690 
intermittently for so it's not like it
just<00:01:38.240> died<00:01:39.229> there's<00:01:39.950> got<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.310> be<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.460> loose

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
just died there's got to be a loose

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.060 
just died there's got to be a loose
connection<00:01:40.820> I<00:01:41.539> think<00:01:42.109> it<00:01:42.229> was<00:01:42.320> aggravated

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
connection I think it was aggravated

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.700 
connection I think it was aggravated
when<00:01:43.969> I'm<00:01:44.090> down<00:01:44.630> here<00:01:44.659> beating<00:01:45.170> on<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.469> blower

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
when I'm down here beating on the blower

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.230 
when I'm down here beating on the blower
motor<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.219> get<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:46.759> turn<00:01:46.969> on

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
motor to get it to turn on

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.719 
motor to get it to turn on
sometimes<00:01:48.109> the<00:01:48.320> blower<00:01:48.530> motor<00:01:48.890> hangs<00:01:49.219> up<00:01:49.460> I

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
sometimes the blower motor hangs up I

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.429 
sometimes the blower motor hangs up I
don't<00:01:50.270> know<00:01:50.479> if<00:01:50.539> it's<00:01:50.810> something<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.320> do<00:01:51.409> with

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
don't know if it's something to do with

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.830 
don't know if it's something to do with
the<00:01:51.649> bearings<00:01:52.070> in<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:53.149> I'll<00:01:53.329> go<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.570> turn

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
the bearings in it but I'll go to turn

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.840 
the bearings in it but I'll go to turn
on<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.170> AC<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.590> nothing<00:01:55.159> happens<00:01:55.579> you'll

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
on the AC and nothing happens you'll

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.300 
on the AC and nothing happens you'll
hear<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.149> compressor<00:01:56.420> kick<00:01:56.869> on<00:01:57.109> but<00:01:58.039> no

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
hear the compressor kick on but no

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.190 
hear the compressor kick on but no
blower<00:01:58.609> motor<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.179> have<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.450> come<00:02:00.020> down<00:02:00.170> here

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
blower motor you have to come down here

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.520 
blower motor you have to come down here
and<00:02:00.499> beat<00:02:00.710> on<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.909> motor<00:02:02.210> housing

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
and beat on the the motor housing

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.919 
and beat on the the motor housing
sometimes<00:02:03.530> turns<00:02:03.859> on<00:02:04.100> if<00:02:04.249> you<00:02:04.369> beat<00:02:04.549> on<00:02:04.729> it

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
sometimes turns on if you beat on it

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.290 
sometimes turns on if you beat on it

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
cluster out

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.800 
cluster out
alright<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.640> get<00:02:13.819> these<00:02:14.030> four<00:02:14.300> bolts<00:02:14.510> out

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
alright so to get these four bolts out

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.260 
alright so to get these four bolts out
I'm<00:02:15.050> using<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.590> seven<00:02:16.010> millimeter<00:02:16.460> socket

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
I'm using this seven millimeter socket

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.940 
I'm using this seven millimeter socket
with<00:02:17.480> extension<00:02:18.200> I'm<00:02:18.440> just<00:02:18.620> going<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.800> pull

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
with extension I'm just going to pull

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.970 
with extension I'm just going to pull
these<00:02:19.069> out<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.340> then<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:20.510> whole<00:02:20.980> cluster

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
these out and then this whole cluster

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.730 
these out and then this whole cluster
should<00:02:22.160> come<00:02:22.400> out<00:02:22.430> there's<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.390> power<00:02:24.020> cord<00:02:24.470> in

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
should come out there's a power cord in

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.890 
should come out there's a power cord in
there<00:02:25.130> with<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.430> blue<00:02:25.640> connector<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.690> I'll

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
there with the blue connector that I'll

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.690 
there with the blue connector that I'll
have<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.110> undo

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.010 

all<00:02:35.700> right<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.030> here's<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.300> instrument

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
all right so here's the instrument

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.870 
all right so here's the instrument
cluster<00:02:37.140> out<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.010> truck<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.670> is

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
cluster out of the truck this is

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.910 
cluster out of the truck this is
apparently<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.630> pretty<00:02:39.750> common<00:02:40.380> problem<00:02:40.830> with

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
apparently a pretty common problem with

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.550 
apparently a pretty common problem with
this<00:02:41.070> LCD<00:02:41.550> intermittently<00:02:42.510> going<00:02:42.870> out<00:02:43.050> it's<00:02:43.440> a

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
this LCD intermittently going out it's a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.210 
this LCD intermittently going out it's a
common<00:02:43.890> problem<00:02:44.130> from<00:02:44.580> 99<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.630> 2000<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.470> GM

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
common problem from 99 to 2000 and to GM

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.940 
common problem from 99 to 2000 and to GM
trucks<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.240> what<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.570> have<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.870> do<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.260> take<00:02:49.709> this

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
trucks so what I have to do is take this

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.460 
trucks so what I have to do is take this
back<00:02:50.220> panel<00:02:50.850> off<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.060> then<00:02:51.540> check<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.170> solder

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
back panel off and then check the solder

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.550 
back panel off and then check the solder
joints<00:02:53.070> on<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.520> LCD<00:02:54.240> board<00:02:54.660> sometimes<00:02:55.110> they

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
joints on this LCD board sometimes they

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.100 
joints on this LCD board sometimes they
are<00:02:55.770> not<00:02:56.220> soldered<00:02:56.550> completely<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.810> I'm<00:02:57.959> going

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
are not soldered completely so I'm going

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.140 
are not soldered completely so I'm going
to<00:02:58.170> check<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.190> looks<00:02:59.459> fine<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.060> I'm

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
to check that if that looks fine and I'm

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.220 
to check that if that looks fine and I'm
just<00:03:00.300> going<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.480> put<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.690> little<00:03:00.870> white<00:03:01.050> grease

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
just going to put a little white grease

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.790 
just going to put a little white grease
on<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.650> connector<00:03:02.430> pin<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.000> hopefully<00:03:03.930> it

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
on that connector pin and hopefully it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.670 
on that connector pin and hopefully it
works<00:03:05.690> all<00:03:06.690> right<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.110> when<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.350> pull<00:03:07.530> this

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
works all right so when you pull this

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.320 
works all right so when you pull this
back<00:03:07.920> cover<00:03:08.280> off<00:03:08.400> you're<00:03:08.820> going<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.000> see<00:03:09.180> the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
back cover off you're going to see the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.810 
back cover off you're going to see the
backside<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.140> circuit<00:03:10.620> board<00:03:10.890> it's<00:03:11.550> only

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
backside of this circuit board it's only

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.510 
backside of this circuit board it's only
set<00:03:12.780> on<00:03:12.989> here<00:03:13.350> it's<00:03:13.560> not<00:03:13.709> held<00:03:13.920> on<00:03:14.100> by<00:03:14.280> anything

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
set on here it's not held on by anything

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.580 
set on here it's not held on by anything
this<00:03:14.940> just<00:03:15.000> pulls<00:03:15.480> off<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.200> what<00:03:16.290> we're<00:03:16.470> gonna

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
this just pulls off so what we're gonna

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.550 
this just pulls off so what we're gonna
do<00:03:16.920> now<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.489> unclip<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.510> see<00:03:19.170> these<00:03:19.350> little

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
do now is unclip this see these little

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.410 
do now is unclip this see these little
clips<00:03:19.920> in<00:03:20.130> there<00:03:20.340> I'm<00:03:20.580> going<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.760> unclip<00:03:21.239> it

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
clips in there I'm going to unclip it

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.900 
clips in there I'm going to unclip it
and<00:03:21.660> carefully<00:03:21.930> Bend<00:03:22.709> this<00:03:22.890> up<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.580> that<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.760> can

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
and carefully Bend this up so that I can

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.449 
and carefully Bend this up so that I can
inspect<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.510> solder<00:03:24.810> joints<00:03:25.440> here<00:03:25.770> this<00:03:26.250> is

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
inspect the solder joints here this is

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.460 
inspect the solder joints here this is
the<00:03:26.610> common<00:03:26.970> pin<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.450> not<00:03:27.630> be<00:03:27.810> soldered<00:03:28.110> right

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
the common pin to not be soldered right

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.930 
the common pin to not be soldered right
so<00:03:28.890> we're<00:03:29.070> going<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.280> check<00:03:29.520> it

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
so we're going to check it

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.270 
so we're going to check it
well<00:03:30.239> I<00:03:30.300> check<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.930> connections<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.980> they

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
well I check the connections and they

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.789 
well I check the connections and they
all<00:03:32.370> seem<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.760> be<00:03:32.850> soldered<00:03:33.390> on<00:03:33.510> there<00:03:33.750> fine<00:03:34.049> so

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
all seem to be soldered on there fine so

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.229 
all seem to be soldered on there fine so
I'm<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.160> going<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.400> put<00:03:35.730> everything<00:03:35.940> back

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
I'm just going to put everything back

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:46.190 
I'm just going to put everything back
together<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:37.370> we'll<00:03:38.370> see<00:03:44.630> as<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.840> can<00:03:45.989> see

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
together and we'll see as you can see

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.670 
together and we'll see as you can see
everything<00:03:46.650> works<00:03:46.860> now<00:03:48.320> after<00:03:49.320> cleaning<00:03:49.530> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
everything works now after cleaning the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.920 
everything works now after cleaning the
terminal<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.519> let's<00:03:51.150> go<00:03:51.299> for<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> test<00:03:51.780> run

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.650 

she's<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:57.960> bit<00:03:58.200> flooded
