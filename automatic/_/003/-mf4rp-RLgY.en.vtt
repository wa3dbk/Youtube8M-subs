00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.770 

tried<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.670> make<00:00:44.879> sure<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> kept<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.540> same

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
tried to make sure I kept the same

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.229 
tried to make sure I kept the same
anointing<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:49.219> so<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.309> felt<00:00:50.579> real<00:00:50.850> good

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:03.040 

the<00:00:55.239> layer<00:00:55.480> stuff

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.320 

notice<00:01:03.650> when<00:01:03.830> I'm<00:01:03.980> layering<00:01:04.489> like<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.300> switch

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.130 

to<00:01:10.690> another<00:01:10.990> path

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:32.899 

I<00:01:16.610> can<00:01:17.610> use<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> mod<00:01:18.030> will

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:47.359

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.850 

little<00:01:48.369> faster<00:01:48.909> a<00:01:49.090> little<00:01:49.840> FM<00:01:50.289> time<00:01:50.560> right

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
little faster a little FM time right

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.969 
little faster a little FM time right
here<00:01:51.130> for<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.209> guys<00:01:52.450> who<00:01:52.719> love<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.020> those<00:01:53.619> FM

here for you guys who love that those FM
time<00:01:57.329> there<00:01:58.329> with<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.750> dyno<00:01:59.020> got<00:01:59.920> something

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
time there with the dyno got something

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:21.080 
time there with the dyno got something
real<00:02:00.520> special

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.710 

piano<00:02:23.670> careful<00:02:24.670> what<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.910> layer<00:02:25.120> though<00:02:25.360> look

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
piano careful what you layer though look

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.590 
piano careful what you layer though look
at<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.900> CPU<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:28.500> before<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.650> layer<00:02:30.330> or<00:02:31.330> does

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
at the CPU so before you layer or does

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:44.970 
at the CPU so before you layer or does
the<00:02:31.720> CPU<00:02:32.230> but

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.910 

so<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.040> want<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.310> hear<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.549> EP<00:02:46.970> course<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:48.709> want

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.059 

with<00:03:32.120> me<00:03:32.330> it's<00:03:32.959> good<00:03:33.200> but<00:03:33.560> remember

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
with me it's good but remember

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.160 
with me it's good but remember
everything<00:03:34.430> is<00:03:34.760> within<00:03:35.090> reason

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.640 

so<00:03:39.980> it's<00:03:40.370> just<00:03:40.550> betta<00:03:41.020> we're<00:03:42.020> keeping<00:03:42.380> people
