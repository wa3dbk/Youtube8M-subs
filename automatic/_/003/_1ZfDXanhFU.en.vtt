00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.179
 the skoda octavia has been one for years 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.660
 lion succes and the netherlands there that is very 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.769
 logical because this car is very large 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.719
 for relatively little money 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.580
 decent volkswagen quality and he is 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.080
 very anonymous appearance so here falls 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.670
 not with that car 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.380
 this third generation is also coming 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.269
 a 40 percent addition performance and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.740
 you know in advance in the czech republic 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.840
 they are already singing it out loud 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.849
 wilhelmus yes then they know at fort in 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.410
 cologne everything because since the focus 14% 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.840
 has an addition is that really is not 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.550
 to drag in our country that is under 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.110
 a well the one process diesel and in it 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.870
 park implementation and we have here too 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.530
 deal with dm process ecoboost gasoline 150 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.170
 pk 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.430
 and moreover there is with an ass 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.870
 that has the advantage that you have quite a bit 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.090
 more love luggage room because there 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.840
 goes no less than 475 liters in the back of this 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.399
 focus 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.610
 so for that matter it was worthy 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.199
 competitor for the guinea pig 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.340
 475 liters I hope your child and 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.340
 wants to take Lego bricks 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.720
 and no matter how ordinary the octave is to you 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.850
 so actually a very special car 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.380
 ramp it is a c segments but then with 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.810
 a space the feel of a d-segment 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.880
 inside there is actually little through 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.320
 our changed but in the main line 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.820
 never stayed the same 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.740
 change a green team that they understand well 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.200
 beeskow that is a car that some seeds 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.580
 is what what business what what waiting mourning 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.160
 but very good all good 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.840
 finished and very clearly a logical one 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.060
 never grasps misfit exactly everything is 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.320
 with your pity I again think you had 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.640
 for this use your contact meets 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 very handy stop your key and the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.270
 you never get lost so now one or the other 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.280
 tacky tackled button that's the luxury 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.960
 you do that elegance 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.490
 on the other hand so that also because they 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.110
 the very nice special things 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.190
 enlarge the door box on the right 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.479
 a kind of holder for and 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.950
 garbage bags yes you will not have any 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.750
 win a Nobel Prize but it is true 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.130
 nice idea and right here in the middle of it 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.229
 middle cup hold a kind of holder 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.759
 where I ca n't get rid of my cell phone and if and 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.200
 those little things and ice scraper 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.280
 behind the tank top yes make it up 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.320
 once more out never lost and then 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.150
 he cleans out he is bigger he is wider and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.860
 longer than the rear octavia 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.549
 especially a lot of space and a lot 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.660
 trunk 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:13.680
 oh yes from tram the offer of focus 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.350
 then we do not really hit me 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.450
 back it is all neat for 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.130
 the c segment but it doesn't do that 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.120
 little bit extra by going through it though 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.370
 is doing 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.079
 further the interior of the focus yes me 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.519
 start a bit annoyingly known 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.480
 being recovered more about it is well 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.310
 once like that 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.530
 she wants to look nice and fresh is nice 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.030
 designed but keeps it ergonomic 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.079
 all not really about what you need 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.489
 Search 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.170
 quickly zoom in on the map 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.940
 octavia is turning their button 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.579
 winter and here you have to search with 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.720
 Push buttons is an arrow and it works 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.989
 just all ff not so bad 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.430
 nice on the operation itself the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.110
 things here 8 the wheel had that cruise 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.340
 control that works reasonably well 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.709
 it's just never quite 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.810
 it will naturally take some getting used to 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.099
 yes , that is really still necessary in 2013 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.650
 well, of course, it's all about 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.690
 what can be behind a 475 liter like 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.700
 said that is well inside than the guinea pig 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.040
 and moreover this is of course a real one 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.120
 traditional Amsterdam 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.110
 let's see how that goes as a couple 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.110
 removal boxes must be in la 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.030
 a market where that is exactly you about 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.380
 front door to start with that focus of 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.239
 you because I have a move for you 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.599
 bavaria that can expire 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.599
 tackle this 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:33.410
 well here runs over her 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:36.099
 chicken a little encore yes he is 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.099
 no problem 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:47.720
 so I can, just like the audi a3 de 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.880
 new wave and the new leon state too 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.410
 this octavia on the mqb platform of 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.420
 volkswagen and so say a week already 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.940
 a bit how that trip well and no 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.769
 very good steering wheel and the car he it 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.000
 crimes that are sharpness of a people 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.690
 for example , he has golf again 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.859
 not 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.359
 but that they do that with more comfort 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.069
 opposite I think just on purpose 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.530
 done satsuki is a car finally 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.239
 get all this car also comes as 40 cents 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.660
 at counter this is that this is not the 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.549
 gasoline the one point four with 140 hp tsi 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.010
 and this accounts for 20% addition a 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.150
 very nice malt a good container also alone 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.400
 At the bottom you can feel it 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.840
 for a moment what i get sometimes effe that 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.650
 feeling but for the rest one 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.650
 very nice machine 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.560
 rot on that plane for natural 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.600
 also all names that input 6 ecoboost 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.639
 this 150hp version that also stands 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.400
 known as a very nice engine 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.020
 in addition, also a 20% addition and type k 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.220
 more 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.930
 of course you don't notice that 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.820
 really but that does not affect that 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.250
 input 6 really very nice so it draws 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.600
 from 500 to detect you really full of surrender 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.340
 to 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.380
 slightly less attentive to the gas than that 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.300
 then that taizÃ© but yes for daily 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.889
 use is fine 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.300
 yes and then gearboxes transported 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.840
 which of course you always good for plume 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.090
 that is unchanged or iebac table 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.280
 also works fine there , it has folk 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.320
 I just bake a little extra is tasty 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.000
 mechanically tasty as if you were really into it 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.680
 the gears are stirring yes that is 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.949
 for the real driver is of course 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.660
 because plus very good because we then 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.120
 praise from the lock about the focus 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.289
 the chassis also that is a known point 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.820
 of course now 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.320
 he sends very sharply he has 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.419
 lots of grip for that which 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.700
 tighter than octavia but it wo n't be 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.039
 uncomfortable and bounce what that 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.330
 concerns a very nice balance in the car 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.860
 He is nice if you agree 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.510
 cloverleaf wants to hunt but never 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.490
 Annoying that he is sitting she has 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.300
 because also mainly made do then says 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.300
 a plus of the focus 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.070
 yes that is not easy to make your choice 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.380
 new octavia between these two cars 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.870
 I really think it's great car row 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.820
 enormously spacious when important, albeit well 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.710
 finished ergonomically you are completely top and 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:15.000
 I also add quite nice and nice 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.650
 so what does the focus still have for it 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.240
 Needs to help them to finish 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.250
 already doing a lot about it indeed 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.720
 but if driving I would find him then 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.760
 actually good weather 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.520
 one step better than the octavia 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.080
 switch the motor yes so penny 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.480
 So I have a little 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.500
 personal preference I think what ha 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.510
 cost something like that 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.910
 around 30,000 who assist profiling 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.020
 actually how money that money is 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.090
 Of course a lot of the best pick 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.950
 yes we did that in the 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.960
 paper version of car week therein 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.940
 said these cars extensively tested after 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.190
 you provide the measurement data that we do things more 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.220
 consumption figures and also the kia 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.220
 optima
