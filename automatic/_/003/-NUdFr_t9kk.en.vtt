items<00:00:14.969> these<00:00:15.780> are<00:00:15.929> totally<00:00:16.800> different<00:00:17.130> than

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
items these are totally different than

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.650 
items these are totally different than
anything<00:00:17.520> I've<00:00:17.760> really<00:00:18.090> ever<00:00:18.119> seen<00:00:18.510> before

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
anything I've really ever seen before

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.599 
anything I've really ever seen before
tell<00:00:19.260> us<00:00:19.410> about<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:19.770> we're<00:00:19.890> looking<00:00:20.010> at<00:00:20.250> yes

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
tell us about what we're looking at yes

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.300 
tell us about what we're looking at yes
so<00:00:21.060> these<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:21.810> really<00:00:22.230> crazy<00:00:22.439> products<00:00:22.980> these

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
so these are really crazy products these

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.700 
so these are really crazy products these
are<00:00:23.550> basically<00:00:24.000> lens<00:00:24.449> style<00:00:24.750> cameras<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.590> I

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
are basically lens style cameras if I

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.890 
are basically lens style cameras if I
get<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.010> right<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.029> not<00:00:27.210> only<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.510> lens

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
get this right this is not only a lens

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.679 
get this right this is not only a lens
but<00:00:28.349> there's<00:00:28.529> also<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.980> camera<00:00:29.490> within<00:00:30.449> this

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
but there's also a camera within this

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.659 
but there's also a camera within this
yeah<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.349> where<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.679> really<00:00:31.890> shines<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
yeah and where it really shines is the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.670 
yeah and where it really shines is the
ability<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.090> connect<00:00:33.570> your<00:00:33.750> phone<00:00:34.020> seamlessly

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
ability to connect your phone seamlessly

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.250 
ability to connect your phone seamlessly
so<00:00:35.100> whatever<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.579> take<00:00:35.850> photos<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:37.020> also

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
so whatever you take photos up it also

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.860 
so whatever you take photos up it also
streams<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> your<00:00:38.340> smartphone<00:00:38.870> isolate

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
streams it to your smartphone isolate

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.750 
streams it to your smartphone isolate
consistently<00:00:40.620> share<00:00:40.920> photo<00:00:41.309> or<00:00:41.579> video

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
consistently share photo or video

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.040 
consistently share photo or video
correct<00:00:42.480> that's<00:00:42.690> correct

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
correct that's correct

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.330 
correct that's correct
okay<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.649> are<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> differences<00:00:44.280> between

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
okay what are the differences between

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.060 
okay what are the differences between
the<00:00:44.700> two<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.969> them<00:00:45.059> sure<00:00:45.420> yeah<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.230> what<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> have

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the two of them sure yeah so what I have

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.819 
the two of them sure yeah so what I have
here<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.640> taller<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> QX<00:00:49.200> 100

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
here the taller one this is the QX 100

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.189 
here the taller one this is the QX 100
it's<00:00:50.340> an<00:00:50.489> amazing<00:00:51.090> lens<00:00:51.570> style<00:00:51.840> camera

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
it's an amazing lens style camera

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.979 
it's an amazing lens style camera
because<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:53.309> exactly<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.969> same<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.239> an<00:00:54.690> RX

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
because it's exactly the same as an RX

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.189 
because it's exactly the same as an RX
100<00:00:55.199> mark<00:00:55.770> 2<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.149> form<00:00:57.660> factor<00:00:57.780> in

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
100 mark 2 but in this form factor in

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.650 
100 mark 2 but in this form factor in
the<00:00:58.469> sense<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.430> sensor<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the sense of the sensor and the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.810 
the sense of the sensor and the
processor<00:01:01.199> yes<00:01:01.500> correct<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.340> M<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
processor yes correct so if M is a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.429 
processor yes correct so if M is a
sensor<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.660> inch<00:01:03.840> sensor<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
sensor it's in a one inch sensor and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.560 
sensor it's in a one inch sensor and
that's<00:01:04.710> an<00:01:04.890> XOR<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.760> takes<00:01:05.970> really<00:01:06.299> great

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that's an XOR it takes really great

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.120 
that's an XOR it takes really great
pictures<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.049> low-light<00:01:07.350> professional

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
pictures in low-light professional

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.600 
pictures in low-light professional
low-light<00:01:09.470> pictures<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.860> okay<00:01:11.250> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
low-light pictures with this okay and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.960 
low-light pictures with this okay and
then<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.970> lens<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.540> its<00:01:13.110> F<00:01:13.380> 1.8<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.340> extremely

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
then the lens to its F 1.8 so extremely

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.210 
then the lens to its F 1.8 so extremely
bright<00:01:15.240> okay<00:01:15.720> as<00:01:15.840> well<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.100> we

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
bright okay as well and then what we

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.929 
bright okay as well and then what we
have<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.390> Q<00:01:18.630> X<00:01:18.810> 10<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.759> has

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
have here is the Q X 10 so this one has

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.850 
have here is the Q X 10 so this one has
a<00:01:20.970> smaller<00:01:21.390> image<00:01:21.750> sensor<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.650> have

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
a smaller image sensor but you can have

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.390 
a smaller image sensor but you can have
10x<00:01:23.250> zoom<00:01:23.369> ok<00:01:24.330> 10x<00:01:24.689> zoom<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.229> with<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.100> level

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
10x zoom ok 10x zoom and with that level

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.950 
10x zoom ok 10x zoom and with that level
of<00:01:26.640> zoom<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.509> an<00:01:27.659> image

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
of zoom do we have an image

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.660 
of zoom do we have an image
stabilization<00:01:28.409> or<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.860> steady<00:01:29.159> shot<00:01:29.250> feature

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
stabilization or a steady shot feature

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.850 
stabilization or a steady shot feature
on<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.000> yeah<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.659> steady<00:01:30.900> shot<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.350> built

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
on this yeah it's a steady shot is built

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.010 
on this yeah it's a steady shot is built
inside<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.729> also<00:01:32.850> has<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.509> image<00:01:33.810> sensor

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
inside it also has the image sensor

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.499 
inside it also has the image sensor
built<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.590> its<00:01:35.009> own<00:01:35.430> separate<00:01:35.880> battery<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
built in its own separate battery and

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.690 
built in its own separate battery and
memory<00:01:37.049> stick<00:01:37.439> as<00:01:37.619> well<00:01:37.829> ok<00:01:38.220> what's<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
memory stick as well ok what's the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.490 
memory stick as well ok what's the
battery<00:01:39.000> life<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.329> both<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.659> these<00:01:39.780> these<00:01:40.290> are

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
battery life on both of these these are

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.580 
battery life on both of these these are
good<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.040> about<00:01:41.159> 200<00:01:41.790> shots<00:01:41.820> ok<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.170> let's<00:01:43.409> go

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
good for about 200 shots ok so let's go

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770 
good for about 200 shots ok so let's go
ahead<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.040> walk<00:01:44.280> through<00:01:44.340> how<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> pair

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
ahead and just walk through how to pair

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.310 
ahead and just walk through how to pair
the<00:01:46.439> camera<00:01:47.159> lens<00:01:47.460> with<00:01:48.210> your<00:01:48.450> actual<00:01:48.960> phone

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the camera lens with your actual phone

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.469 
the camera lens with your actual phone
sure<00:01:49.680> yeah<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.310> these<00:01:50.579> are<00:01:50.790> compatible<00:01:51.240> with

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
sure yeah so these are compatible with

network here with my Wi-Fi and I have a

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.809 
network here with my Wi-Fi and I have a
remote<00:02:17.660> viewfinder<00:02:18.110> correct<00:02:18.800> yeah<00:02:19.010> okay

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
remote viewfinder correct yeah okay

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.540 
remote viewfinder correct yeah okay
now<00:02:20.120> using<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:21.110> PlayMemories<00:02:21.769> mobile<00:02:22.340> app

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
now using the PlayMemories mobile app

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.900 
now using the PlayMemories mobile app
I'm<00:02:22.849> able<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.890> basically<00:02:24.890> see<00:02:25.160> exactly<00:02:25.519> what

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
I'm able to basically see exactly what

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.300 
I'm able to basically see exactly what
I'm<00:02:26.060> seeing<00:02:26.599> with<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.230> lens<00:02:27.440> camera<00:02:28.069> in<00:02:28.280> real

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
I'm seeing with the lens camera in real

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.089 
I'm seeing with the lens camera in real
time<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.090> we<00:02:29.660> can<00:02:29.959> actually<00:02:30.080> control<00:02:30.500> the

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
time and we can actually control the

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.150 
time and we can actually control the
exposure<00:02:32.049> intelligent<00:02:33.049> superior<00:02:33.590> program

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
exposure intelligent superior program

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.990 
exposure intelligent superior program
auto<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.239> then<00:02:35.390> also<00:02:35.629> we<00:02:35.900> can<00:02:35.930> actually<00:02:36.440> zoom

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
auto and then also we can actually zoom

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.240 
auto and then also we can actually zoom
correct<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.269> we<00:02:38.360> can<00:02:38.510> go<00:02:38.629> wide<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:39.980> and

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
correct so we can go wide on this and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.550 
correct so we can go wide on this and
then<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.430> course<00:02:40.459> trigger<00:02:40.970> start/stop<00:02:41.690> do<00:02:41.870> so

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
then of course trigger start/stop do so

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.370 
then of course trigger start/stop do so
that<00:02:43.549> is<00:02:43.760> that's<00:02:44.120> really<00:02:44.420> great<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.290> know

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
that is that's really great and you know

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.680 
that is that's really great and you know
again<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:45.829> actually<00:02:46.250> hooks<00:02:47.180> onto<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:47.510> phone

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
again this actually hooks onto the phone

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.229 
again this actually hooks onto the phone
yep<00:02:47.989> so<00:02:48.709> we<00:02:49.099> don't<00:02:49.310> need<00:02:49.459> us<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.819> always<00:02:50.030> be

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
yep so we don't need us to always be

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.740 
yep so we don't need us to always be
remote<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:51.049> it<00:02:51.140> looks<00:02:51.349> like<00:02:52.360> this<00:02:53.360> attaches

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
remote so it looks like this attaches

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.650 
remote so it looks like this attaches
directly<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.829> your<00:02:54.920> mobile<00:02:55.220> device<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:56.150> then

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
directly to your mobile device and then

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.600 
directly to your mobile device and then
you<00:02:56.780> can<00:02:56.930> use<00:02:57.079> it<00:02:57.230> like<00:02:57.349> this<00:02:57.560> as<00:02:57.739> well<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.220> that

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
you can use it like this as well so that

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.030 
you can use it like this as well so that
also<00:02:58.819> means<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.329> you<00:02:59.420> don't<00:02:59.540> need<00:03:00.019> these<00:03:00.230> to

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
also means that you don't need these to

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.800 
also means that you don't need these to
be<00:03:01.069> touching<00:03:01.370> exactly<00:03:02.090> in<00:03:02.150> order<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.540> see<00:03:02.720> it

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
be touching exactly in order to see it

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.360 
be touching exactly in order to see it
technically<00:03:03.230> because<00:03:03.769> you<00:03:03.920> don't<00:03:04.099> need<00:03:04.250> to

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
technically because you don't need to

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.580 
technically because you don't need to
have<00:03:04.489> this<00:03:04.730> on<00:03:04.970> your<00:03:05.299> phone<00:03:05.540> depending<00:03:06.470> upon

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
have this on your phone depending upon

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.039 
have this on your phone depending upon
what<00:03:07.370> you're<00:03:07.879> actually<00:03:08.180> gonna<00:03:08.269> be<00:03:08.420> using<00:03:08.629> this

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
what you're actually gonna be using this

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.160 
what you're actually gonna be using this
camera<00:03:09.799> lens<00:03:09.980> for<00:03:10.250> really<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.329> possibilities

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
camera lens for really the possibilities

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.789 
camera lens for really the possibilities
are<00:03:12.200> endless<00:03:12.319> now<00:03:13.190> how<00:03:13.459> far<00:03:13.850> can<00:03:14.720> be<00:03:14.799> camera

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
are endless now how far can be camera

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.590 
are endless now how far can be camera
lens<00:03:15.980> be<00:03:16.250> from<00:03:16.609> your<00:03:16.790> actual<00:03:17.060> mobile<00:03:17.359> device

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
lens be from your actual mobile device

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.289 
lens be from your actual mobile device
before<00:03:18.049> we<00:03:18.200> lose<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:19.190> signal<00:03:19.489> yeah<00:03:20.000> that's<00:03:20.180> a

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
before we lose the signal yeah that's a

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.990 
before we lose the signal yeah that's a
common<00:03:20.750> question<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:21.290> we<00:03:21.440> get<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:22.430> depends

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
common question that we get it depends

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.330 
common question that we get it depends
on<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.329> situation<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:24.260> if<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.829> have<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.069> lot<00:03:25.310> of

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
on the situation so if you have a lot of

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.490 
on the situation so if you have a lot of
walls<00:03:25.609> between<00:03:26.120> them<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:26.810> might<00:03:26.930> limit<00:03:27.139> it<00:03:27.349> but

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
walls between them it might limit it but

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.270 
walls between them it might limit it but
generally<00:03:28.010> 15<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.730> 30<00:03:29.000> feet<00:03:29.239> that's<00:03:29.720> great<00:03:30.019> so

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
generally 15 to 30 feet that's great so

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.099 
generally 15 to 30 feet that's great so
really<00:03:31.280> great<00:03:31.400> remote<00:03:31.819> features<00:03:32.389> you<00:03:33.019> know

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
really great remote features you know

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.379 
really great remote features you know
because<00:03:33.530> there<00:03:33.889> is<00:03:34.069> sort<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.459> limitation<00:03:35.030> on

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
because there is sort of a limitation on

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.069 
because there is sort of a limitation on
how<00:03:35.720> far<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.920> holders<00:03:37.639> spread<00:03:38.359> does<00:03:38.959> that

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
how far the holders spread does that

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.379 
how far the holders spread does that
mean<00:03:39.260> that<00:03:39.440> it's<00:03:39.590> either<00:03:40.180> compatible<00:03:41.180> with<00:03:41.359> a

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
mean that it's either compatible with a

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.309 
mean that it's either compatible with a
tablet<00:03:42.310> not<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:43.579> this<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.180> this<00:03:44.510> backplate<00:03:45.109> is

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
tablet not so this is this backplate is
