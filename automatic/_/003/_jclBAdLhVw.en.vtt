or a of this move so if we just show you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.609 
or a of this move so if we just show you
the<00:01:14.400> transition<00:01:14.970> between<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.689> rest<00:01:16.080> dusty

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the transition between the rest dusty

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.580 
the transition between the rest dusty
and<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.360> from<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.350> fall<00:01:19.560> of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and this one we have from the fall of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.880 
and this one we have from the fall of
the<00:01:19.799> log<00:01:20.060> seven<00:01:21.060> eight<00:01:21.299> one<00:01:21.840> two<00:01:22.200> three<00:01:22.380> four

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.719 
five six seven eight
yes<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.509> want<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.900> stay<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.979> right<00:01:32.250> leg<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
yes we want to stay on the right leg and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.630 
yes we want to stay on the right leg and
just<00:01:33.799> spank<00:01:34.799> under<00:01:35.549> eight<00:01:36.829> all<00:01:37.829> right<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
just spank under eight all right so the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.179 
just spank under eight all right so the
transition<00:01:39.240> from<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.930> spank<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> baby<00:01:40.560> into

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
transition from the spank the baby into

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.120 
transition from the spank the baby into
the<00:01:41.430> next<00:01:41.880> sequence<00:01:42.210> which<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
the next sequence which is the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.270 
the next sequence which is the
Charleston<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:45.149> happening<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.290> last<00:01:47.009> two

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
Charleston is happening on the last two

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.179 
Charleston is happening on the last two
counts<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.360> last<00:01:49.020> eight<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> fourth

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
counts of the last eight so the fourth

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.149 
counts of the last eight so the fourth
eighth<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.840> spank<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> baby<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.979> what

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
eighth of the spank the baby so what

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.499 
eighth of the spank the baby so what
we're<00:01:53.280> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.460> do<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.939> instead<00:01:54.450> of

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
we're going to do is that instead of
