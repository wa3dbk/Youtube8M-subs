playing Quigley in France after that but
the<00:04:54.229> modern<00:04:54.440> day<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:55.430> good<00:04:55.760> because<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:56.600> kind

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.830 
of have the school kids we were talking
about<00:04:58.220> earlier<00:04:58.370> I<00:04:58.910> think<00:04:59.600> they'll<00:04:59.720> be

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
about earlier I think they'll be

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.530 
about earlier I think they'll be
terrific<00:05:00.139> they<00:05:00.800> always<00:05:01.070> are<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.550> they've

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
terrific they always are and they've

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.879 
terrific they always are and they've
they've<00:05:03.250> grown<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.930> produced<00:05:05.930> champions

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
they've grown and produced champions

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.400 
they've grown and produced champions
over<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:07.850> years<00:05:08.030> when<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.389> think<00:05:08.479> of<00:05:08.840> the

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
over the years when you think of the

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.940 
over the years when you think of the
times<00:05:09.710> being<00:05:10.130> run<00:05:10.370> by<00:05:10.400> some<00:05:11.389> say<00:05:11.630> 30<00:05:12.440> years<00:05:12.680> ago

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
times being run by some say 30 years ago

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.500 
times being run by some say 30 years ago
and<00:05:14.620> then<00:05:15.620> you<00:05:15.800> realize<00:05:16.190> how<00:05:17.180> much<00:05:17.300> the

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
and then you realize how much the

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.290 
and then you realize how much the
training<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:18.320> coaching<00:05:18.650> and<00:05:19.070> the<00:05:19.639> athletes

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
training and coaching and the athletes

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.510 
training and coaching and the athletes
themselves<00:05:20.740> quite<00:05:21.740> brilliant<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:22.280> I'm<00:05:22.340> sure

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
themselves quite brilliant and I'm sure

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.800 
themselves quite brilliant and I'm sure
that'll<00:05:22.760> be<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.000> case<00:05:23.210> with<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.810> Olympics
