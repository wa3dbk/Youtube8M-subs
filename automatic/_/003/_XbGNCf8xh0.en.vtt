just a quick glimpse of a some of my
favorite<00:00:21.430> presets<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:24.340> we<00:00:24.850> load<00:00:25.060> it<00:00:25.240> up<00:00:25.359> and<00:00:26.369> it

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
favorite presets so we load it up and it

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.840 
favorite presets so we load it up and it
opens<00:00:27.939> at<00:00:28.150> the<00:00:28.330> last<00:00:28.660> used<00:00:29.050> preset<00:00:29.590> a<00:00:29.850> basic

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
opens at the last used preset a basic

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:45.810 
opens at the last used preset a basic
one<00:00:31.029> called<00:00:31.480> double<00:00:32.230> trouble<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:45.340> this<00:00:45.670> is<00:00:45.790> a

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
one called double trouble so this is a

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.630 
one called double trouble so this is a
sequence<00:00:46.300> I<00:00:46.570> have<00:00:47.140> notes<00:00:47.379> entered<00:00:48.070> into<00:00:48.520> the

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
sequence I have notes entered into the

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.590 
sequence I have notes entered into the
noise<00:00:48.969> ayos<00:00:49.829> sequencer<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:51.270> I'm<00:00:52.270> going<00:00:52.570> to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
noise ayos sequencer and I'm going to

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.619 
noise ayos sequencer and I'm going to
show<00:00:52.840> it<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.020> you<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.370> we<00:00:54.550> enter<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.210> editor

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
show it to you so we enter the editor

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.470 
show it to you so we enter the editor
and<00:00:55.840> go<00:00:56.829> to<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.190> pitch<00:00:57.399> sequence<00:00:57.610> a<00:00:58.000> tab<00:00:58.239> and

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
and go to the pitch sequence a tab and

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.670 
and go to the pitch sequence a tab and
then<00:00:59.140> strike<00:00:59.770> the<00:01:00.059> be-bop<00:01:01.059> a<00:01:01.239> drunkie<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.379> this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
then strike the be-bop a drunkie so this

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.649 
then strike the be-bop a drunkie so this
is<00:01:05.710> basically<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.369> bedroom<00:01:06.969> that<00:01:07.299> is<00:01:07.329> being

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
is basically the bedroom that is being

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.129 
is basically the bedroom that is being
played<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.310> glide<00:01:09.549> nodes<00:01:09.819> and<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.139> empty

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:11.139 
played see the glide nodes and the empty

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:17.609 
played see the glide nodes and the empty
nodes<00:01:11.319> which<00:01:11.799> act<00:01:12.069> like<00:01:12.399> space<00:01:16.109> okay<00:01:17.109> let's<00:01:17.499> go

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
nodes which act like space okay let's go

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.370 
nodes which act like space okay let's go
back<00:01:17.889> to<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.130> surface<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.929> let's<00:01:19.929> have<00:01:20.109> some

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
back to the surface and let's have some

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.080 
back to the surface and let's have some
fun<00:01:20.649> with<00:01:20.859> the<00:01:21.009> presets<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:21.579> have<00:01:21.909> been

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
fun with the presets that have been

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.709 
fun with the presets that have been
designed<00:01:22.240> for<00:01:22.599> the<00:01:22.659> keyboard<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:25.240> is<00:01:25.389> one<00:01:25.569> of

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
designed for the keyboard this is one of

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:34.960 
designed for the keyboard this is one of
my<00:01:25.840> favorite<00:01:26.319> presets

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.789 

the<00:01:35.970> unique<00:01:36.240> thing<00:01:36.299> about<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:37.140> keyboard<00:01:37.619> is

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the unique thing about this keyboard is

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.700 
the unique thing about this keyboard is
that<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.310> has<00:01:38.549> velocity<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.080> I<00:01:40.259> streck<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that it has velocity so if I streck the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.280 
that it has velocity so if I streck the
key<00:01:40.860> higher<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:44.280> sound<00:01:44.580> gets<00:01:44.880> quiet<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.509> if<00:01:46.080> I

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
key higher the sound gets quiet and if I

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.440 
key higher the sound gets quiet and if I
strike<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> keyboard<00:01:47.190> at<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.640> bottom<00:01:50.450> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
strike the keyboard at the bottom the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.090 
strike the keyboard at the bottom the
velocity<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> sound<00:01:52.530> increases

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
velocity of the sound increases

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.760 
velocity of the sound increases
gradually<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.810> allows<00:01:55.289> really

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
gradually and it allows really

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:04.550 
gradually and it allows really
expressive<00:01:56.369> playing<00:02:02.840> one<00:02:03.840> more<00:02:03.869> unique<00:02:04.319> thing

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
expressive playing one more unique thing

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.160 
expressive playing one more unique thing
about<00:02:04.590> noise<00:02:05.190> io<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.940> that<00:02:06.300> we<00:02:06.420> had<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> kind<00:02:07.020> of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
about noise io is that we had a kind of

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.440 
about noise io is that we had a kind of
a<00:02:07.380> modulation<00:02:07.890> wheel<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.910> left<00:02:09.090> part<00:02:09.360> of

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
a modulation wheel at the left part of

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.470 
a modulation wheel at the left part of
the<00:02:09.569> screen<00:02:10.580> basically<00:02:11.580> when<00:02:11.880> we<00:02:12.000> have<00:02:12.239> the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
the screen basically when we have the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.720 
the screen basically when we have the
keyboard<00:02:12.989> enabled<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.890> control<00:02:14.310> surface

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
keyboard enabled the control surface

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.540 
keyboard enabled the control surface
shrinks<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.870> small<00:02:16.350> strip<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.370> this

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
shrinks to this small strip and in this

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.330 
shrinks to this small strip and in this
preset<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.269> have<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.780> cutoff<00:02:19.200> assigned<00:02:20.160> to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
preset we have the cutoff assigned to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:31.150 
preset we have the cutoff assigned to
the<00:02:20.430> up/down<00:02:20.970> axis

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:39.390 

you

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
it has the vibrator speed assigned to

00:02:45.379 --> 00:03:04.369 
it has the vibrator speed assigned to
the<00:02:45.499> up-down<00:02:45.980> axis

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:17.630 

some<00:03:05.379> organic<00:03:05.920> preset<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.870> kind<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:08.049> spooky

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
okay now let's get back to the sequences

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.460 
okay now let's get back to the sequences
one<00:03:21.370> thing<00:03:21.640> i<00:03:21.819> love<00:03:22.030> about<00:03:22.269> noise<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:23.019> oh<00:03:23.049> is
