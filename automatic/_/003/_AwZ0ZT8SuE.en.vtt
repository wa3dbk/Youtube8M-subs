00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.080
The University of Melbourne consistently ranks

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.280
amongst the top universities in the world

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.200
for the quality of our teaching and research.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.160
And our graduates are ranked

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.440
in the top ten worldwide

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.840
for employability.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.800
The University has over fifteen graduate schools

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.800
which offer a range of focused and intense courses

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.840
to prepare you for professional careers

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.400
wherever you passion lies.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.720
Whether your future is being a doctor,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.600
a lawyer,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.600
an engineer,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.600
a teacher,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.520
an economist,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.720
whatever it is, the University's graduate schools

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.200
will give you that all important first step.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.720
The gradaute schools offer a suite of professional entry programs

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.400
for when you are commencing your career

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.600
and over 340 professional development programs

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.480
for that extra boost if you are already working.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.040
We have the most amazing experts here.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.800
Our international law group

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.600
is really second to none.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.320
An extraordinary wealth of people

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.400
who working in international tribunals,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.560
for international courts,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.920
in all sorts of different jurisdictions.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.400
Our schools are staffed by

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.760
world class academics and researchers

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.840
and offer a range of teaching styles.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.160
From group discussion to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.520
collaborative study.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.520
Our course design includes connections with community

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.040
government and industry for a truly

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.480
professional education.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.280
Each school has strong industry links

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.640
that give you the contacts you need

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.040
to grow your network.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.040
We probably have the largest industry connections

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.880
in the country as it is already

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.720
and we want to grow.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.720
I have constant contact with HR

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.080
people with all the law firms

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.400
which is a really good way

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.880
of getting to know where you want to go.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.520
The Master of Teaching is quite a unique program.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.200
It's very different to programs you find at other institutions.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.040
It involves very close partnership

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.920
between the University and some partnership schools.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.840
And the academic program is very much

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.640
designed and incorporated into

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.760
the practice that students have.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.040
So our students have three days at the University

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.520
and then they have two days in school per week.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.560
We're able to attend staff meetings,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.040
professional development sessions,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.280
be involved in school excursions, 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.200
camps, musical theatre,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.320
bands, sports activities.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.560
You will have the opportunity to study overseas

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.520
and develop strong inter-cultural communication skills.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.720
Working overseas is also

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.480
very likely,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.640
given where the Biomedical market is

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.640
and where a lot of the univiersities

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.720
have research teams.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.560
There's a lot of work internationally.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.400
Our students graduate

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.840
with internationally recognised qualifications

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.640
that are globally transportable.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.040
We are fully accredited under the EUR-ACE accreditation

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.840
as well as the Washington accord.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.440
So it means that our students, unlike any other students in Australia

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.320
can actually present themselves in Germany

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.160
and become a professional engineer.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.040
Registered in Germany as a professional engineer

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.200
You can't do that anywhere else.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.120
The University has worked closely with employers

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.320
to develop programs that will provide

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.040
transferable, high level skills

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.040
which enables graduates to keep place with employment trends

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.760
in a rapidly changing world.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.240
A colleague who was a structural engineer,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.040
and he was working on the Black Hawk helicopter project,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.040
he applied for a job at Macquarie Bank

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.040
and they snapped him up.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.720
It was interesting to see how

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.280
transferable his skills were.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.040
The key is diversity

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.040
and Melbourne's graduates are certainly

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.480
for thinking outside of the box.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800
I like engineers to go into society

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.520
much broader than just what we

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.400
traditionally associate with engineering.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.080
I like people to go into finance,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.320
look at risk analysis.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.560
Look at how you organise a police department.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.520
Be part of a big bank.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.160
So what are you waiting for?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.240
It's your future and your choice.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.040
