 of ingredients you will see us 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.179
 as we are going to be part of 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.679
 the recipes that are going to be very fast 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.320
 so that they can use them in their 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.789
 pastry in your dessert bar or in 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.339
 any sweet or presentation that 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.570
 want to give for your house then let's go 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.970
 Let's see 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.560
 very good here I already have my cream 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.370
 fresh cream are fixed is like in 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.220
 color rosita and the smell smells as well as 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.230
 as credited with strawberry then the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.239
 it's true that they're going to see who knows 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.690
 well, well, well, I have to do 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.000
 put it to beat 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.530
 just wait for him to get up already 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.300
 They know that I can discuss after 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.750
 we accept the cream here I'm going to put 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.630
 a cup and the time debated if we 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.880
 let's go like 5 to 7 minutes in the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.220
 case of being a cup if they are two cups it 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.710
 it may take up to nine ten minutes in 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.140
 using a homemade blender 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.910
 brings a little more revolutions but 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.800
 that I'm working a manual mixer 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.440
 it probably takes me three more minutes 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.970
 Estimated time and I just told 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.950
 comment then let's take it 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.360
 to beat and see how is our 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.510
 cream to start decorating our 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510
 cars 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.250
 now yes you already came out what is our 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.690
 cream and it was perfect to hold 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.640
 what our sets do in 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.080
 heat season and season 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.560
 winter produces say because it holds 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.050
 perfect then here already once 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.099
 we are going to put in our sleeve and 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.230
 up to 29 to bend the sleeve and we're going to 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.380
 put some of our chantilly cream 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.750
 of strawberry that will be fine either 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.880
 rich to decorate tell them is no longer 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.920
 necessary to add colorants and 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.260
 strawberry flavors or anything because 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.010
 they only bring if they fix the cream is a 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.930
 pink as well as clear style then with 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.319
 that cream like that is going to look really good 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.080
 here we upload what is our sleeve 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.519
 I'm working a 1m shower and now yes 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.640
 we go for the decoration that goes to 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.829
 be very simple well rich we started 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.329
 from here outside and we're going towards 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.329
 up then we press 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.620
 we are going to make shots but they are 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.640
 little ones not so big and we started 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.640
 decorate all the same 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.540
 Y 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.590
 now yes once I have my quito 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.920
 it has been decorated we are going to put 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.610
 decorations like strawberries like praline 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.470
 that I already have with my rich decoration of 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.470
 nuts then let's put here 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.260
 we mentioned others then this is the 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.700
 ease that is taking us now 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.040
 product that is in you and of strawberries with 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.110
 cream not to add extra anything else 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.780
 because they are another product because you're going to 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.959
 see as well as super rich and with some 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.400
 how many decorations that we put to 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.390
 our cupcakes with that and to know 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.860
 appetizing and delicious for a 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.020
 party or bar presentation 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.850
 desserts just ended up putting a little bit of 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.870
 polisher of the same brand of 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.700
 chantilly 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.440
 so that our fruit will not be 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.049
 Dehydrate can be applied with a 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.780
 manga a brochita with what they are most 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.019
 facilitate you and that our fruit 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.990
 Well, on brightness 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.919
 Now, here are our cupcakes 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.919
 ready 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.570
 so ready to use and to present 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.580
 and they're going to see that he's going to be very rich already 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.350
 everyone is going to love it and 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.270
 as chantilly cream itself is the 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.430
 I recommend a lot of prizes with cream 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.770
 or mocha or base cream that will 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.190
 love and then I'm going to try one 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.190
 see how 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.980
 very rich 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.980
 but I recommend so 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.250
