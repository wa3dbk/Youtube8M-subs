our time and access to our wash plant I

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.979 
our time and access to our wash plant I
just<00:02:38.560> got<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.830> build<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.220> build<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.850> right<00:02:40.030> then

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
just got to build it build it right then
