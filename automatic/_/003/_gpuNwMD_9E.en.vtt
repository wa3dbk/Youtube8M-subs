 exactly by josiane pretention i 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.840
 looked to be able to put them together 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.690
 then I will add my melted heart 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.399
 to gold on 100 g of butter just crazy about 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.949
 yes at room temperature really 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.489
 that they do not obviously resume in the 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.660
 comfort 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.789
 it is the case to disperse it very quickly 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.530
 and I'm going to add two spoons to 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.979
 sugar soup 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.250
 and yes, how to reduce if you 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.590
 wish good of leather was since yesterday 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.390
 by donation being the really the minimum of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.659
 small tablespoons I'm going 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.580
 add a teaspoon or a half 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.530
 spoonful of white rum I 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.180
 mixed some of the ingredients into 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.710
 first you understand that I could have 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.810
 do against the state by the dominant 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.270
 yes because the device the flour to 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.400
 rains in the last act 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.950
 how much flour 125 g this is the device 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.930
 via lump-faced list these are there if 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.439
 there are one or two men a shot of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.130
 whip above coming ivory or axial 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:52.439
 we reserve and we can go up 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.299
 the blocks one sets aside a device 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.399
 mixture of ingredients called 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.800
 the camera and we have a blu ray on 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:07.250
 burned two names 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:07.910
 and that's comment look there they 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.650
 are well smooth 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.530
 so the best is when I liked 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.330
 husband then there too a little gesture 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.680
 we know we still took a little bit of 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.630
 time to mount blanks 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.300
 so we'll do a little bit of attention 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.090
 do not break them too much so I 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.380
 rotate the bowl as you go 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.270
 measure movement here is our 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.590
 device to goce is ready one to 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.180
 preheat appliances a little 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.770
 precaution protect your plan from 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.940
 work you'll see we risk 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.990
 bring out a few devices 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.310
 either side because we 're gonna go when 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.920
 even load a little bit with 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.350
 the cold waffle maker so you have to 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.620
 count at least more than one pouch 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.590
 small ladle to fill 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.770
 so you see I'm going to really put 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.330
 quite widely two good pochon and this 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.660
 so watch it that's it 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.420
 important one there I know well and I 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.580
 go right back right now and 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.170
 we then stopped small burr that we 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.730
 see it's not very pretty I admit it 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.680
 but it also allows us to evaluate 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.250
 sees the paw turn the steam 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.360
 it's going to be a test for the 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.640
 see a little bit if the waffle is cooked 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.080
 or not the hall and waffles eight minutes 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.200
 all that defends the waffle makers we had 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.540
 well filled with louvre the surprise 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.520
 and that's when the interests on this 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.230
 we can rent or generators of power 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.860
 take off them alone that's the com 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.530
 so she did not hesitate we are where here 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.020
 take them and let cool and the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.510
 waffle to say if on the surface will remain 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.480
 soft inside is ready now 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.370
 there we have our four left 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.530
 and we can serve them with 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.440
 jam with cream with 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.330
 fried potatoes with bananas so we 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.060
 put a little jam on one 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.060
 little cream a little jam 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.660
 there is no reason little spoon 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.459
 of fresh cream I can remove the 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.459
 others also a little bit I'm good 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:11.299
 icing sugar here with a little bit of 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:15.220
 ice cream is the gourmet paradise 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.220
 see again and good appetite of course
