Revere<00:00:31.939> I<00:00:32.390> did<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:33.050> ton<00:00:33.470> of<00:00:33.500> different<00:00:33.800> brand

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
Revere I did a ton of different brand

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.119 
Revere I did a ton of different brand
names<00:00:34.820> other<00:00:35.270> days<00:00:35.690> we<00:00:35.960> made<00:00:36.230> a<00:00:36.500> parole<00:00:36.980> or

names other days we made a parole or
time<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:37.940> I've<00:00:38.059> converted<00:00:38.420> these<00:00:38.690> into

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
time so I've converted these into

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.840 
time so I've converted these into
electric<00:00:39.559> drums<00:00:39.860> so<00:00:40.129> if<00:00:40.309> these<00:00:40.489> are<00:00:40.670> all

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
electric drums so if these are all

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.119 
electric drums so if these are all
actually<00:00:41.120> electric<00:00:41.809> mm-hmm<00:00:42.350> how<00:00:42.680> did<00:00:42.860> you<00:00:42.949> do

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
actually electric mm-hmm how did you do

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.770 
actually electric mm-hmm how did you do
it<00:00:43.309> um<00:00:44.530> it's<00:00:45.530> really<00:00:45.770> simple<00:00:46.010> actually<00:00:46.780> get

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
it um it's really simple actually get

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.410 
it um it's really simple actually get
mesh<00:00:48.050> heads<00:00:48.430> underneath<00:00:49.430> here<00:00:49.670> is<00:00:49.760> a<00:00:49.790> crossbar

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
mesh heads underneath here is a crossbar

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.260 
mesh heads underneath here is a crossbar
that<00:00:50.660> supports<00:00:51.110> a<00:00:51.290> trigger<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:51.920> then<00:00:52.670> drill<00:00:53.239> a

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
that supports a trigger and then drill a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.850 
that supports a trigger and then drill a
hole<00:00:53.390> in<00:00:53.750> there<00:00:53.899> with<00:00:54.110> a<00:00:54.140> quarter<00:00:54.649> inch<00:00:54.800> jack

connected<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.910> your<00:00:56.530> trigger<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.829> run<00:00:58.730> it<00:00:58.850> to

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
connected to your trigger and run it to

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.850 
connected to your trigger and run it to
the<00:00:59.470> control<00:01:00.470> module<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:03.290> trigger<00:01:03.590> right<00:01:03.770> in

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
the control module the trigger right in

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.290 
the control module the trigger right in
the<00:01:03.920> middle<00:01:04.070> it's<00:01:04.220> got<00:01:04.309> really<00:01:04.550> good<00:01:04.670> dynamic

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
the middle it's got really good dynamic

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.880 
the middle it's got really good dynamic
control<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:05.750> actually<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.380> drum<00:01:06.680> module

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
control and actually the the drum module

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.859 
control and actually the the drum module
itself<00:01:07.160> has<00:01:07.610> really<00:01:07.910> good<00:01:08.030> dynamic<00:01:08.600> control

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
itself has really good dynamic control

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.920 
itself has really good dynamic control
where's<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.500> drill<00:01:09.740> mode<00:01:10.180> it's<00:01:11.180> a<00:01:11.270> row<00:01:11.570> little

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
where's the drill mode it's a row little

where's the drill mode it's a row little
TD<00:01:12.530> 20<00:01:15.280> when<00:01:16.280> I<00:01:16.310> record<00:01:16.789> through<00:01:17.119> it<00:01:17.270> I<00:01:17.450> run<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
TD 20 when I record through it I run the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.380 
TD 20 when I record through it I run the
MIDI<00:01:18.380> out<00:01:18.649> into<00:01:19.039> my<00:01:19.130> computer<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.940> then<00:01:20.330> I

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
MIDI out into my computer and then I

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.649 
MIDI out into my computer and then I
resample<00:01:21.260> all<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.710> MIDI<00:01:22.010> signals<00:01:23.000> through<00:01:23.630> a

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
resample all the MIDI signals through a

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.910 
resample all the MIDI signals through a
drum<00:01:24.380> program<00:01:25.190> called<00:01:26.200> ezdrummer<00:01:27.200> made<00:01:27.740> by

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
drum program called ezdrummer made by

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.580 
drum program called ezdrummer made by
tuned<00:01:28.220> tracks<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:29.840> we'll<00:01:29.960> take<00:01:30.110> my<00:01:30.290> MIDI

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
tuned tracks so we'll take my MIDI

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.190 
tuned tracks so we'll take my MIDI
information<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:31.670> convert<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.479> through<00:01:33.020> a

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
information and convert it through a

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.440 
information and convert it through a
this<00:01:36.200> program<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:37.070> will<00:01:37.159> sample<00:01:37.520> acoustic

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
this program that will sample acoustic

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.090 
this program that will sample acoustic
drums<00:01:38.780> so<00:01:39.080> when<00:01:39.200> I'm<00:01:39.290> all<00:01:39.439> done<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.830> doesn't

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
drums so when I'm all done it doesn't

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.250 
drums so when I'm all done it doesn't
sound<00:01:40.220> like<00:01:40.369> an<00:01:40.610> electric<00:01:41.600> drum<00:01:41.840> set<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.170> will

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
sound like an electric drum set it will

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.719 
sound like an electric drum set it will
actually<00:01:42.350> sound<00:01:42.680> like<00:01:42.830> an<00:01:42.920> acoustically

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
actually sound like an acoustically

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.670 
actually sound like an acoustically
you're<00:01:43.850> taking<00:01:44.210> you're<00:01:44.510> doing<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:44.990> timing

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
you're taking you're doing the timing

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.140 
you're taking you're doing the timing
and<00:01:45.799> everything<00:01:45.860> playing<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:46.909> then<00:01:47.060> you

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
and everything playing it and then you

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.280 
and everything playing it and then you
put<00:01:47.330> it<00:01:47.390> in<00:01:47.570> there<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:47.780> you're<00:01:47.990> doing<00:01:48.080> the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
put it in there and you're doing the

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.740 
put it in there and you're doing the
model<00:01:48.710> drum<00:01:49.070> sounds<00:01:49.640> from<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.030> sounds<00:01:50.630> like

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
model drum sounds from that sounds like

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.870 
model drum sounds from that sounds like
an<00:01:50.869> acoustic<00:01:51.350> it's<00:01:51.710> pretty<00:01:52.100> convincing<00:01:52.700> at

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
an acoustic it's pretty convincing at

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.820 
an acoustic it's pretty convincing at
most<00:01:53.630> I<00:01:53.810> mean<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:54.020> lot<00:01:54.200> of<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.380> has<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.530> do<00:01:54.710> with

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
most I mean a lot of it has to do with

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.370 
most I mean a lot of it has to do with
the<00:01:54.920> data<00:01:55.130> sent<00:01:55.610> by<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:55.820> drum<00:01:56.180> module<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.140> here

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
the data sent by the drum module so here

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.140 
the data sent by the drum module so here
the<00:01:57.500> hi-hat<00:01:57.979> control<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.700> all<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.939> nuances

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
the hi-hat control and all the nuances

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.600 
the hi-hat control and all the nuances
of<00:01:59.680> how<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:01.700> drums<00:02:02.180> react<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.720> your<00:02:02.840> playing

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
of how the drums react to your playing

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.030 
of how the drums react to your playing
but<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.630> program<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.350> tune<00:02:06.710> track

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
but the the program the tune track

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.699 
but the the program the tune track
program<00:02:07.310> has<00:02:07.820> multi<00:02:08.420> sampled<00:02:08.929> layers<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
program has multi sampled layers so the

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.670 
program has multi sampled layers so the
harder<00:02:10.100> you<00:02:10.250> hit<00:02:10.489> here<00:02:11.170> triggers<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.200> different

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
harder you hit here triggers a different

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.400 
harder you hit here triggers a different
sample<00:02:12.980> on<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.549> computer<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:14.959> it's<00:02:15.079> not<00:02:15.170> just

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
sample on the computer so it's not just

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.319 
sample on the computer so it's not just
a<00:02:15.500> soft<00:02:15.799> hit<00:02:16.100> here<00:02:16.400> as<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.579> same<00:02:16.850> sound<00:02:17.150> as<00:02:17.269> a

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
a soft hit here as the same sound as a

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.900 
a soft hit here as the same sound as a
hard<00:02:17.660> hit<00:02:17.900> each<00:02:18.650> drum<00:02:19.220> son<00:02:19.549> will<00:02:19.730> have

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
hard hit each drum son will have

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.060 
hard hit each drum son will have
multiple<00:02:20.420> layers<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.870> samples<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.769> soft

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
multiple layers of samples so the soft

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.890 
multiple layers of samples so the soft
you<00:02:22.220> hit<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.549> you'll<00:02:22.820> trigger<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.209> softer<00:02:23.690> hit

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
you hit it you'll trigger a softer hit

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.420 
you hit it you'll trigger a softer hit
drum<00:02:24.200> sample<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.769> harder<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.130> hit<00:02:25.250> it

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
drum sample the harder you hit it

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.500 
drum sample the harder you hit it
triggers<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.060> hard<00:02:26.359> it<00:02:26.630> really<00:02:26.780> have<00:02:26.989> a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
triggers a hard it really have a

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.000 
triggers a hard it really have a
what's<00:02:27.659> the<00:02:27.810> range<00:02:28.019> I<00:02:28.200> mean<00:02:28.349> how<00:02:28.439> many<00:02:28.500> samples

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
what's the range I mean how many samples

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.250 
what's the range I mean how many samples
does<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.400> have<00:02:29.519> for<00:02:29.730> each<00:02:29.790> thing<00:02:30.090> like<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.599> I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
does it have for each thing like that I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.410 
does it have for each thing like that I
couldn't<00:02:31.709> no<00:02:32.040> more<00:02:32.549> than<00:02:32.640> probably<00:02:32.970> about<00:02:33.090> 12

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
couldn't no more than probably about 12

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.839 
couldn't no more than probably about 12
s<00:02:34.079> that's<00:02:34.470> pretty<00:02:34.739> good<00:02:34.980> actually<00:02:35.280> including

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
s that's pretty good actually including

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.390 
s that's pretty good actually including
rim<00:02:36.060> shots<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.750> edge<00:02:37.019> sock<00:02:37.590> shots<00:02:38.069> on<00:02:38.280> the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
rim shots and edge sock shots on the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.300 
rim shots and edge sock shots on the
symbols<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.540> ride<00:02:40.170> actually<00:02:40.650> has<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.860> bell

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
symbols the ride actually has the bell

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.270 
symbols the ride actually has the bell
the<00:02:41.670> bow<00:02:41.909> and<00:02:42.209> an<00:02:42.299> edge<00:02:42.480> shot<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.200> all<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.159> them

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
the bow and an edge shot and all of them

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.449 
the bow and an edge shot and all of them
you<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.549> choke<00:02:45.390> them<00:02:45.599> as<00:02:45.750> well<00:02:46.220> it's<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> pretty

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
you can choke them as well it's a pretty

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.050 
you can choke them as well it's a pretty
cool<00:02:47.730> thing<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:49.290> what<00:02:49.409> I<00:02:49.440> do<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:50.640> know<00:02:50.760> play

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
cool thing so what I do is you know play

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.119 
cool thing so what I do is you know play
the<00:02:51.239> drums<00:02:51.569> send<00:02:52.500> everything<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:53.040> the

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
the drums send everything to the

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.520 
the drums send everything to the
computer<00:02:53.609> and<00:02:53.640> MIDI<00:02:54.000> then<00:02:54.720> open<00:02:55.109> it<00:02:55.140> up<00:02:55.319> you

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
computer and MIDI then open it up you

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.949 
computer and MIDI then open it up you
know<00:02:56.220> recording<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.819> as<00:02:56.909> a<00:02:56.939> midi<00:02:57.239> file<00:02:57.569> here

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
know recording it as a midi file here

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.770 
know recording it as a midi file here
then<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.739> plays<00:02:59.010> back<00:02:59.400> through<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.239> sampling

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
then it plays back through the sampling

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.309 
then it plays back through the sampling
software<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.739> it's<00:03:02.640> pretty<00:03:03.209> cool<00:03:03.569> here's

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
software and it's pretty cool here's

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.289 
software and it's pretty cool here's
this<00:03:04.500> kind<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.829> dental<00:03:05.190> it's<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.609> scratch

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
working on where you know it allows me

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.610 
working on where you know it allows me
to<00:03:10.530> play<00:03:10.650> all<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.889> instruments<00:03:10.920> myself<00:03:12.049> I<00:03:13.049> did

to play all the instruments myself I did
scratch<00:03:13.950> takes<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.489> guitar<00:03:14.819> scratch

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
scratch takes of the guitar scratch

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.270 
scratch takes of the guitar scratch
takes<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:16.170> base<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.829> then<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:16.980> could<00:03:17.069> go

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
takes of the base and then I could go

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.309 
takes of the base and then I could go
back<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.549> listen<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.329> headphones<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.109> play

oh yeah it sounds pretty convincing

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.840 
oh yeah it sounds pretty convincing
because<00:04:05.050> it's<00:04:05.290> also<00:04:05.470> got<00:04:05.770> not<00:04:06.130> just<00:04:06.550> the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
because it's also got not just the

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.150 
because it's also got not just the
individual<00:04:07.510> drum<00:04:07.840> mics<00:04:08.080> it's<00:04:08.320> got<00:04:08.470> room<00:04:08.830> mics

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
individual drum mics it's got room mics

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.240

you<00:04:09.610> know<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.940> bottom<00:04:10.330> of<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.480> snare<00:04:11.250> you

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
you know the bottom of the snare you

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.900 
you know the bottom of the snare you
could<00:04:12.400> have<00:04:12.610> I<00:04:13.180> believe<00:04:13.720> this<00:04:14.610> let<00:04:15.610> me<00:04:15.700> up<00:04:15.790> for

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
could have I believe this let me up for

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.390 
could have I believe this let me up for
this<00:04:15.970> up<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:19.180> know<00:04:19.299> it's<00:04:19.570> got<00:04:19.840> like<00:04:20.080> that<00:04:20.400> the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
this up you know it's got like that the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.250 
this up you know it's got like that the
sizzle<00:04:21.880> of<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.090> snare<00:04:22.390> even<00:04:22.840> when<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.050> hit

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
sizzle of the snare even when you hit

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.410 
sizzle of the snare even when you hit
like<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.500> rack<00:04:23.950> tom<00:04:24.250> it'll<00:04:24.640> still<00:04:24.850> vibrate<00:04:25.300> the

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
like a rack tom it'll still vibrate the

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.820 
like a rack tom it'll still vibrate the
snares<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:25.870> little<00:04:26.080> bit<00:04:26.230> it's<00:04:26.350> really<00:04:26.620> cool

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
snares a little bit it's really cool

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.290 
snares a little bit it's really cool
that<00:04:26.890> way<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:27.340> it's<00:04:27.670> got<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.270> really<00:04:28.510> you<00:04:29.200> know

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
that way so it's got a really you know

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.330 
that way so it's got a really you know
authentic<00:04:31.300> kind<00:04:31.480> of<00:04:31.570> feel<00:04:31.810> for<00:04:31.840> being<00:04:32.350> done<00:04:33.190> in

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
authentic kind of feel for being done in

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.570 
authentic kind of feel for being done in
MIDI<00:04:33.810> yeah<00:04:34.810> it's<00:04:35.170> a<00:04:35.230> cool<00:04:35.260> sampling<00:04:35.920> program<00:04:36.340> I

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
MIDI yeah it's a cool sampling program I

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.610 
MIDI yeah it's a cool sampling program I
think<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.630> idea<00:04:37.750> like<00:04:38.080> for<00:04:38.260> fish<00:04:38.410> especially

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
think the idea like for fish especially

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.290 
think the idea like for fish especially
people<00:04:38.950> in<00:04:38.980> this<00:04:39.070> city<00:04:39.280> having<00:04:39.550> like<00:04:39.790> instead

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
people in this city having like instead

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
people in this city having like instead
of<00:04:40.360> getting<00:04:40.600> loose<00:04:40.720> like<00:04:40.930> like<00:04:41.520> off<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.580> rack

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
of getting loose like like off the rack

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.080 
of getting loose like like off the rack
like<00:04:44.320> drum<00:04:44.680> kit<00:04:44.919> like<00:04:45.190> electronic<00:04:45.790> drum<00:04:45.940> kit

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
like drum kit like electronic drum kit

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.270 
like drum kit like electronic drum kit
and<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.450> have<00:04:46.690> one<00:04:46.930> of<00:04:47.050> those<00:04:47.140> too<00:04:47.200> it's<00:04:48.040> in<00:04:48.250> a

and I have one of those too it's in a
box<00:04:48.550> I<00:04:48.910> never<00:04:49.210> even<00:04:49.390> use<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:49.720> this<00:04:50.020> just<00:04:50.290> feels

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
box I never even use it this just feels
