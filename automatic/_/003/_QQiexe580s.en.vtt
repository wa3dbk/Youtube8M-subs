00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hey and welcome here too 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.879
 a new mob show i'm off 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.649
 the holiday back and today has one 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.030
 new motto I therefore exist now 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.290
 namely quite cool because wanted 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.969
 I still have to introduce even if 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.410
 about everyone has presented and indeed 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.940
 Will this be if you have a shop and 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.240
 look at what the whole thing costs 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.050
 cost in the 768 890,000 euro so no 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.180
 bargain 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.090
 the image I do not think so at murder 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.650
 nicely done here that the murder of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.399
 itself much nicer than this picture 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.210
 but ok i have no problem with that 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.219
 probably just wanted everything or 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.170
 thing to come with have come next 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.270
 the others cost the maintenance costs 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.500
 are not at 349 euros per day the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.320
 required power of 200 ps 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.710
 Capacities are not ten capacity 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.649
 is 10,000 liters and the fruit 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.420
 Of course, wood is the beast 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.620
 high performance wood chipper the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.770
 extraklasse 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.180
 So a really nice device six 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.530
 meter stood class 1 until now one 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.090
 eight meters or seven meters do not know 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.850
 I just change my name 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.100
 sliced ​​changed to train rehabilitated 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.049
 here is something to catch and the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.900
 chance to all times so it is currently 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.140
 so I can drive away 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.580
 wherever I want 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.850
 and that's actually pretty cool 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.680
 all things work as well 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.680
 Example I have to turn backwards 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.310
 now they do not work anymore why 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.200
 she does not suddenly anymore 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.700
 want 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 So again the lights are working 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.060
 turn on the front but still more than goes 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:43.330
 my keyboard can also be funny again 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:48.310
 lie blinker ag are on 123 left 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.869
 So, though, they work a lot 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.240
 I have no other functions in the 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.000
 coupled condition that's me but 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.700
 let's say come from now wonders 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.720
 of course it makes sense 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.009
 I can not wien at all 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.990
 but that was very funny, too 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.170
 only found out after three minutes 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.890
 or so small mini box can sit 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.700
 me up close with 0 you open 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.630
 as you can so diesel aggregate states 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.350
 The support feet unfold as I am there 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.459
 now in the beautiful extend 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.239
 here too is one below 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.440
 surfing and everything safe i would 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.549
 The cars now want to hang again 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.530
 could i have these all i have these 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.840
 not working then i can only use the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.430
 then open the next flap 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.380
 turn on but not yet driven 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.930
 First, the tube from up there 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.910
 it works out then it is nice too 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.480
 I have high here as a micro 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.590
 at the moment it does not matter 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.620
 labor judge there are again noted 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.620
 10,000 functions how can you choose 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.760
 the middle right of employment and 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.230
 the left work light we are doing now 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.019
 Just turn on that left work light 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.489
 here on the left is how he realizes and now 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.840
 come the interesting option that is 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.580
 up there this small lights which 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.720
 it now looks as is interesting 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.660
 things and you can do this 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.110
 work lights up the markets ag 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.220
 shifts and gets down again 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.569
 we also want to have it turned 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.130
 with k 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.270
 and you can see the cone 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.610
 shifts cool 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.890
 that's pretty cool for me personally 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.030
 if I'm honest 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.980
 im action i even got pretty far 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.840
 forward I can almost believe it 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.220
 Turn right at the front now but do not care 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.680
 and then yes, the other list 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.430
 select to the next house middle 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.750
 Turn on your family vr has noticed 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:43.640
 really licked properly licked 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.860
 It also takes all the time now 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.209
 pretty much if this looks there 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.440
 man's I do not feel like that at all 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.870
 you can see that small right now 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.300
 of course I can move differently 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.950
 and if you realize it is still there 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.780
 that will be on her next days 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.420
 team presented dallas you can you advise 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.980
 what that will mean yes and now 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.480
 comes choose the right one but we 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.480
 This was out of order with that 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.150
 not so wrong 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:13.500
 it's just the mod in action 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.049
 rhine with the wood, so to speak 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.040
 So that's what we're about 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.320
 Let's say I would say so you 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.070
 nothing happens because of that 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.120
 turned 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:32.490
 i know hexel apparently noticed and 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.190
 it is in the front of the tank inside like 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.630
 as you know 10,000 then come 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.380
 Of course, just relax and 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.380
 depend 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:50.620
 and below it is not standing 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:58.090
 under now thinks of me still 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:05:00.550
 underneath and then you can see me 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.680
 Cover everything and do whatever I want 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.029
 so that's cool is you can this 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.889
 really go everywhere 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:07.509
 it is very performance-telling she has to 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.479
 I say the pc here is actually 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.999
 he shit because he was 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.789
 not so hot and such things 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:18.639
 stop me what ever me 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.990
 a little bit irritated is that there what 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.169
 somehow it always stays behind 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.449
 I do not know why that irritates me 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.500
 always a bit bitchy 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.279
 this place is also a bit 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.770
 closer now tested exactly 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:35.759
 So this murder creeps from more 4 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.199
 a million stars 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:40.560
 it was exaggerated now but he gets it 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.729
 of course full stars number because what 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.370
 should you make it even hotter is yes 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.159
 everything works well so everything 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.120
 perfect works even without you 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.560
 shall you have these beautiful ones here 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.889
 switching box just as easy to fold 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.150
 can and it is so cool there can be 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.210
 otherwise say completely switch off and then 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.800
 easy to fold and then it stands there and 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.389
 wait until his next assignment 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.879
 of course an unrealistic light 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.219
 remains switched that would have to be natural 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:07.899
 go out but that is acceptable blessing 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:09.580
 full score for this market I am 

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:10.509
 a bit from the concept out of 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.979
 always ask it will be on 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.210
 a few days later 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.319
 be regulated because the next week 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.930
 probably mainly murder 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:21.460
 Imagination come because I prepare 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:23.110
 I have to say see you tomorrow 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.729
 again in the new video by then the 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.080
 I'm coming late now 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.680
 not work now until then 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.680
 whiz
