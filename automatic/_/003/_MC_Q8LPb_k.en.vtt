Charles<00:05:16.300> Wang<00:05:16.510> usually<00:05:17.380> a<00:05:17.410> bang<00:05:17.770> on<00:05:17.949> the<00:05:18.039> owner

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190

when this stuff happens he didn't do

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.980 
when this stuff happens he didn't do
this<00:05:20.139> in<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.349> dead<00:05:20.530> of<00:05:20.560> night<00:05:20.680> he<00:05:21.190> begged<00:05:21.639> um
