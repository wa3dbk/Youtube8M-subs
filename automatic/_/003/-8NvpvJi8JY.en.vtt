00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.770 
play and and work on it in that way and
so<00:02:27.780> we've<00:02:28.340> picked<00:02:29.340> up<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.760> text<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.420> tried<00:02:30.630> to

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
so we've picked up the text and tried to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.900 
so we've picked up the text and tried to
understand<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.500> from<00:02:31.739> moment<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.190> moment<00:02:32.280> and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
understand it from moment to moment and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.300 
understand it from moment to moment and
that's<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> way<00:02:33.330> we've<00:02:33.600> tackled<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.440> I

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
that's the way we've tackled it and I

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.259 
that's the way we've tackled it and I
think<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:36.080> we've<00:02:37.080> resisted<00:02:37.799> doing<00:02:38.670> an

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
think and we've resisted doing an

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.650 
think and we've resisted doing an
interpretation<00:02:40.110> we've<00:02:40.680> resisted

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
interpretation we've resisted

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.120 
interpretation we've resisted
modernizing<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.110> sense<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.680> putting

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
modernizing it in the sense of putting

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.550 
modernizing it in the sense of putting
them<00:02:44.459> in<00:02:44.580> leather<00:02:45.000> jackets<00:02:45.480> with<00:02:45.660> studs<00:02:45.989> on<00:02:46.290> or

them in leather jackets with studs on or

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.920 
them in leather jackets with studs on or
any<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:46.980> kind<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.430> thing<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.780> fact

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
any of that kind of thing and in fact

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.570 
any of that kind of thing and in fact
the<00:02:49.080> more<00:02:49.260> we<00:02:49.440> got<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.769> know<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.099> piece<00:02:50.310> the

I<00:03:15.769> mean<00:03:16.769> there's<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.100> kind<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.400> there<00:03:17.579> was

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
I mean there's that kind of there was

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.759 
I mean there's that kind of there was
that<00:03:17.910> kind<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.150> snobbery<00:03:18.390> there<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.989> think

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
that kind of snobbery there I think

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.229 
that kind of snobbery there I think
maybe<00:03:19.890> sometimes<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.519> does<00:03:20.670> nothing<00:03:21.060> there

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
maybe sometimes it does nothing there

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.699 
maybe sometimes it does nothing there
still<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.810> got<00:03:21.959> old<00:03:22.109> kernels<00:03:22.560> with

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
still is it got old kernels with

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.170 
still is it got old kernels with
monocles<00:03:23.069> looking<00:03:23.340> around<00:03:23.400> or<00:03:23.700> Mohican<00:03:24.060> to

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
monocles looking around or Mohican to

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.640 
monocles looking around or Mohican to
see<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.450> stage<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.870> think<00:03:25.049> that's<00:03:25.230> exactly

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
see the stage I think that's exactly

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.670 
see the stage I think that's exactly
