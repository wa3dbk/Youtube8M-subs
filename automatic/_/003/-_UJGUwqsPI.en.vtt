 "Sabov is not because I understand only half" 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.340
 "from what he says" 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.840
 Not everyone who makes a video is perfect with English :) 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.380
 "But something tells me that you will understand everything ..." 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.140
 Destroyed 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.640
 Wait a minute 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.140
 This is me destroyed 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.560

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.500
 They call it a skill, right? 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.480

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.620
 I destroyed my Sylvanas 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.500
 NOT! 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.000
 I fucking destroyed her 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.260
 Are you fucking kidding me? 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.560
 "I have no idea what they are talking about" 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040
 "This is how I see it." 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.860
 Well, I do not know, I do not think it is ... 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.520
 What are you with? Right now, I'll go and everything will be 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.260

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.840
 Did you see how it went? 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.940
 So, we put the master of reservation 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.480
 Because it is still early for the dark priestess 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.720
 So let's play this card. 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.300

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.200
 It's weird 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.880
 Just do not pull something crappy 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.800
 Oh my God 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.940

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.000
 using a whirlwind 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.000
 You know? 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.420
 Me and so come down 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.620
 This is a very interesting table. 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.220

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.780

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.900

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.120
 What the fuck? 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.540
 Ok, he probably didn't have time ...
