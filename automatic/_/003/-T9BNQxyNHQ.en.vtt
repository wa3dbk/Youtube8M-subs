each other out and it's just it's quite
fun<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> guess<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> couple<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.170> minutes

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
fun I guess with a couple of minutes

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.110 
fun I guess with a couple of minutes
because<00:00:49.559> dancing<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.550> never<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.090> of

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
because dancing was never really one of

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.610 
because dancing was never really one of
the<00:00:51.239> things<00:00:51.480> i<00:00:51.690> would<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.930> personally<00:00:52.379> said

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the things i would have personally said

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.189 
the things i would have personally said
was<00:00:53.129> going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.579> set<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.780> challenges

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
was going to be set for the challenges

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.689 
was going to be set for the challenges
so<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> lot<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.680> fun<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.100> obviously

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so it's a lot of fun and obviously

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
so it's a lot of fun and obviously
really<00:00:56.940> different<00:00:57.329> when<00:00:57.420> i<00:00:57.449> read<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.780> wasn't

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
really different when i read it wasn't

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.319 
really different when i read it wasn't
obvious<00:00:58.559> expecting<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.250> at<00:00:59.609> first<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.149> did

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
obvious expecting that at first I did

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.639 
obvious expecting that at first I did
have<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> couple<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.809> difficulties<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.620> I

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.170 
starts to take ups like 45 minutes think
something<00:03:48.010> like<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.640> that's<00:03:48.880> insane

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
something like that and that's insane

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.580 
something like that and that's insane
amount<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.720> time<00:03:49.900> just<00:03:50.140> took<00:03:50.320> for<00:03:50.530> a

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
amount of time just took for a

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.590 
amount of time just took for a
commentary<00:03:50.950> or<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.190> topic<00:03:51.520> over<00:03:51.790> so<00:03:52.210> doing<00:03:52.510> it

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
commentary or a topic over so doing it

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.090 
commentary or a topic over so doing it
live<00:03:52.750> with<00:03:52.930> facecam<00:03:53.110> will<00:03:53.560> hopefully<00:03:53.770> be<00:03:54.070> a

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
live with facecam will hopefully be a

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.680 
live with facecam will hopefully be a
lot<00:03:54.220> more<00:03:54.250> interesting<00:03:54.580> enemies<00:03:55.420> i<00:03:55.510> can

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
lot more interesting enemies i can

if<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.340> get<00:04:31.490> enough<00:04:31.669> recorded<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.270> if<00:04:32.660> they<00:04:32.780> are

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
if I get enough recorded and if they are

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.570 
if I get enough recorded and if they are
decent<00:04:33.139> enough<00:04:33.440> i<00:04:33.710> also<00:04:34.100> have<00:04:34.220> a<00:04:34.280> new<00:04:34.400> webcam

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
decent enough i also have a new webcam

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.249 
decent enough i also have a new webcam
coming<00:04:35.030> tomorrow<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.570> quality<00:04:35.750> should<00:04:36.139> be

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
coming tomorrow so the quality should be

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.140 
coming tomorrow so the quality should be
slightly<00:04:36.770> sharper<00:04:37.310> as<00:04:37.490> it<00:04:37.669> is<00:04:37.759> an<00:04:37.820> upgrade

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
slightly sharper as it is an upgrade

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.840 
slightly sharper as it is an upgrade
from<00:04:38.240> 720p<00:04:38.960> to<00:04:39.199> 1080p<00:04:39.229> so<00:04:40.009> those<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:40.729> don't

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
from 720p to 1080p so those you don't

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:41.800 
from 720p to 1080p so those you don't
know<00:04:40.940> what<00:04:41.030> it<00:04:41.090> is<00:04:41.150> it's<00:04:41.389> just<00:04:41.419> a<00:04:41.600> slightly

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
know what it is it's just a slightly

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.200 
know what it is it's just a slightly
higher<00:04:41.930> full<00:04:42.620> HD<00:04:43.009> quality<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.460> webcams

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
higher full HD quality and webcams

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.029 
higher full HD quality and webcams
hopeful<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:44.660> should<00:04:44.810> be<00:04:44.900> pretty<00:04:45.530> good<00:04:45.800> and

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
hopeful that should be pretty good and

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.010 
hopeful that should be pretty good and
obviously<00:04:46.699> recall<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.120> lot<00:04:47.300> nicer<00:04:47.449> lighting

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
obviously recall a lot nicer lighting

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.540 
obviously recall a lot nicer lighting
and<00:04:48.139> stuff<00:04:48.229> like<00:04:48.350> that<00:04:48.410> again<00:04:49.070> if<00:04:49.280> you<00:04:49.400> guys

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
and stuff like that again if you guys

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.920 
and stuff like that again if you guys
hopefully<00:04:49.850> will<00:04:50.150> give<00:04:50.240> them<00:04:50.389> a<00:04:50.449> try<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:50.810> watch

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930
