00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.319
 alright personal articles was one that 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.300
 We're starting for you one more. 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.639
 video creation our complete set of 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.009
 a very nerdy program with staff 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.360
 I selected the green pages here 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.430
 the faces you want to think 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.800
 If you see this option you will 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.670
 first order and separate the materials 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.740
 here ok 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.269
 so you can edit or separately 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.420
 I'm doing this because if we 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.090
 creating some images here in these 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.740
 faces of the game would be possible since 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.190
 in another material because when you 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.690
 add with gsr stay a little more 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.210
 complicated you give in case adding 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.559
 colors to these materials is ok the people 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.600
 will be working a little bit not 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.280
 I wanted to cite clear physics that we will not go 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.760
 do in physics of the ball still in this 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.489
 and the physics of the network is going 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.480
 holding the ball can stay 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.969
 Calm down, people are going to work. 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.530
 according to weather beauty 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.440
 it happens that in this first video here 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.300
 are expected in the one in case lamp the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.949
 scenery we are seeing better 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.110
 I recommend you to produce the blender 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.299
 beauty is because it is much better people 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.189
 to work with a program entirely in the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.560
 our language 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.960
 This is my personal style and it will end. 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.700
 a point but have as you choose the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.990
 type of lamp that illuminates the entire 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.759
 The game's setting is what we are 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.560
 doing at the moment I have several 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.750
 styles as you can see here 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.509
 but this one is the most appropriate because 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.189
 because it illuminates the whole scene is just 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.390
 decrease the intensity to become so 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.490
 not bad like that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.909
 you are visualizing you can 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.140
 check the ball she's falling on 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.270
 infinitely 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.549
 This is because we added 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.960
 and the rigid body type property at 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.390
 this ball is why it is 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.060
 Happening, but rest assured that 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.579
 we will also work in the case of 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 dripping physics ok I think one of the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.270
 things that people will want and more 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.979
 to know even the people who are watching 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.390
 The video talking wrong, I'm sorry. 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.409
 For my Portuguese, right? 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.990
 It so happens that we are human beings. 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.869
 we all make mistakes then also seek 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.670
 new material here will be basically the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.219
 network of the game let's keep running 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.229
 he moved from under the ball we did 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.599
 some tests really is a little 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.470
 complicated the business of simulating 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.110
 been 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.860
 Dona Kisses, she's doing it in render 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.100
 render mode 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.890
 it's a lot easier but in br it's a bit 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.450
 more complicated because max because so 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.120
 When are you going to change something? 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.430
 He does not stay with you, and he wants to be. 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.440
 because you do not have support for this yet 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.150
 so much for video I also do not know if the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.730
 baby is accepting to save a 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.650
 game with intro videos to people already 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.060
 know how to add the videos program 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.250
 to run for a while we'll go 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.440
 save the game point ash one of the points 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.600
 differential is that simply the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.220
 game was not the hotel stays gray is good 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.190
 is moving it then the staff is already 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.440
 no image after supper and the network 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.330
 obviously and more transparent, I do not think 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.680
 that you have already captured, but it is 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.260
 Like this, beginners in the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.090
 Big does not know if he had an image here. 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.190
 basically the network only has to be 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.310
 transparent in the best view 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.650
 following personnel shift physics will 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.990
 leave then you can switch to is 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.690
 confirm if the rigid body okay 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.340
 Anyway, one of these two is going to be there. 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.650
 fundamentally, people are going to work 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.630
 almost in this regard even when it became 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.940
 create ball physics someone has to be 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.340
 none of these two even having the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.870
 materials did not work very well let's go 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.400
 then just position that team 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.370
 is creating the network 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.959
 in case of this field here now it is not there 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.970
 staying or not is to be decreasing or 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.709
 then increasing this network 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.930
 he only position now if they are 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.540
 enjoying subscribing to the channel click no 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.480
 I liked to help out a lot 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.420
 interesting to know that she is 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.220
 accompanying you in editing mode for us 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.250
 we are basically altering some 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.890
 things here to rectify very good not 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.570
 it can be a very bad network 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.090
 I think this part here that she went 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.459
 criticized we will edit it is also 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.430
 because it 's very straight 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.410
 then in the hottest region a ripple 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.450
 so I'm connected by doing this more 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.790
 go ahead and fix these little ones. 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.070
 details the key and will be this illusion 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.570
 then enter edit mode and now 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.910
 furniture for corner 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.709
 you can view is very simple already 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.840
 is making these these little ones 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.400
 details here I know there is a lot of challenge 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.709
 but the next steps we will be 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.209
 correcting this beauty 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.040
 Good, I'll just hang around then, I'll just wait. 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.280
 that you have 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.030
 let's still think about these other faces 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.010
 right here 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.450
 we are positioning and making our 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.940
 part here is simply from our network 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:37.280
 again just saying that the texture folder 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.250
 It will come more forward also physical 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.650
 of the fabric further on will be 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.630
 adding there is the way to lock the 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.120
 game will do something to give 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.340
 Sure that happens in the game. 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.930
 I like this idea, we stay in the channel 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.040
 click I did not like you, you 're 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.300
 helping to promote this video I know 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.430
 that may seem a bit annoying to us 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.310
 You're asking for this but just go to our 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.720
 website is informing you that if you 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.780
 doing this is helping people 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.160
 much is positioning such thinking r 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.310
 of the items you are 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.800
 doing now r rotates you 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.120
 to move around is under that little 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.700
 will be heard with who has you 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.010
 want to be in edit mode a way 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.010
 the object is time you and I was
