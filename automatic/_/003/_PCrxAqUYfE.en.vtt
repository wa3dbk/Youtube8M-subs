00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
started from looking at the body itself

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.450 
started from looking at the body itself
externally<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.990> looking<00:01:37.829> how<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.310> help

the body and his structure improve and
then<00:01:41.189> from<00:01:41.400> there<00:01:41.579> everything<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.000> led<00:01:42.270> me

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
then from there everything just led me

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.270 
then from there everything just led me
to<00:01:42.570> looking<00:01:43.110> at<00:01:43.229> energy<00:01:43.770> how<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.040> body

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
to looking at energy how the body

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.170 
to looking at energy how the body
utilized

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
utilized

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.030 
utilized
from<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.690> nutritional<00:01:46.170> point<00:01:46.230> of<00:01:46.530> view<00:01:46.680> from<00:01:46.860> an

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
from a nutritional point of view from an

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.830 
from a nutritional point of view from an
energetic<00:01:47.400> point<00:01:47.760> of<00:01:47.850> view<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:48.690> of

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
energetic point of view and then of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.290 
energetic point of view and then of
course<00:01:48.960> led<00:01:49.590> me<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.980> mind<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.730> how<00:01:51.120> that

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
course led me to the mind and how that

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.110 
course led me to the mind and how that
mind-body<00:01:51.980> combination<00:01:52.980> comes<00:01:53.640> together

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
mind-body combination comes together

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.450

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
that we think about 60,000 thoughts a

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.420 
that we think about 60,000 thoughts a
day<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.989> they're<00:02:31.110> random<00:02:31.530> thoughts<00:02:31.830> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
day and they're random thoughts and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.910 
day and they're random thoughts and
usually<00:02:33.150> they<00:02:33.300> were<00:02:33.360> surrounding<00:02:34.080> negative

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
usually they were surrounding negative

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.460 
usually they were surrounding negative
thoughts<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.550> know<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.660> we<00:02:36.900> spend<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> lot<00:02:37.290> of

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
thoughts you know and we spend a lot of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.590 
thoughts you know and we spend a lot of
time<00:02:37.709> just<00:02:37.950> focusing<00:02:38.370> on<00:02:38.459> what's<00:02:38.850> wrong<00:02:39.270> and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
time just focusing on what's wrong and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.229 
time just focusing on what's wrong and
and<00:02:39.980> what's<00:02:40.980> gonna<00:02:41.130> go<00:02:41.370> right<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.640> think<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.150> a

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
and what's gonna go right I think it's a

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.270 
and what's gonna go right I think it's a
survival<00:02:42.750> mechanism<00:02:42.780> actually<00:02:43.500> from<00:02:44.010> back<00:02:44.250> in

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
survival mechanism actually from back in

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.070 
survival mechanism actually from back in
the<00:02:44.459> day<00:02:44.730> from<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.630> know<00:02:45.750> we're<00:02:45.900> talking

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
the day from you know we're talking

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.560 
the day from you know we're talking
about<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.709> know<00:02:47.430> from<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.910> caveman<00:02:48.360> days

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
about you know from the caveman days

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.350 
about you know from the caveman days
when<00:02:48.900> we<00:02:49.709> were<00:02:49.860> geared<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.610> look<00:02:50.790> at<00:02:51.000> what's

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
when we were geared to look at what's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.090 
when we were geared to look at what's
wrong<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.930> don't<00:02:52.140> want<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.709> see<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.860> dinosaur

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
wrong you don't want to see a dinosaur

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.130 
wrong you don't want to see a dinosaur
come<00:02:53.549> in<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.760> think<00:02:53.910> everything's<00:02:54.299> okay<00:02:54.720> and

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
come in and think everything's okay and

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.890 
come in and think everything's okay and
so<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:55.799> think<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.340> built<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:57.030> we<00:02:57.540> kind<00:02:57.780> of

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
so I think it's built on that we kind of

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.550 
so I think it's built on that we kind of
took<00:02:58.470> back<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.769> piece<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.459> from<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:01.380> our

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
took back a piece of that from to our

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.710 
took back a piece of that from to our
lifestyle<00:03:02.190> today<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:03.120> know<00:03:03.209> moving<00:03:03.510> for

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
lifestyle today you know moving for

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.780 
lifestyle today you know moving for
there's<00:03:03.900> no<00:03:03.989> more<00:03:04.200> dinosaurs<00:03:04.400> but<00:03:05.400> now<00:03:05.580> we're

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
there's no more dinosaurs but now we're

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.120 
there's no more dinosaurs but now we're
constantly<00:03:06.120> worrying<00:03:06.690> about<00:03:06.890> what's<00:03:07.890> wrong

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
constantly worrying about what's wrong

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.100 
constantly worrying about what's wrong
and<00:03:08.549> that's<00:03:08.760> it's<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.209> built<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.510> mechanism<00:03:09.989> but

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
and that's it's a built in mechanism but

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.630 
and that's it's a built in mechanism but
now<00:03:10.260> we<00:03:10.320> got<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.560> learn<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.709> control<00:03:11.010> it

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
now we got to learn to control it

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.420 
now we got to learn to control it
so<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.030> find<00:03:12.299> meditation<00:03:12.739> enables<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.890> zero

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
so I find meditation enables you to zero

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.640 
so I find meditation enables you to zero
down<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.120> narrow<00:03:15.480> down<00:03:15.690> those<00:03:15.989> thoughts<00:03:16.320> to

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
down and narrow down those thoughts to

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.949 
down and narrow down those thoughts to
what<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.519> want<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.820> focus<00:03:18.000> on<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.660> become

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
what you want to focus on and you become

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.449 
what you want to focus on and you become
I<00:03:19.080> like<00:03:19.230> been<00:03:19.470> was<00:03:19.620> saying<00:03:19.890> what<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.040> was<00:03:20.220> saying

that<00:05:44.150> I've<00:05:44.330> learned<00:05:44.659> is<00:05:44.900> that<00:05:45.139> the<00:05:45.289> brain<00:05:45.500> can

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
that I've learned is that the brain can

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.170 
that I've learned is that the brain can
only<00:05:45.830> hold<00:05:46.099> one<00:05:46.250> conscious<00:05:46.789> thought<00:05:46.970> at<00:05:47.090> the

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
only hold one conscious thought at the

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.670 
only hold one conscious thought at the
time<00:05:47.330> so<00:05:47.870> if<00:05:47.930> you<00:05:48.020> think<00:05:48.199> about<00:05:48.380> that<00:05:48.530> if

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
time so if you think about that if

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.080 
time so if you think about that if
someone<00:05:48.979> else<00:05:49.130> is<00:05:49.340> putting<00:05:49.550> that<00:05:49.729> conscious

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
someone else is putting that conscious

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.189 
someone else is putting that conscious
thought<00:05:50.270> into<00:05:50.449> your<00:05:50.509> mind<00:05:50.750> you<00:05:50.930> have<00:05:51.080> no

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
thought into your mind you have no

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.480 
thought into your mind you have no
control<00:05:51.500> over<00:05:51.530> that<00:05:51.800> so<00:05:51.919> how<00:05:52.039> you<00:05:52.099> supposed<00:05:52.460> to

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
control over that so how you supposed to

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.890 
control over that so how you supposed to
direct<00:05:52.880> that<00:05:53.030> thought<00:05:53.270> toward<00:05:53.570> your<00:05:53.720> goal

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
direct that thought toward your goal

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.749 
direct that thought toward your goal

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
always got a lot of brains that

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.779 
always got a lot of brains that
developed<00:06:14.229> so<00:06:14.409> by<00:06:15.039> meditating<00:06:15.550> you<00:06:15.580> turn

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
developed so by meditating you turn

developed so by meditating you turn
everything<00:06:15.999> off<00:06:16.180> and<00:06:16.930> you<00:06:17.050> allow<00:06:17.229> your<00:06:17.439> brain

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
everything off and you allow your brain

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.170 
everything off and you allow your brain
to<00:06:17.860> focus<00:06:18.279> on<00:06:18.430> that<00:06:18.520> one<00:06:18.699> conscious<00:06:19.029> thought

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
to focus on that one conscious thought

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.179 
to focus on that one conscious thought
that<00:06:19.300> you<00:06:19.509> choose<00:06:19.810> which<00:06:20.620> it<00:06:20.740> may<00:06:20.860> it<00:06:20.979> was<00:06:21.039> just

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:21.189 
that you choose which it may it was just

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:22.679

amazing to me in the way that I meditate

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:23.909 
amazing to me in the way that I meditate
is<00:06:22.779> really<00:06:22.990> simple<00:06:23.259> something<00:06:23.560> Alban<00:06:23.800> taught

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
is really simple something Alban taught

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.439 
is really simple something Alban taught
me<00:06:24.039> was<00:06:24.189> just<00:06:24.279> count<00:06:24.550> backwards<00:06:24.909> from<00:06:24.969> ten

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
me was just count backwards from ten

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:32.480 
me was just count backwards from ten
it<00:06:25.810> goes<00:06:25.930> 10<00:06:26.259> 10<00:06:27.069> 10<00:06:27.819> 10<00:06:28.090> wow<00:06:28.810> I<00:06:28.840> actually<00:06:29.169> also

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.040 

and<00:06:33.490> all<00:06:33.699> the<00:06:33.789> way<00:06:33.849> when<00:06:34.150> you<00:06:34.210> get<00:06:34.330> to<00:06:34.449> zero<00:06:34.479> all

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
and all the way when you get to zero all

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.269 
and all the way when you get to zero all
the<00:06:35.110> thoughts<00:06:35.500> are<00:06:35.650> completely<00:06:35.979> out<00:06:36.069> of<00:06:36.099> my

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:36.279 
the thoughts are completely out of my

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:37.980 
the thoughts are completely out of my
brain<00:06:36.490> and<00:06:36.939> then<00:06:37.210> by<00:06:37.300> that<00:06:37.419> point<00:06:37.629> I<00:06:37.779> try<00:06:37.930> to

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
brain and then by that point I try to
