before it was just snagging and tearing
the<00:01:04.320> cardboard<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.010> went<00:01:05.519> ahead<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.700> put<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.000> on

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the cardboard I went ahead and put it on

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.179 
the cardboard I went ahead and put it on
a<00:01:06.210> clamp<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.689> sharpened<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.229> after<00:01:07.890> about<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
a clamp and sharpened it after about the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.410 
a clamp and sharpened it after about the
ten<00:01:08.369> minutes<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:08.850> talking<00:01:09.180> about

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
make 315 24 inch cuts through cardboard

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.899 
make 315 24 inch cuts through cardboard
like<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.670> before

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
like this before

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.730 
like this before
before<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> ever<00:01:18.630> felt<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.409> time<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
before I ever felt like it was time to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.859 
before I ever felt like it was time to
sharpen<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.159> again<00:01:23.000> just<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.750> it's

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869

just<00:01:25.009> slicing<00:01:26.009> through<00:01:26.100> clean<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.700> easy<00:01:26.850> I

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
just slicing through clean and easy I

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:39.860 
just slicing through clean and easy I
need<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.320> adjust<00:01:28.439> my<00:01:28.740> little

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.380 

got<00:01:40.870> a<00:01:40.900> good<00:01:41.049> goodbye<00:01:41.290> now<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.180> should

got a good goodbye now and it should
just<00:01:51.119> clean<00:01:52.119> cuts<00:01:53.250> at<00:01:54.250> this<00:01:54.460> point<00:01:54.759> it's

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
just clean cuts at this point it's

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.490 
just clean cuts at this point it's
probably<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.600> know<00:01:55.630> not<00:01:56.619> as<00:01:57.450> okay<00:01:58.500> actually

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
this really is still quite sharp in the

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:16.140 
this really is still quite sharp in the
paper<00:02:13.739> procedures<00:02:14.739> really<00:02:15.040> simple<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:16.120> just

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
paper procedures really simple you just

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.690 
paper procedures really simple you just
mount<00:02:17.019> it<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.290> our<00:02:17.380> clamp<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.830> this<00:02:18.070> you<00:02:18.430> set

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
mount it in our clamp like this you set

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.810 
mount it in our clamp like this you set
the<00:02:19.239> depth<00:02:19.510> with<00:02:19.959> this<00:02:20.110> key<00:02:20.400> then<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.489> set<00:02:21.730> it

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
the depth with this key then you set it

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.740 
the depth with this key then you set it
into<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.090> clamp<00:02:22.560> about<00:02:23.560> level<00:02:23.890> like<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
into the clamp about level like that and

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.870 
into the clamp about level like that and
then<00:02:26.880> just<00:02:27.880> snug<00:02:28.239> it<00:02:28.330> up<00:02:29.190> again<00:02:30.190> with<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.489> key

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
then just snug it up again with this key

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.440 
then just snug it up again with this key
over<00:02:31.180> here<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:35.140> then<00:02:36.030> really<00:02:37.030> clamp<00:02:37.239> down<00:02:37.420> on

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
over here and then really clamp down on

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.710 
over here and then really clamp down on
it<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:37.900> nice<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:38.080> tight<00:02:42.630> now<00:02:43.630> I've

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
it so it's nice and tight now I've

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.610 
it so it's nice and tight now I've
already<00:02:43.930> got<00:02:44.079> the<00:02:44.170> angle<00:02:44.500> set<00:02:44.769> here<00:02:45.130> at<00:02:46.230> at<00:02:47.230> 15

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
already got the angle set here at at 15

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.039 
already got the angle set here at at 15
degrees<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.940> I'm<00:02:49.329> just<00:02:49.480> going<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.720> take<00:02:49.900> my

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
degrees and I'm just going to take my

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.259 
degrees and I'm just going to take my
spoons<00:02:51.390> slide<00:02:52.390> them<00:02:52.570> under<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.870> rods<00:02:54.269> and

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
spoons slide them under the rods and

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.140 
spoons slide them under the rods and
make<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.540> few<00:02:55.840> passes<00:02:55.989> and<00:02:57.000> that'll<00:02:58.000> pretty

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
make a few passes and that'll pretty

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.260 
make a few passes and that'll pretty
much<00:02:58.239> restore<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.720> back<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.900> razor<00:02:59.200> sharp

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.310 

so<00:03:05.270> you<00:03:05.360> can<00:03:05.480> maybe<00:03:05.600> see<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.990> a<00:03:06.020> little<00:03:06.170> bit

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
so you can maybe see it a little bit

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.260 
so you can maybe see it a little bit
better<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.770> can<00:03:06.950> go<00:03:07.070> in<00:03:07.130> either<00:03:07.250> direction<00:03:07.520> into

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
better I can go in either direction into

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.040 
better I can go in either direction into
the<00:03:08.360> blade<00:03:09.010> like<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.280> or<00:03:11.120> up<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.690> away<00:03:11.810> like

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
the blade like this or up and away like

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.920 
the blade like this or up and away like
this

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
this

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:23.800 
this
switch<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.260> finer<00:03:15.500> grit<00:03:21.520> and<00:03:22.810> really

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
switch to the finer grit and really

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.840 
switch to the finer grit and really
should<00:03:24.050> be<00:03:24.170> pretty<00:03:24.470> much<00:03:24.620> done<00:03:24.980> there<00:03:25.220> let's

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
should be pretty much done there let's

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.580 
should be pretty much done there let's
try<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.120> use<00:03:26.240> this<00:03:26.390> zoom<00:03:26.810> on<00:03:26.960> this<00:03:27.080> camera<00:03:27.140> if

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
try and use this zoom on this camera if

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:39.360 
try and use this zoom on this camera if
I<00:03:27.740> can<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.780> get<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:29.960> a<00:03:30.080> little<00:03:30.260> closer<00:03:30.500> here

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.700 

okay<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.670> what<00:03:40.820> I<00:03:40.850> want<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.090> show<00:03:41.270> is<00:03:41.480> that<00:03:41.720> the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
okay and what I want to show is that the

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.260 
okay and what I want to show is that the
stone<00:03:42.980> even<00:03:43.370> though<00:03:43.430> there's<00:03:43.610> a<00:03:43.670> slight<00:03:44.000> gap

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
stone even though there's a slight gap

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.240 
stone even though there's a slight gap
and<00:03:44.840> I've<00:03:45.050> taken<00:03:45.200> some<00:03:45.470> photographs<00:03:45.920> for<00:03:46.100> you

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
and I've taken some photographs for you

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.200 
and I've taken some photographs for you
to<00:03:46.460> show<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.000> there's<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.930> slight<00:03:48.170> gap<00:03:49.210> there

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
to show it there's a slight gap there

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.680 
to show it there's a slight gap there
there's<00:03:51.020> enough<00:03:51.320> stone<00:03:51.590> in<00:03:51.770> contact<00:03:52.540> with<00:03:53.540> the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
there's enough stone in contact with the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.390 
there's enough stone in contact with the
surface<00:03:54.050> of<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.230> blade<00:03:54.410> at<00:03:54.620> all<00:03:54.770> times<00:03:55.010> that

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
surface of the blade at all times that

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.650 
surface of the blade at all times that
the<00:03:55.790> whole<00:03:55.970> blade<00:03:56.180> ends<00:03:56.360> up<00:03:56.540> getting

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
the whole blade ends up getting

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:10.059 
the whole blade ends up getting
sharpened

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.219 

okay<00:04:13.129> so<00:04:14.129> that<00:04:14.250> really<00:04:14.519> should<00:04:15.030> be<00:04:15.060> right<00:04:16.049> back

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
okay so that really should be right back

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.460 
okay so that really should be right back
to<00:04:16.380> razor-sharp<00:04:16.739> down<00:04:17.130> again<00:04:18.169> like<00:04:19.169> I<00:04:19.289> said

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
to razor-sharp down again like I said

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.060 
to razor-sharp down again like I said
when<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.650> first<00:04:19.680> did<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.370> was<00:04:20.519> able<00:04:20.639> to<00:04:20.789> do<00:04:22.070> 315

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
when I first did it I was able to do 315

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.790 
when I first did it I was able to do 315
cuts<00:04:23.759> like<00:04:23.910> that<00:04:23.970> into<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:24.509> cardboard<00:04:24.840> 24

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
cuts like that into the cardboard 24

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.770 
cuts like that into the cardboard 24
inches<00:04:26.130> before<00:04:26.789> I<00:04:26.820> really<00:04:27.180> felt<00:04:27.389> like<00:04:27.449> it<00:04:27.660> was

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
inches before I really felt like it was

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.689 
inches before I really felt like it was
time<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.020> touch<00:04:28.289> it<00:04:28.410> up<00:04:28.560> even<00:04:29.220> at<00:04:29.310> that<00:04:29.460> point

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
time to touch it up even at that point

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.400 
time to touch it up even at that point
it<00:04:29.940> wasn't<00:04:30.150> standing<00:04:30.660> in<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.810> cardboard<00:04:31.080> yet

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
it wasn't standing in the cardboard yet

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.020 
it wasn't standing in the cardboard yet
it<00:04:31.590> was<00:04:31.680> just<00:04:31.889> getting<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.550> little<00:04:32.580> harder<00:04:32.940> to

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
it was just getting a little harder to

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.890 
it was just getting a little harder to
work<00:04:33.919> just<00:04:36.320> razor-sharp<00:04:37.320> so<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:39.479> end<00:04:39.720> of<00:04:39.840> the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
work just razor-sharp so the end of the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.900 
work just razor-sharp so the end of the
day<00:04:40.110> maybe<00:04:40.800> or<00:04:41.190> maybe<00:04:41.400> at<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.639> end<00:04:41.760> of<00:04:41.850> the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
day maybe or maybe at the end of the

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.960 
day maybe or maybe at the end of the
week<00:04:42.120> when<00:04:43.080> you've<00:04:43.280> been<00:04:44.280> using<00:04:44.490> these<00:04:44.729> blades

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
week when you've been using these blades

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.240 
week when you've been using these blades
and<00:04:45.300> you<00:04:45.419> want<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.660> go<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.810> touch<00:04:46.020> them<00:04:46.199> up<00:04:46.350> it's

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
and you want to go to touch them up it's

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.980 
and you want to go to touch them up it's
really<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.610> very<00:04:47.669> very<00:04:47.910> short<00:04:48.389> quick<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:48.900> easy

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
really a very very short quick and easy

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.760 
really a very very short quick and easy
process<00:04:49.289> just<00:04:50.000> set<00:04:51.000> it<00:04:51.120> in<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.300> clamp<00:04:51.770> tighten

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
process just set it in the clamp tighten

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.800 
process just set it in the clamp tighten
it<00:04:52.860> down

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.240 

grab<00:04:57.810> your<00:04:57.990> stones<00:05:00.680> there<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:01.800> go

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
grab your stones there you go

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.040 
grab your stones there you go
are<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.669> really<00:05:02.820> only<00:05:03.030> looking<00:05:03.389> at<00:05:03.570> maybe<00:05:03.720> 10

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
are you really only looking at maybe 10

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.650 
are you really only looking at maybe 10
strokes<00:05:04.410> per<00:05:04.710> side<00:05:04.919> with<00:05:05.789> one<00:05:06.000> grit<00:05:06.270> flip<00:05:06.570> it

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
strokes per side with one grit flip it

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.360 
strokes per side with one grit flip it
over<00:05:06.780> ten<00:05:07.169> strokes<00:05:07.410> per<00:05:07.650> side<00:05:07.860> with<00:05:08.039> the<00:05:08.130> next

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
over ten strokes per side with the next

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.430 
over ten strokes per side with the next
grit<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.660> then<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:09.900> blade<00:05:10.139> should<00:05:10.320> be

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
grit and and then the blade should be

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.159 
grit and and then the blade should be
ready<00:05:10.680> to<00:05:10.860> go<00:05:11.009> and<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.120> same<00:05:12.330> thing<00:05:12.570> holds<00:05:12.960> for

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
ready to go and the same thing holds for

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.379 
ready to go and the same thing holds for
all<00:05:13.380> these<00:05:13.740> blades<00:05:13.949> that<00:05:14.250> that<00:05:15.090> we've<00:05:15.210> got

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
all these blades that that we've got

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.110 
all these blades that that we've got
here<00:05:15.830> this<00:05:16.830> one<00:05:17.010> here's<00:05:17.220> another<00:05:17.880> good

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
here this one here's another good

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:27.129 
here this one here's another good
example<00:05:21.740> just<00:05:22.740> set<00:05:22.979> it<00:05:23.070> in<00:05:23.160> like<00:05:23.370> that<00:05:23.580> and

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.000 

again<00:05:28.139> this<00:05:29.010> one<00:05:29.250> has<00:05:29.280> no<00:05:29.699> trouble<00:05:29.970> contacting

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
again this one has no trouble contacting

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:54.909 
again this one has no trouble contacting
another<00:05:32.010> blade<00:05:33.830> at<00:05:34.830> all<00:05:35.010> times<00:05:35.310> to<00:05:35.520> get<00:05:35.639> this

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.619
