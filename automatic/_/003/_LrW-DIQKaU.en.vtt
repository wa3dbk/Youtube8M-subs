00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:10.400
 that is holger creative lens htc 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.769
 47 cents for SLR cameras and 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.210
 although for canon and nikon we have that 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.240
 Here in the offer I say that she is allowed 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.009
 So based on the brand I here 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.779
 left of me have that works 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.910
 Of course, then of course 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.869
 also for the Nikon 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.609
 friends among them 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.590
 let's just start with me 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.869
 Show you the whole time right now 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.150
 components here and then individually 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.650
 We'll do the whole thing here on the 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.640
 attach camera to see it 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.839
 can like that then properly so 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.089
 works or 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:41.180
 that they too technically get away with it 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:45.110
 better to be able to picture this 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.540
 the heart of this creative set is this 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.159
 middle piece which is practically here behind 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.559
 on the back then into the bayonet 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.750
 the camera is used and on the 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.940
 front is then here or 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.769
 if you take off this cap, which I do 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.159
 in any case highly recommend want because 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.290
 so the lens is behind with a fixed 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.540
 with a fixed diameter of turn 8 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.479
 and then we can do the two here 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.950
 additional elements and that is 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.320
 namely, once a so-called revolver 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.479
 filter with new effect and then one 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.909
 another revolver with new parents why 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.469
 the whole revolver is called 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.780
 actually become very clear that 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.579
 put on here and then you can stop 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.200
 just every single effect of these 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.579
 whole revolver we have here so 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.990
 the new pieces in the number if you 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.820
 the whole then took out 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.579
 the squadron which I now also times each 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.280
 wheelchair and they will be easy 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.999
 in front of the lens here in the middle 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.219
 pushed recognized 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:42.469
 and now you know what it is 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.119
 revolver on you has just one 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.920
 practically here of an effect first 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.499
 just then the whole thing down so 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.759
 rotates and the schedule itself is 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:52.729
 actually we just have it there 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.159
 then here are the redeemed with magnets 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.469
 Although we have so small recesses 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.700
 in there and the counterparts are 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.909
 then here in the plastic on the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.549
 back up here and here 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.030
 below and the approaches just turn up 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.500
 a little bit so the whole thing is a rest and 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.269
 then you can use this right here 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.050
 That's right , you have to be like that 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.660
 not to have fear 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.460
 somehow that stops bombproof 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.980
 Of course, the same applies here as well 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.360
 this other revolver with the effects 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.650
 which we have here so are here too 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.350
 the product page you are currently on 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.400
 in the picture gallery for example pictures 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.900
 so that she can be a bit too 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.070
 can do better what the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.840
 individual effects because so in the end 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.810
 So how it was then 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.020
 now we are putting this creatively 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.800
 the hl tc just here on the camera 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.100
 attach that is not easy 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.580
 assuming the camera is easy 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.000
 here 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.520
 the creative objective i the internet 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.150
 just solve it and then we set 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.230
 here then the people creative objective 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.000
 we just got here in the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.980
 side on the edge so a little white 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.360
 Of course, that must have happened 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.080
 then here at the red dot but not 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.530
 the camera 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.520
 if you put that up there 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.980
 and then turn once until the click 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.050
 It looks like that and you can 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.640
 just get started and make photos here 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.050
 the camera is a principle then possible 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.580
 Of course you have to do the iso 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.720
 make it high because there ever 8 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.739
 after light conditions there you have to 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.270
 of course a bit 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.800
 tricks so you just got up 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.600
 packaging leisure also gets quite 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.800
 Clear advantage is of course here 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.510
 digital that you can see right away 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.980
 can do what you did and if that 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.750
 do not like what you did then 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.670
 Just keep turning and then pick up 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.640
 here is the next effect that works 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.200
 of course, for the other effects 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.580
 and then you can agree in principle 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.100
 directly hosting makes err much fun 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.810
 not to say is something completely different 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.550
 as well as drop a bit 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.830
 the wholly owned control and so 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.060
 but I have a faible for such 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.739
 stories and if it's a bit 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.459
 off the beaten-up days 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.650
 is that always great 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.840
 The main thing to be creative is having fun 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.530
 and everything else does not matter 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.900
 that was the fire keeps relatively objective c 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.880
 47 with the blind with the fx aperture 8 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.680
 for train and the spd we have too 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.790
 nikon go already said as initially 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.920
 of course not for me then 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.290
 Everything said that 's just from the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.610
 Ballet different so much fun 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.470
 The decision-making I can only 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.470
 say a lot of fun for a little money
