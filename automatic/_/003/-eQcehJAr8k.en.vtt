limit for this young horse and certainly

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.910 
limit for this young horse and certainly
we<00:03:45.360> might<00:03:45.540> see<00:03:45.750> him<00:03:45.840> once<00:03:46.050> more<00:03:46.170> likely<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:46.830> the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
we might see him once more likely in the
