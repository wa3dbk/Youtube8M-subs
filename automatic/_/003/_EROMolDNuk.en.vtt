shelf itself show you guys how to
achieve<00:00:30.150> woodgrain<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.900> then<00:00:31.199> next<00:00:31.380> week

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
achieve woodgrain and then next week

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.930 
achieve woodgrain and then next week
will<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.859> full<00:00:32.130> time-lapse<00:00:32.610> video

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
will be the full time-lapse video

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.150 
will be the full time-lapse video
including<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.840> candles<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.410> butterflies

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
including the candles and butterflies

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.590 
including the candles and butterflies
now<00:00:35.309> these<00:00:35.430> techniques<00:00:35.880> will<00:00:36.090> work<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.570> both

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
now these techniques will work for both

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.200 
now these techniques will work for both
oil<00:00:36.989> or<00:00:37.350> acrylic<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.250> main<00:00:38.489> difference<00:00:38.969> would

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
oil or acrylic the main difference would

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.729 
oil or acrylic the main difference would
be<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.690> you're<00:00:39.899> working<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.379> oil

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
be if you're working in oil

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.709 
be if you're working in oil
whereas<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.399> layered<00:00:41.820> everything<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.600> then

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
whereas I layered everything and then

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.150 
whereas I layered everything and then
just<00:00:42.750> painted<00:00:43.170> over<00:00:43.320> my<00:00:43.559> background<00:00:43.950> layers

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
just painted over my background layers

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.860 
just painted over my background layers
if<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.760> were<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.090> done<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.510> oil<00:00:45.660> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
if I were to have done this in oil I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.090 
if I were to have done this in oil I
would<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.140> drawn<00:00:46.379> directly<00:00:46.800> onto<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
would have drawn directly onto the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.680 
would have drawn directly onto the
canvas<00:00:47.190> first<00:00:47.640> where<00:00:48.059> my<00:00:48.239> shelf<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
canvas first where my shelf and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.029 
canvas first where my shelf and
butterflies<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.350> candles<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.950> go

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
butterflies and candles are going to go

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.799 
butterflies and candles are going to go
and<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.340> paint<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.670> around<00:00:50.879> everything<00:00:51.329> but

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and just paint it around everything but

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.540 
and just paint it around everything but
with<00:00:52.079> acrylic<00:00:52.440> drying<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.890> quickly<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.430> was

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
with acrylic drying so quickly it was

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.400 
with acrylic drying so quickly it was
just<00:00:53.789> easier<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.690> whole<00:00:54.899> background<00:00:55.289> in

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
just easier to do my whole background in

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.319 
just easier to do my whole background in
the<00:00:55.500> layer<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.039> shelf<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.370> top<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.910> so

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the layer the shelf on top of that so

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.490 
the layer the shelf on top of that so
that<00:00:57.360> would<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> main<00:00:57.989> difference<00:00:58.320> there

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that would be the main difference there

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.049 
that would be the main difference there
if<00:00:58.559> you're<00:00:58.680> gonna<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:59.010> oil<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.399> would<00:00:59.460> recommend

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
if you're gonna do oil I would recommend

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.400 
if you're gonna do oil I would recommend
drawing<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.750> painting<00:01:01.020> around<00:01:01.109> your

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
drawing it out and painting around your

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.290 
drawing it out and painting around your
subjects<00:01:01.800> versus<00:01:02.160> Larry<00:01:02.340> how<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> did<00:01:02.969> here<00:01:03.149> I

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

and unbleached titanium white to get
this<00:01:32.490> color<00:01:32.759> I'm<00:01:33.750> not<00:01:33.960> worrying<00:01:34.229> about

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
this color I'm not worrying about

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.140 
this color I'm not worrying about
blending<00:01:34.829> everything<00:01:34.950> out<00:01:35.280> perfectly<00:01:35.790> I'm

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
blending everything out perfectly I'm

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.700 
blending everything out perfectly I'm
leaving<00:01:36.689> some<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.960> these<00:01:37.079> streaks<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.530> just

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
leaving some of these streaks they just

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.140 
leaving some of these streaks they just
need<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> stay<00:01:38.070> horizontal<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:38.820> they<00:01:38.970> work

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
need to stay horizontal so they work

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.649 
need to stay horizontal so they work
with<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.420> wood<00:01:39.570> grain<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:40.140> later<00:01:40.439> layers

with the wood grain for later layers

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.999 
with the wood grain for later layers
once<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.780> finish<00:01:43.079> getting<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.530> layer<00:01:43.710> blocked

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
once I finish getting this layer blocked

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.280 
once I finish getting this layer blocked
in<00:01:44.220> I'm<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.240> use<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> hairdryer<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> dry

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
in I'm going to use a hairdryer to dry

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.760 
in I'm going to use a hairdryer to dry
it<00:01:46.590> all<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.369> go<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.240> next<00:01:48.270> layer

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
it all and then go on to my next layer

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.530 
it all and then go on to my next layer
I'm<00:01:49.770> not<00:01:50.040> worrying<00:01:50.460> about<00:01:50.670> completely

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
I'm not worrying about completely

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.940 
I'm not worrying about completely
completely<00:01:51.899> covering<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> red<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
completely covering the red in the

completely covering the red in the
pattern<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> background<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:54.090> because

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
pattern in the background here because

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.209 
pattern in the background here because
that's<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.750> gonna<00:01:54.930> add<00:01:55.110> more<00:01:55.380> texture<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.130> my

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
that's just gonna add more texture in my

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.389 
that's just gonna add more texture in my
finished<00:01:57.149> piece<00:01:57.680> now<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.860> that's<00:01:58.950> all<00:01:59.159> dry

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
finished piece now that that's all dry

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.069 
finished piece now that that's all dry
and<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.700> canvas<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.180> cold<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.840> start

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
and the canvas is cold I can start

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.929 
and the canvas is cold I can start
working<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.530> building<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.159> my<00:02:02.340> first<00:02:02.549> set<00:02:02.909> of

so many layers on this to get the

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.900 
so many layers on this to get the
texture<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.800> I<00:02:07.980> want<00:02:08.040> that<00:02:08.460> I'm<00:02:08.700> not

the shelf to be lighter and then back to
be<00:02:16.050> darker<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.130> can<00:02:17.340> get<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.610> depth

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
colors in the foreground and I'll go

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.590 
colors in the foreground and I'll go
back<00:02:23.370> through<00:02:23.640> eventually<00:02:24.000> with<00:02:24.300> airbrush

and really darken up that back line but

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.770 
and really darken up that back line but
for<00:02:27.570> now<00:02:27.750> I'm<00:02:28.080> leaving<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:28.800> this<00:02:29.570> once<00:02:30.570> I

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
for now I'm leaving it like this once I

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.510 
for now I'm leaving it like this once I
get<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.110> transition<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.860> want<00:02:32.130> from<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520

get the transition that I want from the
dark<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:32.910> back<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.540> light<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.960> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
foreground I'm going to dry this layer

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.790 
foreground I'm going to dry this layer
and<00:02:36.360> then<00:02:36.720> start<00:02:37.020> working<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.560> finer

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
and then start working on the finer

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.070 
and then start working on the finer
details<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.880> wood<00:02:39.030> grain<00:02:39.180> itself<00:02:39.480> when

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
details of the wood grain itself when

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.330 
details of the wood grain itself when
you<00:02:40.170> use<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> hairdryer<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.890> dry<00:02:41.010> your

you use the hairdryer to dry your

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.590 
you use the hairdryer to dry your
painting<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:41.820> recommend<00:02:42.150> letting<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
painting I do recommend letting the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.390 
painting I do recommend letting the
canvas<00:02:42.959> cool<00:02:43.140> for<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.440> few<00:02:43.500> seconds<00:02:44.010> before<00:02:44.160> you

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
canvas cool for a few seconds before you

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.770 
canvas cool for a few seconds before you
start<00:02:44.640> painting<00:02:44.820> just<00:02:45.150> because<00:02:45.360> acrylic

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
start painting just because acrylic

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.210 
start painting just because acrylic
dries<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.170> fast<00:02:46.200> as<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.980> don't<00:02:47.010> need

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
dries so fast as it is you don't need

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.800 
dries so fast as it is you don't need
that<00:02:47.340> additional<00:02:47.760> heat<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.150> help<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.510> along

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
that additional heat to help you along

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.930 
that additional heat to help you along
with<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.080> now<00:02:49.740> I'm<00:02:49.860> moving<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.459> painting

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
with that now I'm moving on to painting

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.699 
with that now I'm moving on to painting
in<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.180> actual<00:02:51.510> wood<00:02:51.660> grain<00:02:51.900> I'm<00:02:52.050> using<00:02:52.350> a

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
in the actual wood grain I'm using a

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.280 
in the actual wood grain I'm using a
small<00:02:53.130> flat<00:02:53.610> brush<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.180> I'm<00:02:54.840> keeping<00:02:55.050> my

small flat brush and I'm keeping my

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.050 
small flat brush and I'm keeping my
lines<00:02:55.530> very<00:02:55.890> sketchy<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.520> reason<00:02:56.850> for<00:02:56.940> this

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
using keeping everything with a very

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.520 
using keeping everything with a very

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
dark and the reason for this is I will

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.229 
dark and the reason for this is I will
later<00:03:37.530> go<00:03:37.739> on<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.100> glaze<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:39.060> tone

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
later go on and glaze this to tone

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.640 
later go on and glaze this to tone
everything<00:03:39.480> down<00:03:39.840> but<00:03:39.989> for<00:03:40.200> now<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:40.590> looks

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
everything down but for now it looks

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.470 
everything down but for now it looks
better<00:03:41.070> if<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.430> keep<00:03:41.610> everything<00:03:41.730> really

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
better if I keep everything really

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
hate a dry brush look like passionately

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.960 
hate a dry brush look like passionately
hate<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.810> look<00:04:28.930> of<00:04:29.140> a<00:04:29.200> dry<00:04:29.380> brush<00:04:29.560> but<00:04:30.340> in<00:04:30.670> this

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.510 
hate the look of a dry brush but in this
case<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.630> actually<00:04:31.690> works<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.130> texture

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520

lot of water mixed in with this pain

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.340 
lot of water mixed in with this pain
it's<00:04:36.910> pretty<00:04:37.240> dry<00:04:37.480> so<00:04:37.510> that<00:04:37.690> I<00:04:37.840> can<00:04:38.020> keep<00:04:38.170> that

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
it's pretty dry so that I can keep that

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.740 
it's pretty dry so that I can keep that
sketchy<00:04:38.650> look<00:04:38.920> if<00:04:39.220> you<00:04:39.340> want<00:04:39.550> your<00:04:39.670> your<00:04:40.180> wood

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
sketchy look if you want your your wood

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.390 
sketchy look if you want your your wood
shelf<00:04:41.020> or<00:04:41.200> wood<00:04:41.500> grain<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:42.040> look<00:04:42.250> more

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
shelf or wood grain to look more

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.150 
shelf or wood grain to look more
polished<00:04:42.580> you<00:04:43.270> will<00:04:43.510> do<00:04:43.720> smoother<00:04:44.080> lines<00:04:44.290> and

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
polished you will do smoother lines and

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.300 
polished you will do smoother lines and
in<00:04:45.670> that<00:04:45.850> case<00:04:46.090> no<00:04:46.450> dry<00:04:46.750> brushing<00:04:47.110> at<00:04:47.230> all<00:04:47.350> I'm

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
in that case no dry brushing at all I'm

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.370 
in that case no dry brushing at all I'm
now<00:04:48.550> still<00:04:48.970> using<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.450> unbleached<00:04:49.810> titanium

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
now still using the unbleached titanium

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.020 
now still using the unbleached titanium
white<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.830> I'm<00:04:50.980> really<00:04:51.340> highlighting<00:04:51.940> the

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
white and I'm really highlighting the

white and I'm really highlighting the
edge<00:04:52.180> of<00:04:52.390> this<00:04:52.480> shelf<00:04:52.780> so<00:04:52.990> that<00:04:53.110> it<00:04:53.200> really

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
edge of this shelf so that it really

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.720 
edge of this shelf so that it really
stands<00:04:53.890> out<00:04:54.070> and<00:04:54.280> gives<00:04:54.460> me<00:04:54.580> that

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
stands out and gives me that

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.060 
stands out and gives me that
3-dimensional<00:04:55.420> look<00:04:55.570> as<00:04:56.230> you're<00:04:56.470> working<00:04:56.650> if

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
3-dimensional look as you're working if

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.770 
3-dimensional look as you're working if
you<00:04:57.190> get<00:04:57.370> a<00:04:57.400> few<00:04:57.640> layers<00:04:57.880> that<00:04:58.210> look<00:04:58.390> terrible

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
you get a few layers that look terrible

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.390 
you get a few layers that look terrible
and<00:04:58.930> you<00:04:59.080> hate<00:04:59.290> how<00:04:59.440> they<00:04:59.590> look<00:04:59.800> just<00:05:00.190> keep

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
and you hate how they look just keep

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.920 
and you hate how they look just keep
painting<00:05:00.670> over<00:05:00.970> them<00:05:01.150> don't<00:05:01.390> give<00:05:01.570> up<00:05:01.720> on<00:05:01.900> it

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
painting over them don't give up on it

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.960 
painting over them don't give up on it
the<00:05:02.320> more<00:05:02.500> layers<00:05:02.770> you<00:05:02.920> do<00:05:03.220> for<00:05:03.430> this<00:05:03.520> some<00:05:03.940> of

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
the more layers you do for this some of

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.550 
the more layers you do for this some of
those<00:05:04.210> are<00:05:04.450> going<00:05:04.480> to<00:05:04.690> show<00:05:04.870> through<00:05:05.200> even<00:05:05.500> the

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
those are going to show through even the

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.230 
those are going to show through even the
bad<00:05:05.710> layers<00:05:05.920> and<00:05:06.190> it<00:05:06.340> just<00:05:06.580> builds<00:05:06.760> up<00:05:06.970> that

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
bad layers and it just builds up that

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.940 
bad layers and it just builds up that
much<00:05:07.450> more<00:05:07.600> texture<00:05:08.050> that's<00:05:08.440> why<00:05:08.650> in<00:05:08.800> my

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
much more texture that's why in my

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.650 
much more texture that's why in my
earlier<00:05:09.310> layers<00:05:09.640> I<00:05:09.880> wasn't<00:05:10.240> worried<00:05:10.540> about

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
earlier layers I wasn't worried about

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.450 
earlier layers I wasn't worried about
the<00:05:10.870> red<00:05:11.320> wallpaper<00:05:11.680> showing<00:05:12.280> through<00:05:12.430> a

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
the red wallpaper showing through a

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.950 
the red wallpaper showing through a
little<00:05:12.730> bit<00:05:12.850> because<00:05:13.210> it<00:05:13.420> was<00:05:13.510> just<00:05:13.540> gonna<00:05:13.810> add

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
little bit because it was just gonna add

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.380 
little bit because it was just gonna add
a<00:05:13.990> little<00:05:14.200> bit<00:05:14.650> more<00:05:14.680> texture<00:05:15.160> to<00:05:15.370> my<00:05:15.490> wood<00:05:15.640> you

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
a little bit more texture to my wood you

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.120 
a little bit more texture to my wood you
can<00:05:16.540> do<00:05:16.600> as<00:05:16.750> many<00:05:17.140> layers<00:05:17.350> as<00:05:17.560> you<00:05:17.710> want<00:05:17.800> here

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
can do as many layers as you want here

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.440 
can do as many layers as you want here
just<00:05:18.310> keep<00:05:18.460> building<00:05:18.670> and<00:05:19.000> building<00:05:19.060> and

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
just keep building and building and

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.910 
just keep building and building and
building<00:05:19.480> until<00:05:19.960> you<00:05:20.260> get<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.530> look<00:05:20.710> that<00:05:20.740> you

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
building until you get the look that you

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.460 
building until you get the look that you
like<00:05:21.100> and<00:05:21.340> if<00:05:21.880> you<00:05:22.000> get<00:05:22.240> to<00:05:22.450> where<00:05:22.630> like<00:05:23.260> in

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
like and if you get to where like in

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.230 
like and if you get to where like in
this<00:05:23.620> case<00:05:23.919> I'm<00:05:24.160> having<00:05:24.520> too<00:05:24.730> much<00:05:24.910> contrast

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
this case I'm having too much contrast

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.520 
this case I'm having too much contrast
which<00:05:25.510> I<00:05:25.660> knew<00:05:25.780> I<00:05:25.810> was<00:05:26.050> going<00:05:26.200> to<00:05:26.320> do<00:05:26.440> because

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
which I knew I was going to do because

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.260 
which I knew I was going to do because
I'm<00:05:26.770> going<00:05:27.010> to<00:05:27.130> glaze<00:05:27.310> over<00:05:27.430> but<00:05:27.940> if<00:05:28.030> you<00:05:28.120> get

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
I'm going to glaze over but if you get

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.700 
I'm going to glaze over but if you get
to<00:05:28.360> where<00:05:28.480> you<00:05:28.570> have<00:05:28.690> way<00:05:29.020> too<00:05:29.080> much<00:05:29.320> contrast

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
to where you have way too much contrast

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.870 
to where you have way too much contrast
and<00:05:29.950> you<00:05:29.980> think<00:05:30.190> you've<00:05:30.280> done<00:05:30.400> a<00:05:30.460> terrible<00:05:30.610> job

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
and you think you've done a terrible job

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.790 
and you think you've done a terrible job
need<00:05:31.150> to<00:05:31.210> start<00:05:31.419> over<00:05:31.510> don't<00:05:31.900> because<00:05:32.560> you<00:05:32.650> can

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
need to start over don't because you can

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.530 
need to start over don't because you can
just<00:05:33.010> glaze<00:05:33.250> later<00:05:33.550> on<00:05:33.760> which<00:05:34.000> I<00:05:34.120> will<00:05:34.300> end<00:05:34.450> up

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
just glaze later on which I will end up

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.030 
just glaze later on which I will end up
showing<00:05:34.690> you<00:05:34.810> but<00:05:35.140> you<00:05:35.260> can<00:05:35.410> glaze<00:05:35.590> to<00:05:35.830> tone

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
showing you but you can glaze to tone

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.409 
showing you but you can glaze to tone
all<00:05:36.190> of<00:05:36.340> that<00:05:36.460> down<00:05:36.669> and<00:05:36.880> then<00:05:36.970> continue

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
all of that down and then continue

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.730 
all of that down and then continue
building<00:05:37.600> your<00:05:37.780> wood<00:05:37.990> grain<00:05:38.200> until<00:05:38.440> you<00:05:38.620> get

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
building your wood grain until you get

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.440 
building your wood grain until you get
it<00:05:38.830> how<00:05:38.950> you<00:05:39.010> like<00:05:39.280> but<00:05:39.730> don't<00:05:40.030> get<00:05:40.210> frustrated

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
it how you like but don't get frustrated

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.090 
it how you like but don't get frustrated
and<00:05:40.990> paint<00:05:41.230> over<00:05:41.530> and<00:05:41.710> think<00:05:41.860> you<00:05:41.919> need<00:05:42.070> to

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100

this is over everything in for a glaze
it's<00:06:07.000> a<00:06:07.120> whole<00:06:07.390> lot<00:06:07.540> of<00:06:07.570> water<00:06:07.780> in<00:06:08.080> a<00:06:08.169> little

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
it's a whole lot of water in a little

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.750 
it's a whole lot of water in a little
bit<00:06:08.620> of<00:06:08.710> paint<00:06:08.950> if<00:06:09.100> you're<00:06:09.220> working<00:06:09.400> in<00:06:09.610> oil

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
bit of paint if you're working in oil

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.909 
bit of paint if you're working in oil
you're<00:06:10.060> gonna<00:06:10.180> use<00:06:10.480> your<00:06:10.780> mixing<00:06:11.410> medium<00:06:11.620> in

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
you're gonna use your mixing medium in

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.920 
you're gonna use your mixing medium in
my<00:06:12.010> case<00:06:12.190> it<00:06:12.310> would<00:06:12.370> be<00:06:12.430> liquid<00:06:12.910> with<00:06:13.450> a<00:06:13.480> little

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
my case it would be liquid with a little

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.800 
my case it would be liquid with a little
bit<00:06:14.080> of<00:06:14.169> paint<00:06:14.380> more

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
bit of paint more

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.240 
bit of paint more
when<00:06:14.930> then<00:06:15.050> paint<00:06:15.320> so<00:06:15.740> that<00:06:15.770> it's<00:06:16.010> a<00:06:16.070> very

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
when then paint so that it's a very

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.070 
when then paint so that it's a very
translucent<00:06:17.030> layer<00:06:17.210> and<00:06:17.480> you<00:06:17.600> can<00:06:17.630> see<00:06:17.780> how

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
translucent layer and you can see how

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.140 
translucent layer and you can see how
now<00:06:18.260> it<00:06:18.500> just<00:06:18.530> brings<00:06:19.070> all<00:06:19.370> of<00:06:19.580> those<00:06:19.730> colors

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
now it just brings all of those colors

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.879 
now it just brings all of those colors
of<00:06:20.330> the<00:06:20.540> lights<00:06:20.780> and<00:06:20.960> the<00:06:21.050> darks<00:06:21.139> together<00:06:21.650> in

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
of the lights and the darks together in

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.790 
of the lights and the darks together in
a<00:06:22.040> much<00:06:22.220> more<00:06:22.400> natural<00:06:22.940> look<00:06:23.120> and<00:06:23.530> you<00:06:24.530> can<00:06:24.680> do

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
a much more natural look and you can do

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.800 
a much more natural look and you can do
these<00:06:24.950> glazes<00:06:25.520> in<00:06:25.550> several<00:06:26.060> layers<00:06:26.210> I<00:06:26.480> started

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
these glazes in several layers I started

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.330 
these glazes in several layers I started
with<00:06:26.960> the<00:06:27.050> brown<00:06:27.260> now<00:06:27.500> I'm<00:06:27.620> glazing<00:06:27.860> black

with the brown now I'm glazing black

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.430 
with the brown now I'm glazing black
into<00:06:28.790> the<00:06:28.880> background<00:06:29.330> to<00:06:29.900> darken<00:06:30.260> that<00:06:30.380> up

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.300 
piece but I'm just doing more glazing in
between<00:06:35.930> now<00:06:36.200> you<00:06:36.260> do<00:06:36.680> want<00:06:36.919> to<00:06:36.950> make<00:06:37.100> sure

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
that when you're glazing that you're

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.390 
that when you're glazing that you're
letting<00:06:38.810> that<00:06:38.840> paint<00:06:39.169> dry<00:06:39.380> in<00:06:39.590> between<00:06:39.620> glazes

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
letting that paint dry in between glazes

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.190 
letting that paint dry in between glazes
if<00:06:40.700> it's<00:06:40.880> not<00:06:41.060> completely<00:06:41.450> dry<00:06:41.690> you'll<00:06:41.900> end<00:06:42.080> up

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.200 
if it's not completely dry you'll end up

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.440 
if it's not completely dry you'll end up
lifting<00:06:42.590> up<00:06:42.800> the<00:06:43.100> first<00:06:43.310> few<00:06:43.580> layers<00:06:43.790> so

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
lifting up the first few layers so

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.710 
lifting up the first few layers so
definitely<00:06:45.110> dry<00:06:45.350> it<00:06:45.410> in<00:06:45.560> between<00:06:46.479> I'm<00:06:47.479> now

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720

glazing some magenta into the shelf so

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.219 
glazing some magenta into the shelf so
that<00:06:49.729> it<00:06:49.910> looks<00:06:50.060> like<00:06:50.120> it's<00:06:50.330> reflecting<00:06:50.810> some

very<00:07:14.419> very<00:07:14.660> sketchy<00:07:15.050> lines<00:07:15.380> and<00:07:15.710> you<00:07:16.010> can<00:07:16.160> keep

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 
very very sketchy lines and you can keep
