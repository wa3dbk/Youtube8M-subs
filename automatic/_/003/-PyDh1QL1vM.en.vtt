 good morning we are all here today in the 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.869
 study because we have recorded 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.190
 the arpeggio said branches dinette in 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.230
 particular the species was registered 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.690
 obviously from the maximum varini which 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.110
 progress all the merits because not 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.300
 they are so on the pole can keep researched 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.500
 do my best then before 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.029
 show the arpeggio done as follows 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.530

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.589
 in this case lose it used 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:43.579
 a miss especially the recommend 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:45.429
 at the handle position pick up everything 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.699
 while inside 78 he manages 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:52.149
 basically the colors of the gods 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.269
 cheer store in the intervention is based 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.819
 to entrust general camo one more color 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.179

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:05.180
 kaun a dye 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.820
 all come inside as you see the 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.399
 ours for the current sector 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.810
 triax preamp of the mesa 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:16.039

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.109
 audio and mac with logic have fun 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.420
 as a final treat I also performed the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.730
 only obviously not registered or 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.780
 completely without while in such a way 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.910
 that you can try to hear all 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.020
