it used to have and it's also rather
orange<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.040> bad<00:00:35.460> way<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.690> will<00:00:36.840> start

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
orange in a bad way and I will start

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.869 
orange in a bad way and I will start
with<00:00:37.200> dark<00:00:37.440> egg<00:00:37.649> blue<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:38.579> I'm<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
with dark egg blue and then I'm going to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.830 
with dark egg blue and then I'm going to
put<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> second<00:00:39.540> color<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:40.430> old<00:00:41.430> white<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.969> paint

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
put a second color of old white on paint

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.590 
put a second color of old white on paint
onto<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.579> sort<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.149> every

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
onto it but going in a sort of every

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.639 
onto it but going in a sort of every
which<00:00:45.809> way<00:00:46.940> just<00:00:47.940> push<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.450> paint<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
which way just push the paint in one of

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.900 
which way just push the paint in one of
the<00:00:49.739> reasons<00:00:50.070> why<00:00:50.190> these<00:00:50.250> brushes<00:00:50.670> are<00:00:50.789> really

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the reasons why these brushes are really

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.119 
the reasons why these brushes are really
good<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:51.510> they<00:00:51.719> will<00:00:51.989> allow<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
good is because they will allow you to

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.279 
good is because they will allow you to
stab<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.210> get<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.570> all<00:00:54.840> lots<00:00:55.140> of

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
stab in and get in all lots of

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.979 
stab in and get in all lots of
directions<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.879> first<00:00:57.149> coat<00:00:57.510> should<00:00:57.809> be

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
directions the first coat should be

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.540 
directions the first coat should be
slightly<00:00:58.590> thicker<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.390> more<00:01:00.390> uneven<00:01:01.550> it's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
slightly thicker and more uneven it's

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.429 
slightly thicker and more uneven it's
evenly<00:01:03.000> uneven<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.809> don't<00:01:03.989> want<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.290> doing

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
evenly uneven you don't want to be doing

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.250 
evenly uneven you don't want to be doing
it<00:01:04.769> uneven<00:01:05.760> all<00:01:06.030> over<00:01:06.420> with<00:01:06.510> lots<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.960> lots<00:01:07.080> of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it uneven all over with lots and lots of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.590 
it uneven all over with lots and lots of
bugs<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.580> way<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> paint<00:01:09.180> looks

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
bugs I know that the way I paint looks

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.660 
bugs I know that the way I paint looks
very<00:01:09.900> slapdash<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.869> I'm<00:01:13.430> trying<00:01:14.430> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.480 
very slapdash it is but I'm trying to

make it have some texture and something

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.420 
make it have some texture and something
interesting<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:20.100> I'm<00:01:20.220> doing

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
interesting about it so what I'm doing

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.609 
interesting about it so what I'm doing
now<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.610> doing<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> second<00:01:21.509> coat<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.080> my<00:01:22.560> two

and now I'm putting old white on you

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.690 
and now I'm putting old white on you
need<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.080> paint<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.680> bigger<00:01:29.340> brush

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
need to really paint with a bigger brush

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.330 
need to really paint with a bigger brush
as<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.590> handle<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.770> don't<00:01:31.950> want<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> be

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
as you can handle you don't want to be

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.060 
as you can handle you don't want to be
hanging<00:01:32.579> around<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.710> that's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
hanging around and get on with it that's

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.999 
hanging around and get on with it that's
the<00:01:35.280> idea<00:01:35.869> thinning<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.170> paint<00:01:37.439> down<00:01:37.680> is

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the idea thinning the paint down is

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.609 
the idea thinning the paint down is
quite<00:01:38.280> important<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.049> paint<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.380> too

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
quite important if the paint is too

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.109 
quite important if the paint is too
thick<00:01:40.860> because<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> don't<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.939> when

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
thick because if you don't do that when

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.270 
thick because if you don't do that when
you<00:01:42.240> try<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.450> sand<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.740> will<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.979> really

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you try to sand it it will be really

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.140 
you try to sand it it will be really
really<00:01:44.310> hard<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.880> do

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.140 

so<00:01:51.150> now<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.780> all<00:01:52.020> dry<00:01:52.380> I'm<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.430> wax

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
so now this is all dry I'm going to wax

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.930 
so now this is all dry I'm going to wax
it<00:01:54.480> with<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.960> clear<00:01:55.260> wax<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.010> then<00:01:56.610> I'm<00:01:56.760> just

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
it with the clear wax and then I'm just

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.580 
it with the clear wax and then I'm just
going<00:01:57.120> to<00:01:57.150> gently<00:01:57.330> sand<00:01:57.720> it<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.260> can<00:01:58.410> just

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
going to gently sand it so you can just

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.860 
going to gently sand it so you can just
see<00:01:58.770> some<00:01:58.980> of<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.130> blue<00:01:59.250> coming<00:01:59.760> through<00:02:02.870> you

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
see some of the blue coming through you

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.110 
see some of the blue coming through you
see<00:02:04.110> how<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.590> made<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.160> very<00:02:05.610> slightly

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
see how it's just made it very slightly

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.030 
see how it's just made it very slightly
dark<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:08.160> now<00:02:08.690> I'm<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.560> wipe<00:02:10.800> it

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
dark so now I'm just going to wipe it

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.910 
dark so now I'm just going to wipe it

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.610 
sort of shape of everything some little
bumps<00:02:24.030> there<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.020> paint<00:02:25.320> that<00:02:25.440> was

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
bumps there in the paint that was

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.790 
bumps there in the paint that was
underneath<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.940> getting<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.780> blue<00:02:28.140> paint<00:02:28.590> a

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
underneath so getting the blue paint a

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:38.510 
underneath so getting the blue paint a
little<00:02:29.070> irregular<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.760> really<00:02:30.330> good<00:02:36.709> so<00:02:37.709> there

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
little irregular is really good so there

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.980 
little irregular is really good so there
are<00:02:38.640> lots<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.060> lots<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.360> other<00:02:39.510> techniques

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990
