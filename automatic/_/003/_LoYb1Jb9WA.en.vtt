on this side just to show you how
versatile<00:00:11.780> a<00:00:12.020> straightening<00:00:12.800> iron<00:00:12.830> can<00:00:13.220> be

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
versatile a straightening iron can be

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.970 
versatile a straightening iron can be
tall<00:00:14.180> dudes<00:00:14.450> will<00:00:14.540> take<00:00:14.780> this<00:00:15.200> section<00:00:15.740> here

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
tall dudes will take this section here

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.320 
tall dudes will take this section here
and<00:00:16.340> then<00:00:16.430> what<00:00:16.550> we'll<00:00:16.640> do<00:00:16.760> is<00:00:16.880> we'll<00:00:16.970> twist

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
and then what we'll do is we'll twist

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.630 
and then what we'll do is we'll twist
them<00:00:17.630> and<00:00:18.380> turn<00:00:18.620> the<00:00:18.800> iron<00:00:18.950> around<00:00:19.220> and<00:00:19.580> the

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
them and turn the iron around and the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.040 
them and turn the iron around and the
important<00:00:20.090> thing<00:00:20.240> really<00:00:20.390> is<00:00:20.570> to<00:00:20.690> keep<00:00:20.870> the

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
important thing really is to keep the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.140 
important thing really is to keep the
iron<00:00:21.350> moving<00:00:21.590> at<00:00:21.860> all<00:00:22.010> times<00:00:22.310> try<00:00:22.670> not<00:00:22.850> to<00:00:23.000> let

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
iron moving at all times try not to let

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.029 
iron moving at all times try not to let
it<00:00:23.210> stop<00:00:24.050> because<00:00:24.380> you<00:00:24.410> will<00:00:24.650> put<00:00:24.860> the<00:00:24.890> odd

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
it stop because you will put the odd

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.590 
it stop because you will put the odd
mark<00:00:25.910> in<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:26.270> hair<00:00:26.449> otherwise<00:00:28.330> there<00:00:29.330> you<00:00:29.449> go

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
mark in the hair otherwise there you go

nice girl f now remember the trick is
really<00:00:34.219> to<00:00:34.339> try<00:00:34.519> and<00:00:34.699> keep<00:00:34.789> the<00:00:34.940> iron<00:00:35.269> moving

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
really to try and keep the iron moving

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.229 
really to try and keep the iron moving
all<00:00:35.839> the<00:00:35.989> time<00:00:36.579> just<00:00:37.579> keep<00:00:37.940> turning<00:00:38.390> it

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
all the time just keep turning it

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.209 
all the time just keep turning it
twisting<00:00:41.239> it<00:00:41.359> around<00:00:41.390> until<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.769> come<00:00:42.979> to<00:00:43.010> the

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
twisting it around until you come to the

ends<00:00:43.429> of<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:43.579> hair<00:00:44.440> now<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.920> more<00:00:46.129> you<00:00:46.159> twist

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
ends of the hair now the more you twist

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.930 
ends of the hair now the more you twist
the<00:00:46.670> iron<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.469> smaller<00:00:48.949> the<00:00:49.159> section<00:00:49.579> the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
the iron and the smaller the section the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.119 
the iron and the smaller the section the
curlier<00:00:50.449> it<00:00:50.719> will<00:00:50.960> be<00:00:51.109> if<00:00:51.589> you<00:00:51.649> tend<00:00:51.889> to<00:00:51.949> find

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
curlier it will be if you tend to find

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.369 
curlier it will be if you tend to find
that<00:00:52.370> your<00:00:52.670> hair<00:00:52.940> is<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.479> type<00:00:53.749> of<00:00:53.780> hair<00:00:54.139> that

that your hair is the type of hair that
doesn't<00:00:55.039> hold<00:00:55.219> a<00:00:55.370> curl<00:00:55.609> very<00:00:55.909> long<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.809> once

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
doesn't hold a curl very long and once

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.939 
doesn't hold a curl very long and once
you've<00:00:57.350> got<00:00:57.499> your<00:00:57.530> section<00:00:59.769> give<00:01:00.769> it<00:01:00.859> another

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
you've got your section give it another

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.229 
you've got your section give it another
brush<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:04.250> hair<00:01:04.460> shouldn't<00:01:04.759> be<00:01:04.850> wet<00:01:05.059> with

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
brush and hair shouldn't be wet with

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.399 
brush and hair shouldn't be wet with
hairspray<00:01:05.570> but<00:01:05.869> it<00:01:05.930> should<00:01:06.140> just<00:01:06.229> have<00:01:06.380> a

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
hairspray but it should just have a

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.319 
hairspray but it should just have a
coating<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:06.920> hair<00:01:07.009> spray<00:01:07.280> on<00:01:07.579> it<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.149> then<00:01:08.270> you

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
coating of hair spray on it and then you

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.340 
coating of hair spray on it and then you
can<00:01:08.450> give<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.659> hair<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:08.869> little<00:01:09.049> twist<00:01:11.350> it's

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
can give the hair a little twist it's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.590 
can give the hair a little twist it's
like<00:01:12.469> a<00:01:12.500> little<00:01:12.799> piece<00:01:12.979> of<00:01:13.009> rope<00:01:13.479> what<00:01:14.479> we're

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
like a little piece of rope what we're

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.940 
like a little piece of rope what we're
going<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:14.780> do<00:01:14.899> here<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.170> then<00:01:15.439> just<00:01:15.590> clamp<00:01:15.829> the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
going to do here is then just clamp the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.280 
going to do here is then just clamp the
iron<00:01:16.219> up<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.520> down<00:01:16.640> this<00:01:16.820> twist<00:01:17.149> here

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
iron up and down this twist here

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.680 
iron up and down this twist here
it's<00:01:18.710> quite<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:18.920> loose<00:01:19.250> rough<00:01:19.730> textured<00:01:20.510> wave

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
it's quite a loose rough textured wave

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.780 
it's quite a loose rough textured wave
if<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:21.470> do<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.680> on<00:01:21.740> whole<00:01:21.980> head<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:22.310> hair<00:01:22.430> kind

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
if you do it on whole head of hair kind

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.490 
if you do it on whole head of hair kind
of<00:01:22.850> really<00:01:23.390> really<00:01:23.780> nice<00:01:26.320> we'll<00:01:27.320> leave<00:01:27.470> that

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
of really really nice we'll leave that

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.420 
of really really nice we'll leave that
for<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.800> minute<00:01:27.950> we'll<00:01:28.100> just<00:01:28.250> do<00:01:28.340> another

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
for a minute we'll just do another

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.330 
for a minute we'll just do another
section<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.180> just<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.480> can<00:01:29.660> see<00:01:29.930> that

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
section that just so you can see that

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:42.310 
section that just so you can see that
works<00:01:40.300> leave<00:01:41.300> those<00:01:41.420> just<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.690> cool<00:01:41.840> down<00:01:41.900> from

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
works leave those just to cool down from

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.350 
works leave those just to cool down from
you<00:01:42.470> before<00:01:42.620> we<00:01:42.800> take<00:01:43.010> them<00:01:43.130> out<00:01:43.310> I'll<00:01:44.210> just

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
you before we take them out I'll just

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.610 
you before we take them out I'll just
show<00:01:44.510> you<00:01:44.540> one<00:01:44.690> other<00:01:44.750> little<00:01:44.990> trick<00:01:45.320> as<00:01:45.470> well

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
show you one other little trick as well

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.680 
show you one other little trick as well
which<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:45.860> quite<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.130> nice<00:01:46.340> little<00:01:47.210> technique

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
which is quite a nice little technique

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.249 
which is quite a nice little technique
to<00:01:47.900> do<00:01:48.080> you<00:01:48.530> take<00:01:48.770> smaller<00:01:49.310> sections<00:01:50.080> you<00:01:51.080> want

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
to do you take smaller sections you want

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.550 
to do you take smaller sections you want
quite<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.500> lot<00:01:52.690> if<00:01:53.690> you<00:01:53.810> can<00:01:53.930> use<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.050> really<00:01:54.380> big

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
quite a lot if you can use a really big

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.230 
quite a lot if you can use a really big
pin<00:01:54.830> or<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.100> really<00:01:55.340> small<00:01:55.580> pin<00:01:55.850> you'll<00:01:56.030> get

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
pin or a really small pin you'll get

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.510 
pin or a really small pin you'll get
slightly<00:01:56.479> different<00:01:56.840> results<00:01:57.200> from<00:01:57.350> each<00:01:57.530> and

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
slightly different results from each and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.580 
slightly different results from each and
then<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:58.759> wrap<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.090> hair<00:01:59.240> around<00:01:59.410> like<00:02:00.410> in<00:02:00.560> a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
then you wrap the hair around like in a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.770 
then you wrap the hair around like in a
figure<00:02:00.920> eight<00:02:00.950> this<00:02:02.290> Kirby<00:02:03.290> grip<00:02:03.970> up<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.630> just

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
figure eight this Kirby grip up and just

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.810 
figure eight this Kirby grip up and just
slide<00:02:06.080> that<00:02:09.160> give<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.190> another<00:02:10.399> little<00:02:10.459> douche

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
slide that give it another little douche

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.760 
slide that give it another little douche
your<00:02:10.970> purse<00:02:11.090> breaks<00:02:14.320> also<00:02:15.320> you've<00:02:15.440> got<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.590> lot

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
your purse breaks also you've got a lot

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.380 
your purse breaks also you've got a lot
of<00:02:15.800> patience<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.580> can<00:02:16.700> do<00:02:16.820> this<00:02:16.910> all<00:02:17.090> over<00:02:17.209> the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
of patience you can do this all over the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.140 
of patience you can do this all over the
head<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.830> looks<00:02:19.010> fantastic<00:02:19.430> just<00:02:19.970> take<00:02:20.120> a

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
head and it looks fantastic just take a

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.210 
head and it looks fantastic just take a
long<00:02:20.390> time<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.989> trick<00:02:21.200> really<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.620> to

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
long time so the trick really is to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.340 
long time so the trick really is to
maybe<00:02:22.370> have<00:02:22.580> your<00:02:22.700> hair<00:02:22.850> curly<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.690> then<00:02:24.170> just

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
maybe have your hair curly and then just

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.170 
maybe have your hair curly and then just
put<00:02:24.500> two<00:02:24.680> or<00:02:24.800> three<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.100> these<00:02:25.220> in<00:02:25.489> here<00:02:26.000> there

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
put two or three of these in here there

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.590 
put two or three of these in here there
and<00:02:26.209> everywhere<00:02:27.790> okay<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:28.970> little<00:02:29.120> twisty

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
and everywhere okay so a little twisty

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.119 
and everywhere okay so a little twisty
basically<00:02:29.989> don't<00:02:30.290> put<00:02:30.410> your<00:02:30.500> fingers<00:02:30.860> in<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
basically don't put your fingers in the

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.770 
basically don't put your fingers in the
this<00:02:33.129> was<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> technique<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:34.269> used<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.480> use<00:02:34.599> to

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
this was a technique we used to use to

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.440 
this was a technique we used to use to
create<00:02:34.959> dreadlocks<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:35.799> hair<00:02:36.310> like<00:02:36.670> temporary

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
create dreadlocks in hair like temporary

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.179 
create dreadlocks in hair like temporary
dreadlocks<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.560> do<00:02:38.680> get<00:02:38.799> this<00:02:38.950> slightly

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
dreadlocks so you do get this slightly

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.750 
dreadlocks so you do get this slightly
kind<00:02:39.489> of<00:02:39.629> ropey<00:02:40.629> finish<00:02:41.379> to<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.650> hair<00:02:41.799> you

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
kind of ropey finish to the hair you

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.210 
kind of ropey finish to the hair you
just<00:02:42.970> slide<00:02:43.180> out<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.390> curvy<00:02:43.840> grip<00:02:44.049> push<00:02:45.040> out

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
just slide out the curvy grip push out

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:53.369 
just slide out the curvy grip push out
the<00:02:45.370> pin<00:02:45.579> from<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:45.939> end<00:02:48.060> zigzag<00:02:49.060> things<00:02:52.379> you

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
the pin from this end zigzag things you

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.929 
the pin from this end zigzag things you
can<00:02:53.470> imagine<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.739> one<00:02:54.010> section<00:02:54.459> if<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.819> have

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
can imagine that one section if you have

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.059 
can imagine that one section if you have
it<00:02:55.090> blended<00:02:55.689> in<00:02:55.780> with<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.900> lot<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.079> curls<00:02:56.379> and<00:02:56.980> a

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
it blended in with a lot of curls and a

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.069 
it blended in with a lot of curls and a
lot<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.310> other<00:02:57.459> movement<00:02:57.849> it<00:02:58.359> looks<00:02:58.659> fantastic

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
lot of other movement it looks fantastic

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.319 
lot of other movement it looks fantastic
gives<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.040> hair<00:03:00.220> huge<00:03:00.609> amounts<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.120> body

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
gives the hair huge amounts of body

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.229 
gives the hair huge amounts of body
because<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.140> way<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.290> expands<00:03:03.010> like<00:03:03.239> it's

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
because the way it expands like it's

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.240 
because the way it expands like it's
called<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.510> pin<00:03:04.720> for<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.049> because<00:03:05.950> ideally

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
called the pin for is because ideally

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.949 
called the pin for is because ideally
what<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:06.519> would<00:03:06.639> then<00:03:06.790> do<00:03:07.000> is<00:03:07.450> if<00:03:07.659> you<00:03:07.750> add<00:03:07.870> it

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
what you would then do is if you add it

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.839 
what you would then do is if you add it
on<00:03:08.079> mass<00:03:08.319> you<00:03:08.590> then<00:03:08.769> start<00:03:09.069> to<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.609> brush<00:03:09.819> it

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
on mass you then start to to brush it

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.050 
on mass you then start to to brush it
out<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.450> turns<00:03:10.720> into<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.079> amazing<00:03:11.530> kind<00:03:11.769> of

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
out it turns into this amazing kind of

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.229 
out it turns into this amazing kind of
crepe<00:03:13.060> like<00:03:13.389> texture<00:03:14.340> you've<00:03:15.340> got<00:03:15.700> naturally

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
crepe like texture you've got naturally

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.550 
crepe like texture you've got naturally
curly<00:03:16.599> hair<00:03:16.780> you<00:03:16.810> can<00:03:17.019> tend<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.319> find<00:03:17.439> that

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
curly hair you can tend to find that

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.530 
curly hair you can tend to find that
sections<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.159> it<00:03:18.280> still<00:03:18.670> go<00:03:18.819> a<00:03:18.849> bit<00:03:19.030> fluffy<00:03:19.450> in

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
sections of it still go a bit fluffy in

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.449 
sections of it still go a bit fluffy in
a<00:03:19.629> bit<00:03:19.750> frizzy<00:03:20.019> so<00:03:20.829> even<00:03:21.189> if<00:03:21.280> you've<00:03:21.370> got

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
a bit frizzy so even if you've got

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.830 
a bit frizzy so even if you've got
naturally<00:03:21.849> curly<00:03:22.150> hair<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.389> could<00:03:22.480> still<00:03:22.810> use

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
naturally curly hair you could still use

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.809 
naturally curly hair you could still use
this<00:03:23.230> technique<00:03:23.650> on<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:24.189> important<00:03:24.519> thing<00:03:24.670> is

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
this technique on the important thing is

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.729 
this technique on the important thing is
the<00:03:25.450> hair<00:03:25.629> hasn't<00:03:25.750> really<00:03:26.019> got<00:03:26.170> any<00:03:26.319> knots<00:03:26.530> in

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
the hair hasn't really got any knots in

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.199 
the hair hasn't really got any knots in
it<00:03:26.829> so<00:03:27.010> just<00:03:27.040> take<00:03:27.340> your<00:03:27.370> section<00:03:27.879> give<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.150> a

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
it so just take your section give it a

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.849 
it so just take your section give it a
little<00:03:28.329> brush<00:03:28.689> which<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.319> know<00:03:29.439> will<00:03:29.560> make<00:03:29.709> it

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
little brush which I know will make it

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.920 
little brush which I know will make it
go<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.040> bit<00:03:30.159> frizzy<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.670> start<00:03:30.970> with<00:03:31.180> as<00:03:31.599> you<00:03:31.840> can

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
go a bit frizzy to start with as you can

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.809 
go a bit frizzy to start with as you can
see<00:03:32.170> by<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:32.950> time<00:03:33.189> you've<00:03:33.370> done<00:03:33.459> this<00:03:33.519> little

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
see by the time you've done this little

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.150 
see by the time you've done this little
technique<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:35.049> curl<00:03:35.290> locked<00:03:35.590> back<00:03:35.829> up<00:03:35.980> you

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
technique the curl locked back up you

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.250 
technique the curl locked back up you
get<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.340> nice<00:03:36.430> big<00:03:36.760> clumpy<00:03:37.299> curl<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:38.109> naturally

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
get a nice big clumpy curl so naturally

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.979 
get a nice big clumpy curl so naturally
curly<00:03:38.739> hair<00:03:38.769> straight<00:03:39.310> hair<00:03:39.340> in<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.419> wavy<00:03:40.810> hair

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
curly hair straight hair in a wavy hair

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.960 
curly hair straight hair in a wavy hair
this<00:03:41.410> technique<00:03:41.799> works<00:03:41.949> pretty<00:03:42.220> much<00:03:42.430> on<00:03:42.609> all

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
this technique works pretty much on all

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.520 
this technique works pretty much on all
hair<00:03:43.750> types<00:03:45.449> remember<00:03:46.449> the<00:03:46.510> curls<00:03:46.840> if<00:03:47.409> you

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
hair types remember the curls if you

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.319 
hair types remember the curls if you
want<00:03:47.680> tighter<00:03:47.949> curls<00:03:48.340> take<00:03:48.669> smaller<00:03:49.030> sections

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
want tighter curls take smaller sections

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.420
