00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
carefully cut out the shape be sure to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.060 
carefully cut out the shape be sure to
try<00:00:57.570> out<00:00:57.780> lots<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.320> different<00:00:58.379> shapes<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
try out lots of different shapes and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.830 
try out lots of different shapes and
sizes<00:01:01.850> put<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> disc<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.270> front<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.660> lens

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
sizes put the disc in front of the lens

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.870 
sizes put the disc in front of the lens
set<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.710> camera<00:01:05.010> into<00:01:05.159> aperture<00:01:05.640> priority

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
set your camera into aperture priority

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.719 
set your camera into aperture priority
or<00:01:06.299> manual<00:01:06.750> mode<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:07.830> want<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> aperture<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
or manual mode you want the aperture to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.700 
or manual mode you want the aperture to
be<00:01:08.850> as<00:01:09.030> wide<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.659> possible<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.500> maximum

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
be as wide as possible for maximum

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.190 
be as wide as possible for maximum
blurriness<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.909> set<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> f-stop<00:01:12.630> number<00:01:13.049> as

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
blurriness so set the f-stop number as

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.550 
blurriness so set the f-stop number as
low<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:14.040> possible<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:15.240> lens<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.869> 1.4

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
low as possible on this lens it's a 1.4

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.280 
low as possible on this lens it's a 1.4
so<00:01:16.799> I'm<00:01:17.009> gonna<00:01:17.130> use<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.780> disc<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.140> gonna

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
so I'm gonna use that the disc is gonna

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.050 
so I'm gonna use that the disc is gonna
block<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> lot<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.979> light<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.220> you'll<00:01:20.759> need<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
block a lot of light so you'll need to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.760 
block a lot of light so you'll need to
set<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> longer<00:01:21.659> exposure<00:01:21.900> time<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.530> order<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
set a longer exposure time in order to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.410 
set a longer exposure time in order to
compensate<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.460> therefore<00:01:24.060> you'll<00:01:24.240> need<00:01:24.390> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
compensate and therefore you'll need a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
compensate and therefore you'll need a
tripod<00:01:24.750> or<00:01:25.200> something<00:01:25.530> else<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.830> stabilize

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
tripod or something else to stabilize

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.649 
tripod or something else to stabilize
the<00:01:26.400> camera<00:01:26.580> while<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> shutter<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.450> open

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the camera while the shutter is open

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.510 
the camera while the shutter is open
other<00:01:28.439> than<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.310> need<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
other than that you just need to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
other than that you just need to
experiment<00:01:29.970> any<00:01:30.390> small<00:01:30.990> point<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.439> light

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
experiment any small point of light

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.620 
experiment any small point of light
that's<00:01:31.979> out<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.460> focus<00:01:32.670> will<00:01:32.970> turn<00:01:33.000> into<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
that's out of focus will turn into the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.719 
that's out of focus will turn into the
shape<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> cut<00:01:34.409> into<00:01:34.650> your<00:01:34.740> disk<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.549> you

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
shape that you cut into your disk if you

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.370 
shape that you cut into your disk if you
want<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.970> work<00:01:36.090> indoors<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.110> use<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
want to work indoors you can use a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.830 
want to work indoors you can use a
strand<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.799> Christmas<00:01:38.250> lights<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.700> go<00:01:39.509> outside

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
strand of Christmas lights or go outside

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.399 
strand of Christmas lights or go outside
at<00:01:40.020> night<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.409> shoot<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.479> went<00:01:42.810> outside<00:01:42.930> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
at night and shoot so I went outside and
