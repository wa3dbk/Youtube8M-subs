00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
gainer before the actual gainer and

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.729 
gainer before the actual gainer and
Sieber<00:00:32.489> will<00:00:32.820> explain<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:34.290> what<00:00:34.530> kind<00:00:34.710> of

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
Sieber will explain what what kind of

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.889 
Sieber will explain what what kind of
trick<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:36.210> trick<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.630> will<00:00:36.750> learn

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
trick it is the trick you will learn

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.950 
trick it is the trick you will learn
before<00:00:37.170> gainer<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:38.180> almost<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.329> football<00:00:39.719> cake

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
before gainer is almost a football cake

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.590 
before gainer is almost a football cake
but<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:41.640> follow<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> foot<00:00:42.390> all

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
but you do it like follow the foot all

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.350 
but you do it like follow the foot all
the<00:00:42.660> way<00:00:42.989> up<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:44.430> almost<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.910> gainer<00:00:45.090> but

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the way up and it's almost a gainer but

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.450 
the way up and it's almost a gainer but
it's<00:00:45.539> more<00:00:45.750> horizontal<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.129> scary

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
it's more horizontal it's not that scary

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.209 
it's more horizontal it's not that scary
and<00:00:47.610> easier<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> learn<00:00:48.300> now<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.649> actual<00:00:49.920> trick

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and easier to learn now the actual trick

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.090 
and easier to learn now the actual trick
before<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.850> learn<00:00:51.030> Dana<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:52.199> almost<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
before you learn Dana it's almost like a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.729 
before you learn Dana it's almost like a
football<00:00:53.309> kick<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.120> said<00:00:54.329> before<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.530> like

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
football kick as we said before the like

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.479 
football kick as we said before the like
domesticate<00:00:56.520> upwards<00:00:57.239> because<00:00:58.140> not

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
domesticate upwards because not

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.290 
domesticate upwards because not
completely<00:00:59.489> upwards<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.910> little<00:01:00.149> more

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
completely upwards a little more

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.420 
completely upwards a little more
horizontal<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.250> that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
horizontal so we like it's not that

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:14.590 
horizontal so we like it's not that
scary<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.180> much<00:01:03.329> easier<00:01:03.780> watch

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.440 

okay<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.170> now<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.590> actual<00:01:16.890> gainer<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:18.090> it's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
okay and now the actual gainer it's it's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.300 
okay and now the actual gainer it's it's
all<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.870> it's<00:01:19.350> almost<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> same<00:01:20.070> trick

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
all it's it's almost like the same trick

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
all it's it's almost like the same trick
that<00:01:20.340> we're<00:01:20.670> that's<00:01:21.120> ever<00:01:21.300> did<00:01:21.480> before

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that we're that's ever did before

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
that we're that's ever did before
but<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.530> all<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:23.700> back<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> don't

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
but it's all the way back so you don't

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.150 
but it's all the way back so you don't
follow<00:01:24.690> your<00:01:24.840> foot<00:01:25.050> up<00:01:25.230> to<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> side<00:01:25.710> you
