00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
 Hi everybody, I'm back together after a little snow holiday 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.960
 I know you're all very enthusiastic about Jinx 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.180
 but before I get to it, I wanted to talk about one of the unknown facts about Piltower's cop 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.900
 Caitlyn is the first to perform basic attacks at basic level with 650 basic attack range 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.580
 When Vi and Caitlyn are next to each other, they'll get the best Piltower indicator and they both get 1 extra speed 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.340
 and get 1 extra gold from their partner scores 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.640
 If Vi provokes Caitlyn, he will have a tea cup in his hand 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.780
 If he's in a mirror costume, he'il be able to create and equip 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.420
 Caitlyn will receive an indication of being an irritant and will remain on display until it does damage to Vi or until death. 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.800
 If Caitlyn doesn't kill Vi with the ultimate, Vi will say something special 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.160
 Vi: Good shot candy 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 I didn't cait that cait 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.180
 no yaaa 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.120
 he probably refers to cupcakes he used in Yordle traps and sometimes to cupcake Vi Caitlyn 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:21.460
 If there is Jinx in the opposite team, Caitlyn will buy a counter called Frustrating, and this counter will increase every time it kills or contributes to killing Jinx. 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.020
 and Caitlyn will get 1 gold extra 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.220
 Caitlyn's classic costume reminiscent of Madmoxy from the Borderlands series 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.540
 and the resistance costume can also be inspired by Redalert 3 from Natasha Wolkowa 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.980
 Caitlyn's safari costume is a reference to a computer browser, like other browser costumes, next to the real safari. 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.720
 and this is Apple Safari 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.100
 Caitlyn Volibear, Trundle and Vi 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.340
 Caitlyn is a partner with Rengar, Nidalee and Master. 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:07.220
 pole warrior Caitlyn made in memory of the legendary Finnish sniper who killed more than 500 Russian soldiers in about 3 months in 1930 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:17.620
 Contrary to the known name of Vi Vi has not made this tattoo because the name does not know the real name and since the small tattoo on the face 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.300
 people call him Vi 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.140
 Vi hasn't known since when and why this tattoo is 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.280
 "VI" "VI" is 6 by Roman numerals 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.220
 and flat in the hat and breast of Vi 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.820
 Vi joins the mafia at the age of 6, and part 6 of the American constitution is about criminal proceedings 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.560
 Vi's abilities are disproportionate power and assault and darb are real crimes 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.680
 According to a discount notice, Vi weighs 3.6 tons with gloves 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.860
 but it is so written that it must be rational 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.380
 I really don't think there are 3 ton things in hand. 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.920
 When he first designed Vi, his name was Ruby and he was skating 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.920
 I think it's quite a fun komsept to bring something of this style. 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.260
 Vi thinks that Jinx is a headache and becomes nervous 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.500
 Interesting facts about Caitlyn and Vi 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.000
 Our next videos will be Jinx's story, unknown facts about Jinx and a few surprise videos in random order 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.380
 Thanks for watching and see you in next video 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.660
 happy snow holidays
