like being a paw on them in the post

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.340 
like being a paw on them in the post
I<00:01:17.009> had<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> detect<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.090> determine<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:18.869> like

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
I had to detect like determine like like

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.560 
I had to detect like determine like like
see<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.680> where<00:01:19.920> my<00:01:20.100> defender<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.970> make<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
see like where my defender is and make a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.820 
see like where my defender is and make a
move<00:01:21.720> according<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.350> where<00:01:22.530> they<00:01:22.680> are

move according to like where they are
and<00:01:23.330> I<00:01:24.330> guess<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:24.960> being<00:01:25.830> able<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> analyze

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and I guess like being able to analyze

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.219 
and I guess like being able to analyze
poem<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.090> feel<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.420> read<00:01:27.780> kind<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
different situations and the poem kind

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.370
