00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
actually spend that much money on any of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.840 
actually spend that much money on any of
these<00:00:55.379> original<00:00:55.829> plastics<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.399> cheese<00:00:56.610> and

these original plastics and cheese and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.660 
these original plastics and cheese and
actually<00:00:57.629> these<00:00:58.440> are<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.829> original<00:00:59.010> plastics

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
actually these are not original plastics

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.900 
actually these are not original plastics
and<00:00:59.850> cheese<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.210> two<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> most<00:01:01.289> highly

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
and cheese so two of the most highly

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.260 
and cheese so two of the most highly
asked<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.180> cubes<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:05.670> one<00:01:05.850> isn't<00:01:06.000> even

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270

as Angie its impact to goo hyung it's a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.810 
as Angie its impact to goo hyung it's a
goo<00:01:09.330> hyung<00:01:09.510> version<00:01:09.960> 2<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:12.409> it's<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
goo hyung version 2 so it's I have to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
original plastic sanchita not too goo

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.990 
original plastic sanchita not too goo
hyung<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> new<00:01:20.130> plastic<00:01:20.610> sentient

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
hyung and this is a new plastic sentient

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.460 
hyung and this is a new plastic sentient
anybody<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:21.900> knows<00:01:22.049> there's<00:01:22.290> an

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
cheese would be able to tell just by the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.609 
cheese would be able to tell just by the
sound<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:27.619> new

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
sound of this one that it is a new

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.850 
sound of this one that it is a new
plastic<00:01:29.840> sanchi<00:01:30.840> because<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> cliq<00:01:31.560> eNOS

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
plastic sanchi because of the cliq eNOS

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.310 
plastic sanchi because of the cliq eNOS
even<00:01:32.579> though<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.090> better<00:01:33.329> than<00:01:33.420> pretty

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
even though this is better than pretty

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.080 
even though this is better than pretty
much<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.650> my<00:01:34.799> original<00:01:35.220> plastics<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.820> cheese

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
much all my original plastics and cheese

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.450 
much all my original plastics and cheese
it<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.810> new<00:01:37.320> plastic<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.220> actually

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
it is the new plastic and this actually

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.510 
it is the new plastic and this actually
is<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> Ludwig<00:01:39.270> sanchi<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.259> took<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> logo

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
is a Ludwig sanchi but I took the logo

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.010 
is a Ludwig sanchi but I took the logo
off<00:01:41.610> when<00:01:41.790> i<00:01:41.850> restored<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.540> i<00:01:42.659> never<00:01:42.869> got

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
off when i restored it and i never got

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.100 
off when i restored it and i never got
around<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.380> putting<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.710> back<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.869> this<00:01:45.869> is

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
around to putting it back on so this is

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.960 
around to putting it back on so this is
the<00:01:46.259> original<00:01:46.470> plastics<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.340> chi<00:01:47.490> silk<00:01:47.759> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the original plastics in chi silk it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.719 
the original plastics in chi silk it
does<00:01:48.119> pop<00:01:48.360> quite<00:01:48.750> often<00:01:48.990> though<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.729> every

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
does pop quite often though like every

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.880 
does pop quite often though like every
three<00:01:51.000> or<00:01:51.030> four<00:01:51.149> solve<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.380> most<00:01:52.590> highly

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
three or four solve so the most highly

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.649 
three or four solve so the most highly
requested<00:01:53.159> cubes<00:01:53.670> aren't<00:01:54.000> actually<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.630> of

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
requested cubes aren't actually one of

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.959 
requested cubes aren't actually one of
