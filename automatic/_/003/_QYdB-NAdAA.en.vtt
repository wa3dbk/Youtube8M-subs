00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
I'm looking at his his stance I'm a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.859 
I'm looking at his his stance I'm a
looking<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> way<00:01:36.119> he's<00:01:36.299> positioning<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
looking at the way he's positioning the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
looking at the way he's positioning the
ball<00:01:37.049> remember<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.250> an<00:01:38.369> offensive<00:01:38.820> player<00:01:38.880> I

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
ball remember as an offensive player I

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.300 
ball remember as an offensive player I
always<00:01:39.540> said<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.860> protect<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
always said you have to protect the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.580 
always said you have to protect the
basketball<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.150> if<00:01:42.299> he's<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.509> protecting<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
basketball so if he's not protecting the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.249 
basketball so if he's not protecting the
basketball<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:45.329> flick<00:01:45.570> at<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> basketball

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
basketball I can flick at the basketball

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.800 
basketball I can flick at the basketball
so<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.950> look<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.479> now<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.600> he<00:01:48.780> is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so you look for that now if he is
