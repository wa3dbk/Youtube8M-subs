hey what's up everybody just wanted to

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.430 
hey what's up everybody just wanted to
answer<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.389> quick<00:00:03.750> question<00:00:03.810> I've<00:00:04.319> been

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
answer a quick question I've been

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.160 
answer a quick question I've been
getting<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.799> lot<00:00:04.980> of<00:00:05.040> emails<00:00:05.490> about<00:00:06.020> what<00:00:07.020> to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
getting a lot of emails about what to

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.650 
getting a lot of emails about what to
take<00:00:07.350> right<00:00:07.770> before<00:00:08.130> you<00:00:08.220> go<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.460> bed<00:00:08.630> to<00:00:09.630> help

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
take right before you go to bed to help

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.379 
take right before you go to bed to help
stay<00:00:10.139> anabolic<00:00:10.830> throughout<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.940> night<00:00:12.150> and

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
stay anabolic throughout the night and

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.390 
stay anabolic throughout the night and
help<00:00:12.599> build<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:12.929> lean<00:00:13.259> muscle<00:00:13.679> rather<00:00:14.190> than

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
help build that lean muscle rather than

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.160 
help build that lean muscle rather than
moving<00:00:14.670> into<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> catabolic<00:00:15.420> state<00:00:15.630> or<00:00:16.049> you're

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
moving into a catabolic state or you're

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.980 
moving into a catabolic state or you're
actually<00:00:16.289> breaking<00:00:16.710> down<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.369> muscle<00:00:17.990> which

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
actually breaking down the muscle which

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.160 
actually breaking down the muscle which
is<00:00:19.140> going<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.380> obviously<00:00:20.210> hinder<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.750> results

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
is going to obviously hinder the results

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.240 
is going to obviously hinder the results
that<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.619> through<00:00:22.949> your<00:00:23.070> weight

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
that you have through your weight

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.970 
that you have through your weight
training<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> nutshell<00:00:24.810> it's<00:00:25.740> pretty

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
training so in a nutshell it's pretty

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.130 
training so in a nutshell it's pretty
simple<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.580> slow<00:00:27.090> digesting<00:00:27.599> protein<00:00:27.960> is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
simple a slow digesting protein is

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.380 
simple a slow digesting protein is
exactly<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.310> need<00:00:29.670> right<00:00:29.820> before<00:00:30.300> you

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
exactly what you need right before you

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.450 
exactly what you need right before you
go<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.570> bed<00:00:30.630> some<00:00:31.619> people<00:00:31.980> they<00:00:32.009> don't<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.340> to

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
go to bed some people they don't like to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.819 
go to bed some people they don't like to
go<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.759> bed<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> full<00:00:33.600> stomach<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.590> if<00:00:34.739> you

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
go to bed on a full stomach so if you

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.860 
go to bed on a full stomach so if you
eat<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.370> meal<00:00:35.550> right<00:00:35.760> around<00:00:35.910> 30<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.450> 45

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
eat that meal right around 30 to 45

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200 
eat that meal right around 30 to 45
minutes<00:00:37.140> before<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.890> lay<00:00:38.040> down<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.399> bed<00:00:38.610> that

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
minutes before you lay down for bed that

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.299 
minutes before you lay down for bed that
would<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.480> perfect<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.620> no<00:00:40.860> issues

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
would be perfect if you have no issues

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.310 
would be perfect if you have no issues
falling<00:00:41.640> asleep<00:00:42.149> after<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.230> ate

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
falling asleep after you just ate

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
falling asleep after you just ate
something<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:44.250> by<00:00:44.340> all<00:00:44.370> means<00:00:44.579> take<00:00:45.390> your

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
something then by all means take your

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.240 
something then by all means take your
protein<00:00:45.840> source<00:00:46.410> your<00:00:46.590> last<00:00:46.829> meal<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.190> day

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
protein source your last meal of the day

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.520 
protein source your last meal of the day
right<00:00:47.670> before<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:48.120> go<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> sleep<00:00:48.469> now<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
right before you go to sleep now the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.590 
right before you go to sleep now the
ideal<00:00:50.190> thing<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.520> take<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.059> obviously

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
ideal thing to take is obviously

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600 
ideal thing to take is obviously
something<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.770> slow<00:00:53.070> digesting

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
something that's a slow digesting

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.299 
something that's a slow digesting
protein<00:00:53.969> such<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> case<00:00:54.870> nate<00:00:55.199> protein<00:00:55.739> any

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
type of casein protein it's a slow

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.770 
type of casein protein it's a slow
digesting<00:00:59.129> protein<00:00:59.579> much<00:01:00.149> different<00:01:00.660> than

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
digesting protein much different than

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.110 
digesting protein much different than
white<00:01:01.170> protein<00:01:01.739> which<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> fast<00:01:02.850> digesting

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.539 
white protein which is a fast digesting
protein<00:01:03.960> will<00:01:04.530> touch<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
protein will touch on that in just a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.219 
protein will touch on that in just a
second<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.240> back<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> slow

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
second but going back to the slow

second but going back to the slow
digesting<00:01:07.890> casein<00:01:08.310> protein<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
digesting casein protein it's going to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.920 
digesting casein protein it's going to
take<00:01:10.049> around<00:01:10.200> six<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.979> seven<00:01:11.520> hours<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.299> your

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
take around six to seven hours in your

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.410 
take around six to seven hours in your
system<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.500> fully<00:01:13.799> digest<00:01:14.070> which<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.909> perfect

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
system to fully digest which is perfect

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.030 
system to fully digest which is perfect
for<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.810> take<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.200> right<00:01:16.409> before<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.920> go

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
for if you take it right before you go

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.570 
for if you take it right before you go
to<00:01:17.070> bed<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.479> being<00:01:18.540> said<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.740> can

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
to bed now with that being said you can

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.640 
to bed now with that being said you can
basically<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.030> any<00:01:21.420> type<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.869> slow

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
basically have any type of slow

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
basically have any type of slow
digesting<00:01:23.189> protein<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.390> wanted<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> use

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
digesting protein if you wanted to use

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
digesting protein if you wanted to use
the<00:01:25.080> casein<00:01:25.439> protein<00:01:25.860> by<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.130> means<00:01:26.340> go<00:01:26.580> grab

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the casein protein by all means go grab

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.640 
the casein protein by all means go grab

mind eating in terms of that fiber or
fat<00:02:39.090> source<00:02:39.480> by<00:02:39.989> all<00:02:40.230> means<00:02:40.500> go<00:02:40.920> ahead<00:02:41.209> so

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
fat source by all means go ahead so

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.900 
fat source by all means go ahead so
again<00:02:42.569> just<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.049> bring<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.410> down<00:02:43.440> slow

again just to bring it down slow
digesting<00:02:44.910> protein<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.540> definitely<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.650> way

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
digesting protein is definitely the way

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.640 
digesting protein is definitely the way
to<00:02:46.830> go<00:02:47.090> casing<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.239> ideal<00:02:48.630> whether<00:02:49.319> it's<00:02:49.560> a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
to go casing is ideal whether it's a

to go casing is ideal whether it's a
whole<00:02:49.860> food<00:02:50.130> meal<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.940> chicken<00:02:51.269> breast

yogurt the egg whites all that's fine

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.300 
yogurt the egg whites all that's fine
again<00:02:58.049> you<00:02:58.170> can<00:02:58.200> throw<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.709> fat<00:02:58.920> or<00:02:59.069> fiber

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
again you can throw on a fat or fiber

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.699 
again you can throw on a fat or fiber
source<00:02:59.730> if<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.690> wanted<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.140> use<00:03:01.290> some<00:03:01.530> whey

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
protein or that whole food meal just so
