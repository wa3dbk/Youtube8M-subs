Japanese market offering the drawback to
these<00:00:29.189> guitars<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.760> they<00:00:29.910> came<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.859> not<00:00:31.859> such

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
these guitars is they came with not such

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.430 
these guitars is they came with not such
great<00:00:32.279> electronics<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.300> after<00:00:34.200> time

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
great electronics and after time

obviously<00:00:34.710> pots<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.489> really<00:00:35.730> dirty<00:00:35.940> switches

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
obviously pots get really dirty switches

get<00:00:37.820> jammed<00:00:38.820> up<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.059> gunk<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.440> stop

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
get jammed up with gunk and just stop

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
get jammed up with gunk and just stop
functioning<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.399> I've<00:00:42.329> taken<00:00:42.660> everything<00:00:42.989> out

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
functioning so I've taken everything out

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.700 
functioning so I've taken everything out
and<00:00:44.100> I'm<00:00:44.370> going<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> set<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.989> change

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and I'm going to set this up to change

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.610 
and I'm going to set this up to change
over<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> electronics<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.780> I'm<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
over the electronics so I'm going to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.959 
over the electronics so I'm going to
spare<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:49.950> all<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.219> details<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
spare you all the details of the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.420 
spare you all the details of the
soldering<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> stuff<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.280> just

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
soldering and all that stuff and just

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.549 
soldering and all that stuff and just
cut<00:00:54.149> right<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> chase<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.989> show<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.199> how

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
cut right to the chase and show you how

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.639 
cut right to the chase and show you how
I<00:00:56.090> change<00:00:57.090> electronics<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.109> hollow<00:00:58.350> body

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
I change electronics in a hollow body

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.470 
I change electronics in a hollow body
because<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.160> hard<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> access<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.210> holes

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
because it's hard to access the holes

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.360 
because it's hard to access the holes
and<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:01.109> everything<00:01:01.350> put<00:01:01.980> back<00:01:02.190> in

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
and get everything put back in

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.240 
and get everything put back in
efficiently<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.059> take<00:01:03.899> your<00:01:04.379> average<00:01:04.769> piece<00:01:05.040> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
efficiently I take your average piece of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.010 
efficiently I take your average piece of
wire<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.939> any<00:01:08.939> average<00:01:09.180> piece<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.630> copper

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
wire so just any average piece of copper

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.960 
wire so just any average piece of copper
or<00:01:10.229> nickel<00:01:11.030> electronic<00:01:12.030> wire<00:01:12.470> roughly<00:01:13.470> about

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
or nickel electronic wire roughly about

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.620 
or nickel electronic wire roughly about
12<00:01:14.970> inches<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:16.850> I'm<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.150> strip<00:01:18.420> off

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
12 inches of it I'm going to strip off

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.810 
12 inches of it I'm going to strip off
one<00:01:19.470> end

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.480 

you

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:36.230 

twist<00:01:28.270> off<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.590> end<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:30.370> it's<00:01:31.120> clean

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.100 

move<00:01:37.240> your<00:01:37.420> electronics<00:01:37.960> aside<00:01:38.320> here<00:01:39.870> so<00:01:40.870> for

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
move your electronics aside here so for

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.300 
move your electronics aside here so for
instance<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.500> have<00:01:41.530> your<00:01:41.800> switch<00:01:42.070> whole

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
instance you have your switch whole

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.960 
instance you have your switch whole
volumes<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:43.690> tones<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.740> your<00:01:45.370> output<00:01:45.550> check

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
volumes and tones and your output check

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.469 
volumes and tones and your output check
so<00:01:46.120> we'll<00:01:46.270> start<00:01:46.450> with<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.720> output<00:01:47.020> Jack<00:01:47.200> Hoel

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
so we'll start with the output Jack Hoel

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.870 
so we'll start with the output Jack Hoel
once<00:01:49.479> you've<00:01:49.630> got<00:01:49.869> your<00:01:50.050> new<00:01:50.260> output<00:01:51.100> jack<00:01:51.340> all

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
once you've got your new output jack all

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.370 
once you've got your new output jack all
soldered<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:52.570> ready<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.840> go<00:01:53.550> poke<00:01:54.550> this<00:01:54.729> wire

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
soldered and ready to go poke this wire

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:05.100 
soldered and ready to go poke this wire
through<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.619> hole<00:02:00.509> fish<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.720> through<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
through that hole fish it through and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.910 
through that hole fish it through and
you<00:02:05.290> can<00:02:05.440> see<00:02:05.710> through<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.070> F<00:02:06.190> holes<00:02:07.920> where

you can see through the F holes where

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.130 
you can see through the F holes where
the<00:02:09.009> wire<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.250> take<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.270> trusty<00:02:10.720> pair<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:10.989> long

nosed grab your wire and what you'll
want<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.239> do<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.540> toss<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.739> through<00:02:22.590> fit

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
want to do is toss that through fit

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.300 
want to do is toss that through fit
around<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.920> bottom<00:02:25.530> pop<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.800> into<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.160> F
