itself to factory settings right as you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.280 
itself to factory settings right as you
can<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.189> saying<00:01:36.079> erasing<00:01:37.079> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.440 
so basically it is erasing all your data
on<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> device<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:41.159> personal<00:01:41.670> data<00:01:42.030> or<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
on the device the personal data or the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.950 
on the device the personal data or the
any<00:01:42.689> data<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.350> same<00:01:44.869> except<00:01:45.869> that

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
any data you have same except that

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.830 
any data you have same except that
factory<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.009> settings<00:01:47.670> data<00:01:48.060> right

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
factory and settings data right

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.510 
factory and settings data right
basically<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.790> wait<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.540> maybe<00:01:52.530> 1<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.220> 2

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
basically so just wait for maybe 1 to 2

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:20.780 
basically so just wait for maybe 1 to 2
minutes<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.909> process<00:01:57.360> will<00:01:57.540> complete

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.089 

as<00:02:21.299> you<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:21.659> see<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.140> device<00:02:22.439> has<00:02:22.650> rebooted

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
as you can see the device has rebooted

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.280 
as you can see the device has rebooted
again<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.879> hopefully<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.599> device<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:25.079> now

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
again and hopefully the device is now

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.520 
again and hopefully the device is now
factory<00:02:25.829> they<00:02:26.040> say<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:27.209> that's<00:02:27.840> all<00:02:28.140> the
