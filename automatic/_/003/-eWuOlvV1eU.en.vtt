00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
and mix very quickly we don't want the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.100 
and mix very quickly we don't want the
dough<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:12.860> become<00:01:13.340> very<00:01:13.550> warm<00:01:16.810> okay<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:17.869> now

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
dough to become very warm okay so now

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.630 
dough to become very warm okay so now
I'm<00:01:18.200> just<00:01:18.289> gonna<00:01:18.440> add<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.679> little<00:01:18.950> teaspoon<00:01:19.310> of

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
I'm just gonna add a little teaspoon of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.040 
I'm just gonna add a little teaspoon of
cold<00:01:19.880> water<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.360> don't<00:01:20.479> need<00:01:20.660> a<00:01:20.690> lot<00:01:20.899> because

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
cold water you don't need a lot because

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.430 
cold water you don't need a lot because
my<00:01:21.229> dough<00:01:21.289> is<00:01:21.410> pretty<00:01:21.740> easy<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.250> work<00:01:22.340> with<00:01:22.399> and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
my dough is pretty easy to work with and

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.469 
my dough is pretty easy to work with and
we<00:01:24.440> just<00:01:24.470> mix<00:01:24.830> that<00:01:24.890> in<00:01:27.910> okay<00:01:28.910> so<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.330> dough

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
we just mix that in okay so the dough

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.660 
we just mix that in okay so the dough
should<00:01:29.660> look<00:01:29.720> like<00:01:29.869> this<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:30.440> now<00:01:31.009> you<00:01:31.340> put<00:01:31.580> it

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
should look like this and now you put it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.290 
should look like this and now you put it
on<00:01:31.940> a<00:01:32.649> surface<00:01:33.649> with<00:01:34.130> tinfoil<00:01:34.640> or<00:01:34.880> cling<00:01:35.119> film

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
on a surface with tinfoil or cling film

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.199 
on a surface with tinfoil or cling film
which<00:01:35.450> I'm<00:01:35.599> using<00:01:35.810> press<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:36.410> down<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:36.860> just

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
which I'm using press it down and just

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:40.300 
which I'm using press it down and just
close<00:01:38.209> it<00:01:38.509> now<00:01:39.110> this<00:01:39.560> will<00:01:39.709> have<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.009> go<00:01:40.130> in<00:01:40.250> the

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
close it now this will have to go in the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.850 
close it now this will have to go in the
fridge<00:01:40.580> for<00:01:40.880> about<00:01:41.420> half<00:01:41.569> an<00:01:41.959> hour<00:01:42.080> and<00:01:42.440> the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
fridge for about half an hour and the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.199 
fridge for about half an hour and the
reason<00:01:43.130> for<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:43.340> is<00:01:43.520> because<00:01:43.550> it<00:01:43.910> won't<00:01:44.119> be

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
reason for that is because it won't be

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:45.940 
reason for that is because it won't be
much<00:01:44.390> easier<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.869> work<00:01:45.110> with<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.440> dough<00:01:45.619> later

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
much easier to work with the dough later

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.570 
much easier to work with the dough later
on<00:01:46.250> is<00:01:47.090> ready<00:01:47.330> I've<00:01:47.690> put<00:01:48.470> some<00:01:48.649> flour<00:01:49.009> on<00:01:49.280> our
