00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.439
 just cause 3 lets it from the first 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.599
 december really crack 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.910
 that sounds awfully trite 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.310
 in fact, the third part of the just 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.750
 cause row but that convincing to one of the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.720
 best open world games of the last 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.570
 to become years if you want to chaos 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.489
 imagination and destruction has the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:43.260
 reasons for this we summarize in this video 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:45.260
 together just cause 3 tells how 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.049
 the predecessors a story around 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.040
 special agent rico rodriguez whose 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:52.049
 However, the starting situation is fitting 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.420
 a beer cap or on one 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:56.879
 caprice rodrigues visits namely the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.920
 insular republic medici the homeland of his 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.940
 mother is under the knout of general 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.580
 the rebels 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.890
 ricoh wants to put an end to this and that 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.380
 it was easy to get there 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.240
 directly remmidemmi just cause 3 should 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.189
 Do not even play first in one 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.260
 tutorial prayer include the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.299
 supposedly just over 1000 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.830
 square kilometer big game world is 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.920
 not opened gradually 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.640
 one should be able to rage directly everywhere and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.000
 while walking in cars and bidding in 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.710
 planes or with the wingsuit 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.170
 is one of the largest mechanical 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.180
 Innovations in just cause 3 and allowed 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.950
 in combination with the hook one 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.680
 move on almost to the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.360
 batman arkham row is reminiscent that is 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.730
 but not that parachute 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.830
 would have been used to hang the jersey 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.930
 namely very and this time even 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.820
 Stable because the wingsuit at the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.150
 the parachute helped 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.950
 made more suitable for combat situations 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.630
 it is much more stable in the air 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.190
 and rico can during the flight 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.200
 use all weapons 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.580
 The paraglider becomes so especially 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200
 a good companion if that 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.260
 Leveldesign fights in the vertical 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.920
 pulls and that should in just cause 3 more often 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.750
 happen 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.310
 the game world should be in the area though 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.050
 that of the predecessor 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.780
 But even more so in the height and 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.550
 deep expanded 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.050
 then, of course, the 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.010
 ask what you are in this game world 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.959
 actually does 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.670
 the answer to that is in advance 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.160
 Promises are conceivably simple 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.930
 you should destroy pretty much everything 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.540
 can and on the most diverse 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.610
 types are the most important tool in just 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.310
 cause 3 are next to weapons or 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.110
 wonderfully crashworthy 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.730
 means of transport ropes weko can 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.440
 not with the enterhaken 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.480
 only to objects or characters 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.130
 attract and this time at the same time 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.010
 shoot but also things together 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.989
 connect and in just cause 3 same 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.510
 with several connecting ropes per 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:51.070
 unholy union between soldiers and 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.830
 gas bottles cars and planes buses 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.760
 and helicopter or anything you guys 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.760
 otherwise it comes to mind 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.830
 it sounds at least a bit absurd 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.170
 and maybe too powerful and that 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.330
 belongs to the design player of just cause 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.860
 3 should let off steam and the game world 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.300
 can simulate without getting involved 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.610
 to feel constrained 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.560
 partly it seems almost as 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.410
 you would just cause 3 with activated 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.150
 developer difference playing the wingsuit 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.090
 is so good that it almost seems like 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.890
 could rico fly c4-explosives must 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.170
 one does not earn one 's got ricoh 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.330
 from home in endless stock in luggage 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.950
 destroyed buildings will be if it is 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.050
 not exactly for the campaign 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.970
 important bases of the general 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.069
 acts in ricoh's absence again 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.200
 built it up just again 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.700
 can simulate 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.310
 keep the player controlled vehicles 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.380
 something more than that of npc drivers 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.239
 and let a good rebel connection 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.310
 weapons and vehicles by pressing a button 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.540
 deliver to the current location 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.400
 especially this revolucer 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.260
 Express Shipping restrict the developers 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.299
 while one and make the strength of 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.880
 orderable goods, for example from 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.200
 campaigns progressively dependent 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.600
 basically, but just cause 3 so 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.370
 chaotic exaggerated and bombastic like 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.620
 it is possible to do too much free rein 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.750
 could hurt the game but also 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.760
 so great the explosions are 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.709
 Incidentally, link to the chain reaction 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.420
 Also let's look quite without 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.100
 cohesion through a gameplay 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.799
 it will be pure chaos sooner or later 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.269
 maybe boring but there are 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.150
 Here is a campaign in the course 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.620
 retro for example, abundant 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.020
 military bases or protz built by 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.760
 general ravello zerdeppert there is 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.560
 a character progressing system over 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.570
 this is the skill of the character 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.630
 let expand because then just yet 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.520
 not almighty in medici rages and it 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.380
 Although there are typical things besides goals 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.210
 and challenges included 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.620
 best lists to try on 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.180
 and can measure 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.160
 At least we are looking forward to a game 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.440
 at best one of the 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.690
 most entertaining openworld gaudÃ­s the 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.000
 last years will be and we will be happy 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.250
 What will happen to just cause 3 as soon as possible 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.240
 the modding community is first in 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.240
 the fingers get just cause 3
