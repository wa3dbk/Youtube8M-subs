00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.910
 beatriz is asking for pizza for a 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.420
 party every pizza comes cut in 12 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.820
 beatriz wants to have some pizza 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.619
 so that each person can eat four 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.289
 pieces and 16 people go to our party. 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.350
 There is a lot of information on this problem. 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.980
 actress buy 7 pizza 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.820
 she buys 7 pit's how many pieces go 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.730
 have left 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.520
 after each person eats four 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.640
 To do this, let's think about 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.590
 How many pieces in total is she going to have there? 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.870
 we'll think while the pieces are going to be 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.329
 consumed in total by 16 people 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.160
 so we find out how many pieces are left 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.980
 first let's think about the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.289
 total amount of pieces of advice 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.260
 to pause the video try to calculate alone 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.610
 she asked for seven pit's how many pieces of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.449
 pizza has in total 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:03.660
 good has seven pizza 7 this is the number of 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:07.320
 pizza number and pizza if the 12 pieces 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.380
 for pizza you multiply by 12 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.950
 to have the total number of pieces 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:23.900
 is the number of pieces per pizza seven 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:26.130
 times 12 is equal to 84 pieces in total 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.079
 84 pieces 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.509
 those are the pieces she has now 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.369
 let's think about how many were consumed 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.640
 by 16 people 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.700
 then 16 people 16 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.060
 this is the number of people number of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.030
 people and this symbol and calls the notation 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:53.360
 of 16 people and each one with the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:56.610
 my four pieces then 16 people 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.049
 times four pieces per person 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:07.110
 the number of pieces per person 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:10.560
 sixteen times 4 is 6464 pieces were 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.569
 consumed by 16 people 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.129
 then the remaining good if av 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.060
 84 and 64 were consumed 84-64 equal to 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.760
 20 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.799
 So we deserve a 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:30.280
 drums now to 20 pieces that will be 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:33.810
 listener pieces left over after all 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.810
