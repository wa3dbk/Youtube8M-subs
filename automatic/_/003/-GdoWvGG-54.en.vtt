00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.770
 finally squares in dimension to goat and 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:07.720
 if I have an analysis in my grain there 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.519
 some problem and here they come that with 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.530
 this video we inaugurate in average nor may 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.849
 horror manga in macabre dimension that 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.349
 means that every Thursday I go to 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.969
 be talking about movies based on 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.380
 animes or sleeves of horror and the tutor 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.060
 Guest May who thinks will be 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.800
 uploading videos every Saturday 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.390
 related to the subject and the last 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.310
 Saturday of this month we will close it with 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.780
 a likes having special so I do not know 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.280
 they will lose it and to start with the 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.780
 right foot let's talk about the 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.820
 adaptation live action of one of my 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.860
 favorite sleeves I'm talking about that 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.230
 sing a sleeve of the editorial of your 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.570
 Once created by yauco spin the manga 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.010
 akron ok a student presents us 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.079
 out one day he meets his old 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.640
 fellow cat when he sang try 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.530
 help a drunk who fell on the tracks 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.239
 of a train tour you will not help alone 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.399
 so they end up dying the two but 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.870
 they have not died or so it seems as 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.550
 they discover that they are trapped in a 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.320
 room with a black ball called 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.000
 guns along with another survivor to 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.380
 from there they must face missions 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.239
 bloody to try 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.070
 recover their lives now the movie is 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.809
 exactly the same covers all the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.119
 first arc of the manga and the first 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.500
 missions up here, well, I'm not going to 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.430
 keep counting because they also do not 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.990
 I want spoiler 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.180
 besides that there is a second movie 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.850
 which also covers what follows 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.290
 so characterization is something very 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.000
 important when it comes to adapting 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.440
 a work of manga but in this case the 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.750
 characters are mostly fine 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.340
 characterized none is terribly 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.840
 bad although there are cases in which yes it 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.729
 They could have tried harder as 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.310
 example spending that is a character in the 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.200
 sleeve that is tall chunky and is a 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.220
 character that really imposes and here in 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.990
 the movie is high and the same goes for 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.940
 kishimoto which in the ink sleeve 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.920
 with a beautiful girl who come back 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.369
 crazy to all the characters since the 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.810
 movie has short hair 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.220
 but still those things do not seem to me 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.140
 too bad in the section of 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.759
 good performances are Japanese 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.410
 obviously they will know how to act in some 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.270
 parts but it's nothing that I can 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.250
 say what is wrong they are acting not 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.560
 for nothing the manga is worldwide 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.119
 known for its high content of ory 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.619
 explicit and my main concern 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.110
 with this movie was it to be a 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.850
 movie of cannes without any word but 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.830
 although it does not reach the ends of the manga 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.050
 the movie has its pretty correct 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.149
 amount of blood and explosions of 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.250
 members plus they rarely 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.940
 digital effects were used 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.400
 that mostly 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.620
 they used prosthetic puppets and for 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.720
 example the costumes actually have 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.820
 lights in them and the digital effects 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.130
 that were used as for example the 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.380
 teleportation were quite 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.750
 well still not so surgically 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.550
 It is lawful as in the sea ​​but it is 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.140
 better than nothing if there is nothing wrong 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.730
 characterization in the performance in the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.830
 effects and in the story what's wrong 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.450
 with this movie, the truth is that 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.280
 the director never uses 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.890
 the blueprints to show something beyond 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.660
 that simply show never try 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.520
 transmit anything with your plans to 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.230
 difference of the sleeve where the planes 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.520
 used by yauco turn were there 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.280
 to make something more rim 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.860
 impressive or failing to do 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.270
 some scenes even more uncomfortable to watch 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.860
 I 'm not going to talk like the 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.080
 development of the characters in the manga 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.330
 It is a beauty but at least give them 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.160
 more background than here here the people 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.080
 dies and the truth is that it matters a little 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.670
 shit but all that just explains 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.440
 how this movie is not so good 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.670
 compared to the manga but when 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.230
 we see that this movie is a 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.460
 adaptation this movie could 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.050
 classify as one of those that 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.490
 we found in the bottom of the video store and 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.260
 that when you see I found it quite 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.910
 interesting even I think it could 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.480
 catch some viewers that never 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.610
 have 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.530
 legal sleeve and you can take them to read 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.360
 so without saying more I'm going to give 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.390
 cannes the adaptation dance action of 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.280
 anime 16.5 a Sunday movie but 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.860
 not that bad if you do not know anything about 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.299
 guns do not approach the anime is terrible 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.430
 It sucks better to take a look 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.930
 this movie and if already this sea of 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.750
 there you hope to find something similar in 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.700
 this movie better re-read the 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.470
