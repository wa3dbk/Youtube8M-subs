00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 friends I have something for you and that 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.599
 let's see the wiko return that 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.059
 motorola moto ii second generation 2015 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.460
 with lte and both we want in the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.800
 benchmark check 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.060
 they say I have similar spex and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.970
 That's why we just want to go 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.880
 compare android 4.4 point 4 against 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 android 5.0 lolly pop we have 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.010
 same processor 2 gb ram against one 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.230
 gigabyte ram but also a higher 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.450
 resolution display at the weko fritsch 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.190
 So I went through all the tests 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.739
 leave and in this video we look 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.140
 look at what the result is 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.780
 I expected relatively similar and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.300
 that's what I also get one 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.190
 could eg the forests moore and their 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.960
 I can of course see results 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.120
 all benchmarks looked at that we 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.309
 download the same version and also 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.079
 use the same version and yes we have 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.370
 So the latest version at all 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.530
 benchmarks and these will be here 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.180
 they really do compare 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.680
 very similar result you can see here 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.439
 but now I want a few more 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.270
 Let go of words and let it be 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.460
 Please be told that benchmarks 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.340
 really have no meaning 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.080
 means a device with a high benchmark 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.060
 Values ​​do not have to be clear either 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.280
 liquid run as a smartphone 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.720
 it can be less high benchmark 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.580
 even be that smartphone with 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.070
 lower human market values ​​liquid 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.659
 runs as the listening benchmarks 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.060
 just a kind of tail comparison 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.229
 there has always been in the last few years 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.790
 more naturalized 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.979
 many people want that because of it 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.450
 synonymous but synonymous this video synonymous 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.770
 The note that you can not go to any 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.720
 case should rely on it 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.000
 that means nothing to the benchmark 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.979
 the performance and that is one 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.590
 really very important note I 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.200
 you will always be happy to give in well 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.689
 We now have all the values in succession 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.460
 You may know what you have seen 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.290
 maybe something learned from it and 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.399
 That's why I'm already done with 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.680
 this video 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.729
 thanks for that 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.729
 take care
