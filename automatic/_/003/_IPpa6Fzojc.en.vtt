00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.600
 Hi, I'm a clear image and fashion consultant 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.130
 today I want us to talk about 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.120
 the body types 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.120
 the silhouettes 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.189
 because it's important to know what kind of 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.439
 body you have what you think is fundamental 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.180
 so that we do not make mistakes so that 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.040
 the garments in the wonderful veins and 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.520
 to be able to show off fashion and 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.000
 trends to our size fashion 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.490
 yields to our feet not the other way around 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.739
 many times you lose security because you do not 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.080
 you know if what you have put you have left 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.200
 well or do not know if there is a purchase 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.660
 successful and you feel insecure I love you 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.590
 teach how to determine what kind of 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.210
 silhouette you have to take advantage of 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.580
 first in this video we are going to determine 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.739
 the silhouettes and characteristics of 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.530
 each of them in the videos 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.000
 next I will give my recommendations 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.030
 for each type of silhouette understood 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.280
 It happens a lot that you get to see magazines or 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.200
 search images on the internet and you want 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.590
 copy looks of women that are 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.960
 completely different from its physiognomy 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.570
 so you have to understand first the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.680
 your body language know where you have 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.600
 the proportion where you have to do it 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.870
 where there is more volume where is missing 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.070
 volume and thus eating the world 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.360
 and if this is also decisive for 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.320
 Regain or conquer your boy 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.680
 to get a good position or a 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.230
 rise everything determine because the body 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.240
 and our corporality speak all the 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.610
 time go hand in hand with what 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.410
 we think about what we have lived with 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.130
 our experiences with our 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:05.770
 personality so very to you there are 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.770
 five types of bodies I started 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.410
 your hourglass silhouette is met 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.410
 with these characteristics 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.440
 If your waist is defined and the shoulders 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.740
 and the hip have the same width of 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.360
 admire I saw you in the mirror and not 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.380
 determine that the silhouette wanted to make 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.050
 but really with objective eyes 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.760
 put in the mirror determine your 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.670
 silhouette 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.740
 This is a very Latin silhouette the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.080
 we found thin or thick but 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.120
 if you follow these characteristics the clock 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.510
 of sand some simple 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.670
 this is a very latin silhouette there are some 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.519
 which they are thinner others are 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.470
 little bit more full or thick but it 's 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.069
 determining the characteristics that you 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.069
 I just gave 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.130
 your silhouette is triangular if it meets 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.000
 these characteristics 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.280
 if your hips are pronounced the shoulders 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.210
 They are more contempt than your hip and 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.340
 you have little chest 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.510
 some also call this type of 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.340
 silhouette but I prefer not to put 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.140
 fruits in this theme 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.140
 and here a good example 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.800
 your silhouette is inverted triangle if 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.280
 meets those characteristics 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.380
 his shoulders are wide at the waist and the 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.680
 chain are symmetrical the arms are 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:07.100
 corpulent the chest is bulky the 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.190
 hip is medium or narrow and your legs 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.230
 They are slightly thin 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.480
 this body type we can also 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.780
 find in women's thin women 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.880
 Thick even the swimmers tend to 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.750
 have this type of body because they are 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.610
 many men develop 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.610
 and here it is clean 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.270
 its rectangular silhouette if it meets 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.970
 these characteristics 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.730
 the shoulders and the chains have the 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.090
 same width and its waist is little 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.699
 definite 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.830
 silhouette may change over time 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.650
 even many women after passing 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.350
 for a pregnancy they say there are more 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.979
 wide waist and become many 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:06.729
 hourglass to silhouette 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:10.169
 rectangular good not all not all 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.169
 this is the team 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.880
 its various zones and meets these 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.880
 characteristics 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:32.430
 your shoulders are round you have volume 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:35.050
 in waist the hips are wide and you 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.569
 belly is prominent 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.849
 to be able to identify it by looking at you 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:42.699
 front you can clearly draw a 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.940
 oval from the shoulders to the 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.940
 knees 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.560
 to clearly identify what 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.020
 kind of silhouette you have is fundamental 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.930
 even as a basic wardrobe that you have 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.259
 a full-body mirror does not go to 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.570
 be that you climb over the toilet to 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.880
 look at everything in a mirror like that 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.590
