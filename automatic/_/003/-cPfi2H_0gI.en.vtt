00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi everyone i'm riccardo of style 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.879
 apple.it and this is my review 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:15.990
 of the ipad air 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:18.090
 let's start let's take a look 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.250
 fast to the hardware features of the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.740
 new ipad for the first time comes 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.500
 also used on ipad a processor a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.170
 64 bit and we're talking about the processor 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.550
 to 7 of apple the same that we find on 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.380
 iphone 5s 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.870
 accompanied by the co processor of 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.550
 m7 movement since you have it 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.230
 asked many would like to explain 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.690
 quickly what is the co 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.660
 m7 processor the talk is a lot 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.850
 simple m7 processes in real time i 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 gyroscope accelerometer data e 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.320
 of the compass giving the possibility to 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.329
 Applications that use these sensors 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.010
 have an immediate and al answer 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.590
 same time lightens the work of the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.329
 main processor 7 then its 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.910
 presence affects in a positive way 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.100
 on the performance and duration of 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.320
 battery of our ipad 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.939
 talking about ipad air e 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.390
 supports the 802.11n dual band wifi the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:16.979
 bluetooth 4.0 and more wifi model 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:22.110
 cell we have umts hsph connectivity 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.700
 spa plus dual carrier hsdp allt e for le 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.979
 city ​​where this technology is already 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.619
 display available 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.659
 obviously it's a 9.7 screen retina 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:38.340
 inches with 2048 x 1536 resolution e 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.140
 with 264 ppi it would technically seem 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.000
 same as the display of previous models 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.189
 but I can assure you that there is a net 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.680
 improvement in color rendering and 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.210
 brightness is slightly higher then 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.090
 also the quality of the display is 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.009
 decidedly increased as far as 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.960
 this concerns the photographic sector 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.630
 ipad equipped with two cameras 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.930
 frontally we have a 1.2 chamber 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.250
 megapixel that records video at 720p and has 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.259
 an optimal quality for the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.320
 video calls instead on the back side 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.840
 we have a 5 megapixel camera that 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.100
 record video at 1080p and take photos 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.110
 really valid under conditions 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.360
 a brightness in a few seconds 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.970
 you will see a couple of video examples 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.970
 register directly with ipad air 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.159
 also as regards the audio the 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.989
 new ipad has improved 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.970
 we have stereo speakers that have a 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.939
 quite high volume and a clean sound 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.370
 and then a double microphone with 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.079
 reduction of background noise that it is 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.060
 very useful especially when we use 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.680
 the iPad to make video calls 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.079
 as we saw in the video 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.790
 of unboxing the iPad the year for how much 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.220
 regards the design is perfectly 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.200
 identical to the ipad mini and compared to the 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.060
 previous generations we are facing 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.489
 a quite lightened ipad e 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.459
 certainly less cumbersome 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.909
 precise dimensions are 16.9 mm of 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.780
 width x 24 cm in height with one 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:35.200
 just 75 mm thick all in one 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.970
 weight that is around 470 grams 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.739
 after about a month of use I can 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.139
 tell you that the weight difference is felt 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.269
 so much and I found ipad air 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.129
 extremely more manageable than the 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.780
 previous models 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.480
 now let's talk a little bit about the software 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.510
 of ipad air ios 7 that it was 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.579
 optimized for 64-bit and managed 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.069
 to perfection from the 7 processor 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.049
 during everyday use I never have 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.299
 noticed any kind of jamming and 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.379
 all the classic operations like the 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.659
 web browsing 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.540
 the management of the email reproduction of 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.840
 videos and movies are always performed with 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.879
 the typical fluidity of apple devices 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.290
 obviously ipad air is at its best 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.150
 when we go to squeeze the 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.340
 processor potentiality 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.650
 more complex operations such as 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.139
 a video montage with imovie or with 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.289
 3d video games with elaborate graphics 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.510
 such as asphalt imovie 8 in the video in full 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.130
 hd at 1080p are handled 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.990
 quietly with performance 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.090
 comparable to those of a macbook 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.669
 recent and in motor racing 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.409
 of asphalt the graphics the effects to 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.300
 fluidity of play are quietly 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:43.300
 comparable to those of a console 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.909
 like the ps3 or the xbox 360 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.220
 the battery with average use arrives 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.690
 easily at 10 hours declared by 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.550
 apple and this is something that is me 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.560
 always loved the ipad 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.270
 all these things make the experience 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.890
 very use indeed 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.840
 pleasant and this time I can 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.240
 confirm that apple has kept the 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.250
 promise made by giving us a lot of ipads 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.990
 more portable and manageable e 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.910
 same time much more powerful and faster 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.130
 compared to previous models 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.350
 reminds me a little bit of the difference 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.160
 was there when we switched from ipad 1 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.440
 all ipad 2 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.730
 concluding my review I can 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.890
 tell you that I remained fully 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.170
 satisfied by ipad air below 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.150
 practically every point of view and me 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.950
 really like the fact that apple gives the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.990
 possibility for those who buy a new ipad 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.460
 to download many for free 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.460
 applications that were previously paid 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.530
 like new or pages and I'm sure that 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.600
 many people who will buy ipad air 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.340
 they will have a tablet for use 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.590
 basic will be able to replace 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.910
 almost totally a real computer e 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.230
 own 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.700
 so i feel comfortable in the 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.030
 advise you on the purchase of this 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.980
 product this review ends here and 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.410
 now I'm very curious to know that 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.300
 what do you think of ipad air you have it 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.940
 already bought you are going to 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.950
 buy it anyway you like it 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.690
 let me know below in the comments and 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.700
