00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
text input on the Apple iPad because you

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.429 
text input on the Apple iPad because you
have<00:00:22.140> several<00:00:22.439> different<00:00:22.590> choices<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> when

have several different choices so when

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.859

you open up notes you have your standard

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.050 
you open up notes you have your standard
vertical<00:00:28.109> keyboard<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.760> actually

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
vertical keyboard and it's actually

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.870 
vertical keyboard and it's actually
fairly<00:00:30.510> well<00:00:30.840> sized<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.219> let's<00:00:32.399> say<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> wanted

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
fairly well sized so let's say I wanted

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:47.810 
fairly well sized so let's say I wanted
to<00:00:32.940> type<00:00:33.210> hello<00:00:33.510> world<00:00:46.370> that's<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.430> pretty<00:00:47.610> good

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
to type hello world that's a pretty good

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.220 
to type hello world that's a pretty good
job<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.210> course<00:00:48.480> I'm<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.690> an<00:00:48.780> awkward<00:00:48.960> angle

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
job of course I'm at an awkward angle

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.080 
job of course I'm at an awkward angle
because<00:00:49.620> I'm<00:00:49.710> leaning<00:00:49.920> over<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.190> camera<00:00:50.579> but

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
because I'm leaning over a camera but

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.639 
because I'm leaning over a camera but
vertical<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.719> not<00:00:52.140> bad

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
vertical is not bad

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.010 
vertical is not bad
however<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.730> think<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.149> better<00:00:54.300> keyboard<00:00:54.840> is

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
however I think the better keyboard is

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.580 
however I think the better keyboard is
the<00:00:55.170> widescreen<00:00:55.590> keyboard<00:00:56.719> so<00:00:57.719> when<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.500> go

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the widescreen keyboard so when you go

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.889 
the widescreen keyboard so when you go
into<00:00:58.739> widescreen<00:00:59.100> mode<00:00:59.430> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.510> always<00:01:00.750> hide

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
into widescreen mode you can always hide

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.270 
into widescreen mode you can always hide
the<00:01:01.020> keyboard<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.500> your<00:01:01.739> other<00:01:01.920> notes

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the keyboard you have your other notes

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.090 
the keyboard you have your other notes
here<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.329> also<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.840> your<00:01:04.830> current

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
here and then you also have your current

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.789 
here and then you also have your current
note<00:01:05.369> here<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.510> I'm<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.380> similar

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
note here so I'm going to do a similar

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:17.350 
note here so I'm going to do a similar
thing

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.120 

and<00:01:18.020> I'm<00:01:18.260> just<00:01:18.410> doing<00:01:18.530> this<00:01:18.680> with<00:01:18.860> thumbs

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
and I'm just doing this with thumbs

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.780 
and I'm just doing this with thumbs
because<00:01:19.370> it<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.550> at<00:01:19.700> an<00:01:19.820> awkward<00:01:20.090> angle<00:01:20.180> for<00:01:20.510> me

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
because it is at an awkward angle for me

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.400 
because it is at an awkward angle for me
but<00:01:22.790> it's<00:01:23.000> gonna<00:01:23.150> be<00:01:23.300> at<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.420> weird<00:01:23.660> angle<00:01:23.900> but<00:01:24.230> I

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
but it's gonna be at a weird angle but I

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.430 
but it's gonna be at a weird angle but I
can<00:01:24.650> actually<00:01:24.770> almost<00:01:25.130> type<00:01:25.640> correctly<00:01:26.600> just

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
can actually almost type correctly just

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:36.310 
can actually almost type correctly just
like<00:01:27.560> this<00:01:34.210> so<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.330> only<00:01:35.450> thing<00:01:35.660> is<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.990> didn't

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
like this so the only thing is it didn't

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.260 
like this so the only thing is it didn't
register<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.770> second<00:01:37.070> L<00:01:37.190> in<00:01:37.310> hello<00:01:37.610> but<00:01:38.090> I<00:01:38.120> was

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
register the second L in hello but I was

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.910 
register the second L in hello but I was
able<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.510> do<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:38.720> pretty<00:01:39.020> quick<00:01:39.290> with<00:01:39.770> the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
able to do that pretty quick with the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.040 
able to do that pretty quick with the
horizontal<00:01:40.310> keyboard<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:41.630> really<00:01:41.870> think

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
horizontal keyboard so I really think

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.900 
horizontal keyboard so I really think
the<00:01:42.170> horizontal<00:01:42.710> keyboard<00:01:43.040> does<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.550> great<00:01:43.850> job

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
the horizontal keyboard does a great job

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.730 
the horizontal keyboard does a great job
you<00:01:44.420> don't<00:01:44.510> necessarily<00:01:44.720> need<00:01:45.260> an<00:01:45.410> external

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
you don't necessarily need an external

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.390 
you don't necessarily need an external
keyboard<00:01:46.300> with<00:01:47.300> that<00:01:47.450> said<00:01:47.890> with<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.010> iPad

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
keyboard with that said with the iPad

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.640 
keyboard with that said with the iPad
you're<00:01:49.580> able<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:49.970> use<00:01:50.270> an<00:01:50.450> external<00:01:51.080> Bluetooth

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
you're able to use an external Bluetooth

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.590 
you're able to use an external Bluetooth
keyboard<00:01:52.160> so<00:01:52.430> I'm<00:01:52.490> just<00:01:52.580> going<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.760> show<00:01:53.540> you

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
keyboard so I'm just going to show you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.110 
keyboard so I'm just going to show you
how<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.810> connect<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.830> standard<00:01:55.190> Apple<00:01:55.760> keyboard

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
how to connect a standard Apple keyboard

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.890 
how to connect a standard Apple keyboard
but<00:01:56.479> any<00:01:56.630> Bluetooth<00:01:57.020> keyboard<00:01:57.470> will<00:01:57.920> work<00:01:58.900> so

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
but any Bluetooth keyboard will work so

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.850 
but any Bluetooth keyboard will work so
let's<00:02:00.080> just<00:02:00.200> put<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:00.380> like<00:02:00.500> that

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
let's just put it like that

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.980 
let's just put it like that
so<00:02:01.550> this<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.119> over<00:02:02.330> bluetooth<00:02:02.690> so<00:02:02.810> we're<00:02:02.900> going

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
so this is over bluetooth so we're going

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.070 
so this is over bluetooth so we're going
to<00:02:03.050> go<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.260> settings<00:02:03.670> we're<00:02:04.670> going<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:04.850> go<00:02:04.940> to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
to go to settings we're going to go to

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.240 
to go to settings we're going to go to
bluetooth<00:02:06.080> we're<00:02:06.740> going<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.920> turn<00:02:07.040> bluetooth

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
bluetooth we're going to turn bluetooth

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.940 
bluetooth we're going to turn bluetooth
on<00:02:07.550> it'll<00:02:08.149> start<00:02:08.360> scanning<00:02:08.630> for<00:02:08.840> devices<00:02:08.950> just

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
on it'll start scanning for devices just
