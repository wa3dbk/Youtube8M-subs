 creepy fishing I loved fishing with 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.259
 overnight stay 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.900
 but how this one happened to me 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.000
 a case of a friend called visas 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.610
 every sunday went to the forest on 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.130
 fishing trip with an overnight stay and then came 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.410
 sunday i got together on saturday 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.279
 in the morning not to rush about the apartment 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.920
 searching for things 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.160
 and then when we come to find out that I forgot 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.390
 something around 30 I drove for denis 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.850
 and we hit the 800 way well and profit 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.340
 started laying out the trees hung 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.380
 dried algae since there when 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.770
 flood starts water level 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.149
 rises and flood the surrounding area 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.820
 changes from our last visit here 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.640
 there was no one except here 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.850
 animals did not sing birds did not run hedgehogs 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.879

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.149

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.809
 fishing catch was very small this 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.660

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.909
 and decided that I would give the cat Goshi we sat down 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.250
 drink beer and drank till night 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.110
 then they poured into the tent at night 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.110
 national car I got up and 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.500
 woke up denis he said that probably 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.509
 cats walk but it didnâ€™t calm me 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.450
 as in the morning and in the afternoon there was not one 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.500
 the cats in my body ran goosebumps and 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.700
 lay down and lay with open eyes but on 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.000
 this is not over 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.970
 the car signaled again when denis 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.729
 out of the tent I heard him scream and 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.369
 so scared that piss crying my 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.159
 to the body of the river and the streams of sweat I lay and wept 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.930
 before losing consciousness i saw 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.810

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.210

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.509
 because I was afraid it was still there when 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.899
