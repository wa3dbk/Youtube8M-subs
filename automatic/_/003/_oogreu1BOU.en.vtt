starting<00:01:15.330> my<00:01:15.509> senior<00:01:15.900> year<00:01:16.049> actually<00:01:16.409> today

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
starting my senior year actually today

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.679

somewhat<00:01:17.549> further<00:01:17.729> ahead<00:01:17.909> than<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.479> my

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
somewhat further ahead than you but my

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
freshman year I think my record might

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.740 
freshman year I think my record might
have<00:01:20.729> been<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.030> something<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.479> nine<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
have been like something like nine and

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.870 
have been like something like nine and
