00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
we have that done you want to come over

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.309 
we have that done you want to come over
to<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.350> attributes<00:01:36.859> tab<00:01:37.189> again<00:01:37.810> click<00:01:38.810> D<00:01:39.170> on

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
to the attributes tab again click D on

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.270 
to the attributes tab again click D on
your<00:01:39.350> keyboard<00:01:40.179> turn<00:01:41.179> the<00:01:41.740> maximum<00:01:42.740> angle<00:01:43.130> to

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
your keyboard turn the maximum angle to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.249 
your keyboard turn the maximum angle to
91<00:01:43.819> and<00:01:44.109> the<00:01:45.109> offset<00:01:45.619> or<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.100> really<00:01:46.429> depends

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
91 and the offset or it really depends

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.690 
91 and the offset or it really depends
so<00:01:48.259> I'm<00:01:48.319> going<00:01:48.499> to<00:01:48.530> put<00:01:48.679> it<00:01:48.799> to<00:01:48.920> one<00:01:49.100> will

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
so I'm going to put it to one will

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.120 
so I'm going to put it to one will
offset<00:01:49.939> means<00:01:50.359> is<00:01:50.569> the<00:01:51.289> higher<00:01:51.469> the<00:01:51.679> offset

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
offset means is the higher the offset

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.389 
offset means is the higher the offset
the<00:01:52.999> bigger<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.810> extrusion<00:01:54.469> will<00:01:54.619> be<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.069> if<00:01:55.280> I

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
the bigger the extrusion will be so if I

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.349 
the bigger the extrusion will be so if I
click<00:01:55.460> apply<00:01:56.049> there<00:01:57.049> we<00:01:57.200> go<00:01:57.380> we<00:01:57.619> have<00:01:58.179> we<00:01:59.179> have

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
click apply there we go we have we have

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.599 
click apply there we go we have we have
it<00:01:59.539> extruded<00:02:00.289> as<00:02:00.499> you<00:02:00.649> can<00:02:00.799> see<00:02:01.009> right<00:02:01.219> there

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
it extruded as you can see right there

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:06.129 
it extruded as you can see right there
let's<00:02:02.479> actually<00:02:02.899> do<00:02:03.380> this<00:02:03.530> bumpy<00:02:03.979> as<00:02:04.159> well<00:02:05.139> so

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:06.139 
let's actually do this bumpy as well so

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:08.499 
let's actually do this bumpy as well so
same<00:02:06.590> principle<00:02:07.130> applies<00:02:07.459> we're<00:02:08.149> just<00:02:08.270> going

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
same principle applies we're just going

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.740 
same principle applies we're just going
to<00:02:08.569> select<00:02:08.750> this<00:02:08.990> click<00:02:09.950> t<00:02:10.420> we're<00:02:11.420> gonna<00:02:11.569> make

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
to select this click t we're gonna make

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.370 
to select this click t we're gonna make
this<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.290> this<00:02:12.470> time<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:13.690> there<00:02:14.690> we<00:02:14.780> go<00:02:14.810> see<00:02:15.230> if

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
this to this time and there we go see if

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.330 
this to this time and there we go see if
we<00:02:15.560> were<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:16.100> do<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.700> render<00:02:17.120> preview<00:02:17.600> of<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:18.340> you

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
we were to do a render preview of it you

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.810 
we were to do a render preview of it you
should<00:02:19.580> have<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.760> nice-looking<00:02:21.010> extrude<00:02:27.820> so

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
should have a nice-looking extrude so

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.240 
should have a nice-looking extrude so
here<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.180> is<00:02:29.530> loaded

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
here it is loaded

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.080 
here it is loaded
so<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.570> actually<00:02:34.020> done<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.740> mistake<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.340> stir<00:02:35.910> it

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
so I actually done a mistake of stir it

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.710 
so I actually done a mistake of stir it
now<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.570> don't<00:02:37.350> fitness<00:02:37.710> bad<00:02:37.920> about<00:02:38.330> be<00:02:39.330> at<00:02:39.510> this

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
now I don't fitness bad about be at this

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
extrude and because this has no weight

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.150 
extrude and because this has no weight
on<00:03:56.280> it<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:56.820> just<00:03:57.000> makes<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.299> even<00:03:57.480> easier<00:03:58.010> so<00:03:59.010> we

actually<00:04:40.240> using<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.900> lightroom<00:04:41.380> when<00:04:41.560> you

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
actually using the lightroom when you

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.440 
actually using the lightroom when you

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.960 
guys don't need to i suggest you do and
yeah<00:04:46.660> let's<00:04:46.990> just<00:04:47.110> get<00:04:47.680> preview<00:04:48.280> on<00:04:48.460> right<00:04:48.640> now

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.000 

so<00:04:51.970> there's<00:04:52.180> our<00:04:52.440> extruded<00:04:53.440> belt<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:53.830> there

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
so there's our extruded belt and there

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.420 
so there's our extruded belt and there
so<00:04:54.310> it's<00:04:54.640> beyond<00:04:55.560> not<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.680> best<00:04:56.860> but<00:04:57.010> you

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
so it's beyond not the best but you

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.220 
so it's beyond not the best but you
could<00:04:57.700> fiddle<00:04:57.850> around<00:04:58.090> with<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.450> settles<00:04:59.050> and

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
could fiddle around with it settles and

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.550 
could fiddle around with it settles and
