connectors you wish to join two pieces
of<00:01:10.439> cable<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.040> see<00:01:11.250> how<00:01:11.369> joins<00:01:11.670> together

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
of cable you can see how joins together

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.380 
of cable you can see how joins together
like<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.710> also<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.369> given<00:01:14.729> an<00:01:14.970> coax

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
like that and also we have given an coax

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.649 
like that and also we have given an coax
connectors<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.970> coax<00:01:17.970> joiners<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
connectors and coax joiners here so and

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.660 
connectors and coax joiners here so and
so<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.960> basic<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.680> basically<00:01:23.310> how<00:01:23.520> it

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
so that the basic and basically how it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.969 
so that the basic and basically how it
be<00:01:23.790> used<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.720> didn't<00:01:24.930> sell<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.170> area<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
be used you didn't sell the area on the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.850 
be used you didn't sell the area on the
roof<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.810> on<00:01:27.810> top<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> pole<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.500> bracket

joint and a neck connector and use this

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139 
joint and a neck connector and use this
cable<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.740> join<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.310> single<00:01:50.700> cable<00:01:50.880> that's

alternatively<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:53.670> you're<00:01:53.790> going<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.090> use

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
alternatively if you're going to use

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.110 
alternatively if you're going to use
something<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.689> this

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
something like this

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.600 
something like this
education<00:01:55.540> system<00:01:55.900> what<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.560> do<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:57.010> you<00:01:57.220> put

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
education system what you do is you put

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.320 
education system what you do is you put
a<00:01:58.000> connector<00:01:58.870> like<00:01:59.740> this<00:01:59.980> on<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.850> end<00:02:01.000> of<00:02:01.210> the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
a connector like this on the end of the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.240 
a connector like this on the end of the
satellite<00:02:01.690> cable<00:02:01.930> coming<00:02:02.410> in<00:02:02.560> from<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.980> area

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
satellite cable coming in from the area

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.690 
satellite cable coming in from the area
and<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.730> can<00:02:04.000> feed<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.450> into<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:05.700> distribution

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
and you can feed it into a distribution

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.969 
and you can feed it into a distribution
system<00:02:06.880> like<00:02:07.270> this<00:02:07.510> so<00:02:07.960> we<00:02:08.080> feed<00:02:08.350> in<00:02:08.500> here<00:02:08.830> and

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
system like this so we feed in here and

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.090 
system like this so we feed in here and
then<00:02:09.369> all<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.790> various<00:02:10.150> and<00:02:10.590> rooms<00:02:11.590> would<00:02:11.950> all

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
then all the various and rooms would all

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.800 
then all the various and rooms would all
feed<00:02:12.400> off<00:02:12.550> seeing<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.910> distribution<00:02:13.180> and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
feed off seeing the distribution and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.660 
feed off seeing the distribution and
that's<00:02:14.470> why<00:02:14.710> we<00:02:14.860> would<00:02:14.980> say<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:15.280> have<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.430> large

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
that's why we would say we have a large

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.700 
that's why we would say we have a large
