let's get to this video so making a stop
action<00:00:16.440> video<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.640> time<00:00:17.910> consuming<00:00:17.940> if

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
action video is very time consuming if

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.480 
action video is very time consuming if
um<00:00:20.310> if<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:21.390> like<00:00:21.539> your<00:00:21.689> first<00:00:21.810> time<00:00:22.050> doing<00:00:22.080> it

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
um if it's like your first time doing it

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.609 
um if it's like your first time doing it
actually<00:00:23.490> anytime<00:00:23.730> really<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.080> better

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
actually anytime really but the better

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.730 
actually anytime really but the better
you<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.010> at<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.550> takes<00:00:26.939> less<00:00:27.269> time<00:00:27.529> but<00:00:28.529> it

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
you get at it it takes less time but it

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.060 
you get at it it takes less time but it
still<00:00:29.220> takes<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.609> lot<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.760> time<00:00:29.910> no<00:00:30.090> matter<00:00:30.179> what

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
still takes a lot of time no matter what

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.350 
still takes a lot of time no matter what

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
move it again and make sure you only

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.859 
move it again and make sure you only
move<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:30.750> object<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.970> little<00:01:32.970> tiny<00:01:33.420> bit<00:01:33.570> each

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
move the object a little tiny bit each

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.440 
move the object a little tiny bit each
time<00:01:34.250> otherwise<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.610> video<00:01:35.880> will<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.210> very

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
time otherwise your video will be very

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.870 
time otherwise your video will be very
choppy<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.680> hard<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.100> understand<00:01:38.610> if

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
choppy and really hard to understand if

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.510 
choppy and really hard to understand if
you<00:01:39.750> don't<00:01:39.990> want<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.259> move<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.159> much

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
you don't want to move it like that much

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.700 
you don't want to move it like that much
each<00:01:41.759> time<00:01:42.030> otherwise<00:01:42.360> it'll<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.780> G<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
each time otherwise it'll be like G and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.960 
each time otherwise it'll be like G and
um<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:45.060> really<00:01:45.259> confusing<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:47.250> watch<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
um that's really confusing to watch and

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.969 
um that's really confusing to watch and
we<00:01:48.149> don't<00:01:48.299> really<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.509> watching<00:01:48.979> videos

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
we don't really like watching videos

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.340 
we don't really like watching videos
like<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.780> because<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.930> don't<00:01:52.079> really<00:01:52.170> get

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
like that because we don't really get

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.499 
like that because we don't really get
what's<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> good<00:01:54.270> video

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509

picture<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.909> probably<00:02:00.149> get<00:02:00.390> that

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
picture and you probably get that

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.590 
picture and you probably get that
already<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.549> other<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.180> other<00:02:03.329> thing<00:02:03.570> is

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
already so the other the other thing is

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.200 
already so the other the other thing is
make<00:02:03.840> sure<00:02:03.869> your<00:02:04.170> camera<00:02:04.530> doesn't<00:02:04.860> move<00:02:05.210> that

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
make sure your camera doesn't move that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.350 
make sure your camera doesn't move that
much<00:02:06.450> because<00:02:07.439> then<00:02:07.920> you'll<00:02:08.190> because<00:02:08.940> you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
much because then you'll because you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.059 
much because then you'll because you
when<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.780> put<00:02:09.989> them<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> editing

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
when you put them on to the editing

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.930 
when you put them on to the editing
software

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
software

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.640 
software
there<00:02:13.060> they<00:02:13.540> all<00:02:13.660> go<00:02:13.840> together<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.380> if<00:02:14.500> like

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
there they all go together and if like

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.200 
there they all go together and if like
your<00:02:14.800> cameras<00:02:15.100> over<00:02:15.280> here<00:02:15.490> at<00:02:15.610> one<00:02:15.730> point<00:02:15.880> over

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
your cameras over here at one point over

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.610 
your cameras over here at one point over
here<00:02:16.240> another<00:02:16.660> point<00:02:16.960> they'll<00:02:17.230> just<00:02:17.440> be<00:02:17.590> like

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
here another point they'll just be like

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.260 
here another point they'll just be like
and<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.130> goes<00:02:18.280> super<00:02:18.640> fast<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:18.940> it'll<00:02:19.090> just<00:02:19.120> be

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
and it goes super fast so it'll just be

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.570 
and it goes super fast so it'll just be
like<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.570> so<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.650> won't<00:02:21.100> be<00:02:21.220> able<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.430> tell

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
like that so you won't be able to tell

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.380 
like that so you won't be able to tell
what's<00:02:21.760> going<00:02:21.850> on<00:02:22.120> at<00:02:22.360> all<00:02:22.980> um<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:25.180> we<00:02:25.240> don't

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
what's going on at all um so we don't

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.080 
what's going on at all um so we don't
really<00:02:25.480> like<00:02:25.690> those<00:02:25.840> videos<00:02:26.170> either<00:02:26.320> um<00:02:27.090> but

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
really like those videos either um but

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.480 
really like those videos either um but
if<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.240> don't<00:02:28.390> have<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.540> tripod<00:02:28.770> but<00:02:29.770> if<00:02:29.980> you

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
if you don't have a tripod but if you

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.950 
if you don't have a tripod but if you
can<00:02:30.700> definitely<00:02:31.060> get<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.360> tripod<00:02:31.720> they're

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960

really<00:02:32.290> really<00:02:32.410> nice<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.850> use<00:02:34.030> like

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
really really nice you can use like

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.200 
really really nice you can use like
boxes<00:02:34.990> or<00:02:35.500> any<00:02:35.830> kind<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.310> flat<00:02:36.580> surface<00:02:37.060> that

boxes or any kind of flat surface that
does<00:02:37.390> not<00:02:37.570> move<00:02:38.190> but<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.430> tripod<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.180> good

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
does not move but a tripod is good

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.980 
does not move but a tripod is good
because<00:02:40.780> when<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.770> um<00:02:42.420> making<00:02:43.420> videos<00:02:43.750> you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
because when you um making videos you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.510 
because when you um making videos you
want<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.260> be<00:02:44.350> able<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.620> like<00:02:44.770> move<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.250> camera

want to be able to like move the camera
in<00:02:45.940> some<00:02:46.930> angle<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:47.560> tripods<00:02:48.250> let<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.520> do

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
in some angle and tripods let you do

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.570 
in some angle and tripods let you do
allow<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.360> but<00:02:50.250> boxes<00:02:51.250> do<00:02:51.430> not

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
allow you to do that but boxes do not

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.040 
allow you to do that but boxes do not
always<00:02:51.820> let<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.150> do<00:02:52.270> that<00:02:52.390> because<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.870> can't

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
always let you do that because you can't

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.570 
always let you do that because you can't
really<00:02:53.170> like<00:02:53.440> move<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.800> box<00:02:53.980> without<00:02:54.160> letting

really like move the box without letting

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.890 
really like move the box without letting
move<00:02:54.880> because<00:02:55.090> then<00:02:55.270> it'll<00:02:55.390> have<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.660> go<00:02:55.750> back

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
move because then it'll have to go back

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.810 
move because then it'll have to go back
and<00:02:55.960> if<00:02:56.740> you<00:02:56.890> keep<00:02:57.010> pushing<00:02:57.190> forward<00:02:57.340> before

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
and if you keep pushing forward before

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.360 
and if you keep pushing forward before
you<00:02:58.000> take<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> picture<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.950> won't<00:02:59.950> get<00:03:00.130> you<00:03:00.190> the

you take a picture it won't get you the
same<00:03:00.490> spot<00:03:00.640> each<00:03:00.910> time<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.950> third<00:03:03.190> thing

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
same spot each time so the third thing

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.030 
same spot each time so the third thing
is<00:03:03.700> make<00:03:04.690> sure<00:03:04.720> before<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.350> take<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.740> picture

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
just keep changing and it'll just be

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.360 
just keep changing and it'll just be
really<00:03:46.930> weird<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.320> confusing<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:48.010> doesn't

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
really weird and confusing it doesn't

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.449 
really weird and confusing it doesn't
look<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.519> good<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:50.200> we<00:03:50.410> normally<00:03:51.040> redo<00:03:51.310> those

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
look that good so we normally redo those

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:52.680 
look that good so we normally redo those
videos<00:03:51.790> even<00:03:52.000> though<00:03:52.150> it's<00:03:52.239> really<00:03:52.420> annoying

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
videos even though it's really annoying

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.100 
videos even though it's really annoying
so<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:52.989> have<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.560> good<00:03:53.920> video<00:03:54.750> just<00:03:55.750> make<00:03:56.080> sure

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
so to have a good video just make sure

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:04.259 
so to have a good video just make sure
you<00:03:57.360> have<00:03:58.360> a<00:03:58.390> good<00:03:58.450> lighting<00:03:58.840> um<00:04:03.000> let's<00:04:04.000> see

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
you have a good lighting um let's see

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.530 
you have a good lighting um let's see
what<00:04:04.570> else<00:04:04.600> is<00:04:05.019> there<00:04:05.380> um

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.550 

well<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:10.569> can't<00:04:10.870> really<00:04:10.930> think<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.349> anything

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
well I can't really think of anything

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.809 
well I can't really think of anything
else<00:04:11.739> because<00:04:11.920> those<00:04:12.189> are<00:04:12.340> pretty<00:04:12.430> much<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
else because those are pretty much the

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.550 
else because those are pretty much the
only<00:04:12.849> steps<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:13.569> need<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.780> making<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.319> stop
