we wanted to use this Japanese
metalworking<00:00:19.560> technique<00:00:20.039> mocha<00:00:20.340> meghana

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
metalworking technique mocha meghana

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.040 
metalworking technique mocha meghana
where<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.000> take<00:00:21.180> different<00:00:21.539> layers<00:00:21.689> of

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
where you take different layers of

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.929 
where you take different layers of
different<00:00:22.230> colors<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.710> metal<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.519> sandwich

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
different colors of metal you sandwich

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.640 
different colors of metal you sandwich
them<00:00:24.090> together<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.840> beat<00:00:25.080> them<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.500> then

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
them together you beat them and then

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.890 
them together you beat them and then
when<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.949> when<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.580> sand<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.970> flat<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.689> get<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
when you when you sand it flat you get a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.150 
when you when you sand it flat you get a
woodgrain<00:00:28.170> effect<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.830> two<00:00:28.920> different

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
woodgrain effect in the two different

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.380 
woodgrain effect in the two different
colors<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.369> metal<00:00:29.670> oh<00:00:29.760> why<00:00:29.910> not<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.269> with

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
colors of metal oh why not do it with

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.049 
colors of metal oh why not do it with
meat<00:00:30.990> fish<00:00:31.439> yeah<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.520> decided<00:00:32.850> on

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
meat fish yeah so we decided on

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.229 
meat fish yeah so we decided on
yellowtail<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.809> lamb<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.940> when<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.059> did<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
yellowtail and lamb and when we did a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.229 
yellowtail and lamb and when we did a
test<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:37.440> turned<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.190> much<00:00:38.550> better<00:00:38.610> than<00:00:38.969> we

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
test it turned out much better than we

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.479 
test it turned out much better than we
even<00:00:39.270> expected<00:00:39.809> yeah<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.160> I'm<00:00:41.219> going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.370> show

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
even expected yeah so I'm going to show

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.190 
even expected yeah so I'm going to show
you<00:00:41.550> how<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> make<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> mold<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.840> don't<00:00:42.989> want

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you how to make the mold you don't want

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.110 
you how to make the mold you don't want
to<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.440> too<00:00:43.620> regular<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.309> turns<00:00:44.489> out<00:00:44.670> potatoes

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
to be too regular it turns out potatoes

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.619 
to be too regular it turns out potatoes
are<00:00:45.300> extremely<00:00:45.719> cheap<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.260> also<00:00:47.100> irregular

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
are extremely cheap and also irregular

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.389 
are extremely cheap and also irregular
so<00:00:48.629> we're<00:00:48.930> using<00:00:49.110> potatoes<00:00:49.649> as<00:00:49.800> our<00:00:49.950> mold<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
so we're using potatoes as our mold and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.700 
so we're using potatoes as our mold and
then<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.000> bought<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.570> acrylic<00:00:52.110> from<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
then I bought just acrylic from the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.279 
then I bought just acrylic from the
plastic<00:00:53.129> supply<00:00:53.430> down<00:00:53.489> downtown<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.930> cut<00:00:55.140> them

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
out put them into an oven at like 325

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.729 
out put them into an oven at like 325
degrees<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> little<00:00:58.379> hot<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.710> careful
