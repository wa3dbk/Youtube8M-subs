00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
for example the camera has been

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.910 
for example the camera has been
optimized<00:03:43.800> to<00:03:44.160> use<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.670> image<00:03:45.480> chip<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.710> that

optimized to use a image chip so that

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.810 
optimized to use a image chip so that
the<00:03:47.280> sensor<00:03:48.590> feeds<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.710> same<00:03:49.950> data<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.490> OS

the sensor feeds the same data to the OS
the<00:03:51.030> only<00:03:51.210> difference<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:52.020> quality<00:03:52.380> will<00:03:52.770> be

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
the only difference in quality will be

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.720 
the only difference in quality will be
in<00:03:53.160> post-processing<00:03:54.050> from<00:03:55.050> what<00:03:55.230> I've<00:03:55.350> seen

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
in post-processing from what I've seen

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.560 
in post-processing from what I've seen
the<00:03:56.730> sense<00:03:58.940> post-processing<00:03:59.940> is<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.210> little

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
the sense post-processing is a little

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.530 
the sense post-processing is a little
bit<00:04:00.690> better<00:04:00.900> than<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.040> AOSP<00:04:02.460> or<00:04:02.940> Google

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
bit better than the AOSP or Google

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.420 
bit better than the AOSP or Google
Edition<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.320> as<00:04:04.620> you<00:04:04.710> can<00:04:04.830> see<00:04:04.890> it's<00:04:05.190> slightly

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
Edition and as you can see it's slightly

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.800 
Edition and as you can see it's slightly
different<00:04:05.970> camera<00:04:06.600> -<00:04:08.210> normally<00:04:09.210> this<00:04:09.600> would

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
different camera - normally this would

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.390 
different camera - normally this would
be<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.960> sphere<00:04:11.930> there'd<00:04:12.930> be<00:04:13.140> five<00:04:13.680> points<00:04:14.250> for

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.460 

you<00:04:33.030> get<00:04:33.180> more<00:04:33.360> options<00:04:33.780> instead<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.170> a<00:04:34.260> menu

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470
