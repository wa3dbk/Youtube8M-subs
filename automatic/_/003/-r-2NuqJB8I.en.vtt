00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
top of the bar you continue just like

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.380 
top of the bar you continue just like
you<00:01:26.180> were<00:01:26.360> before<00:01:27.550> overlapping<00:01:28.550> only<00:01:29.120> about

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
you were before overlapping only about

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.649 
you were before overlapping only about
half<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:29.900> width<00:01:30.380> of<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.650> tape<00:01:31.030> just<00:01:32.030> continue

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
half the width of the tape just continue

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.880 
half the width of the tape just continue
in<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:32.810> manner<00:01:33.260> all<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.920> way<00:01:34.100> down<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.270> bar

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
in that manner all the way down the bar

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.149 
in that manner all the way down the bar
until<00:01:36.890> you're<00:01:37.250> at<00:01:37.610> your<00:01:37.940> stopping<00:01:38.270> place<00:01:39.159> it's

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
until you're at your stopping place it's

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.340 
until you're at your stopping place it's
a<00:01:40.220> good<00:01:40.400> idea<00:01:40.550> to<00:01:40.729> have<00:01:41.030> your<00:01:41.330> adhesive<00:01:42.080> tape

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
a good idea to have your adhesive tape

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.200 
a good idea to have your adhesive tape
ready<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.130> when<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.370> get<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.580> this<00:01:43.760> point<00:01:44.000> you

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
ready so when you get to this point you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.600 
ready so when you get to this point you
can<00:01:44.390> just<00:01:44.420> pick<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:45.320> up<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.740> usually<00:01:45.950> stick<00:01:46.430> it

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
can just pick it up I usually stick it

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.250 
can just pick it up I usually stick it
to<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.850> other<00:01:47.000> side<00:01:47.300> of<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.570> bar<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.110> it's

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
to the other side of the bar so it's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.460 
to the other side of the bar so it's
ready<00:01:48.670> take<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.700> pair<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.060> scissors<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.870> cut

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470
