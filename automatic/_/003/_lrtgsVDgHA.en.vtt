matches this is going to be gets hungry

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.089 
matches this is going to be gets hungry
Umbreon<00:00:29.509> so<00:00:29.750> let's<00:00:29.960> go<00:00:30.110> ahead<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:30.410> get<00:00:30.919> into

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
Umbreon so let's go ahead and get into

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.319 
Umbreon so let's go ahead and get into
this<00:00:31.250> he's<00:00:31.430> going<00:00:31.579> to<00:00:31.669> lead<00:00:31.790> off<00:00:31.939> with<00:00:32.149> his

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
this he's going to lead off with his

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.030 
this he's going to lead off with his
yanmega<00:00:32.720> and<00:00:33.050> of<00:00:33.410> course<00:00:33.620> it's<00:00:33.770> going<00:00:33.890> to<00:00:33.950> be<00:00:34.010> a

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
yanmega and of course it's going to be a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.680 
yanmega and of course it's going to be a
speed<00:00:34.399> boost<00:00:34.640> variant<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:35.270> I'm<00:00:35.390> gonna<00:00:35.540> lead

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
speed boost variant so I'm gonna lead

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.630 
speed boost variant so I'm gonna lead
off<00:00:35.809> with<00:00:35.989> my<00:00:36.110> tres<00:00:36.440> porygon<00:00:36.890> with<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.399> evo

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
off with my tres porygon with the evo

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.610 
off with my tres porygon with the evo
aight<00:00:37.820> of<00:00:37.850> course<00:00:37.969> does<00:00:38.780> trace<00:00:39.110> his<00:00:39.290> speed

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
aight of course does trace his speed

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.049 
aight of course does trace his speed
boost<00:00:39.829> and<00:00:40.340> he's<00:00:40.489> going<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:40.700> go<00:00:40.760> ahead<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:41.000> hit

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
boost and he's going to go ahead and hit

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.700 
boost and he's going to go ahead and hit
me<00:00:41.180> with<00:00:41.270> air<00:00:41.450> /<00:00:41.719> I'm<00:00:41.960> gonna<00:00:42.079> go<00:00:42.170> for<00:00:42.440> that<00:00:42.469> ice

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
me with air / I'm gonna go for that ice

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.229 
me with air / I'm gonna go for that ice
beam<00:00:42.980> but<00:00:43.190> then<00:00:43.309> I<00:00:43.399> flinched<00:00:43.670> and<00:00:43.910> I'm<00:00:44.030> like

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
beam but then I flinched and I'm like

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.110 
beam but then I flinched and I'm like
damn<00:00:44.480> it<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.320> this<00:00:46.250> was<00:00:46.460> just<00:00:46.670> going<00:00:46.790> to<00:00:46.850> happen

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
damn it so this was just going to happen

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.000 
damn it so this was just going to happen
this<00:00:47.210> whole<00:00:47.390> time<00:00:47.570> because<00:00:47.750> I'm<00:00:48.080> easily<00:00:48.890> keep

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
this whole time because I'm easily keep

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.590 
this whole time because I'm easily keep
flinching<00:00:49.550> me<00:00:49.700> while<00:00:49.910> I'm<00:00:50.000> trying<00:00:50.240> to<00:00:50.270> attack

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
flinching me while I'm trying to attack

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.210 
flinching me while I'm trying to attack
but<00:00:50.840> this<00:00:50.960> time<00:00:51.080> I<00:00:51.170> decided<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.620> go<00:00:51.680> toxic

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
but this time I decided to go toxic

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.620 
but this time I decided to go toxic
because<00:00:52.340> I<00:00:52.460> think<00:00:52.670> he<00:00:52.910> probably<00:00:53.120> does<00:00:53.480> have

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
because I think he probably does have

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.720 
because I think he probably does have
the<00:00:53.750> focus<00:00:54.110> after<00:00:54.290> that<00:00:54.590> we'll<00:00:54.800> probably<00:00:55.010> you

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
the focus after that we'll probably you

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.480 
the focus after that we'll probably you
know<00:00:55.960> break<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:57.440> I'm<00:00:57.980> gonna<00:00:58.190> go<00:00:58.460> ahead

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
know break it so I'm gonna go ahead

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.920 
know break it so I'm gonna go ahead
we're<00:00:58.970> both<00:00:59.090> getting<00:00:59.210> our<00:00:59.390> speed<00:00:59.600> boost<00:00:59.810> not

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
we're both getting our speed boost not

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.330 
we're both getting our speed boost not
like<00:01:00.050> he's<00:01:00.200> gonna<00:01:00.290> go<00:01:00.410> for<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.620> bug<00:01:00.829> bus<00:01:01.070> cuz

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
like he's gonna go for the bug bus cuz

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.100 
like he's gonna go for the bug bus cuz
stabbing<00:01:01.730> all<00:01:01.820> that<00:01:02.000> but<00:01:02.270> um<00:01:02.480> I'm<00:01:02.870> just<00:01:02.960> gonna

here I'm oh go ahead and try and go for
another<00:01:10.640> ice<00:01:11.299> beam<00:01:11.659> but<00:01:12.140> it<00:01:12.259> seems<00:01:12.470> like<00:01:12.619> every

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
another ice beam but it seems like every

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.350 
another ice beam but it seems like every
time<00:01:12.829> I<00:01:12.950> tried<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.369> attack<00:01:13.670> him<00:01:13.909> I<00:01:14.119> always

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.210 
time I tried to attack him I always
flinch<00:01:14.810> so<00:01:15.380> whenever<00:01:15.619> I<00:01:15.770> try<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:15.920> go<00:01:16.100> for

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
flinch so whenever I try to go for

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.010 
flinch so whenever I try to go for
recovers<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:17.000> know<00:01:17.149> I'm<00:01:17.360> fine<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:17.990> don't

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
recovers you know I'm fine and I don't

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.840 
recovers you know I'm fine and I don't
flinch<00:01:18.439> to<00:01:18.530> just<00:01:18.679> keep<00:01:18.770> recovering<00:01:19.310> off<00:01:19.490> so

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
flinch to just keep recovering off so

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.029 
flinch to just keep recovering off so
that's<00:01:20.389> it's<00:01:20.780> just<00:01:21.079> kind<00:01:21.259> of<00:01:21.319> me<00:01:21.469> just<00:01:21.740> toxic

selling<00:01:22.549> him<00:01:22.700> with<00:01:22.880> my<00:01:23.060> porygon<00:01:23.389> while<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:23.810> keep

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:24.109 
selling him with my porygon while I keep

selling him with my porygon while I keep
getting<00:01:24.319> me<00:01:24.799> no<00:01:24.920> speed<00:01:25.280> boost<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.700> whole<00:01:25.880> time

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
getting me no speed boost the whole time

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.330 
getting me no speed boost the whole time
so<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.600> know<00:01:26.719> my<00:01:26.840> my<00:01:27.439> porygon<00:01:27.889> is<00:01:28.100> gonna<00:01:28.249> be

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
kind of pants off I thought as like

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.800 
kind of pants off I thought as like
Stahli<00:01:48.679> and<00:01:48.979> long<00:01:49.189> it<00:01:49.429> kind<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:49.969> just<00:01:50.359> goes<00:01:50.630> off

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
Stahli and long it kind of just goes off

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.690 
Stahli and long it kind of just goes off
faster<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:51.829> didn't<00:01:52.069> hit<00:01:52.159> me<00:01:52.219> with<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.369> final

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
faster so didn't hit me with the final

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.609 
faster so didn't hit me with the final
air<00:01:52.819> /<00:01:53.090> before<00:01:53.270> he<00:01:53.479> dies<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.049> i<00:01:54.139> think<00:01:54.560> i'll

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
air / before he dies and i think i'll

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.929 
air / before he dies and i think i'll
probably<00:01:54.799> went<00:01:55.069> for<00:01:55.189> recover<00:01:55.459> there<00:01:55.729> but<00:01:55.909> I

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
probably went for recover there but I

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.819 
probably went for recover there but I
flinched<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.420> time<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.229> that's<00:01:57.469> fine<00:01:57.679> so

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
flinched that time so that's fine so

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.319 
flinched that time so that's fine so
he's<00:01:57.950> go<00:01:58.009> ahead<00:01:58.249> and<00:01:58.399> send<00:01:58.549> out<00:01:58.670> honcho<00:01:59.119> and

he's go ahead and send out honcho and
I'm<00:01:59.810> just<00:01:59.929> gonna<00:02:00.049> go<00:02:00.109> ahead<00:02:00.200> of<00:02:00.319> recover

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
I'm just gonna go ahead of recover

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.139 
I'm just gonna go ahead of recover
thinking<00:02:01.249> he<00:02:01.369> might<00:02:01.549> want<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.849> go<00:02:01.939> for<00:02:02.119> the
