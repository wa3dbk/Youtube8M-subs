00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.360 
switch and so for folks that don't know
this<00:02:09.270> isn't<00:02:09.629> 100-percent<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> complete

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
this isn't 100-percent like a complete

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.610 
this isn't 100-percent like a complete
redo<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.910> game<00:02:12.090> correct<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.110> we're

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
redo of the game correct so we're

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.920 
redo of the game correct so we're
basically<00:02:14.010> taking<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.150> original<00:02:15.599> sprites

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
basically taking the original sprites

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.080 
basically taking the original sprites
and<00:02:16.080> modernizing<00:02:16.920> them<00:02:17.069> as<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.580> can<00:02:17.700> see<00:02:17.879> here

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
and modernizing them as you can see here

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.809 
and modernizing them as you can see here
these<00:02:18.209> are<00:02:18.269> some<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:18.780> new<00:02:19.790> renders<00:02:20.790> that

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
these are some of the new renders that

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.270 
these are some of the new renders that
we<00:02:21.030> did<00:02:21.659> of<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> characters<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:23.069> you'll<00:02:23.190> be

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
we did of the characters so you'll be

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.320 
we did of the characters so you'll be
able<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.459> select<00:02:23.610> between<00:02:23.909> five<00:02:24.299> different

able to select between five different

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.509 
able to select between five different
heroes<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.379> we're<00:02:25.890> going<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.040> go<00:02:26.159> ahead<00:02:26.280> and

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
heroes and we're going to go ahead and

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.630 
heroes and we're going to go ahead and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
select Randy here and basically take a

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
area again to show you what the uprise

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.710 
area again to show you what the uprise
luck<00:02:35.129> all<00:02:35.310> these<00:02:35.579> have<00:02:35.909> sort<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.209> been<00:02:36.269> redone

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
luck all these have sort of been redone

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.170 
luck all these have sort of been redone
in<00:02:37.159> high-def<00:02:38.159> and<00:02:38.340> then<00:02:38.430> we<00:02:38.489> apply<00:02:38.790> different

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
in high-def and then we apply different

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.059 
in high-def and then we apply different
kind<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.390> filters<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:39.930> them<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.560> smoothing<00:02:41.010> out

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
kind of filters on them so smoothing out

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.619 
kind of filters on them so smoothing out
the<00:02:41.250> graphics<00:02:41.730> make<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.090> really<00:02:42.299> look<00:02:42.420> good

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
the graphics make it really look good

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.030 
the graphics make it really look good
because<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.319> know<00:02:43.440> we<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:43.650> know<00:02:43.799> we're<00:02:43.950> all

you<00:04:42.280> can<00:04:42.520> also<00:04:42.759> pick<00:04:43.150> unlockable<00:04:43.870> characters

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
you can also pick unlockable characters

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.110 
you can also pick unlockable characters
and<00:04:44.500> there<00:04:44.889> are<00:04:45.009> about<00:04:45.220> forty<00:04:45.729> nine<00:04:45.879> maybe

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
and there are about forty nine maybe

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.999 
and there are about forty nine maybe
almost<00:04:46.330> 50<00:04:46.840> characters<00:04:47.110> in<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.620> game<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.949> we

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
almost 50 characters in the game that we

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.920 
almost 50 characters in the game that we
could<00:04:48.190> use<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:48.610> they<00:04:49.030> were<00:04:49.090> totally<00:04:49.389> random

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
could use and they were totally random

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.050 
could use and they were totally random
so<00:04:50.440> that<00:04:50.620> right<00:04:50.800> this<00:04:51.099> was<00:04:51.280> not<00:04:51.400> balanced<00:04:51.940> at

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
so that right this was not balanced at

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.550 
so that right this was not balanced at
all<00:04:52.210> so<00:04:52.479> yes<00:04:52.659> you<00:04:52.840> could<00:04:52.990> totally<00:04:53.199> use<00:04:53.409> that

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
all so yes you could totally use that

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.830 
all so yes you could totally use that
rabbit<00:04:54.129> and<00:04:54.310> kind<00:04:54.610> of<00:04:54.699> completely<00:04:55.389> take<00:04:55.690> the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
rabbit and kind of completely take the

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.209 
rabbit and kind of completely take the
match<00:04:56.020> if<00:04:56.259> you<00:04:56.349> were<00:04:56.440> if<00:04:56.710> you're<00:04:56.830> good<00:04:57.039> about

able to play it as like different like a

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.490 
able to play it as like different like a
wolf<00:05:00.759> and<00:05:01.030> some<00:05:01.719> of<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.870> different<00:05:02.169> enemies

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
wolf and some of the different enemies

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.890 
wolf and some of the different enemies
you'll<00:05:03.490> go<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.210> graveyard<00:05:04.479> here<00:05:04.810> and

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
you'll go to the graveyard here and

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.070 
you'll go to the graveyard here and
you'll<00:05:04.990> find<00:05:05.310> like<00:05:06.310> an<00:05:06.490> undead<00:05:06.960> villains<00:05:07.960> as

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
you'll find like an undead villains as

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.390 
you'll find like an undead villains as
well<00:05:08.229> that<00:05:08.379> you'll<00:05:08.530> be<00:05:08.590> able<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:08.770> play<00:05:08.979> as<00:05:09.129> so

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
well that you'll be able to play as so

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.189 
well that you'll be able to play as so
it's<00:05:09.879> really<00:05:10.120> interesting<00:05:10.479> but<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:10.870> think<00:05:11.080> the

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
it's really interesting but I think the

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.740 
it's really interesting but I think the
one<00:05:11.349> key<00:05:11.830> element<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.400> garden<00:05:13.150> heroes<00:05:13.509> had

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
one key element the garden heroes had

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.809 
one key element the garden heroes had
back<00:05:14.259> in<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.560> saturn<00:05:14.830> and<00:05:15.129> it<00:05:15.370> stands<00:05:15.639> out

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
back in the saturn and it stands out

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:18.719 
back in the saturn and it stands out
really<00:05:16.210> well<00:05:16.330> on<00:05:16.389> xbla<00:05:17.080> is<00:05:17.349> those<00:05:18.129> multiple

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
really well on xbla is those multiple

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.149 
really well on xbla is those multiple
pathways<00:05:19.300> so<00:05:19.930> there<00:05:20.139> are<00:05:20.199> over<00:05:20.440> 30<00:05:20.770> levels

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159 
pathways so there are over 30 levels

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.070 
pathways so there are over 30 levels
within<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.520> game<00:05:21.759> and<00:05:22.000> depending<00:05:22.719> on<00:05:22.840> what

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
within the game and depending on what

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.230 
within the game and depending on what
choices<00:05:23.349> you<00:05:23.560> make<00:05:23.889> at<00:05:24.430> different<00:05:24.880> sort<00:05:25.180> of

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
choices you make at different sort of

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.290 
choices you make at different sort of
crossroads<00:05:25.960> you'll<00:05:26.560> for<00:05:26.889> example<00:05:27.279> say<00:05:27.669> i<00:05:27.909> want

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
crossroads you'll for example say i want

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.820 
crossroads you'll for example say i want
to<00:05:28.330> go<00:05:28.449> back<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.659> town<00:05:29.020> or<00:05:29.319> no<00:05:29.469> i'm<00:05:29.620> going<00:05:29.770> to

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
to go back to town or no i'm going to

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.230 
to go back to town or no i'm going to
attack<00:05:30.039> the<00:05:30.190> castle<00:05:30.400> or<00:05:30.819> i'm<00:05:30.909> going<00:05:31.029> to<00:05:31.090> hide

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
attack the castle or i'm going to hide

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.059 
attack the castle or i'm going to hide
in<00:05:31.389> the<00:05:31.479> forest<00:05:31.509> and<00:05:32.020> that'll<00:05:32.650> lead<00:05:32.800> you<00:05:32.919> to

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
in the forest and that'll lead you to

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.129 
in the forest and that'll lead you to
new<00:05:33.190> choices<00:05:33.520> and<00:05:33.849> eventually<00:05:34.360> you'll<00:05:34.900> come

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
new choices and eventually you'll come

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.129 
new choices and eventually you'll come
up<00:05:35.259> with<00:05:35.469> one<00:05:36.250> of<00:05:36.599> different<00:05:37.599> endings<00:05:37.960> that

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
up with one of different endings that

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.769 
up with one of different endings that
really<00:05:38.860> range<00:05:39.099> within<00:05:39.430> scope<00:05:39.849> so<00:05:40.360> not<00:05:40.630> to

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
really range within scope so not to

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.390 
really range within scope so not to
spoil<00:05:41.020> it<00:05:41.229> for<00:05:41.800> people<00:05:42.009> who<00:05:42.069> haven't<00:05:42.190> played

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
spoil it for people who haven't played

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.279 
spoil it for people who haven't played
it<00:05:42.639> but<00:05:42.759> some<00:05:43.330> endings<00:05:43.659> are<00:05:43.810> a<00:05:43.870> little<00:05:44.080> bit

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
it but some endings are a little bit

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.469 
it but some endings are a little bit
more<00:05:44.469> local<00:05:45.430> so<00:05:45.610> for<00:05:45.759> example<00:05:45.849> you'll<00:05:46.270> save

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
more local so for example you'll save

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.269 
more local so for example you'll save
the<00:05:46.599> kingdom<00:05:46.840> while<00:05:47.440> others<00:05:47.800> you're<00:05:48.069> going<00:05:48.219> to

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279 
the kingdom while others you're going to

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.149 
the kingdom while others you're going to
go<00:05:48.430> up<00:05:48.610> in<00:05:48.789> battle<00:05:49.599> cosmic<00:05:50.050> deities<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:50.680> sort

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
go up in battle cosmic deities and sort

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.219 
go up in battle cosmic deities and sort
of<00:05:51.190> have<00:05:51.340> a<00:05:51.370> much<00:05:51.580> more<00:05:51.870> cause<00:05:52.870> making

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
of have a much more cause making

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.100 
of have a much more cause making
universal<00:05:54.090> scope<00:05:55.090> of<00:05:55.240> an<00:05:55.360> ending<00:05:55.659> so<00:05:55.900> it's

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
universal scope of an ending so it's

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.680 
universal scope of an ending so it's
really<00:05:56.349> cool<00:05:56.650> depending<00:05:57.129> on<00:05:57.250> what<00:05:57.430> you<00:05:57.550> choose

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
really cool depending on what you choose

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.909 
really cool depending on what you choose
is<00:05:58.690> really<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.139> kind<00:05:59.259> of<00:05:59.349> adventure<00:05:59.710> that<00:05:59.830> you

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
is really the kind of adventure that you

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.129 
is really the kind of adventure that you
can<00:06:00.039> end<00:06:00.219> up<00:06:00.279> by<00:06:00.400> playing<00:06:00.669> it's<00:06:01.599> just<00:06:01.810> it's<00:06:02.050> a

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
can end up by playing it's just it's a

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:03.689
