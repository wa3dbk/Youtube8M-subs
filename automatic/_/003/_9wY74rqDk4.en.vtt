talking<00:01:10.040> now<00:01:11.659> if<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.470> new<00:01:13.710> chip<00:01:14.210> I'll

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
talking now if I get the new chip I'll

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.620 
talking now if I get the new chip I'll
just<00:01:15.570> disconnect<00:01:16.759> this<00:01:18.409> from<00:01:19.409> here<00:01:20.390> pop<00:01:21.390> out

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
just disconnect this from here pop out

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.140 
just disconnect this from here pop out
the<00:01:21.810> old<00:01:21.840> chip<00:01:24.020> put<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.670> make<00:01:26.670> sure<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:26.970> all

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the old chip put in make sure it's all

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.429 
the old chip put in make sure it's all
right<00:01:27.270> wait<00:01:28.610> put<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.000> new<00:01:30.360> chip<00:01:33.439> connect

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
right wait put in the new chip connect

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:49.360 
right wait put in the new chip connect
it<00:01:34.650> up<00:01:38.659> plug<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.740> speaker

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.240 

diddly<00:01:50.370> there<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:50.880> go<00:01:51.230> so<00:01:52.230> that's<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:53.040> new

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
diddly there we go so that's the new

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.300 
diddly there we go so that's the new
chip<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.880> would<00:01:54.150> expect<00:01:54.740> if<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.920> run<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
chip and you would expect if I run the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.120 
chip and you would expect if I run the
same<00:01:56.520> piece<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.940> software<00:01:57.620> I'll<00:01:58.620> get<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:58.950> same

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
same piece of software I'll get the same

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.990 
same piece of software I'll get the same
reaction<00:02:01.400> there<00:02:02.400> we<00:02:02.520> go

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
reaction there we go

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.320 
reaction there we go
software<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.690> running<00:02:04.100> nothing<00:02:05.100> I'll<00:02:06.000> try<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
software is running nothing I'll try it

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.630 
software is running nothing I'll try it
again<00:02:07.520> still<00:02:08.520> nothing<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:11.520> try<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.420> again

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
again still nothing and try it again

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.110 
again still nothing and try it again
nothing<00:02:14.640> again<00:02:16.280> now<00:02:17.510> if<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.780> had<00:02:20.120> only

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
nothing again now if I had only

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.120 
nothing again now if I had only
purchased<00:02:21.690> one<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.930> these<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.530> probably

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
purchased one of these I probably

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.590 
purchased one of these I probably
wouldn't<00:02:23.400> be<00:02:23.520> too<00:02:23.700> stressed<00:02:24.030> out<00:02:24.210> about<00:02:24.420> it

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
wouldn't be too stressed out about it

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.800 
wouldn't be too stressed out about it
just<00:02:25.140> think<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> bad<00:02:25.710> chip<00:02:27.020> unfortunately

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.270 

unfortunately<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.550> purchased<00:02:36.800> 200<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:39.300> these

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
unfortunately I purchased 200 of these

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:51.670 
unfortunately I purchased 200 of these
200<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:46.190> guess<00:02:47.190> I've<00:02:47.370> been<00:02:47.550> bitten<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:50.240> have

200 and I guess I've been bitten I have

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:01.460 
200 and I guess I've been bitten I have
since<00:02:54.050> contacted<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:58.550> supplier<00:03:00.410> who<00:03:01.410> is

it<00:03:04.110> must<00:03:04.470> be<00:03:04.709> wrong<00:03:05.090> well<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> software

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
it must be wrong well it's the software

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.640 
it must be wrong well it's the software
it's<00:03:10.080> running
