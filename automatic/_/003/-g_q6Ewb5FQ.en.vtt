it's<00:01:02.160> still<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.270> take<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
it's still going to like take all the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.390 
it's still going to like take all the
frizz<00:01:04.199> away<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.589> keep<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> sleek<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.189> shiny

frizz away and keep it sleek and shiny

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.609 
frizz away and keep it sleek and shiny
and<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.939> infused<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.960> wild<00:01:07.380> cherry

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619

twist<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.130> Jewell<00:01:08.430> orchid<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.420> think

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
twist and Jewell orchid so I think

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
twist and Jewell orchid so I think
that's<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.930> pretty<00:01:10.170> snazzy<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.040> also

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that's a pretty snazzy and it's also

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.030 
that's a pretty snazzy and it's also
like<00:01:11.460> purple<00:01:11.939> which<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.150> pretty<00:01:12.479> cool<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
like purple which is pretty cool and

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.890 
like purple which is pretty cool and
it's<00:01:14.040> makes<00:01:14.430> my<00:01:14.610> hair<00:01:14.820> smell<00:01:15.210> amazing<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.810> if

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it's makes my hair smell amazing and if

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
it's makes my hair smell amazing and if
I<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.140> use<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.680> conditioner<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.189> use<00:01:17.430> this

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
I do not use that conditioner I use this

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.460 
I do not use that conditioner I use this
one<00:01:17.700> from<00:01:17.909> Pantene<00:01:18.299> which<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> heatshield

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
one from Pantene which is the heatshield

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.520 
one from Pantene which is the heatshield
conditioner<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.810> basically<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.290> heat

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
conditioner and this is basically a heat

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.380 
conditioner and this is basically a heat
protectant<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.640> an<00:01:23.729> extra<00:01:24.060> step<00:01:24.240> in

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
protectant but it's an extra step in

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.820 
protectant but it's an extra step in
your<00:01:24.509> conditioner<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.259> protects<00:01:25.740> your

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
your conditioner so it protects your

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.640 
your conditioner so it protects your
