00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269

and<00:00:49.510> he<00:00:49.600> said<00:00:49.780> I<00:00:49.809> think<00:00:50.080> we<00:00:50.170> can<00:00:50.350> do<00:00:50.470> it<00:00:50.500> so<00:00:51.089> we

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
and he said I think we can do it so we

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.910 
and he said I think we can do it so we
cut<00:00:52.330> a<00:00:52.360> hole<00:00:52.570> in<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.809> hood<00:00:52.960> which<00:00:53.229> was<00:00:53.470> really

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
cut a hole in the hood which was really

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.399 
cut a hole in the hood which was really
scary<00:00:54.339> on<00:00:54.549> a<00:00:54.580> brand<00:00:54.850> new<00:00:54.970> car<00:00:55.269> and<00:00:55.629> of<00:00:56.140> course

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
scary on a brand new car and of course

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.100 
scary on a brand new car and of course
we<00:00:56.589> had<00:00:56.739> a<00:00:57.059> shaker<00:00:58.059> system<00:00:58.540> that<00:00:58.780> actually

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
we had a shaker system that actually

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.170 
we had a shaker system that actually
didn't<00:00:59.650> fit<00:00:59.799> the<00:00:59.920> car<00:01:00.129> but<00:01:00.519> we<00:01:00.699> finally<00:01:01.059> got

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
didn't fit the car but we finally got

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.520 
didn't fit the car but we finally got
her<00:01:01.299> shoehorned<00:01:01.780> in<00:01:01.900> there<00:01:02.080> and<00:01:02.199> got<00:01:02.290> her<00:01:02.409> to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
her shoehorned in there and got her to

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.259 
her shoehorned in there and got her to
work<00:01:02.680> in<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:02.920> hood<00:01:03.129> will<00:01:03.280> actually<00:01:03.670> close<00:01:03.879> so

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
work in the hood will actually close so

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.870 
work in the hood will actually close so
that<00:01:04.299> helped<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:06.040> that<00:01:06.220> was<00:01:06.369> one<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.700> big

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
that helped so that was one of the big

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.800 
that helped so that was one of the big
things<00:01:07.119> I<00:01:07.810> put<00:01:08.740> stripes<00:01:09.190> on<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.390> car<00:01:10.570> now

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
things I put stripes on the car now

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.300 
things I put stripes on the car now
those<00:01:10.990> stripes<00:01:11.320> are<00:01:11.500> painted<00:01:11.920> I<00:01:12.010> painted

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
those stripes are painted I painted

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.460 
those stripes are painted I painted
those<00:01:12.460> on<00:01:12.730> if<00:01:12.940> you<00:01:13.540> look<00:01:13.720> at<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.930> side<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.200> the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
those on if you look at the side of the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.170 
those on if you look at the side of the
car<00:01:14.680> I<00:01:14.710> had<00:01:14.980> two<00:01:15.070> windows<00:01:15.460> all<00:01:15.640> tended<00:01:16.060> to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
car I had two windows all tended to

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.210 
car I had two windows all tended to
match<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.720> very<00:01:17.080> back<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.620> then<00:01:18.070> I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
match the the very back and then I

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.540 
match the the very back and then I
painted<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.360> sides<00:01:20.080> above<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.890> windows<00:01:21.340> to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
painted the sides above the windows to

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.430 
painted the sides above the windows to
make<00:01:21.730> the<00:01:21.940> roof<00:01:22.420> actually<00:01:22.690> look<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.260> little

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
make the roof actually look a little

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.730 
make the roof actually look a little
lower<00:01:23.830> than<00:01:24.340> it<00:01:24.490> really<00:01:24.640> is<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.290> that<00:01:26.470> helped

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
lower than it really is so that helped

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.860 
lower than it really is so that helped

whole<00:01:57.070> lot<00:01:57.190> of<00:01:57.310> mechanical<00:01:57.820> because<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:58.240> is

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
whole lot of mechanical because this is

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.510

an SRT the street and racing technology
guys<00:02:00.909> did<00:02:01.150> that<00:02:01.180> for<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:01.570> already<00:02:01.870> with

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
guys did that for you already with

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.719 
guys did that for you already with
suspensions<00:02:02.650> big<00:02:03.159> brakes

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
suspensions big brakes

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.730 
suspensions big brakes
you<00:02:03.909> mentioned<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.270> 6.1<00:02:04.810> with<00:02:05.080> more<00:02:05.260> power<00:02:05.500> in

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
you mentioned the 6.1 with more power in

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.230 
you mentioned the 6.1 with more power in
it<00:02:05.860> already

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
it already

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.779 
it already
basically<00:02:07.900> on<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.709> put<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.340> Diablo

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
basically on that I put a Diablo

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.120 
basically on that I put a Diablo
predator<00:02:10.299> in<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.750> then<00:02:11.349> I<00:02:11.470> tuned<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:11.950> back

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
predator in it and then I tuned it back

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.420 
predator in it and then I tuned it back
for<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.490> 91<00:02:13.120> octane<00:02:13.530> what<00:02:14.530> was<00:02:14.680> happening<00:02:15.190> was

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
for a 91 octane what was happening was

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.420 
for a 91 octane what was happening was
with<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:15.970> 93

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
with a 93

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.320 
with a 93
and<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.239> 93<00:02:18.680> gas<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.099> here<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:21.090> knock

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
and the 93 gas we have here the knock

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.850 
and the 93 gas we have here the knock
sensors<00:02:21.720> will<00:02:21.840> kick<00:02:22.019> in<00:02:22.170> at<00:02:22.290> about<00:02:22.409> three

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
sensors will kick in at about three

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.610 
sensors will kick in at about three
third<00:02:23.519> gear<00:02:23.760> right<00:02:24.330> into<00:02:24.540> forth<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.319> 91

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
third gear right into forth so the 91

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.280 
third gear right into forth so the 91
octane<00:02:26.099> setup<00:02:26.879> with<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.569> predator<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.170> put

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
octane setup with the predator and put

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.369 
octane setup with the predator and put
93<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:30.060> won't<00:02:30.209> layover<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.930> just

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
93 in it and it won't layover it just

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.410 
93 in it and it won't layover it just
keeps<00:02:31.620> on<00:02:31.769> trucking<00:02:32.370> now<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.640> put<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.879> magnaflow

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
keeps on trucking now I put a magnaflow

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.970 
keeps on trucking now I put a magnaflow
exhaust<00:02:33.450> because<00:02:34.079> I<00:02:34.200> like<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.530> sound<00:02:34.769> it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
exhaust because I like the sound it

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.729 
exhaust because I like the sound it
sounds<00:02:35.310> good<00:02:35.519> outside<00:02:36.079> fairly<00:02:37.079> quiet<00:02:37.379> on<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
sounds good outside fairly quiet on the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.789 
sounds good outside fairly quiet on the
inside<00:02:38.159> and<00:02:38.549> so<00:02:38.970> that's<00:02:39.780> basically<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.349> I'll
