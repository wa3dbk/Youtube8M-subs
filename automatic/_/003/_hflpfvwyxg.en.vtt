think culture is a different club now
it's<00:07:01.560> not<00:07:01.680> it<00:07:01.830> shall<00:07:01.980> be<00:07:02.070> a<00:07:02.100> different<00:07:02.430> table

because they've got a different manager
and<00:07:03.900> I<00:07:03.990> think<00:07:04.170> the<00:07:04.380> leader<00:07:04.560> of<00:07:04.800> a<00:07:04.920> club<00:07:05.630> sets

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
and I think the leader of a club sets

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.920 
and I think the leader of a club sets
that<00:07:06.810> sets<00:07:07.170> the<00:07:07.290> tone<00:07:07.880> and<00:07:08.880> there's<00:07:09.570> a<00:07:09.660> chance
