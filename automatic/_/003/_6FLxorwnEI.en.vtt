when<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:03.719> small<00:01:04.260> two<00:01:04.920> years<00:01:05.129> old<00:01:05.250> he

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
when I was very small two years old he

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.070 
when I was very small two years old he

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
built me a small go-kart because she

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.109 
built me a small go-kart because she
cannot<00:01:07.260> buy<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:07.920> class<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.400> size<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.729> he

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
cannot buy your class in that size so he

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.390 
cannot buy your class in that size so he
had<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> build<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.110> weld<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.830> frame<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
had to build one and weld the frame and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.870 
had to build one and weld the frame and
everything<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> drove<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.189> tell<00:01:14.490> us<00:01:14.670> I

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
everything so drove that and tell us I

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.730 
everything so drove that and tell us I
was<00:01:15.090> big<00:01:15.270> enough<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.540> drive<00:01:15.750> bigger<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.530> cuts

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
was big enough to drive bigger go cuts

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.480 
was big enough to drive bigger go cuts
every<00:01:17.460> win<00:01:17.670> every<00:01:18.270> win<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.479> special<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.110> guess

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
every win every win is special I guess

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.899 
every win every win is special I guess
the<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.909> really<00:01:21.270> satisfying<00:01:22.140> wins<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.340> when

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the the really satisfying wins is when

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.060 
the the really satisfying wins is when
you<00:01:24.000> come<00:01:24.180> from<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> back<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.890> I've<00:01:25.890> done

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you come from the back and I've done

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.340 
you come from the back and I've done
that<00:01:26.189> before<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.580> karting<00:01:27.210> when<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.229> was

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that before in karting when I was

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.950 
that before in karting when I was
starting<00:01:28.500> last<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.700> came<00:01:30.570> back<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.869> win

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
starting last and and came back to win

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.929 
starting last and and came back to win
the<00:01:31.020> race<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.259> those<00:01:32.130> winds<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.579> probably

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the race and those winds are probably

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.880 
the race and those winds are probably
the<00:01:33.570> best<00:01:33.720> ones<00:01:33.840> when<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> when<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.560> really

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the best ones when you when you really

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.700 
the best ones when you when you really
have<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.130> fight<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.790> take<00:01:36.689> my<00:01:36.810> horses<00:01:37.439> is
