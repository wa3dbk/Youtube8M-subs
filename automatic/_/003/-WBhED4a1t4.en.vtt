00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
head a little round head going around

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.140 
head a little round head going around
towards<00:00:47.900> his<00:00:48.050> shell<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.129> now<00:00:49.699> we'll<00:00:49.850> draw<00:00:50.090> the

towards his shell and now we'll draw the
shell<00:00:50.559> and<00:00:52.269> shell<00:00:53.269> is<00:00:53.420> total<00:00:54.230> shell<00:00:54.379> is<00:00:54.530> made

up of several several her little

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.530 
up of several several her little
platelets<00:00:59.150> I<00:00:59.769> think<00:01:00.769> you'd<00:01:00.890> call<00:01:00.920> them<00:01:01.540> and

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
platelets I think you'd call them and

platelets I think you'd call them and
here<00:01:02.780> we<00:01:02.900> are<00:01:02.930> this<00:01:03.650> is<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.890> pattern<00:01:04.510> you<00:01:05.510> see

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
here we are this is the pattern you see

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:14.469 
here we are this is the pattern you see
on<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.049> shell<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:13.490> now<00:01:13.940> we'll<00:01:14.119> draw<00:01:14.420> the

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
on the shell and now we'll draw the

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.250 
on the shell and now we'll draw the
basic<00:01:14.810> shape<00:01:15.260> of<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.770> tortoise<00:01:16.610> shell<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:18.140> was

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
basic shape of the tortoise shell it was

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.679 
basic shape of the tortoise shell it was
round<00:01:18.500> there<00:01:21.280> roughly<00:01:22.280> it's<00:01:23.240> only<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.510> rough

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
round there roughly it's only a rough

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.960 
round there roughly it's only a rough
drawing<00:01:24.080> but<00:01:24.380> it's<00:01:25.220> beginning<00:01:25.400> to<00:01:25.670> look<00:01:25.909> like

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
drawing but it's beginning to look like

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.510 
drawing but it's beginning to look like
a<00:01:26.150> tortoise<00:01:26.570> now<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.799> now<00:01:27.920> what<00:01:28.100> we'll<00:01:28.220> do<00:01:28.369> is

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
a tortoise now and now what we'll do is

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.249 
a tortoise now and now what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:28.729> draw<00:01:29.000> a<00:01:29.680> sling<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.840> reason<00:01:33.140> for

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
we'll draw a sling and the reason for

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.300 
we'll draw a sling and the reason for
that<00:01:33.320> is<00:01:33.710> he's<00:01:33.950> got<00:01:34.189> one<00:01:34.909> of<00:01:35.030> his<00:01:35.119> legs<00:01:36.159> in<00:01:37.159> a

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
that is he's got one of his legs in a

flip<00:03:17.000> charts<00:03:17.450> but<00:03:18.109> I<00:03:18.139> find<00:03:18.560> they're<00:03:18.769> ideal<00:03:19.099> for

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
flip charts but I find they're ideal for

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.319 
flip charts but I find they're ideal for
coming<00:03:21.650> in<00:03:21.829> cartoons<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:25.190> we<00:03:25.519> will<00:03:25.639> add<00:03:25.729> water

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
coming in cartoons so we will add water

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.330 
coming in cartoons so we will add water
now<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.609> drawing<00:03:29.829> here<00:03:30.829> we<00:03:30.919> go

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
now to the drawing here we go

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.909 
now to the drawing here we go
and<00:03:32.150> what<00:03:32.299> I'll<00:03:32.720> do<00:03:32.900> now<00:03:33.109> is<00:03:33.139> I'll<00:03:33.440> completely

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
and what I'll do now is I'll completely

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:40.780 
and what I'll do now is I'll completely
cover<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.459> drawing<00:03:34.790> in<00:03:35.120> water<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:39.790> covers

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
cover the drawing in water this covers

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.930 
cover the drawing in water this covers
the<00:03:40.909> whole<00:03:41.060> sheet<00:03:41.379> soaks<00:03:42.379> the<00:03:42.560> paper<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.370> when

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
the whole sheet soaks the paper and when

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.259 
the whole sheet soaks the paper and when
I<00:03:43.970> put<00:03:44.239> color<00:03:44.479> on<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:45.650> tends<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.459> run<00:03:46.699> a<00:03:46.729> bit<00:03:47.000> but

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
I put color on it tends to run a bit but

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.830 
I put color on it tends to run a bit but
it<00:03:47.449> gives<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:48.079> nice<00:03:48.260> effect<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:49.449> know<00:03:50.449> the<00:03:50.659> water

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
it gives a nice effect I know the water

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.960 
it gives a nice effect I know the water
doesn't<00:03:51.470> look<00:03:51.560> clean<00:03:51.829> but<00:03:51.859> it<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:52.310> supposed<00:03:52.699> to

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
doesn't look clean but it is supposed to

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.569 
doesn't look clean but it is supposed to
be<00:03:53.030> but<00:03:53.720> what<00:03:54.169> the<00:03:54.470> last<00:03:54.680> time<00:03:54.859> I<00:03:54.889> used<00:03:55.220> it<00:03:55.430> the

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
be but what the last time I used it the

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.080 
be but what the last time I used it the
term<00:03:55.879> I<00:03:56.680> used<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.919> with<00:03:58.069> blue<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:58.819> can<00:03:58.849> see

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
term I used it with blue and you can see

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.140 
term I used it with blue and you can see
the<00:03:59.239> waters<00:03:59.599> slightly<00:04:00.409> blue<00:04:00.709> but<00:04:00.979> I<00:04:01.159> couldn't

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
the waters slightly blue but I couldn't

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.449 
the waters slightly blue but I couldn't
I<00:04:02.329> was<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:02.989> bit<00:04:03.169> lazy<00:04:03.379> really<00:04:03.829> I<00:04:03.859> didn't<00:04:04.220> really

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
I was a bit lazy really I didn't really

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.539 
I was a bit lazy really I didn't really
replace<00:04:04.849> the<00:04:05.030> water<00:04:05.239> but<00:04:05.919> at<00:04:06.919> least<00:04:07.099> it<00:04:07.310> shows

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
replace the water but at least it shows

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.449 
replace the water but at least it shows
you<00:04:08.949> the<00:04:09.949> coverage<00:04:11.290> I'm<00:04:12.290> doing<00:04:13.189> on<00:04:13.340> this

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
you the coverage I'm doing on this

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.360 
you the coverage I'm doing on this
drawing<00:04:13.729> there<00:04:14.510> we<00:04:14.659> are

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
drawing there we are

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.490 
drawing there we are
the<00:04:16.370> drawing<00:04:16.699> is<00:04:16.820> now<00:04:17.030> completely<00:04:17.449> soaked<00:04:17.870> so

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
the drawing is now completely soaked so

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.110 
the drawing is now completely soaked so
what<00:04:18.650> I'll<00:04:18.799> do<00:04:19.009> now<00:04:19.220> is<00:04:19.250> add<00:04:19.579> a<00:04:19.609> bit<00:04:19.699> of<00:04:19.820> color

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
what I'll do now is add a bit of color

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.030 
what I'll do now is add a bit of color
to<00:04:20.389> the<00:04:21.019> drawing

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.510 

mix<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:25.090> up<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.330> bit<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:26.710> here<00:04:27.070> we<00:04:27.160> go

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
mix it up a bit and here we go

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.800 
mix it up a bit and here we go
hollering<00:04:28.390> in<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:30.670> shell<00:04:30.940> you<00:04:31.180> don't<00:04:31.540> have<00:04:31.690> to

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
hollering in the shell you don't have to

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.330 
hollering in the shell you don't have to
be<00:04:31.960> precise<00:04:32.380> just<00:04:34.710> gives<00:04:35.710> a<00:04:35.830> little<00:04:36.040> shading

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
be precise just gives a little shading

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.630 
be precise just gives a little shading
effect<00:04:37.500> as<00:04:38.500> you<00:04:38.650> see<00:04:38.890> I'm<00:04:39.010> not<00:04:39.190> being<00:04:39.460> too

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
effect as you see I'm not being too

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:49.800 
effect as you see I'm not being too
fussy<00:04:43.050> bit<00:04:44.050> more<00:04:44.380> up<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.680> top

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.180 

now<00:04:50.470> we'll<00:04:51.840> color<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:53.020> tortoise<00:04:53.470> in<00:04:53.650> there<00:04:54.100> we

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
now we'll color the tortoise in there we

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:07.480 
now we'll color the tortoise in there we
go<00:04:55.800> his<00:04:56.800> little<00:04:57.130> head<00:04:57.720> do<00:04:58.720> his<00:04:58.870> leg

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:14.200 

they're<00:05:08.030> speaking<00:05:08.690> like<00:05:09.350> a<00:05:09.380> tortoise<00:05:09.770> now

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.620 

just<00:05:14.840> add<00:05:14.990> a<00:05:15.020> bit<00:05:15.229> more<00:05:15.259> Brown<00:05:15.680> I<00:05:15.710> think

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.020 

but<00:05:21.170> the<00:05:21.290> green<00:05:21.560> color<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.700> grass<00:05:24.880> it's<00:05:25.880> not

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030
