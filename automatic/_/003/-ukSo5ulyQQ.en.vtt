00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.890
 and then we have arrived at small mini applications 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.199
 best on programs for them also called 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.419
 you actually bring useful functions that you normally find on your desk 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.749
 like a calculator the blow on you and things like that 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.880
 summarized in a program 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.390
 in the background 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.199
 and maybe i'm not gonna fully understand what i mean but you are 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.740
 started to work texts and did not count that text working camp 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.669
 numerous tourists a calculator in the picture 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:31.800
 a notepad 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.600
 mathijs no look 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.560
 I am working on a text working program 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.570
 And one of the disadvantages of this package you have is that you create one file at a time 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.540
 can consult 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.530
 by simply pressing a button 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 I bring that background program forward 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.940
 I choose to make a note 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.740
 and I have as it were and came flat to the hand so I can actually have two 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.630
 consult files now 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.240
 one step further 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 the use of the calculator for calculations 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.900
 one more, even for a calendar 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.190
 and that is not the calendar 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.560
 of one or two days that can go on for years 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.980
 one step further 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.830
 a phone chatter in the picture 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.479
 can also accurately use telephone numbers 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.140
 those with an autonomous order can still be called automatically as well 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.560
 and finally 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.430
 3 if he wants to 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.520
 standard finds its operation working and we want energy, for example 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.880
 March 2nd 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.729
 then we can look up the corresponding as that code 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.830
 and so use piet characters within a certain parquet 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.670
 and review some nice hard work at the end of this lesson 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.300
 show extensions 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
 you could compare it a bit with the simple store 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.610
 then this video camera is just starting 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.659
 a camera that we have connected 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.760
 through a special interface 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.209
 on a person computer 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.900
 what we can do is to include images, possibly change to 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.260
 the computer image and then make video again 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.789
 next to a special apple 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:25.209
 the attorney has that 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.949
 where text is on 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:30.189
 can deposit 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.969
 according to pressing a handsome 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.459
 I think your paper disappears in the picking 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.329
 I think that is a paper shredder that I have seen before but this is one 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.699
 special read if you like 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.450
 information from the paper are recently 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.920
 via the ps2 32 output 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.009
 on the machine 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:49.509
 linked to a personal computer 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.769
 that it is good to also refuse the text around our screen here 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.810
 can work teletext and that way 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.699
 of paper just our file rebellion fact 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.699
 and then we walk to the other side 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.050
 for example, we see a keyboard here 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.840
 be able to connect to a higher microphone and therefore the bulk of voice commands 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.959
 to give the computer 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.959
 also a keyboard with a special window 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.849
 by simply touching the window with a finger 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.250
 In this way we can send commands to the computer 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.030
 otherwise handy help 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.489
 for the bookkeeper 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.359
 we can still do that on a normal keyboard 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.959
 he can then set the number clocks pass and thus the number keys on his own 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.509
 keep using the keyboard 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:39.939
 and use it for control course 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.689
 further of course also 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.029
 this is demanding 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:44.929
 a device 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:46.079
 using 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:46.939
 to press 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.099
 on that plate 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.099
 be able to pass on beekeeping coordinates 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:54.949
 just make the step monitor 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.369
 You see here a very special screen that is actually the size 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:59.969
 has a few of them 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:03.329
 and that can be useful if wim word processing equals content from one 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.329
 very much that you want to have a4 in the picture 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.610
 if we take a look at that screen, graphic cards always belong there 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:11.039
 at 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.719
 and then there are many different graphic cards 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.090
 and this is a very special card 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.260
 all members of the different cards can be a mini and or 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.159
 so you want to simulate 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.109
 it's about 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.620
 using the info setting the vub 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.569
 the Swiss 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.569
 on the backside 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:32.749
 the step to the cd rom 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.779
 you can still use the disc 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:39.509
 have one-off information recorded by the manufacturer 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.830
 for example a data file or whatever as a copy of my part and 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.830
 now we can always stand by again 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.979
 The disadvantage of the disc is that it can only be read but there 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.979
 we have found a solution for namely the who drive 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.300
 write the coupons once we can disc the writer and then 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.210
 frequently read 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.219
 and that is mostly used in the 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.219
 the Veerburg signs 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.629
 beside 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:11.999
 a hard leather 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:15.700
 points card that we can store in the computer so you can see here too 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.349
 connection 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:22.369
 and there is a complete hard disk unit of 20 megabit on it with all 

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:24.449
 electronics that go with it 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.800
 I am a market share
