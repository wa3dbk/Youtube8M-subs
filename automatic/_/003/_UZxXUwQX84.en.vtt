00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.220
Dr. Larabee this book is too heavy.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.720
Good!

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.200
It'll develop your arm muscles.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.120
I thought we were developing my vocabulary.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:08.800
We are.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.760
Please continue reading.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.800
But I already know most of the words of this speech.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.500
Its not a speech. It's an essay, by W.E.B Debois.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.820
The first black man to receive a PhD from Harvard University.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.100
Maybe we should be studying more big words.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.040
Spell cabalistic.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.440
C-A-B-A-L-I-S-T-I-C

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.800
Cabalistic.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.160
And when did you learn that one?

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.520
About two minutes ago in this book.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.460
But in the time it took to learn that one word, Dylan probably learned twenty.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.440
And those twenty words wont mean anything to him.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.860
He's just a little robot memorizing lists of words.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.320
The people we are studying, Debois, Dr. King, JFK.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.860
These people used words to change the world.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.340
And they did acquire their vocabulary by rote memorization.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.040
OK but when I'm at the bee and they tell me to spell some little fish from Australia.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.220
or some weird bacteria on the moon.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.340
We're gonna wish we did a little more rotemerizing and not so much essay reading.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.380
If you don't mind me saying.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.000
Bacteria don't exist on the moon.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.300
Let me ask you something.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.480
Where do you think big words come from?

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.840
People with big brains?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.740
Ha

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.960
Alright, what do you see?

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.620
A bunch of big words I don't know.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.720
Ah! Look again.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.720
What kind of power do we get from the sun?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.400
Solar.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.120
So what does SOL mean?

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.780
Sun.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.200
What does terraneous sound like?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.200
Terrain

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.280
Meaning the earth

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.900
Soliterraneous means the sun and the earth WORKING TOGETHER!

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.260
So where do big words come from?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.060
Little words.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.960
How many little words do you know?

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.860
Tons

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.960
YES!!

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.680
And there are tons more for you to learn.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.760
There are Greek ones.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.520
There are Latin ones.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.680
French ones

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.040
and if you learn them all you can spell any word, no matter how big.
