and how that hydrogen peroxide is such a
wonderful<00:00:17.730> ingredient<00:00:18.449> because<00:00:18.869> it's

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
wonderful ingredient because it's

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
have thought that why not just go to the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.240 
have thought that why not just go to the
pharmacy<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.480> pick<00:00:31.320> up<00:00:31.439> one<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.710> those<00:00:31.800> brown

pharmacy and pick up one of those brown
jugs<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.940> hydrogen<00:00:33.450> peroxide<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.170> use<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.500> as

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
jugs of hydrogen peroxide and use it as

jugs of hydrogen peroxide and use it as
a<00:00:34.710> mouth<00:00:35.010> rinse<00:00:35.219> now<00:00:35.460> there's<00:00:36.180> three<00:00:36.540> very

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
a mouth rinse now there's three very

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.229 
a mouth rinse now there's three very
good<00:00:37.410> reasons<00:00:37.559> why<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.820> won't<00:00:39.030> be

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
good reasons why this won't be

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.819 
good reasons why this won't be
particularly<00:00:39.690> effective<00:00:40.320> at<00:00:40.440> whitening<00:00:40.739> your

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
particularly effective at whitening your

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.619 
particularly effective at whitening your
teeth<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.730> won't<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:42.000> very<00:00:42.149> healthy

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
teeth and it won't be very healthy

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.350 
teeth and it won't be very healthy
either<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> first<00:00:44.190> reason<00:00:44.640> I'd<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
either and the first reason I'd like to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.020 
either and the first reason I'd like to
share<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> fact<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.980> using<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
share with you is the fact that using a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.590 
share with you is the fact that using a
whitening<00:00:48.450> mouth<00:00:49.289> rinse<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:50.149> not<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> very<00:00:51.510> good

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
whitening mouth rinse is not a very good

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
whitening mouth rinse is not a very good
delivery<00:00:52.350> method<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> hydrogen

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
delivery method for the hydrogen

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.799 
delivery method for the hydrogen
peroxide<00:00:54.030> itself<00:00:54.980> meaning<00:00:56.600> instead<00:00:57.600> of

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
peroxide itself meaning instead of

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.750 
peroxide itself meaning instead of
getting<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> teeth<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.070> lot<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.489> times

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
getting to the teeth a lot of times

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.700 
getting to the teeth a lot of times
these<00:01:00.030> hydrogen<00:01:00.510> peroxide<00:01:00.960> molecules<00:01:01.500> will

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
these hydrogen peroxide molecules will

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.410 
these hydrogen peroxide molecules will
end<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:01.920> reacting<00:01:02.430> with<00:01:02.579> your<00:01:02.730> saliva<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
end up reacting with your saliva and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.050 
end up reacting with your saliva and
never<00:01:04.049> getting<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.650> stains<00:01:04.949> which<00:01:05.820> is

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
never getting to the stains which is

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.200 
never getting to the stains which is
counterproductive<00:01:07.549> secondly<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.030> never

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
counterproductive secondly you never

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.270 
counterproductive secondly you never
know<00:01:09.360> how<00:01:09.780> long<00:01:09.810> these<00:01:10.530> brown<00:01:10.830> shows<00:01:11.070> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
know how long these brown shows of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.679 
know how long these brown shows of
hydrogen<00:01:11.610> peroxide<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.090> been<00:01:12.210> sitting<00:01:12.510> out

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
hydrogen peroxide have been sitting out

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.240 
hydrogen peroxide have been sitting out
on<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.960> counters<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.920> lot<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
on the counters and a lot of the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.429 
on the counters and a lot of the
hydrogen<00:01:14.580> peroxide<00:01:14.729> contain<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.930> those<00:01:16.200> jokes

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
hydrogen peroxide contain in those jokes

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.760 
hydrogen peroxide contain in those jokes
has<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.369> more<00:01:17.549> than<00:01:17.700> likely<00:01:17.930> reacted<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
has we more than likely reacted and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.240 
has we more than likely reacted and
degraded<00:01:20.369> into<00:01:20.850> water<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.659> oxygen<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.470> that

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
degraded into water and oxygen and that

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.160 
degraded into water and oxygen and that
brings<00:01:23.580> me<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.000> my<00:01:24.119> third<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.509> final<00:01:24.600> point

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
brings me to my third and final point

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.380 
brings me to my third and final point
which<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.549> order<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.939> resist<00:01:27.210> this

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
which is that in order to resist this

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.440 
which is that in order to resist this
degradation<00:01:27.860> these<00:01:28.939> jugs<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.090> hydrogen

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
degradation these jugs of hydrogen

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.630 
degradation these jugs of hydrogen
peroxide<00:01:30.630> contain<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> liquid<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.220> very

shelf-life of the hydrogen peroxide that
you'll<00:01:37.439> find<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.799> store<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.869> ironically

acidic<00:01:41.460> things<00:01:41.670> will<00:01:42.360> help<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.500> whitening

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
acidic things will help with whitening

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.080 
acidic things will help with whitening
but<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:46.680> flipside<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.820> it's

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
but the flipside of that is that it's

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.450 
but the flipside of that is that it's
very<00:01:48.180> erosive<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.590> enamel<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.100> very

very erosive to your enamel and very

very erosive to your enamel and very
