00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.070
 ah 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.440
 ah 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.200
 greetings and welcome all my name is 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.900
 Raquel this is the nail decoration in 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.970
 which we will be working now for 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.700
 start this design I'm going to paint a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.650
 french design in color bougainvillea I am 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.290
 starting by painting the smile line 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.720
 and now I'm going to bring that color bougainvillea 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.300
 towards the middle looking up from my 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.300
 French design and I want to hurry to 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.269
 this step because when I add the color 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.040
 fiusha I want it to be still wet this 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.409
 color bougainvillea then nothing else 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.280
 add the future and I'm blurring 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.280
 the two colors 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.079
 now I'm going to add a rose in 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.300
 a very pale tone the same and I'm going to 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.730
 blur the color of pink with color 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.830
 fiusha once everything has dried by 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.170
 complete add a glaze with glitter 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.229
 of your preference and to finalize 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.100
 add a transparent glaze of your 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.770
 preference 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.710
 now for my nail of my ring finger 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.440
 I decided to paint a freehand flower 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.420
 to be using a brush at an angle and 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.000
 nothing add the white on the 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.100
 top part and the color fiusha in the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.649
 bottom part and I'm painting my 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.649
 first petal of a flower dragging it 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.979
 little by little and I'm going to make my flower 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.899
 5 petals this technique is different from 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.200
 which is used to make the flower to 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.850
 hand raised and moving the brush towards 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.880
 top down this is much more 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.190
 easy is nothing more with pure pats and 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.860
 at the same time bringing the brush towards 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.780
 the side is a very easy technique one of 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.300
 my favorites and the flowers are very 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.360
 nice then here nothing else I'm 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.340
 ending with my fifth petal now 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.430
 in the center I will add a color 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.040
 green 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.380
 and I will also be delineating my 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.620
 little flower with a very yellow color 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.330
 pale and this at the end makes the flower 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.009
 It looks very pretty because I'm a 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.800
 little bit of the white and a little 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.720
 yellow color too now I will be 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.610
 adding the same yellow color in the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.610
 center of the flower in the form of dots 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.220
 and I will also be adding dots 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.830
 in brown color all around the circle 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.440
 green but I'm going to concentrate more on the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.840
 area below with these little dots in 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.060
 coffee color now using a color 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.310
 white I'm going to make two lines curving 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.370
 the towards the side of the flower rounding 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.500
 the French design and about each of 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.739
 the little tips I will paint a form of 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.739
 almond 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.610
 and his last step as always is 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.980
 apply a transparent glaze to 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.800
 seal your design well and that your art 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.350

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.930
 per week I hope you liked it 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.290

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.870

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.090
