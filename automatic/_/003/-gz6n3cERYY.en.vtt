00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.879
 to make the brioche point so 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.059
 we need two colors of 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:14.400
 wool and double pointed needle 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.949
 so at first we're going 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.949
 to mount a number of my hair 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.989
 to make this point of brioche or rib 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.360
 gluers for so we need two 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.210
 wool of different colors must be well 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.040
 to take helene similar otherwise it 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.100
 will pose a worry and a land 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.800
 of needle then double point and for 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.340
 start so let's go up a 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.600
 number of father miles very simply 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.600
 really very simply 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.100
 so when we invented know my to 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.650
 using the second hand we 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.030
 let's start inserting our 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.430
 second color so we will jam the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.430
 yarn between the stitches 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:27.640
 and we will start by making a mesh 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:30.729
 upside down and then we'll do a 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.490
 mesh double place so the mesh 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.460
 double place we will not sting like we 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.530
 used to do it we will sting in 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:45.549
 underneath so I hope you see 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:48.460
 well and knit the knit at the place 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.940
 so poking it under the head 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.479
 in the loop that is below the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:01.149
 initial mesh then we redo 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:04.479
 a mesh upside down we start again 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:09.600
 soft mesh I hope you see 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:14.700
 well actually a pic in this loop there 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.700
 and we do our stitch at the place a 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.480
 mesh upside down 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:28.480
 a mesh at the double place which 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.230
 we will do this all the while 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.180
 ending with stitch upside down 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.299
 when we finished so our first 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.590
 rank we have the second son who is 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.989
 so find at the end is our 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.519
 mounting wire 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.519
 so in fact we're going to slip the stitches 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.690
 and resume with the son of montages in 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.650
 made a rank over two years will knit with 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.450
 the initial color 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.340
 so there when it's black on them 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.140
 the sting knits with the rose and 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.160
 when it's hard to contract is sorted 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:11.670
 with the black film so for the second 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.670
 rank we will make a stitch upside down 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:24.390
 a mesh at the place 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:28.110
 so there a normal mesh followed by a 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:33.300
 mesh upside down so double so in fact 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:41.000
 we are going to stoke the breath every year in the 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:44.240
 loop during previous and one comes out 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.240
 our mesh 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.390
 it 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:00.470
 we do a stitch at the place so 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:04.690
 normal and we redo a mesh so to 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:09.340
 the reverse we sting from behind in fact 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.340
 to take the two colors of line 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.440
 a mesh at the place a double stitch 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.590
 upside down and we're going to do that all 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.590
 rank 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:32.400
 and eventually to a mesh 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.400
 double and one stitch in normal cairo 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.880
 you see the two colors that 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:47.770
 are taken when we mesh at 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:50.020
 double upside down so when we're done 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.720
 we have the two girls who are 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:58.630
 found at one end there we go 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:06.030
 return the job it's the sons of 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:09.340
 start now with the black film 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.000
 we are going to redo the 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:18.040
 third rank like the previous rank 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:23.100
 so with a mesh towards a mesh to 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:30.610
 the place a double stitch upside down 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:34.330
 so we transplant from behind while spiking 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:38.380
 in the mesh during a previous 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.600
 mesh at the place a mesh in dr doom 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:45.240
 and eventually to a mesh 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.240
 double followed by a glass mesh 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.259
 when our rank is over we 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.870
 let's slide know my to your and the ex 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:56.870
 ends to make the fourth rank 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.599
 with our pink wool 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:03.590
 so we're going to make a stitch to 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.590
 upside 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.080
 a mesh at the double place so 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:13.439
 always stitching in the loop in 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.719
 below we do not sting like those 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:17.719
 sting in the loop during previous 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:27.080
 a mesh towards a mesh place 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.080
 double 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.919
 I 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:38.919
 a stitch upside down 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.940
 how do you see 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:56.690
 and we will repeat 1 6 and 4 th rank you 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:59.850
 see that it will start to form 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:02.120
 so that's what we need to get in 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:06.800
 continually repeating his four years 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:14.580
 so you see we determine well the 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:15.300
 two colors that are reversible so 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.340
 on the other side 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.440
 that's what it gives so there is 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:22.650
 several methods to do it but 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:27.140
 this one seems to me to be the simplest for 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.140
 beginners and even for myself
