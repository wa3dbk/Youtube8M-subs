thousand<00:00:19.740> XP<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.539> that<00:00:21.539> time<00:00:21.720> frame<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.490> here

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
thousand XP in that time frame so here

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.769 
thousand XP in that time frame so here
we<00:00:23.580> go<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.970> go<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> private<00:00:24.359> match<00:00:26.779> and

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:11.260 
we can boost over close to a as soon as
this<00:03:02.080> gets<00:03:02.230> capped

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:20.740 

be<00:03:12.270> careful<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.750> your<00:03:12.810> corners

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.309 

that's<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:22.220> wait<00:03:23.220> for<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.490> get<00:03:23.670> capped

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
that's it wait for that to get capped

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.190 
that's it wait for that to get capped
and<00:03:25.319> this<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.860> why<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.100> set<00:03:26.490> it<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:27.080> 500<00:03:28.080> points

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
and this is why you set it to 500 points

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.170 
and this is why you set it to 500 points
that<00:03:28.530> way<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:31.220> keeps<00:03:32.220> down<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.640> time<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:33.030> takes

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
that way it keeps down the time it takes

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.910 
that way it keeps down the time it takes
for<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.540> hit<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:34.670> point<00:03:35.670> limit<00:03:36.920> and

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
for you to hit that point limit and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.340 
for you to hit that point limit and
that's<00:03:38.070> all<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.250> need<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.490> do<00:03:38.580> see<00:03:45.110> this<00:03:46.110> is<00:03:46.320> a

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
that's all you need to do see this is a

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:57.950 
that's all you need to do see this is a
extremely<00:03:46.770> easy<00:03:47.370> way<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:50.420> boost<00:03:51.420> wins

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.950 

there<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.650> go<00:03:58.770> just<00:03:59.240> repeat<00:04:00.240> as<00:04:00.480> much<00:04:00.690> as<00:04:00.840> you

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
there you go just repeat as much as you

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.270 
there you go just repeat as much as you
want<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:02.420> see<00:04:03.420> here<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:03.720> get<00:04:03.870> 800<00:04:04.320> XP<00:04:04.680> because

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
want and see here you get 800 XP because

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.100 
want and see here you get 800 XP because
of<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:05.550> four<00:04:05.820> C's<00:04:06.540> two<00:04:06.720> points<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:09.840> also

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
of the four C's two points it also

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.020 
of the four C's two points it also
counts<00:04:10.350> as<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> win<00:04:10.710> toward<00:04:11.250> whichever<00:04:11.730> team

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
counts as a win toward whichever team

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.190 
counts as a win toward whichever team
you're<00:04:12.060> using<00:04:13.610> and<00:04:14.610> you'll<00:04:14.850> see<00:04:17.900> at<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.050> end

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
you're using and you'll see at the end

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.410 
you're using and you'll see at the end
here<00:04:19.640> all<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.880> points<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.210> get<00:04:21.300> you

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
here all the points you get you

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.390 
here all the points you get you
typically<00:04:21.720> get<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.930> thousand<00:04:22.740> 25<00:04:23.870> so<00:04:25.190> go<00:04:26.190> over

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
typically get a thousand 25 so go over

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.330 
typically get a thousand 25 so go over
here<00:04:26.670> so<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:27.630> get<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.020> four<00:04:28.290> captures<00:04:28.830> that's

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
here so you get the four captures that's

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:36.470 
here so you get the four captures that's
800<00:04:30.410> round<00:04:31.410> win<00:04:31.590> 250<00:04:32.160> so<00:04:34.010> that's<00:04:35.010> what<00:04:35.480> 1050

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
800 round win 250 so that's what 1050

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.420 
800 round win 250 so that's what 1050
and<00:04:37.170> you<00:04:37.320> can<00:04:37.410> do<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:37.620> takes<00:04:37.860> two<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.280> half

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
and you can do that takes two and a half

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.120 
and you can do that takes two and a half
minutes<00:04:38.750> need<00:04:39.750> as<00:04:39.900> much<00:04:40.080> as<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.350> want<00:04:40.560> helps

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
minutes need as much as you want helps
