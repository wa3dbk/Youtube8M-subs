00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hello everyone, Alyona is good with you 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.840
 to my channel today I want you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.240
 to tell 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.300
 briefly about the new brand which 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.759
 I met this Ukrainian brand 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.880
 are called enterprise georg biosystems 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.890
 this enterprise produces both products 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.740
 for health, that is, pharmacy products 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.960
 so in principle 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.210
 cosmetics before in particular care was made and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.390
 they sent me several products on 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.750
 a review also sent a brochure in principle 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.730
 I tried and now I will tell you 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.510
 when I found out that this is a company from 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.880
 Donetsk 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.700
 I immediately know the first thought that this 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.340
 It will be something like Bioko at the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.649
 there is no biocoque even near me 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.660
 I liked much more than the first ones 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.760
 I decided to try this product because 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.980
 I wanted to support the domestic 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.260
 I love the manufacturer like you 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.969
 you know and principle was very interesting 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.610
 because I have such chun ok I already 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.460
 I saw such videos it was interesting 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.920
 try this makeup my tears 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.080
 VKontakte group there is in the discussion 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.030
 Do you fly around bloggers that is, I just 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.070
 on any kind of blogger can send but 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.830
 maybe no it is of course they decide 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.350
 they sent me such a cream and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.040
 movie from acne and here are such 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.600
 probnichki creams instruction 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.000
 the first thing I really liked 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.790
 this is such a movie 15 milliliters 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.540
 here from acne as you know recently u 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.300
 I had a review 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.570
 order faberlic and I took it there too 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.640
 local acne treatment and 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.820
 I compared these two means I 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.710
 used these houses means 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.740
 the same amount of time and honestly 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.470
 saying this tool helped not get rid 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.360
 from rashes much much faster then 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.250
 there are literally three days I have gone 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.280
 some rash on cheeks here but not 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.920
 all unfortunately not all and it is not the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.080
 a magic remedy that anointed and on 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.020
 next day you have a clean face 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.090
 smooth some did not know the baby ass to 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.100
 Sorry this is not true 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.830
 I want to mention that if of course 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.929
 not a living space you have on your face enormous 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.180
 the number of rashes is probably not the same 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.600
 magic wand which is for one night 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.010
 all your rashes will remove an hour in two for 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.110
 3 for 1 night 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.270
 this tool does not save therefore be to 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.900
 this is ready and I think most 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.520
 girls waiting for such funds that here 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.140
 smeared five minutes gone by and all to 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.180
 nothing in the evening and by the way I saw 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.489
 Some kind of reklamku this such 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.500
 means and there told that if 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.360
 in the afternoon, apply this agent to pimple then 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.180
 in the evening you can go on a date and 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.400
 your pimple no longer know and no trace 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.739
 I think it will remain all fairy tales and 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.450
 such tales I do not believe 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.700
 also they sent me a cream for dry 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.459
 sensitive skin speaking 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.350
 interesting cream now summer heat and in 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.900
 principle your face and need to moisturize 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.790
 even though for example if 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.430
 you have oily or combination skin 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.350
 needs moisture anyway 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.480
 chic cream walks and positioned 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.180
 as for dry sensitive skin 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.100
 It is also suitable in principle for 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.230
 oily skin because this cream 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.860
 absolutely not fat it is light I would even 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.170
 called it fluid honestly and for 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.610
 summer he also fits he really 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.580
 you 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.500
 if I have another cream of another brand 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.570
 more dense yes that is he too 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.510
 moisturizing too for dry skin 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.020
 this cream I put for example only in the 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.900
 account when we have the heat passes but what 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.910
 hot days are absolutely impossible 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.590
 enjoy that face cream though 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.690
 Of course you need to moisturize 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.090
 this cream and face need to moisturize 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.880
 calm and this cream can be used 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.070
 also under make up that huge huge 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.870
 invested me with him absolutely not 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.780
 no problem i would even say i 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.750
 He caused her to forget and after some 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.510
 The time when I put on makeup 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.300
 this is foundation or powder in principle 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.430
 I have no feeling of clogged pores from those 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.340
 or something like this is the most 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.020
 nice here is that in this cream spf15 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.120
 with peace of mind you can 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.160
 use fly 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.709
 based on sp factor as well as 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.670
 the fact that this film does not clog pores and 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:20.070
 principle absorbed moisturizes and about it 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:24.120
 you forget to be honest there is no 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.950
 feeling good cream you need to take once i 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.780
 already said more oily skin 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.160
 I will say that this company has cream 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.320
 protective moisturizing cream for normal 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.510
 and combination skin that is 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.450
 no matter how the skin news in this brand 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.480
 you can get yourself a moisturizer 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.010
 for the face that is 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.960
 whatever skin type is good too 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.000
 I liked the cream too much 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.340
 I respect this brand for what they 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.690
 released moisturizers for both 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.030
 dry or oily combination 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:05:00.450
 skin not every 3 or 5 brand produces 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:03.060
 moisturizing such means in order and 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.190
 of that type of skin that is usually with us 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.770
 for oily skin 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.110
 there is absolutely no effect 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.970
 attachments never 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.790
 revealed to most manufacturers 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.630
 cases and hydration we only for 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.240
 dry skin 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.610
 since I already started talking about haze 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.460
 I was sent an atom and a little face cream 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.950
 cream for problem skin here 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.940
 rib + white tea for daily 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.880
 of use 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.920
 psp factor says nothing here 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.740
 concept of not having the most and truth 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.560
 stronger but in this pamphlet 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.570
 sp factor is not specified, to be honest all 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.970
 these three creams my skin took on 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.370
 urale don't even know next time to whom 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.260
 I took it straight for dry 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.940
 Whether cream sensitive skin is to 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.240
 normal and combination skin 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.910
 that is, when we usually pick up the cream 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.950
 based on your type if you don't know 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.740
 your type if you can not decide 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:01.690
 It seems either of these two creams 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:04.640
 which contain themselves moisturizing yes how 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.560
 manufacturer claims any of this cream 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.510
 Should in principle come I am not 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.840
 I guarantee that it will suit one hundred 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.720
 percent God forbid I still advise there 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.000
 it won't suit you, but it seems to me worth it 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.980
 try it uniquely and separately 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.690
 I want to say what and even if 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.340
 you oily and combination skin 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.980
 during the day you can use the cream with 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.620
 a matting effect and for the night for example 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.360
 moisturizing effect just like i already 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.040
 said even oily skin needs 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.380
 in moistening 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.200
 on me two such probnichka creams 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.750
 Hand and honey agaric points luxury firm 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.700
 principle I liked the heels in 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.810
 summertime need to look after never 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.930
 forget about it 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.240
 if we talk about hand care i can 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.230
 neglect varnishes I can give my 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.170

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.450
 rest i can short cut the nails but 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.220
 hand creams I was put in no way 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.380
 case not neglect because hands

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.370
 younger age there 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.510
