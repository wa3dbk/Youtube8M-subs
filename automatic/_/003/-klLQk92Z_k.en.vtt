trapped<00:01:41.440> into<00:01:41.710> one<00:01:42.190> song<00:01:42.490> it's<00:01:43.240> only<00:01:43.420> because

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
trapped into one song it's only because

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.360 
trapped into one song it's only because
they<00:01:43.870> don't<00:01:43.900> build<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.530> vehicle<00:01:45.040> if<00:01:45.160> to

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
they don't build the vehicle if to

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.000 
they don't build the vehicle if to
create<00:01:45.730> that<00:01:46.180> you<00:01:47.140> never<00:01:47.320> say<00:01:47.500> like<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.860> got

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
create that you never say like you got

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.530 
create that you never say like you got
to<00:01:48.100> create<00:01:48.400> that<00:01:48.610> vehicle<00:01:49.150> and<00:01:49.270> that's<00:01:49.420> what

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
to create that vehicle and that's what

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.630 
to create that vehicle and that's what
I'm<00:01:49.630> saying<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:49.900> think<00:01:49.990> that<00:01:50.260> this<00:01:50.560> is<00:01:50.800> this<00:01:51.580> is

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
I'm saying I think that this is this is

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.330 
I'm saying I think that this is this is
jagged-edged<00:01:52.360> way<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:52.750> create<00:01:53.440> that<00:01:53.710> the

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
jagged-edged way to create that the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.940 
jagged-edged way to create that the
vehicle<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.910> make<00:01:55.090> people<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.229> see<00:01:56.530> them<00:01:56.740> at

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
vehicle to make people and I see them at

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:24.420 
vehicle to make people and I see them at
different<00:01:57.370> light<00:01:57.550> as<00:01:57.729> opposed<00:01:58.120> to<00:01:58.300> just<00:01:58.570> like

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.460
