00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.540
 Today is a big family reunion at the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.790
 Neustädtern where you meet in the test game 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.960
 against tus koblenz and his brother 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.980
 daniel and his father Peter is 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.199
 namely coach here 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.890
 and then got a few gates of the still 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.720
 visit by his wife moment actually 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.350
 I had them in a different way 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.260
 memory 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.810
 Well, we'll come to Schalke later 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.760
 started with timo hildebrand to highland 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.070
 higher of the santana and cola she naked 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.829
 leon goretzka jermaine jones im 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:41.160
 Midfield and front swirled bastos 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:44.190
 farfan huntelaar and sala and schalke 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.270
 started strongly jones - on salei the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.289
 loses the ball 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.239
 but from behind comes tim hoogland and 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:55.610
 the first warning shot in the direction 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.610
 koblenz goal first minute 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.950
 seven minutes later our captain with 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.600
 the opening pass in the top 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.890
 Salai and catch a great one 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.020
 combination and then it is down free 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.140
 and when she does not believe me but I believe 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.440
 I almost share a body he copies 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.420
 the ball 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.470
 in the net 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.619
 1 0 thanks for royal blue so it should 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.619
 go on 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.420
 it was almost fifteen minutes played 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.810
 and the Schalke are pushing hard 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.920
 tempo 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.600
 the hunter on salei and the 2 0 for the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.400
 Schalke 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.340
 a great interplay between the 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.750
 both storm tops as if they were 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.640
 have always played together 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.350
 especially in this initial phase, the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.210
 royal blue the regional alligists 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.970
 clearly the class difference 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:59.590
 revealed 20 minute ball pastors and 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.590
 Benedict Höwedes in the second attempt 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.950
 1 pm for royal blue 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.800
 and how are they going to be in the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.590
 see repetition 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.660
 the first time it does not hurt any 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.650
 chance for him and then with the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.320
 second attempt at net goalkeeper paucken 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.840
 without any chance but she could 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.060
 later, jones will excel on the trade 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.990
 and the dutch for the first to the second 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:34.000
 times and the koblenzer keeper parried 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:38.230
 legally again cramming with the far 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.390
 tee off leon goretzka misjudges 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.550
 here with the breast extension and on 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.290
 once koblenz stumped by patrick 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.290
 the chance for a goal hit 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.340
 otherwise the koblenzer are in the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.990
 first half rather by rough fouls 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.840
 noticed it here 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.880
 leon goretzka should be painfully experienced 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.730
 an unsightly scene to part 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.220
 really koblenzer the one rubric 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.800
 or other times a bit over-motivated across 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.410
 over the legs and through the legs 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.000
 flew our Schalke 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.100
 result of treatment for several minutes and 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.170
 a thread bruise on the left leg 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.360
 good improvement that was it from the first one 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.630
 halftime daniel neustädter leaves from 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.680
 place and his brother roman comes 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.160
 Although still a few teething problems 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.050
 with the jersey but while coach jens 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.420
 Keller German Jones explains that he still 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.350
 a half time should play then 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.970
 finally done 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.770
 on we go 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.290
 and the tight ones do that as they do 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.810
 Klingingen has stopped with the flank 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.780
 in the 16s and somehow the ball comes 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.760
 to marco höger but the host comes 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.620
 no right pressure behind the ball 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.080
 but right after the connection 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.240
 the koblenzer so fast that the camera 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.180
 almost does not follow and curves 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.770
 kevin lahn almost the entire defense and 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.660
 it suddenly stands one in three 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.660
 barely an hour played 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.560
 but thank god we have ours 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.550
 teemu pukki also came on 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.590
 neustädter with the ball win in 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:17.410
 midfield and the fin with a 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.410
 beautiful schlenzer in the right corner 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.700
 66 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.700
 a dream gate 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:33.310
 five minutes later and china beautiful 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:36.400
 pushed through by clemens and then 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.169
 it pats right on the subject of profi 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.139
 forgives the next chance 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.680
 yes it he will ride on the back 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.680
 dream 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.050
 eight minutes before closing then the last one 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.669
 Chance of the royal blue clemens I bet 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.660
 good again over the right wing 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:04.440
 and again it is okay and unfortunately has to 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.060
 you say again it is needed 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.229
 the koblenzer with a strong performance 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:14.080
 in the gate of a larger residue 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.630
 has baffled in koblenz 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.460
 handshake between father and son and 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.570
 for roman neustädter has this game 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.690
 something special, of course, all the way 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.009
 many years apart that one earlier 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.210
 said that we will be together someday 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.650
 but they were standing in one place 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.199
 's funny together and now 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.090
 it has happened and that of course 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:37.030
 a nice if you can see that all 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.770
 see three in the football field and 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.050
 that you meet again is indeed 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.949
 the first time and also from me 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.669
 also happen more often 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.720
 the stupid thing was just that your daddy and 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.039
 jens keller is in the right place 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.340
 have agreed that their two 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.930
 I have not met suddenly 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.120
 so that's football is all right 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.320
 simply is the preparation since then 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.909
 took me into consideration even though 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.650
 that's why family needs us full 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.120
 focus on the game no matter who 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.159
 which coach faces which one 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.300
 players and that's why we have to do each one 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.729
 play as tackle as it also halt 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.210
 have made nothing with the agreement 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.710
 do I know the slices 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.150
 even before the game signals that the 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.919
 will play two halves i have 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.099
 with whether the novel first or the 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:20.139
 But the second half in plays for thy 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.669
 Poor is then magic with painting too 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.460
 just replaced after half-time 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:27.159
 because the rent was not like me 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.470
 the imaginary looking sword still quite 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:31.210
 play fast forward and that was 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.740
 not my plan actually has 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.110
 the second half at the same time 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.370
 implemented and with the hero's place I 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.740
 a little different 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.340
 The coach then has to be tougher than 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.810
 The dad might like it 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.330
 the hardness the guys know exactly 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.280
 how hard I'm there I can 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.810
 also pats but it is clear 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.610
 you have to tune the performance on the 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.930
 place but as I said that was for us 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.240
 a very good test 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.700
 how do you see the development of roman? 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.590
 very well on the hook 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.950
 I'm happy for him makes easy 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.330
 just watching fun as he was there 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.920
 the beginning of the last season against the 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.670
 national team stormed that was 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.150
 sensational 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.980
 yeah that has earlier me where I 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.770
 probably still in gladbach has played 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.630
 I was still nervous about the stands 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.820
 but now was not in the game in series 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.080
 then i just have big joy and 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.870
 has the small big flap because 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.730
 they only lost one too much 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.980
 I think he has seen that he still 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.560
 something is missing and what he has to work on 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:33.490
 and I hope that the two also have one 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:36.640
 good as well and then it would still be 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:39.490
 to understand the matter with the help of the clarify 

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.440
 she was just a fan but if he found 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.230
 is also very funny and then has 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.030
 Do not ask too long 

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:49.050
 There were no wedding rings for 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:52.050
 laura from worms but a rare one 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.050
 souvenir
