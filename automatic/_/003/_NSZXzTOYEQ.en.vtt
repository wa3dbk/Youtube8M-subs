00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
you can remove so that's it almost my

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.760 
you can remove so that's it almost my
battery<00:01:21.039> is<00:01:21.069> almost<00:01:21.310> out<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:23.049> now<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.409> next

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
battery is almost out and now the next

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.019 
battery is almost out and now the next
step<00:01:25.109> it's<00:01:26.109> to<00:01:26.380> remove<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.889> cables<00:01:27.279> it's<00:01:27.700> very

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:28.029 
step it's to remove the cables it's very

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:32.809 
step it's to remove the cables it's very
important<00:01:28.569> to<00:01:29.289> remove<00:01:29.529> the<00:01:29.740> positive<00:01:29.950> before

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.230 

because<00:01:33.819> we<00:01:34.749> don't<00:01:34.959> want<00:01:35.109> it<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.349> touch<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
because we don't want it to touch and

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.059 
because we don't want it to touch and
you<00:01:37.389> have<00:01:37.539> to<00:01:37.659> be<00:01:37.779> careful<00:01:38.200> so<00:01:38.409> your<00:01:38.560> socket

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
you have to be careful so your socket

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.289 
you have to be careful so your socket
once<00:01:39.340> you're<00:01:40.149> removing<00:01:41.219> the<00:01:42.219> positive<00:01:42.700> so<00:01:43.179> it

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
once you're removing the positive so it

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.099 
once you're removing the positive so it
doesn't<00:01:43.599> touch<00:01:43.719> any<00:01:45.119> metal<00:01:46.119> parts<00:01:46.479> around<00:01:46.869> it

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
doesn't touch any metal parts around it

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.620 
doesn't touch any metal parts around it
so<00:01:47.289> we<00:01:48.130> really<00:01:48.159> have<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.609> be<00:01:48.729> careful<00:01:49.179> and

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
so we really have to be careful and

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.459 
so we really have to be careful and
we're<00:01:50.560> going<00:01:50.709> to<00:01:50.799> use<00:01:50.950> for<00:01:51.219> this<00:01:52.469> eight

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
we're going to use for this eight

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.760 
we're going to use for this eight
millimeter<00:01:53.979> socket<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.409> we're<00:01:56.590> going<00:01:56.679> to

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
millimeter socket so we're going to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.000 
millimeter socket so we're going to
start<00:01:57.219> by

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.840 

when<00:02:01.000> it<00:02:01.150> slowly-slowly<00:02:02.250> now<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.280> can<00:02:03.520> do<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.670> by

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
when it slowly-slowly now I can do it by

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.960 
when it slowly-slowly now I can do it by
hand<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:05.310> we're<00:02:06.310> going<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.520> do<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.760> same

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
hand and we're going to do the same

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:17.930 
hand and we're going to do the same
thing<00:02:07.860> for<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:09.640> negative<00:02:10.060> side<00:02:14.190> okay<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:16.590> now

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
thing for the negative side okay and now

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.420 
thing for the negative side okay and now
there's<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.990> protector<00:02:20.590> over<00:02:20.740> here<00:02:21.070> it's

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
only clipped with the thing like that so

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.690 
only clipped with the thing like that so
it's<00:02:25.570> very<00:02:25.720> easy<00:02:25.960> to<00:02:26.170> remove<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.740> there<00:02:27.640> you
