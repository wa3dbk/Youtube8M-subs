00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
so the first progression progression

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.560 
so the first progression progression
number<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.439> minor<00:00:30.260> G<00:00:31.759> F<00:00:34.190> G

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
number one is going to be a minor G F G

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:46.220 
number one is going to be a minor G F G
I'll<00:00:36.570> pull<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.230> again<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:38.180> minor<00:00:39.180> G<00:00:41.870> F<00:00:43.550> G<00:00:45.230> he's

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
I'll pull it again a minor G F G he's

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.069 
I'll pull it again a minor G F G he's
like<00:00:46.590> hey<00:00:47.399> everybody<00:00:47.640> cut<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.840> first

progression<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:49.950> therefore<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.879> makes<00:00:51.090> me

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
progression and therefore that makes me

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.299 
progression and therefore that makes me
cooler<00:00:51.539> than<00:00:51.899> all<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.199> other<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.800> there

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:15.910 
show you like how we break up the chords
I'm<00:03:14.720> going<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.900> play<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.110> like<00:03:15.230> twice<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.769> then

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
I'm going to play it like twice and then

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:31.870 
I'm going to play it like twice and then
hopefully<00:03:16.160> you'll<00:03:16.430> get<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.670> she<00:03:16.819> goes<00:03:25.870> this<00:03:30.880> is

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
hopefully you'll get it she goes this is

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.670 
hopefully you'll get it she goes this is
it

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:53.740 

so<00:03:36.680> that's<00:03:36.860> how<00:03:36.980> you<00:03:37.040> break<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.430> up<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:53.540> break

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
so that's how you break it up so break

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.319 
so that's how you break it up so break
it<00:03:53.870> up<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.079> where<00:03:54.200> you<00:03:54.260> go<00:03:54.440> when<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.489> say<00:03:55.760> the

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
it up to where you go when you say the

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.630 
it up to where you go when you say the
ring<00:03:56.599> and<00:03:56.870> offer<00:03:57.019> ring<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.680> hit<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.010> minor

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
ring and offer ring you hit the minor

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:10.110 
ring and offer ring you hit the minor
this<00:04:00.940> C<00:04:01.940> minor<00:04:02.180> where<00:04:03.170> is<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:04.310> F<00:04:07.030> melismatic<00:04:08.030> I

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
this C minor where is it F melismatic I

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.000 
this C minor where is it F melismatic I
like<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.239> add<00:04:11.359> that<00:04:11.389> just<00:04:12.170> for<00:04:12.319> flavor<00:04:12.590> and

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
like to add that just for flavor and

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.150 
like to add that just for flavor and
then<00:04:14.000> we<00:04:14.180> go<00:04:14.329> into<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.720> course<00:04:14.959> which<00:04:15.799> is<00:04:16.010> the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
then we go into the course which is the

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:37.620 
then we go into the course which is the
second<00:04:17.049> progression<00:04:18.049> we<00:04:18.169> go<00:04:18.880> this<00:04:19.880> is<00:04:20.180> a<00:04:20.209> kid

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.689 

all<00:04:38.630> right<00:04:38.840> now<00:04:39.500> that<00:04:39.680> sounded<00:04:40.130> kind<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.460> bad

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
all right now that sounded kind of bad

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.300 
all right now that sounded kind of bad
because<00:04:41.060> I'm<00:04:41.540> sick<00:04:41.930> andum<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:42.860> can't<00:04:43.190> really

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
because I'm sick andum so I can't really

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.560 
because I'm sick andum so I can't really
sing<00:04:43.550> that<00:04:43.699> part<00:04:43.910> right<00:04:44.000> but<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.300> chords

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
sing that part right but the chords

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.000 
sing that part right but the chords
alright<00:04:44.870> it<00:04:45.020> just<00:04:45.199> sounded<00:04:45.410> funky<00:04:45.740> cuz<00:04:45.919> I

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
alright it just sounded funky cuz I

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.129 
alright it just sounded funky cuz I
can't<00:04:46.250> sing<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.550> right<00:04:46.729> I<00:04:46.940> find<00:04:47.570> that<00:04:47.720> a<00:04:47.780> lot<00:04:48.020> of

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
can't sing it right I find that a lot of

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.920 
can't sing it right I find that a lot of
times<00:04:48.380> people<00:04:48.620> mistake<00:04:49.510> chords<00:04:50.510> for<00:04:50.690> being

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
times people mistake chords for being

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.540 
times people mistake chords for being
wrong<00:04:51.199> because<00:04:51.500> they're<00:04:51.889> having<00:04:52.220> trouble

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
wrong because they're having trouble

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.640 
wrong because they're having trouble
getting<00:04:52.669> into<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.120> key<00:04:53.330> um<00:04:54.139> so<00:04:54.410> they're<00:04:54.530> not

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
getting into the key um so they're not

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.750 
getting into the key um so they're not
having<00:04:54.770> trouble<00:04:54.979> singing<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:55.610> right

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
having trouble singing it right

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.070 
having trouble singing it right
therefore<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.150> chords<00:04:56.419> sound<00:04:56.600> wrong<00:04:56.810> I

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
therefore the chords sound wrong I

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.200 
therefore the chords sound wrong I
should<00:04:57.560> know<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:57.710> experienced<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.280> a<00:04:58.340> lot<00:04:58.610> so

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
should know I experienced that a lot so

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.700 
should know I experienced that a lot so
don't<00:04:59.570> worry<00:04:59.810> that<00:04:59.960> is<00:05:00.020> definitely<00:05:00.470> right

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
don't worry that is definitely right

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.439 
don't worry that is definitely right
okay<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.220> then<00:05:01.310> we<00:05:01.460> go<00:05:01.610> into<00:05:01.789> back<00:05:02.060> into<00:05:02.330> the

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
okay and then we go into back into the

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.450 
okay and then we go into back into the
verse<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:03.080> second<00:05:03.380> verse<00:05:03.530> has<00:05:03.800> is<00:05:04.100> the<00:05:04.250> same

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
verse the second verse has is the same

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.110 
verse the second verse has is the same
first<00:05:04.910> progression<00:05:05.479> with<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.789> time<00:05:07.789> reasons

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
first progression with the time reasons

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.279 
first progression with the time reasons
I'm<00:05:08.240> not<00:05:08.270> gonna<00:05:08.510> run<00:05:08.750> you<00:05:08.900> through<00:05:08.930> stuff<00:05:09.260> that

like<00:06:05.700> everything's<00:06:06.420> an<00:06:06.540> eight<00:06:06.630> count<00:06:06.810> so<00:06:06.990> you

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
like everything's an eight count so you

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.320 
like everything's an eight count so you
just<00:06:07.230> play<00:06:07.380> it<00:06:07.470> twice<00:06:07.970> all<00:06:08.970> right<00:06:09.120> now<00:06:09.210> we're

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
just play it twice all right now we're

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.630
