00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.369 
you when I think about content creation
it<00:03:48.459> all<00:03:48.609> comes<00:03:48.910> down<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.090> engagement<00:03:49.569> so

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
it all comes down to engagement so

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.809 
it all comes down to engagement so
similarly<00:03:50.859> to<00:03:51.280> as<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.459> was<00:03:51.579> describing

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
similarly to as I was describing

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.360 
similarly to as I was describing
relationships<00:03:52.659> being<00:03:52.870> at<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.139> core<00:03:53.409> content

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
relationships being at the core content

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.280 
relationships being at the core content
creation<00:03:54.699> has<00:03:55.090> really<00:03:55.629> got<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.959> be<00:03:56.079> at<00:03:56.169> the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
creation has really got to be at the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.409 
creation has really got to be at the
core<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.769> why<00:03:57.430> that's<00:03:57.639> important<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:58.359> because

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
core and why that's important is because

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.189 
core and why that's important is because
the<00:03:58.870> quality<00:03:59.319> of<00:03:59.349> that<00:03:59.530> content<00:04:00.010> builds<00:04:00.849> trust

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
the quality of that content builds trust

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.619 
the quality of that content builds trust
it<00:04:02.199> builds<00:04:02.709> communication<00:04:03.699> it<00:04:04.030> builds

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
it builds communication it builds

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.619 
it builds communication it builds
engagement<00:04:05.349> and<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:06.250> quality<00:04:06.579> content<00:04:07.269> is<00:04:07.389> so

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
engagement and the quality content is so

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.659 
engagement and the quality content is so
critical<00:04:08.139> if<00:04:08.409> i<00:04:08.560> were<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.859> think<00:04:09.069> about<00:04:09.340> one

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
critical if i were to think about one

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.399 
critical if i were to think about one
key<00:04:10.000> piece<00:04:10.209> of<00:04:10.269> information<00:04:10.690> that<00:04:11.169> i<00:04:11.199> would

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
key piece of information that i would

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:12.190 
key piece of information that i would
share

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
share

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.830 
share
there<00:04:12.349> will<00:04:12.440> be<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.530> lot<00:04:12.830> more<00:04:12.860> in<00:04:13.550> session<00:04:14.120> it's

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
there will be a lot more in session it's

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.340 
there will be a lot more in session it's
really<00:04:15.459> packing<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.730> really<00:04:17.450> tight<00:04:17.690> punch<00:04:17.959> when

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
really packing a really tight punch when

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.990 
really packing a really tight punch when
you're<00:04:18.440> creating<00:04:18.620> content<00:04:19.130> and<00:04:19.609> what<00:04:19.820> that

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
you're creating content and what that

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.180 
you're creating content and what that
means<00:04:20.269> is<00:04:20.570> it's<00:04:21.079> thinking<00:04:21.470> about<00:04:21.799> in<00:04:22.100> the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
means is it's thinking about in the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.950 
means is it's thinking about in the
digital<00:04:22.340> world<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:23.150> importance<00:04:23.810> of

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
digital world the importance of

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.650 
digital world the importance of
bite-size<00:04:24.590> chunks<00:04:24.620> of<00:04:25.250> content<00:04:25.790> it's<00:04:26.450> not

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
bite-size chunks of content it's not

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.140 
bite-size chunks of content it's not
long<00:04:27.169> novels<00:04:27.680> that's<00:04:28.040> a<00:04:28.160> different<00:04:28.550> form<00:04:28.880> and

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
long novels that's a different form and

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.210 
long novels that's a different form and
certainly<00:04:29.810> an<00:04:29.930> important<00:04:30.380> form<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:30.800> content

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
certainly an important form of content

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.040 
certainly an important form of content
creation<00:04:31.520> but<00:04:32.210> it's<00:04:32.360> thinking<00:04:32.690> about<00:04:32.900> the

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
creation but it's thinking about the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.200 
creation but it's thinking about the
bite-size<00:04:33.650> chunks<00:04:33.680> kind<00:04:34.460> of<00:04:34.550> like<00:04:34.639> a<00:04:34.669> meal<00:04:35.060> I

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
bite-size chunks kind of like a meal I

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.350 
bite-size chunks kind of like a meal I
guess<00:04:36.070> what<00:04:37.070> are<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.310> pieces<00:04:37.550> that<00:04:37.790> you<00:04:38.030> want

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
guess what are the pieces that you want

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.090 
guess what are the pieces that you want
to<00:04:38.419> be<00:04:38.510> able<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.780> share<00:04:39.110> with<00:04:39.919> your<00:04:40.070> audience
