00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.730
 very good people another video more here 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:12.290
 we are destiny but this time 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:16.230
 We are going back back back back to 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.020
 the earth and we are going to do a mission 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.990
 which is called patrolling the cosmodrome 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.360
 ok and it's a little different from the others 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.970
 that we have seen the others are missions 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.270
 concrete and here we are going to find 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.850
 with the whole map to be able to explore without 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.269
 no any 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.150
 without any limitation or anything but here 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:43.490
 they are not going to send us missions 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.750
 little by little we have that there is a place we 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.040
 sent an emission type 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.330
 but he sends you another type of mission and this 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.770
 this type of broadcast do 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.770
 Normally to search 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.640
 in reputation as the vanguard 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.830
 for a type of object that afterwards 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.290
 you need to be able to buy then that 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.930
 reputation has to go up as was 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.540
 on earth in this way it also 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.130
 get bio metal which is an object that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.890
 If you collect it later, they give you 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.909
 something else exactly does not stay 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.980
 I have to look at it 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.580
 let's 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.580
 watch 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.289
 let's see let's see it in a 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.289
 just like that 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.289
 quickly 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.250
 and we have already been seeing all the 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.890
 missions of the earth we have done 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.570
 also the missions of two missions of 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.630
 the moon if I do not remember 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.729
 so we know how the moon is in the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.729
 moon there is another kind of mission like this 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.880
 to raise reputation of another faction 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.670
 that is something that I would like to follow 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.810
 looking 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.810
 because it's something that 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.340
 I'm interested in a lot of good 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.770
 when we are widgets on the fly 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.410
 attention to the green we have to look 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:22.780
 beacons I feel good 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:24.880
 and those beatings are what are going to give us 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.510
 the missions 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.510
 OK 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.930
 the other performs there so it's not going to 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.930
 have to load what they are here 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.189
 we're not going to give him anything 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.069
 ah 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.240
 we never passed there true 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.299
 ah 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:26.250
 well here we have a beacon to see that 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.250
 they send us to do it 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.090
 guardian is a large shadow is projected 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.659
 we see our eyes 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.659
 let's investigate 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.810
 and here I'm not going to 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.989
 they are much more 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.400
 because they are missions that can be a 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.400
 a series of enemies 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:59.319
 to kill also some who come out 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.319
 they are very concrete things 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.210
 and this I see I always collect the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.990
 field what is it used for? 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.990
 we see it already 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.530
 I do not want to be with this 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.530
 do not 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.530
 on our way 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.140
 has been better with what I'm looking for 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.140
 but let's have 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.000
 I was wrong 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:01.659
 it's a place that we 're leaving 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.659
 some videos of the girlfriend of gas won 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.140
 I have to catch the speed 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.980
 one year for this 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.230
 well I will get 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.100
 on another site and I'm here doing 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.100
 the fool 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.650
 from the base 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:59.309
 well let's go to grain 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.730
 to the best way 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.240
 very well 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.240
 you are right 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.810
 here 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.430
 normal 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.900
 I will be here also on a mission 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.900
 so few 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:57.840
 the misery and the accusation 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.340
 and that's it and the type of 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.020
 mission 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.330
 if we want missions for what I said 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:10.030
 look if you have bay there are different 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:13.360
 different as it is called that I do not get 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:15.490
 of different types of symbols that 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.080
 represent a type of broadcast here 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:21.740
 They can also help us with 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.780
 the random events that come out because 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.330
 this map mode is very good because 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.819
 can say three even six if 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:32.110
 are things like that to explore and such could 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:34.150
 do several patrols 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.200
 with a group of chapeau of these six 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.050
 people and could be doing 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.500
 missions and I could talk and if and if it comes out 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:43.930
 an event as the likes and you can 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.420
 complete more easily so nothing 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.680
 this is what I wanted to teach you is a 

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.500
 video 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.920
 a little much more because I want to separate 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.100
 what each mission and each 

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.620
 and each topic and nothing I hope that I have 

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.110
 liked that you are liking the series as 

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.690
 I 'm doing it and nothing and we no longer see 

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:07.670
 the next chapter that we will return to 

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.670
 the moon until then
