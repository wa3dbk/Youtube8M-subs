00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:36.960

 the scissors and contact the print 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.410
 choose 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.530
 I chose this one, not only do you measure 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.230
 the front size the end of the agenda 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.360
 so here the start capada 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.850
 part of the background from the beginning of the background here 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.620
 There you will measure the sheet up here and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.410
 leave one centimeter to each side 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.869
 left over to be able to fold in 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.110
 I cut here that the size I need 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.640
 Look, I 've already cut through coming. 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.619
 easier for you to see looks 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.350
 positioning it is because it is 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.880
 true that of paper that is for power 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 put in an inch to 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.069
 each side drop or laptop that people 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.080
 will begin with the part of the spring not 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.490
 knows a whole little eyrie here in the folder 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.750
 long 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.849
 I'm going to turn the agenda or centralized 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.640
 leaving one centimeter left for each 

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:39.679
 side and right here at the beginning of the hole 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.170
 not to cover the hole positioned so only 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:46.470
 pressed for the contact to gather law 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.080
 the first part is now the same 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.599
 procedure that we always do goes 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.020
 gradually releasing, not realizing 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:57.830
 get blisters if you stand up with 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:03.179
 tati and cola again 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:08.940
 realizing very quickly to give another 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:13.019
 face to your schedule ended up neighbor 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.069
 now we're going to put her to stay 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.819
 best 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:22.049
 You will pick up now here at this end 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:28.189
 here and we will cut a triangle 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:31.680
 so it is well renders, look how it got 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:36.269
 I'll do the same thing from the other side. 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.620
 Look, I took that shot in 2011 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.420
 points out that the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.420
 now just turn it on 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:52.349
 is the same in the other two 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:54.989
 good done it forward is ready 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.640
 and we'll repeat that same pachÃº 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.150
 here behind 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.859
 already faced the two sides now let's go 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.849
 part of the finish I took a piece 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:08.969
 of white contact and cut in that size 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.790
 and right look here in 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:14.310
 from the beginning here of the holes to 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.810
 leaving think half a centimeter in 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.400
 each side here 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.560
 I will not let go of this contact. 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.859
 procedure is the same when people 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.629
 will make ahead to the square of the verse 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:33.989
 accent this larger side will position 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:37.340
 yields to the holes and always leaving 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.620
 half a centimeter to each side and 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.959
 Press and from here to the rest you already 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.019
 they know that they are partners and that 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.680
 contacting so that it is not 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.829
 with bubbles slowly so as not to 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.650
 It's very easy and very fast. 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.799
 you have a new agenda in a few 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.779
 minutes and spending very little and without 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.099
 Tell you what it's gonna look like, right? 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:03.120
 can choose the print that most 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.040
 loaded 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.400
 and ends up being personalized agenda to 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.970
 your face and look at the finish 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.129
 perfect and let's do the same thing 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.199
 on the reverse now we go from 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.269
 writing you can put it in the 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.620
 in front of whatever you want you looked at 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.350
 more money you can vote agenda 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.389
 2014 or if you looked at a notebook you 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.449
 will put the title you want 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.580
 the contact itself on the back or 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.620
 This is a piece here. 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.860
 you come several letters 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.530
 if you want it's just you cut and 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.199
 look and it's already right look it's already 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.690
 until the contrary they can see that pp 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.430
 it's the opposite for when you take it 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.169
 He's going to stick to the right side. 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.330
 so you can crop if you do not 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.520
 I want because I think it 's so over 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.100
 spending a lot of paper contact you can 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.020
 to draw freehand in another contact 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.160
 in the same color you want to do 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.860
 your letters 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.120
 I chose this rose you can come here 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.919
 I do not ask because you do not want to 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.850
 cut the letters you can pick up a 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.680
 pen and draw free love as in 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.750
 my wrote videos 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.020
 so I can select the size that 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.030
 I just want to be based on the 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.490
 and draw the letter what 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.039
 you want and as you want 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.919
 the squares already give you a size 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.740
 Right, I wrote more or less state 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:29.280
 no reflection 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:32.070
 here the role of best has many letters 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.860
 that it was not advisable to see one of a 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.870
 'mistake' o I started doing s 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.320
 there you draw the letter in the format 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.930
 you want and trim you can crop 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.150
 same procedure positions on top of the 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.760
 agenda and rope any way you want 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.419
 I already have a team ready to I 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.090
 posted her picture looks with the letters 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.849
 Be the little flowers down here. 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.050
 I cut a round one round 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:02.039
 yellow 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.930
 and I say more drops five drops even of 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.840
 same letter color and maintains a 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.080
 flower and put my line 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.210

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.490
 Fey also other things

 Look at another picture. This is a 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.160
 I keep writing a checkerboard that I 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.130
 I thought at home I was playing too. 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.160
 I chose this flower print and head 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.500
 another floral agenda is also 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.800
 beautiful answering also the finish 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.510
 and it would only be that I did not write 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.070
 Nothing I have not decided yet that I'm going 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.229
 use this pad 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.360

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.550
