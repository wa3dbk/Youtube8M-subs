00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.710
 hello youtube friends today 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.870
 I will teach how to repair a hearing aid 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.620
 good today I have these 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.190
 headphones 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.390
 well apparently we in a given that is 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.230
 the left side is supposed 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.230
 is this 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.300
 to know what he has in 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.670
 essence first thing is here let's see is 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.099
 that this part of our damage if it 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.600
 look that is in good condition we proceed 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.930
 to the union 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.380
 where do the other two cables come from? 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.280
 it is this part 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:42.400
 sometimes it happens here now we see in these 2 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.240
 and these parts look good 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.520
 proceed to the part near the hearing aid 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.160
 there are times that here is until the 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.950
 exposed wires what is easier to 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.680
 identify if we do not proceed to 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.910
 check the horns but in this case 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.910
 we remove the gummy 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.000
 and as we see 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.060
 you have to try it in the kitchen to see 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.670
 if it is not the kitchen that is damaged 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.650
 to check 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.200
 what they can do 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.840
 with a tester putting the tips in a 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.360
 side to see if it's still running 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.610
 if they do not have a tester at hand and not 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.630
 they have who the expression of that good 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.630
 do something always 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.680
 if they have another speaker and at hand 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.689
 can desolder the colon and 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.090
 put them to the new kitchen 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.220
 if it sounds because the stop once set 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.490
 in this case we are going to remove the one that we 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.490
 it serves 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.549
 and I will put the proposed one time 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.549
 so that I do not look 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.780
 Well, he's already a soldier 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.039
 the kitchen then is in the kitchen that 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.799
 serve us 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.819
 let's replace it with this one is the one 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:18.579
 serves us in this and serve 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.260
 they may not look the same but I have 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.139
 tried to get one that sounds 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.180
 similar or similar then we do not know 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.740
 will make the difference with this then 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.900
 we are going to place this new 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.900
 and see how 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.030
 have to be very careful not to 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.470
 are going to lose the cables without 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.520
 do not take us for a bath 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.840
 in this case 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.050
 it is a blue and the golden natural copper 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.640
 they can identify them and then we go 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.640
 to weld them to see how 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.939
 I've already soldered it before closing it and 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:16.719
 put everything we will proceed to test use 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.719
 on your player 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.230
 [Music] 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.230
 good that side that served 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:34.219
 how do you see this side if it sounds let's see this 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.219
 yes 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.860
 [Music] 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:46.250
 they also serve good you once 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.380
 verified that very carefully they close 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.840
 again eye have to have a lot 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.290
 careful because the speakers have a 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.680
 part and all 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.930
 this part that has some kind of rubber 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.629
 resin is to protect two cables 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.829
 disassembled that go towards the horn this 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:08.109
 it serves to make them more careful 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.849
 then if they realize all the 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.090
 hearing aids have to have a space 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.790
 so that this part fits in then 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.970
 let's proceed to make this part fit 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.350
 here 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.940
 and keeping it that way 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.940
 we put the gummie 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.699
 Sometimes it will cost to put the rubber band 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.740
 good 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.980
 and gradually no 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.009
 but as you see it is already affecting gummy 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.960
 and I continue 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.240
 I hope you liked it, do not forget 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.939
