00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
mixture is going to resemble like a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.970 
mixture is going to resemble like a
pancake<00:02:24.030> batter<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.440> what's<00:02:25.740> great<00:02:25.950> about

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
pancake batter so what's great about

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.070 
pancake batter so what's great about
this<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.550> could<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:26.910> all<00:02:27.150> by<00:02:27.180> hand<00:02:27.690> and

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
this you could do this all by hand and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.140 
this you could do this all by hand and
it<00:02:28.350> should<00:02:28.500> take<00:02:28.680> about<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.250> good<00:02:29.610> two<00:02:29.940> minutes

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
it should take about a good two minutes

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.070 
it should take about a good two minutes
or<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:31.610> now<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.670> want<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.060> slowly<00:02:33.330> whisk<00:02:33.750> in

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
or so now you want to slowly whisk in

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.050 
or so now you want to slowly whisk in

piece of saran wrap pressed directly

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.900 
piece of saran wrap pressed directly
onto<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.290> surface<00:03:09.830> of<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.100> batter<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.760> that

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
onto the surface of the batter so that

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.780 
onto the surface of the batter so that
it'll<00:03:11.090> prevent<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.720> skin<00:03:12.049> from<00:03:12.290> forming<00:03:12.790> once

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
it'll prevent a skin from forming once

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.430 
it'll prevent a skin from forming once
done<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.150> want<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.569> place<00:03:14.780> this<00:03:15.019> into<00:03:15.260> the

done you want to place this into the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.680 
done you want to place this into the
refrigerator<00:03:15.560> overnight<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.910> rest<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.480> it'll

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
refrigerator overnight to rest and it'll

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.759 
refrigerator overnight to rest and it'll
also<00:03:17.870> allow<00:03:18.019> your<00:03:18.530> batter<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.980> firm<00:03:19.220> up<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.489> bit

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
also allow your batter to firm up a bit

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.320 
also allow your batter to firm up a bit
so<00:03:21.769> it's<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.130> following<00:03:22.340> day<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.030> now<00:03:23.209> I'm

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
so it's the following day and now I'm

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330 
so it's the following day and now I'm
just<00:03:23.510> using<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:24.019> melon<00:03:24.380> baller<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.860> scoop<00:03:25.160> out

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
just using a melon baller to scoop out

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.970 
just using a melon baller to scoop out
my<00:03:25.489> dough<00:03:25.660> now<00:03:26.660> this<00:03:26.930> batter<00:03:27.260> does<00:03:27.650> spread<00:03:27.920> a

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
my dough now this batter does spread a

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.100 
my dough now this batter does spread a
bit<00:03:28.190> during<00:03:28.459> baking<00:03:28.819> so<00:03:29.269> it's<00:03:29.420> important<00:03:30.019> to

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
bit during baking so it's important to

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.930 
bit during baking so it's important to
space<00:03:30.530> out<00:03:30.769> your<00:03:30.830> cookie<00:03:31.310> dough<00:03:31.489> at<00:03:31.700> least

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
space out your cookie dough at least

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.780 
space out your cookie dough at least
three<00:03:32.299> inches<00:03:32.510> apart<00:03:32.959> from<00:03:33.170> each<00:03:33.290> other<00:03:33.790> the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
most i bake at one time is 9 at a time

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.789 
most i bake at one time is 9 at a time
you<00:03:38.540> want<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.810> bake<00:03:38.959> these<00:03:39.170> off<00:03:39.230> in<00:03:39.680> a
