00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.020
 as the fate of the country is connected with the fate 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.589
 man how to use 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.870
 know your freedom of choice 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.450
 fate comes first 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.170
 the fate of the country on the second such connection 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.720
 the fate of the country and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.939
 this is the power that makes life harder 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.619
 and outside 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.689
 but if a person lives in the inside 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.460
 life he lives in prayer then fate 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.670
 countries will not be able to fully 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.850
 to stop him, he does not lose any work not 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.280
 relationship is not your fate inside heavy 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.739
 living in a country why because he 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.930
 there is enough inner strength to cope 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.399
 with this weight 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.040
 the fate of the country is just a volume 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.070
 work right now has become life in our 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.920
 the country has become harder to know what will come 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.070
 time and so the fate of the rest of all 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.989
 countries will be filled with the same weight 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.989
 because generally in all the earth now 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.039
 there comes a time in which everything will be 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.229
 live harder than some countries begins 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.710
 earlier with some kind of come this 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.200
 later 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.900
 the wave still goes everywhere doesn't have 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.700
 meaning and meaning to run somewhere has 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.830
 sense to think how to survive in this 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.320
 situations only one way 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.619
 solve problems within your heart and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.630
 outside they will be decided by itself 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.060
 no other way to survive when we say 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.920
 bombs fly rather than solve problems 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.350
 inside your heart because you are you 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.479
 you can emerge to predict where she is 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.820
 will come to understand the rope does not ask 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.430
 but if you pray you can escape with 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.200
 the place where she owes 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.750
 get an example 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.899

 Donets better of course she left 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:52.479
 but since she lives in Donetsk she can 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.549
 get involved in the bombing and in 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.750
 at some point it happened at the beginning 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:03.640

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:06.520
 which she lives and she did not go 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.599

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.290
 the doom that should have happened 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.000
 in his life he bought a faulty car 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.730
