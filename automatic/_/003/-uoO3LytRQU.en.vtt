00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.560
 fraganti I am pérez pirela and is that a 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.860
 less than 10 days that the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.350
 copa america chile 2015 in the world of 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.770
 football was released a news that 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:20.429
 caused a commotion and that this time 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.419
 was about a goal or a game 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:27.150
 resignation of President Joseph Blatter 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:29.789
 who had been in the highest position for 17 years 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.970
 of the fifa the entity that governs the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.520
 most popular sport on the planet and that 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.170
 neglected one more time in a 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.050
 corruption scandal 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.379
 the platter division was surrounded 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.010
 of controversy because despite being reelected the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:51.059
 last May 29 he admitted that within the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.850
 football cited textually did not count on 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.429
 A lot of support must also be taken in 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.039
 account that just a week before the 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.960
 world was shocked by the news of the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.960
 detention of a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.159
 and nine directors of the fifa accused 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.380
 bribery and embezzlement all the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.680
 photos of the capture invaded the networks 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.369
 social and all sports portals 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.409
 from the web many expressed that it was 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.440
 obvious the secret to voices of the 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.210
 corruption and others indicated that 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:31.050
 he dealt with an isolated matter but what 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.869
 means this event is really about 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.320
 of a specific case or just the tip 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.259
 from an expert in this chapter 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.770
 we grabbed the fifa in fragrance and 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.210
 we explain what is the dark side behind 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.810
 of the most followed sport in the world to 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.810
 companions 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.310
 in recent years the fifa federation 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.479
 International Football Association has 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.780
 consolidated as one of the 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.020
 most lucrative global organizations 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.300
 in the whole world this institution that 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.670
 in the late 70s employed 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.340
 less than 10 people full time 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.250
 has become an entity with a 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.120
 enormous global influence that is not only 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.620
 sports but also cultural policy 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.650
 and economic the question is how do you earn 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.610
 money this association how does it get a 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.400
 body accumulate in only four years 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.650
 hundreds of millions of dollars 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.709
 the managers assure that the majority 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.590
 of revenues are due to sponsorships and 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.280
 tickets in the soccer world but 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.140
 now when 14 people included 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.410
 members of the executive committee are 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:56.080
 being accused of receiving bribes worth 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.080
 it is worth highlighting some figures 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.989
 during the four years before the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.360
 Brazil 2014 World Cup every 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.459
 national soccer federation received 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.200
 by fifa about two 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.450
 millions of dollars and the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.190
 continental confederations like the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.530
 Central American confederation and 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:21.140
 Caribbean football received concacaf 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.959
 17.5 million based on 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.000
 this has to be the total received in 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:31.599
 the organizations related to the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.150
 fifa between 2011 and 2014 was close to 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.609
 137 million without a 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.209
 doubts the football world cup is the event 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:43.370
 most profitable sport on the planet 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.870
 eclipsing and even the Olympians in 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.310
 the last world cup the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.829
 tournament qualifiers in Brazil 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.859
 they meant an income close to 4 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:55.220
 thousand 800 million dollars after 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:58.810
 the expenses the fifa assured that it was left 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.810
 a profit close to 2 thousand 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.810
 millions 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.150
 the question is what are these 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.870
 sums what are those expenditures over 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.180
 2 billion dollars we have already seen 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.470
 that are talking about very large 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:24.889
 amounts of money and that also said 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.889
 accounts are far from transparent 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.750
 in 2014 the Argentine soccer star 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.910
 diego armando maradona affirmed in the 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.660
 left-handed program transmitted by 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.949
 telesur that I quote textually the power 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.440
 of the fifa is an ugly power denouncing 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.050
 bribes not only in the choice of 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.870
 venues of the world but also in 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.210
 the choice of equipment reaching 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.610
 the end of the tournament at that moment 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.180
 the 'fluff' who was the best player 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.340
 of the world in the cup mexico-86 noted 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.639
 that the president of the fifa joseph 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.350
 blatter who had more than 12 years in 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.789
 that position earns money without doing anything 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.550
 Maradona also said that there is a 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:15.280
 incongruent and abysmal difference in 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.210
 As for the prize figures , yes, 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:22.479
 you earn 4 billion dollars with the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.000
 event how it is possible for the champion to 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:28.540
 carries only 35 million 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.480
 the fifa multinational is eating 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.910
 the ball is what Maradona says 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.040
 while in the middle of the scandal of the 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.640
 corruption revealed in recent days 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.350
 There are many who also doubt what 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.310
 What is behind the selection of 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.860
 tasting venues considered a country without 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.490
 football was chosen to host the 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:55.330
 world 2022 when the conditions 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.720
 climatic conditions will be the most adverse for 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.720
 Players 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.960
 blatter's response to all this was 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.690
 initially that he as president I quote 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.610
 literally could not realize 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.220
 everything that happens inside the 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.919
 organization and defended the votes 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.050
 of the venues but then the day of the 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.630
 election where he applied to be 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.270
 reelecto affirmed that he assumed the 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.120
 responsibility for the corruption of the 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:28.690
 that had been unmarked and committed 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.000
 to insist to clarify the event in 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.220
 both the accused managers among the 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.250
 who is the Venezuelan rafael 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:40.210
 esquivel the former president of the conmebol 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.740
 nicolás leoz and the secretary general of 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.370
 the concacaf 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:49.630
 enrique sanz have been suspended from their 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:53.349
 functions and other former footballers like the 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:57.280
 Portuguese Luis Figo denounced the lack 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:07:01.529
 of transparency in the electoral process 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.399
 in which Blatter was reelected 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:06.949
 this was in fraganti I am pérez pirela 

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:12.149
 and we will analyze in the next chapter 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:16.909
 more of ethical economic disasters and 

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:16.909
 fifa politicians until then
