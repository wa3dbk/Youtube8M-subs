xeljanz and save Ian's these silicon's
could<00:02:18.769> be<00:02:18.950> perhaps<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:20.000> heaviest<00:02:20.420> China's

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
could be perhaps the heaviest China's

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.370 
could be perhaps the heaviest China's
I've<00:02:21.680> ever<00:02:22.489> played<00:02:22.819> so<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.810> lot<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.319> guys

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
I've ever played so a lot of you guys

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.620 
I've ever played so a lot of you guys
who<00:02:24.739> complain<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.190> China's<00:02:25.910> crack<00:02:26.239> a<00:02:26.269> lot

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
who complain that China's crack a lot

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.589 
who complain that China's crack a lot
and<00:02:26.840> that's<00:02:26.959> not<00:02:27.200> just<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.860> dig<00:02:28.819> on<00:02:29.060> move<00:02:29.360> on

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
and that's not just I dig on move on

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.030 
and that's not just I dig on move on
because<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.080> hear<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.349> all<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.530> time<00:02:30.650> with

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
because you hear that all the time with

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.520 
because you hear that all the time with
them<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.519> think<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.569> lot<00:02:32.599> of<00:02:32.780> that's<00:02:33.019> got<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.380> do

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
them I think a lot of that's got to do

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.640 
them I think a lot of that's got to do
with<00:02:33.560> technique<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.049> a<00:02:36.080> very<00:02:36.380> heavy

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
with technique this is a very heavy

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.430 
with technique this is a very heavy
China<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.910> am<00:02:38.299> so<00:02:38.630> intrigued<00:02:38.810> by<00:02:39.260> its

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
China and I am so intrigued by its

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.789 
China and I am so intrigued by its
weight<00:02:39.850> when<00:02:40.850> I<00:02:40.880> list<00:02:41.269> this<00:02:41.569> I'm<00:02:42.110> going<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.620> put

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
weight when I list this I'm going to put

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.559 
weight when I list this I'm going to put
the<00:02:42.920> weight<00:02:43.130> down<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.700> didn't<00:02:44.030> realize<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.480> was

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
the weight down I didn't realize it was

00:02:44.569 --> 00:03:09.610 
the weight down I didn't realize it was
so<00:02:44.780> heavy

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.740 

again<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.879> very<00:03:11.720> very<00:03:12.440> interesting<00:03:13.280> china<00:03:13.750> from

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
again a very very interesting china from

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.500 
again a very very interesting china from
soakin<00:03:15.409> this<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.159> certainly<00:03:16.700> not<00:03:17.090> your

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
soakin this is certainly not your
