routines that we've been respecting for
last<00:00:19.289> few<00:00:19.500> years<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.980> know<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.250> might<00:00:20.400> see

last few years you know we might see

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.240 
last few years you know we might see
with<00:00:20.789> people<00:00:21.150> i<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> same<00:00:22.740> team<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.100> people

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
with people i have a same team of people

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.980 
with people i have a same team of people
for<00:00:23.580> last<00:00:23.760> six<00:00:23.939> seven<00:00:24.240> years<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.810> hasn't

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
for last six seven years so it hasn't

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.230 
for last six seven years so it hasn't
changed<00:00:25.199> we're<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.859> adjusting<00:00:26.430> depending

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
changed we're just adjusting depending

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.960 
changed we're just adjusting depending
on<00:00:27.470> depending<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> condition<00:00:29.160> every<00:00:29.699> year

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
on depending on a condition every year

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.959 
on depending on a condition every year
so<00:00:30.740> everything<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:32.219> according<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
so everything is going according to the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.260 
so everything is going according to the
plan<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.540> hopefully<00:00:34.469> i<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.559> get<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.610> fast<00:00:35.940> as

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
plan and hopefully i can get in fast as

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.360 
plan and hopefully i can get in fast as
possible<00:00:36.540> shape<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> side<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.219> how

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
possible shape for the side and how

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.889 
possible shape for the side and how
tough<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> improve<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.390> such<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> busy

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
tough is it to improve with such a busy

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.250 
tough is it to improve with such a busy
schedule<00:00:40.940> well<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.540> busy<00:00:42.780> schedule<00:00:43.230> but

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
schedule well it is busy schedule but

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.020 
schedule well it is busy schedule but
it's<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.860> been<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.940> many

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
it's it's been like this for for many

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.380 
it's it's been like this for for many
years<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.739> know<00:00:47.160> what<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.879> need<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.120> do

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
years so I I know what what I need to do

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.860 
years so I I know what what I need to do
in<00:00:48.570> order<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.610> adjust<00:00:50.610> from<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.329> slowest<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
in order to adjust from the slowest to

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.510 
in order to adjust from the slowest to
the<00:00:51.930> fastest<00:00:52.320> surface<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.280> very<00:00:53.460> short

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
the fastest surface in a very short

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.479 
the fastest surface in a very short
period<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:54.090> time<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.780> difficult<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.489> it's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
period of time it is difficult but it's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.700 
period of time it is difficult but it's
the<00:00:56.579> same<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:56.940> everybody<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:58.469> not<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the same for everybody and it's not the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.779 
the same for everybody and it's not the
first<00:00:58.859> time<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.160> I've<00:00:59.430> been<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.670> this

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
first time that I've been in this

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.819 
first time that I've been in this
position<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.480> hopefully<00:01:01.020> i<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.140> i<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.800> my

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
position so hopefully i can i can do my

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.399 
position so hopefully i can i can do my
best<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.940> person<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.570> monday

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
best and then be on a person for monday

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.990 
best and then be on a person for monday
what<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> most<00:01:05.400> difficult<00:01:05.549> thing<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
what what is the most difficult thing to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.580 
what what is the most difficult thing to
adjust<00:01:06.420> e<00:01:06.600> when<00:01:06.750> you're<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.110> from<00:01:07.260> cross

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
adjust e when you're going from cross

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.800 
adjust e when you're going from cross
from<00:01:08.189> player<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.729> across<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.299> movement

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
from player it's across a movement

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.050 
from player it's across a movement
mostly<00:01:10.080> i<00:01:10.350> guess<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> movement<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
mostly i guess you know the movement the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.330 
mostly i guess you know the movement the
ball<00:01:12.900> bounce<00:01:13.170> everything<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.830> different<00:01:13.979> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
ball bounce everything is different I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.480 
ball bounce everything is different I
mean<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:15.229> as<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.409> said<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.770> slowest<00:01:17.100> surface

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
mean it's as I said the slowest surface

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.320 
mean it's as I said the slowest surface
in<00:01:17.640> sport<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.390> bounce<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.259> clay<00:01:19.820> is<00:01:20.820> very<00:01:21.119> high

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
in sport the bounce on clay is very high

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.399 
in sport the bounce on clay is very high
on<00:01:21.630> grass<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.860> don't<00:01:23.040> get<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.220> such<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> high

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
on grass you don't get that such a high

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.580 
on grass you don't get that such a high
bounce<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.799> then<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.580> course<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.030> can't<00:01:27.330> fly

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
bounce and then of course you can't fly

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.510 
bounce and then of course you can't fly
there's<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.939> difference<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:31.369> footsteps<00:01:32.369> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
there's a difference in in footsteps and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.840 
there's a difference in in footsteps and
adjustments<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> ball<00:01:34.850> obviously

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
adjustments to the ball obviously

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.580 
adjustments to the ball obviously
everything<00:01:36.240> happens<00:01:36.689> very<00:01:36.810> fast<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.380> grass

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
everything happens very fast and grass

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.679 
everything happens very fast and grass
you<00:01:38.009> know<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.850> try<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> focus<00:01:39.360> on

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
you know so you have to try to focus on

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.929 
you know so you have to try to focus on
the<00:01:39.780> return<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.320> serve<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:41.430> more<00:01:41.640> aggressive

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
the return and serve be more aggressive

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.899 
the return and serve be more aggressive
and<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:43.439> takes<00:01:43.649> time<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.100> obviously<00:01:44.399> takes

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and it takes time and obviously takes

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.600 
and it takes time and obviously takes
time<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.810> think<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.770> think<00:01:47.280> I'm<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
time that I think I think I'm going to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.680 
time that I think I think I'm going to
be<00:01:47.729> fine<00:01:47.939> for

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
be fine for

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.540 
be fine for
without<00:01:49.020> consolations<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.950> losing<00:01:50.310> such<00:01:50.520> a

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
without consolations to losing such a

and I'm very happy for that because that

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.440

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
is my goal and I I don't think the grass

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.930 
is my goal and I I don't think the grass
is<00:03:12.510> probably<00:03:13.410> my<00:03:13.620> most<00:03:14.010> preferred<00:03:14.430> surface

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
is probably my most preferred surface

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.440 
is probably my most preferred surface
it's<00:03:15.450> probably<00:03:15.780> hard<00:03:16.020> court<00:03:16.290> but<00:03:16.910> but<00:03:17.910> over

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
it's probably hard court but but over

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.670 
it's probably hard court but but over
the<00:03:18.570> years<00:03:18.600> I've<00:03:18.989> been<00:03:19.170> playing<00:03:19.350> really<00:03:19.560> well

special<00:04:18.620> well<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.650> think<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.130> fact<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.430> we

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
special well I think the fact that we

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.490 
special well I think the fact that we
played<00:04:20.760> so<00:04:20.940> many<00:04:21.060> times<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.750> especially<00:04:21.989> in

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
played so many times and especially in

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.040 
played so many times and especially in
the<00:04:22.590> big<00:04:22.710> events<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:24.570> know<00:04:24.690> we

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
the big events and you know we

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.140 
the big events and you know we
they<00:04:26.860> of<00:04:27.250> course<00:04:27.310> Nadal<00:04:27.970> in<00:04:28.180> feather<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:29.050> two

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
they of course Nadal in feather the two

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.450 
they of course Nadal in feather the two
most<00:04:31.150> successful<00:04:31.750> active<00:04:32.470> players<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.340> I

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
most successful active players and I

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.909 
most successful active players and I
still<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.389> still<00:04:34.629> think<00:04:34.870> that<00:04:35.020> their<00:04:35.409> rivalry

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
still the still think that their rivalry

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.189 
still the still think that their rivalry
is<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:37.060> best<00:04:37.240> rivalry<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.810> we<00:04:37.930> have<00:04:38.080> in

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
is the best rivalry that we have in

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.020 
is the best rivalry that we have in
sport<00:04:38.500> no<00:04:38.620> question<00:04:38.979> about<00:04:39.069> it<00:04:39.220> of<00:04:39.849> course

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
sport no question about it of course

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.659 
sport no question about it of course
Maria<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:40.900> myself<00:04:41.139> we<00:04:41.620> we<00:04:42.220> grew<00:04:42.400> up<00:04:42.430> together

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
Maria and myself we we grew up together

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.960 
Maria and myself we we grew up together
and<00:04:43.210> we<00:04:43.509> we<00:04:44.110> started<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.560> play<00:04:44.800> more<00:04:45.550> against

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
and we we started to play more against

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.730 
and we we started to play more against
each<00:04:46.060> other<00:04:46.300> under<00:04:46.569> the<00:04:46.900> big<00:04:47.050> tournaments<00:04:47.620> and

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
each other under the big tournaments and

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.020 
each other under the big tournaments and
I<00:04:47.800> think<00:04:47.979> that's<00:04:48.159> maybe<00:04:48.370> one<00:04:48.669> of<00:04:48.699> the<00:04:48.849> riders

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
I think that's maybe one of the riders

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.580 
I think that's maybe one of the riders
that<00:04:49.330> can<00:04:49.509> develop<00:04:49.629> over<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.080> years<00:04:50.289> no

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
that can develop over the years no

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.399 
that can develop over the years no
because<00:04:50.770> she<00:04:51.610> focused<00:04:52.300> on<00:04:52.449> Andy<00:04:52.870> Murray<00:04:53.020> again

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
because she focused on Andy Murray again

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.499 
because she focused on Andy Murray again
this<00:04:53.800> year<00:04:53.860> he<00:04:54.729> does<00:04:54.879> into<00:04:55.150> this<00:04:55.210> wilderness

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
this year he does into this wilderness

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.659 
this year he does into this wilderness

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.290 
champion does that make the freshly less
award<00:05:00.849> well<00:05:01.629> I<00:05:01.659> think<00:05:01.780> he<00:05:02.580> he<00:05:03.580> did<00:05:03.849> he<00:05:04.000> did<00:05:04.270> he
