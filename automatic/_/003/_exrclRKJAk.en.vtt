there<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.350> go<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.799> quick<00:02:02.070> review<00:02:02.250> of

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.590 

a<00:02:05.940> most<00:02:06.940> much<00:02:07.150> like<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.480> it<00:02:07.540> also<00:02:07.990> i<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:10.390> this

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
a most much like I it also i think this

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.690 
a most much like I it also i think this
is<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.840> only<00:02:10.990> one<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.410> know<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.710> it's<00:02:12.220> got

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
is the only one that I know of it's got

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.410 
is the only one that I know of it's got
something<00:02:13.260> BPA<00:02:14.260> free<00:02:14.380> logo<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.760> think<00:02:16.150> right

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
something BPA free logo I think right

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.520 
something BPA free logo I think right
underneath<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.070> non-toxic

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
underneath that so it's a non-toxic

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.840 
underneath that so it's a non-toxic
plastic<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.130> know<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.370> freeze<00:02:21.820> it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
plastic so you know you can freeze it

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.020 
plastic so you know you can freeze it
apparently<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.900> can<00:02:23.080> do<00:02:23.430> lots<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.580> stuff<00:02:24.640> it's

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
apparently you can do lots of stuff it's

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.630 
apparently you can do lots of stuff it's
like<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.300> best<00:02:25.480> best<00:02:26.260> made<00:02:26.500> quality<00:02:26.950> shake<00:02:27.610> it

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640
