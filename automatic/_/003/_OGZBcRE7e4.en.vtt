00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.729
 hello to youtube once again leaves maite 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.070
 diamond events 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.379
 lately we bought a lot of lights 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.389
 and I have been getting many and more to 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.730
 my email boxes that I 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.590
 are asking me to do a review because 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.050
 there are two lights that are very similar one 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.300
 what if america dj and one that is ch치vez 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.939
 I bought the two I have the two systems 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.410
 but the american dj system is 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.480
 growing and that people have noticed that 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.890
 I've been buying more units the 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.670
 unit that I am referring ladies and 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.969
 caballeros is the megapark profile 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.429
 megapark profile and america dj because 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.089
 because it's that I decided to go with them with 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.180
 this system 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.820
 good easy I will explain simple 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.850
 simply because it is one is a 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.079
 unit your profile in this super thin 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.070
 if maybe two and a half inches is very very 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.960
 very thin 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.239
 it weighs nothing 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.730
 It weighs enough to be on the floor 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.430
 to not move with a pull of cables 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.890
 heavy enough so you can not 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.340
 lift it this unit is great 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.259
 because because in the past 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.509
 the connectors came in the back 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.329
 had in the back and those 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.670
 connectors and emex oex the bar are so 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:22.069
 great then we had connectors like this 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.090
 and we suffered because the light had to 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.210
 have large parties 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.230
 now the connectors go on the sides 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.770
 let's show them here 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:36.070
 the connectors enter the sides 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.530
 now when one throws this as up line 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.070
 and it is totally pemex or that is 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.050
 cleaned with divx 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.979
 it's so easy the thing that enters your 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.979
 de mex cable 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.170
 and it comes out right here between your cable 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.390
 power and it goes out right here that many 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.440
 of you do not have the cable is called 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.200
 there is and if there is and if this cable does not have 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.460
 that buy it clear there are many sites in 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.610
 internet where you can 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.570
 get economical that cable serves to 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.510
 clean the lights to separate and that the 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.590
 units are enter you enter you can 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.440
 here 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.420
 and go out right here come into your day I ex 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.150
 here and out here, or is that when 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.450
 the beasts in a line 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.540
 cable enters cable leaves power to enter 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.980
 power comes out then that's why that's 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.290
 one of the best units in the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.060
 market to buy and make to the beach 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.700
 where the transported ones are 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.680
 asking easy we transport them here 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:45.730
 in this box is a box write 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.380
 comes by sections 3 6 9 12 13 14 and a 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.140
 medium up to 15 units enter here 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.310
 then it is not mistreated to be 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.349
 fully cushioned 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.349
 while for a view 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.730
 233 per section 3 6 9 12 13 14 15 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.380
 I wrote against blows against 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.860
 all is not cheap it is very expensive but if 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.160
 you have 15 units or more than 15 units 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.800
 you need them to be protected now 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.440
 many people use controllers 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.890
 Analog controller slides 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.580
 we use software 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.290
 computer because we do not want to go 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.319
 for back we believe without facing 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.720
 with the slider control because that's 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.850
 a little 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.760
 we have to go forward and 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.340
 we have software drivers or 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.810
 computer now here we have some 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.810
 units we are going to show the 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.000
 these are the units are 10 mega per 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.390
 profiles are obviously connected to 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.610
 the time to touch the wires are created 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.890
 they keep are needed in a more 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.950
 they hide everything they get scared by the cables 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.980
 what do these units do well 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.470
 Starting in 2011, the fashion for making 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.330
 upline paint the salons of colors 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.860
 paint the walls red green blue 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.459
 yellow depending on the theme of your 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:23.340
 good party that is a review of how 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.340
 they work these no no of how 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:32.680
 this what regular people do for 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.680
 a beach 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:40.500
 there we have a static color 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.500
 meta4 for wolves 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.880
 this scene is called all blue 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.880
 there you can see why 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:56.330
 that is easy to obtain 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.880
 a static color is called static 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.160
 the 2012 quincea침eras weddings have 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.780
 been painting the heels of 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.210
 different colors quincea침eras 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.770
 all quincea침eras and if you look 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.650
 on youtube they are blue 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.150
 all the balls then we do not know by 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.150
 what to say these abodes 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.499
 there are those who have delayed now 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.710
 at the time of the dance 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.860
 if you have them cleaned well mex and all 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.610
 they are added in channels 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.610
 independent 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.580
 we can have an equalizer 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:21.729
 for blue equalizer 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.920
 this equalizer does not come in the program 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.050
 does one manually do one to 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.090
 hand but that's part of the 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.390
 programming well is like being a 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.110
 green equalizer 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.110
 central 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:31.370
 now these scenes with smoke with gays and 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.159
 bets on others looks fantastic 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:37.810
 you can look at the rays and then I repeat 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:37.810
 you can do many things with this 

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:43.789
 all the fantastic units 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:55.540
 with many people like bars 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:58.050
 this does work that the bars but it's 

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.050
 individual 

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.350
 Well, I want to tell you that if I liked the 

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:07.780
 video please subscribe and as always 

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:11.610
 have a comment and then what should I 

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.610
 say parts in English
