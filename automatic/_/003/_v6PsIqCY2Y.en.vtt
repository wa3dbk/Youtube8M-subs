well the breads been proving for about

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.400 
well the breads been proving for about
an<00:00:04.200> hour<00:00:04.319> now<00:00:04.500> just<00:00:04.890> under<00:00:05.160> an<00:00:05.250> hour<00:00:09.410> it's

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
an hour now just under an hour it's

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.919 
an hour now just under an hour it's
double<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:10.800> size<00:00:11.040> now<00:00:11.910> cuz<00:00:12.059> he<00:00:12.210> hasn't<00:00:12.540> quite

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
double in size now cuz he hasn't quite

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.470 
double in size now cuz he hasn't quite
filled<00:00:13.740> into<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.190> part<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.700> pot<00:00:14.969> there's

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
filled into this part of the pot there's

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.240 
filled into this part of the pot there's
a<00:00:15.540> good<00:00:15.690> reason<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.320> there's<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.890> gentle

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
a good reason for that there's a gentle

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.800 
a good reason for that there's a gentle
breeze<00:00:17.550> blowing<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.270> way

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
breeze blowing this way

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.480 
breeze blowing this way
meaning<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.680> side<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.100> pot<00:00:20.310> will

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
meaning that this side of the pot will

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.490 
meaning that this side of the pot will
be<00:00:20.520> cooler<00:00:20.910> than<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> other<00:00:21.390> side<00:00:21.689> that's<00:00:22.289> all

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
be cooler than the other side that's all

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.620 
be cooler than the other side that's all
it<00:00:22.769> takes<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.189> spoil<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.850> proving<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.510> you

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
it takes to spoil the proving so you

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.300 
it takes to spoil the proving so you
have<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.869> really<00:00:25.470> make<00:00:25.710> sure<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:26.039> get<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
have to really make sure you get the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.490 
have to really make sure you get the

has I reckon that bridge done it's a
dirty<00:03:12.150> smell<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:13.110> might<00:03:13.349> scorched<00:03:13.830> on<00:03:13.980> the

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
dirty smell so it might scorched on the

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:23.720 
dirty smell so it might scorched on the
underside<00:03:14.549> but<00:03:21.950> hasn't<00:03:22.950> stuck<00:03:23.340> which<00:03:23.549> is<00:03:23.700> a

underside but hasn't stuck which is a

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.120 
underside but hasn't stuck which is a
good<00:03:23.940> sign<00:03:24.150> always<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.230> good<00:03:25.500> sign<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:28.130> little

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
the cloth over the top help stop the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:56.690 
the cloth over the top help stop the
crust<00:03:43.170> going<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.590> dry<00:03:49.190> clean<00:03:55.519> while<00:03:56.519> that's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
crust going to dry clean while that's

cooling<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.239> just<00:03:57.450> have<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.600> little<00:03:57.690> bit<00:03:57.840> of<00:03:57.930> a

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
cooling I just have a little bit of a

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.490 
cooling I just have a little bit of a
tidy<00:03:58.230> up<00:03:59.239> but<00:04:00.239> in<00:04:00.329> an<00:04:00.450> ideal<00:04:00.569> world<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.380> could

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
tidy up but in an ideal world you could

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.900 
tidy up but in an ideal world you could
leave<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:01.920> today<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.220> was<00:04:02.340> probably<00:04:02.639> cool

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
leave this today it was probably cool

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.420 
leave this today it was probably cool
before<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.359> sliced<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.870> but<00:04:04.530> I've<00:04:04.739> got<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:04.980> film

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
before you sliced it but I've got a film

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.879 
before you sliced it but I've got a film
crew<00:04:05.670> salivating<00:04:06.060> for<00:04:06.840> they<00:04:07.440> say<00:04:07.620> still<00:04:07.859> a

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
crew salivating for they say still a

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:08.629 
crew salivating for they say still a
little<00:04:08.069> bit<00:04:08.250> warm

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
little bit warm

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.550 
little bit warm
putting<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.239> cloth<00:04:09.450> on<00:04:09.660> top<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:10.109> helps<00:04:10.410> just

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
putting the cloth on top just helps just

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.199 
putting the cloth on top just helps just
to<00:04:10.620> keep<00:04:10.889> the<00:04:11.010> crust<00:04:11.310> from<00:04:11.519> going<00:04:11.730> too<00:04:11.910> hard

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
to keep the crust from going too hard

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.430 
to keep the crust from going too hard
and<00:04:14.150> well<00:04:15.150> it's<00:04:15.569> got<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.780> be<00:04:15.900> done<00:04:16.079> hasn't<00:04:16.350> it

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
and well it's got to be done hasn't it

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.040 
and well it's got to be done hasn't it
it's<00:04:16.769> got<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:17.010> be<00:04:17.100> sliced<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.700> tasted

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.219 

let's<00:04:25.050> just<00:04:25.229> have<00:04:25.349> a<00:04:25.409> look<00:04:26.810> looks<00:04:27.810> pretty<00:04:28.080> good

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
let's just have a look looks pretty good

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:28.869 
let's just have a look looks pretty good
isn't<00:04:28.439> it

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:28.879 
isn't it

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.939 
isn't it
and<00:04:29.879> I<00:04:29.970> guess<00:04:30.180> what<00:04:30.840> we<00:04:30.930> have<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.139> do<00:04:31.289> is<00:04:31.740> in

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
and I guess what we have to do is in

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.330 
and I guess what we have to do is in
