now I'm going to show you a few basic
tricks<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:01.829> link<00:00:02.040> your<00:00:02.100> dragon<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.399> little<00:00:02.550> bit

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.519 
tricks to link your dragon a little bit
more<00:00:02.790> interesting<00:00:03.240> first<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:03.990> all<00:00:04.140> the

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
more interesting first of all the

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.129 
more interesting first of all the
overhand<00:00:04.859> truck<00:00:08.420> it's<00:00:09.420> not<00:00:09.480> very<00:00:09.780> just<00:00:09.990> what

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
overhand truck it's not very just what

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.709 
overhand truck it's not very just what
puns<00:00:10.380> up<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.740> grab<00:00:11.010> some<00:00:11.400> what's<00:00:12.210> pencil<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.690> it

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
puns up to grab some what's pencil on it

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.839 
puns up to grab some what's pencil on it
but<00:00:13.080> take<00:00:13.380> two<00:00:13.559> balls<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.309> again<00:00:14.700> you're

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
but take two balls and again you're

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.310 
but take two balls and again you're
gonna<00:00:14.940> throw<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.420> first<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:15.839> but<00:00:16.020> instead<00:00:16.260> of

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
gonna throw the first one but instead of

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.840 
gonna throw the first one but instead of
going<00:00:16.440> underneath<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.039> as<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.340> reaches<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> peak

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
going underneath it as it reaches a peak

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.689 
going underneath it as it reaches a peak
you're<00:00:18.029> gonna<00:00:18.150> go<00:00:18.330> over<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.890> like<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.130> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
you're gonna go over it like that and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.179 
you're gonna go over it like that and
stuff<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:24.529> so<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:25.560> practice<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
stuff like that so just practice that a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.200 
stuff like that so just practice that a
few<00:00:26.220> times<00:00:26.369> get<00:00:26.730> used<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> both<00:00:27.269> ways<00:00:27.480> and

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
few times get used to it both ways and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.200 
few times get used to it both ways and
then<00:00:30.210> trying<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> get<00:00:30.689> your<00:00:30.840> full<00:00:30.990> pattern

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
then trying to get your full pattern

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.910 
then trying to get your full pattern
your<00:00:33.210> weight<00:00:33.329> until<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.780> previous<00:00:34.680> ball

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
your weight until you the previous ball

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.290 
your weight until you the previous ball
reaches<00:00:35.190> its<00:00:35.340> peak<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.760> like<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> normal

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
reaches its peak just like a normal

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.819 
reaches its peak just like a normal
throw<00:00:36.480> except<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.200> go<00:00:37.290> over<00:00:37.530> it

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
throw except to go over it

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.920 
throw except to go over it
I<00:00:37.860> notice<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> overhand<00:00:39.180> throw<00:00:39.329> goes<00:00:39.660> over

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
I notice the overhand throw goes over

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
I notice the overhand throw goes over
the<00:00:40.020> entire<00:00:40.050> pattern

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the entire pattern

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.979 
the entire pattern
it<00:00:41.250> goes<00:00:41.430> over<00:00:41.550> both<00:00:41.910> balls<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.629> lands<00:00:42.809> all

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
it goes over both balls and lands all

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.030 
it goes over both balls and lands all
right<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.379> side<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.829> throw

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
right on this side and you throw

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.799 
right on this side and you throw
underneath<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> normal<00:00:45.200> throw<00:00:47.809> it's

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
underneath it like a normal throw it's

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.840 
underneath it like a normal throw it's
pretty<00:00:49.050> wide<00:00:49.260> arch<00:00:52.250> also<00:00:53.250> you'll<00:00:53.489> notice<00:00:53.730> when

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
pretty wide arch also you'll notice when

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.459 
pretty wide arch also you'll notice when
you're<00:00:53.940> doing<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.149> normal<00:00:54.420> pattern<00:00:54.660> normal

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
you're doing a normal pattern normal

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.619 
you're doing a normal pattern normal
cascade<00:00:55.649> your<00:00:56.309> hands<00:00:56.670> go<00:00:56.820> circles<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.420> way

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
cascade your hands go circles this way

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.479 
cascade your hands go circles this way
why<00:00:58.379> you're<00:00:58.500> doing<00:00:58.620> an<00:00:58.710> overhand<00:00:59.039> throw<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
why you're doing an overhand throw for a

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.150 
why you're doing an overhand throw for a
moment<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.789> haven't<00:00:59.940> got<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> circle<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.750> way

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
moment I haven't got a circle this way

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.640 
moment I haven't got a circle this way
go<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:03.049> you'll<00:01:04.049> feel<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.290> especially

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
go like that you'll feel this especially

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.859 
go like that you'll feel this especially
if<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.949> throw<00:01:05.129> every<00:01:05.400> second<00:01:05.790> ball<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.720> can

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
if you throw every second ball you can

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.300 
if you throw every second ball you can
notice<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.409> rocking<00:01:07.830> motion<00:01:08.189> my

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
notice the kind of rocking motion my

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.990 
notice the kind of rocking motion my
right<00:01:08.460> hand<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.510> under<00:01:09.780> over<00:01:09.960> under<00:01:10.260> over

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
right hand to go under over under over

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.190 
right hand to go under over under over
now<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> throw<00:01:12.360> all<00:01:12.570> over<00:01:12.810> hand<00:01:12.990> throws

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
now if you throw all over hand throws

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.510 
now if you throw all over hand throws
one<00:01:13.500> hands<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.979> matter<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.280> called<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
one hands and that matter is called a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.020 
one hands and that matter is called a
half<00:01:14.670> shower

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
half shower

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.090 
half shower
it's<00:01:16.020> pretty<00:01:16.229> nice<00:01:16.350> pattern<00:01:16.680> maybe<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.040> it

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
it's pretty nice pattern maybe do it

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.380 
it's pretty nice pattern maybe do it
both<00:01:17.250> ways<00:01:19.310> if<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.520> choose<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:20.939> ball<00:01:21.180> or

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
both ways if you choose one ball or

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.670 
both ways if you choose one ball or
every<00:01:21.540> time<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.810> catch<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.200> ball<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.560> go

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
every time you catch that ball you go

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.870 
every time you catch that ball you go
back<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.009> forth<00:01:23.100> that's<00:01:23.610> called<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
back and forth that's called the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.289 
back and forth that's called the
jugglers<00:01:24.270> tennis

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.940 

it's<00:01:30.810> also<00:01:30.930> important<00:01:31.320> not<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.470> stress<00:01:31.799> out

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it's also important not to stress out

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
it's also important not to stress out
and<00:01:32.130> throw<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> next<00:01:32.640> ball<00:01:32.850> too<00:01:33.030> early<00:01:33.329> after

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and throw the next ball too early after

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600 
and throw the next ball too early after
your<00:01:33.689> gran<00:01:33.899> throw<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.740> overhand<00:01:35.130> ball<00:01:35.340> will

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
your gran throw the overhand ball will

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.429 
your gran throw the overhand ball will
in<00:01:35.939> most<00:01:36.149> cases<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.689> higher<00:01:36.990> than<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> other

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
in most cases go higher than the other

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.649 
in most cases go higher than the other
balls<00:01:38.360> today

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
balls today

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.940 
balls today
that<00:01:40.170> means<00:01:40.350> they'll<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.560> more<00:01:40.740> hang<00:01:40.920> time

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that means they'll have more hang time

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.109 
that means they'll have more hang time
so<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.399> have<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.640> wait<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> little<00:01:41.939> bit<00:01:42.060> longer

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
so you have to wait a little bit longer

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.760 
so you have to wait a little bit longer
before<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.689> reaches<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:42.960> peak<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.590> don't

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
before it reaches that peak but don't

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.779 
before it reaches that peak but don't
worry<00:01:43.860> about<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.220> even<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.460> you're<00:01:44.549> sort<00:01:44.700> of

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
worry about it even if you're sort of

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.300 
worry about it even if you're sort of
really<00:01:44.970> high<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.299> wait<00:01:46.009> don't<00:01:47.009> freak<00:01:47.220> out

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
really high just wait don't freak out

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.529 
really high just wait don't freak out
and<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.729> two<00:01:47.880> balls<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.210> hear<00:01:48.299> at<00:01:48.390> once

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
and then have two balls we hear at once

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.020 
and then have two balls we hear at once
that<00:01:48.720> gets<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.080> hectic

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
that gets a little hectic

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.310 
that gets a little hectic
that's<00:01:51.030> basically<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> overhand<00:01:51.840> throw<00:01:51.929> just

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that's basically the overhand throw just

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.810 
that's basically the overhand throw just
throw<00:01:52.740> them<00:01:52.920> every<00:01:53.100> now<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.340> then<00:01:53.429> it's<00:01:53.640> fun

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
throw them every now and then it's fun

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.969 
throw them every now and then it's fun
to<00:01:53.909> mess<00:01:54.030> around<00:01:54.149> with<00:01:54.679> also<00:01:55.679> I<00:01:55.710> forgot<00:01:55.830> to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
to mess around with also I forgot to

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.070 
to mess around with also I forgot to
mention<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.939> reverse<00:01:57.210> cascade<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.960> do

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
mention the reverse cascade if you do

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.620 
mention the reverse cascade if you do
all<00:01:58.289> group<00:01:58.530> overhead<00:01:59.369> throws<00:01:59.610> your<00:02:00.420> end<00:02:00.570> up

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
all group overhead throws your end up

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.550 
all group overhead throws your end up
like<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:01.940> both<00:02:02.940> hands<00:02:03.240> doing<00:02:03.569> this<00:02:03.720> motion

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.029 

that's<00:02:07.560> very<00:02:07.799> nice<00:02:07.950> pattern<00:02:08.160> too<00:02:09.920> but<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that's very nice pattern too but to

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.020 
that's very nice pattern too but to
start<00:02:11.250> out<00:02:11.310> with<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.580> would<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.819> try

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
start out with I would just try

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.820 
start out with I would just try
peppering<00:02:12.480> your<00:02:12.660> normal<00:02:13.110> cascade<00:02:13.470> with<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.680> few

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
peppering your normal cascade with a few

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.460 
peppering your normal cascade with a few
overhead<00:02:14.160> throws<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.580> both<00:02:14.700> sides<00:02:15.319> it's<00:02:16.319> that

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
overhead throws for both sides it's that

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.289 
overhead throws for both sides it's that
fun<00:02:16.680> with<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:16.940> another<00:02:17.940> fun<00:02:18.180> little

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
fun with that another fun little

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.670 
fun with that another fun little
variation<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:18.989> throwing<00:02:19.230> well<00:02:19.410> they're<00:02:19.530> doing

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
variation of throwing well they're doing

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.590 
variation of throwing well they're doing
a<00:02:19.769> normal<00:02:20.040> cascade<00:02:20.190> there's<00:02:21.000> an<00:02:21.120> underhanded

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
a normal cascade there's an underhanded

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.070 
a normal cascade there's an underhanded
drop<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:23.000> do<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.120> both<00:02:24.299> ways<00:02:24.540> also<00:02:27.080> and

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
drop that do this both ways also and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.440 
drop that do this both ways also and
it's<00:02:28.200> not<00:02:28.319> too<00:02:28.440> hard<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.650> understand<00:02:29.450> strike

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
it's not too hard to understand strike

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.009 
it's not too hard to understand strike
with<00:02:30.599> two<00:02:30.630> balls

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
with two balls

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.289 
with two balls
you're<00:02:31.560> going<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.769> throw<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.099> first<00:02:32.250> one<00:02:32.400> now

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
you're going to throw the first one now

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.150 
you're going to throw the first one now

sweeping once you're done throwing that
column<00:02:52.079> before<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.380> come<00:02:52.530> back<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.859> catch

column before you come back and catch

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.050 
column before you come back and catch
the<00:02:53.160> ball<00:02:53.280> again<00:02:53.519> where<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.730> started<00:02:56.000> it's<00:02:57.000> a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
the ball again where you started it's a

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.099 
the ball again where you started it's a
little<00:02:57.239> awkward<00:02:57.510> at<00:02:57.540> first<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:57.900> you'll<00:02:58.019> get

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
little awkward at first but you'll get

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.449 
little awkward at first but you'll get
used<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.320> it

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.020 

when<00:03:03.030> you're<00:03:03.120> doing<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:03.390> three<00:03:03.629> balls

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.920 

you

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.150 

it's<00:03:37.930> also<00:03:38.140> important<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.620> practice<00:03:39.010> being

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
it's also important to practice being

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.860 
it's also important to practice being
able<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.370> do<00:03:39.519> two<00:03:39.700> balls<00:03:39.910> in<00:03:40.060> one<00:03:40.239> hand<00:03:40.269> now

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
able to do two balls in one hand now

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.119 
able to do two balls in one hand now
personally<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.379> would<00:03:41.530> start<00:03:41.769> out<00:03:41.860> with<00:03:41.980> your

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
personally I would start out with your

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.100 
personally I would start out with your
strong<00:03:42.400> hand<00:03:42.430> but<00:03:43.120> also<00:03:43.150> make<00:03:43.569> sure<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.989> I'm

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
strong hand but also make sure that I'm

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.390 
strong hand but also make sure that I'm
still<00:03:44.319> practicing<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.830> might<00:03:44.950> weaken<00:03:45.220> because

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
still practicing it might weaken because

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.619 
still practicing it might weaken because
you<00:03:45.580> don't<00:03:45.730> want<00:03:45.849> to<00:03:45.910> get<00:03:45.970> out<00:03:46.120> of<00:03:46.209> balance<00:03:46.360> if

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
you don't want to get out of balance if

on<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.140> right<00:04:02.200> side<00:04:03.239> there's<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.510> outward

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
on the right side there's the outward

pattern where it's running from the
inside<00:04:06.129> of<00:04:06.220> your<00:04:06.310> body<00:04:06.489> to<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.760> outside<00:04:07.120> and

inside of your body to the outside and

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.210 
inside of your body to the outside and
of<00:04:08.140> course<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.500> inside<00:04:08.769> pattern<00:04:09.069> for<00:04:09.190> each

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
of course the inside pattern for each

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.089 
of course the inside pattern for each
other<00:04:09.430> command<00:04:09.910> inside<00:04:10.090> to<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.329> inside

other command inside to the inside
personally<00:04:12.099> I<00:04:12.130> find<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.579> harder<00:04:12.849> to<00:04:12.880> throw

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
personally I find it harder to throw

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.850 
personally I find it harder to throw
them<00:04:13.269> hand<00:04:13.450> side<00:04:13.660> in<00:04:13.870> but<00:04:14.230> some<00:04:14.440> people<00:04:14.680> find

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
them hand side in but some people find

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.440 
them hand side in but some people find
it<00:04:14.980> easier<00:04:15.040> whatever<00:04:15.730> works<00:04:15.940> for<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.239> just

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
it easier whatever works for you just

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.150 
it easier whatever works for you just
make<00:04:17.109> sure<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:17.320> keep<00:04:17.530> two<00:04:17.709> balls<00:04:17.889> in<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.130> air

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
make sure you keep two balls in the air

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.640 
make sure you keep two balls in the air
at<00:04:18.340> once<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:19.479> speed<00:04:19.780> is<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.959> little<00:04:20.019> bit<00:04:20.260> faster

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
at once the speed is a little bit faster

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.900 
at once the speed is a little bit faster
with<00:04:20.829> three<00:04:20.950> ball<00:04:21.130> cascade<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.669> but<00:04:21.820> the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
with three ball cascade it but the

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.520 
with three ball cascade it but the
timing<00:04:22.270> is<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.479> same<00:04:22.690> concept<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:23.320> have<00:04:23.440> to

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
timing is the same concept you have to

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.690 
timing is the same concept you have to
wait<00:04:23.680> for<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.919> first<00:04:24.070> ball<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.340> reach<00:04:24.520> its

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
wait for the first ball to reach its

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.580 
wait for the first ball to reach its
peak<00:04:24.850> and<00:04:25.120> then<00:04:25.210> throw<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.479> next<00:04:25.630> ball<00:04:25.840> and

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
peak and then throw the next ball and

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.290 
peak and then throw the next ball and
that<00:04:26.860> first<00:04:27.130> ball<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.460> peaking<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:27.910> pausing

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
that first ball is peaking and pausing

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.760 
that first ball is peaking and pausing
or<00:04:28.479> pausing<00:04:28.930> down<00:04:29.050> at<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.229> bottom<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:29.560> didn't

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
or pausing down at the bottom you didn't

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.409 
or pausing down at the bottom you didn't
ready<00:04:29.889> to<00:04:30.010> from<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.250> next<00:04:30.460> one<00:04:30.580> your<00:04:31.240> hand

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
ready to from the next one your hand

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.250 
ready to from the next one your hand
works<00:04:31.600> kinda<00:04:31.840> like<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:31.960> piston<00:04:33.900> it's<00:04:34.900> probably

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
works kinda like a piston it's probably

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.689 
works kinda like a piston it's probably
easier<00:04:35.470> if<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:35.650> start<00:04:35.889> learning<00:04:36.310> columns

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
easier if you start learning columns

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:37.830 
easier if you start learning columns
because<00:04:37.000> there<00:04:37.120> have<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.360> worry<00:04:37.539> about<00:04:37.660> the

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
because there have to worry about the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.240 
because there have to worry about the
arcing<00:04:38.169> of<00:04:38.229> the<00:04:38.289> ball<00:04:38.440> like<00:04:38.470> right<00:04:38.830> it<00:04:38.949> too<00:04:39.039> far

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
arcing of the ball like right it too far

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
arcing of the ball like right it too far
or<00:04:39.460> whatever<00:04:39.699> you're<00:04:39.850> going<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.000> be<00:04:40.060> doing

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
or whatever you're going to be doing

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.719 
or whatever you're going to be doing
maximum<00:04:40.840> so<00:04:41.440> just<00:04:41.979> do<00:04:42.100> whatever<00:04:42.250> is<00:04:42.460> easier

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
maximum so just do whatever is easier

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:43.890 
maximum so just do whatever is easier
for<00:04:42.760> you<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.240> try<00:04:43.419> to<00:04:43.479> make<00:04:43.570> sure<00:04:43.720> you<00:04:43.810> can

for you and try to make sure you can

for you and try to make sure you can
