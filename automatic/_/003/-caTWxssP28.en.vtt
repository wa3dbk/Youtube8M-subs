drivers and for some reason in 3dmark
does<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> drivers<00:01:00.050> both<00:01:01.050> have

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
does not like be a drivers both have

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.920 
does not like be a drivers both have
exactly<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> same<00:01:02.030> processor<00:01:03.030> both<00:01:03.570> sides

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
exactly the same processor both sides

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.830 
exactly the same processor both sides
exactly<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> same<00:01:04.769> speed<00:01:05.210> both<00:01:06.210> using<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
exactly the same speed both using the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.679 
exactly the same speed both using the
Year<00:01:07.110> Maximus<00:01:07.500> five<00:01:07.770> gene<00:01:08.130> motherboard<00:01:08.700> both

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
Year Maximus five gene motherboard both

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.000 
Year Maximus five gene motherboard both
of<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> exactly<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> same<00:01:10.560> memory<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
of the exactly the same memory so you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.270 
of the exactly the same memory so you
can<00:01:11.130> tell<00:01:11.369> us<00:01:11.400> exactly<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.150> same<00:01:12.330> computer

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
can tell us exactly the same computer

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.710 
can tell us exactly the same computer
okay<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:14.790> I'll<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.060> go<00:01:15.210> into<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> actual

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
okay so now I'll just go into the actual

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.929 
okay so now I'll just go into the actual
results<00:01:16.080> themselves<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.909> see

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
results themselves and as you can see

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.899 
results themselves and as you can see
clearly<00:01:19.340> scores<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> right<00:01:20.729> are

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
clearly scores on the right are

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.210 
clearly scores on the right are
significantly<00:01:21.780> higher<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.830> reason<00:01:23.130> why

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
significantly higher the reason why

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.859 
significantly higher the reason why
they're<00:01:23.400> significantly<00:01:24.000> higher<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.540> because

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
they're significantly higher is because

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.170 
they're significantly higher is because
whereas<00:01:25.229> i<00:01:25.350> thought<00:01:25.710> i<00:01:25.979> had<00:01:26.369> virtue<00:01:26.729> MVP

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
whereas i thought i had virtue MVP

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.810 
whereas i thought i had virtue MVP
disabled<00:01:27.750> i<00:01:27.990> go<00:01:28.590> down<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.890> list<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.460> as<00:01:29.700> you

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
disabled i go down this list and as you

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.499 
disabled i go down this list and as you
can<00:01:29.970> see<00:01:30.000> down<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:32.430> has<00:01:32.610> true<00:01:33.000> next<00:01:33.299> which

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
can see down here it has true next which

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.780 
can see down here it has true next which
means<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.960> virtue<00:01:34.200> MVP<00:01:34.829> was<00:01:35.250> actually

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
means the virtue MVP was actually

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
means the virtue MVP was actually
enabled<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> also<00:01:37.229> shows<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.770> other

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
enabled but it also shows one other

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.660 
enabled but it also shows one other
thing<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:38.850> virtue<00:01:39.180> MVP<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.810> enabled

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
thing that because virtue MVP is enabled

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.880 
thing that because virtue MVP is enabled
you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.700> get<00:01:41.939> scores<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:43.079> double<00:01:43.500> where<00:01:43.680> i<00:01:43.740> can

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you can get scores in double where i can

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.469 
you can get scores in double where i can
get<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.770> 10,000<00:01:46.770> plus<00:01:47.479> category

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
get like in the 10,000 plus category

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.620 
get like in the 10,000 plus category
whereas<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:49.950> i'm<00:01:50.189> still<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:51.329> just

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
whereas with that one i'm still in just

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.719 
whereas with that one i'm still in just
a<00:01:51.720> four<00:01:51.899> digit<00:01:52.049> sum<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:52.860> still<00:01:53.159> eight<00:01:53.430> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
a four digit sum but still eight and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.149 
a four digit sum but still eight and
nine<00:01:54.000> eight<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> half<00:01:54.899> thousand<00:01:55.560> 3d<00:01:55.860> marks

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
nine eight and a half thousand 3d marks

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.310
