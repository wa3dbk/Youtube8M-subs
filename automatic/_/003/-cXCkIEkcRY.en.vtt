bracelet you're gonna take a device to

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.150 
bracelet you're gonna take a device to
slice<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.990> log<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.560> can<00:00:16.710> use<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> regular

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
slice the log you can use a regular

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.040 
slice the log you can use a regular
knife<00:00:17.369> or<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.850> can<00:00:18.029> use<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> piece<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.480> plastic

knife or you can use a piece of plastic

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.109 
knife or you can use a piece of plastic
and<00:00:19.680> you're<00:00:20.039> gonna<00:00:20.130> cut<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.580> into<00:00:20.910> five

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and you're gonna cut it into five

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.870 
and you're gonna cut it into five
different<00:00:21.359> pieces<00:00:21.750> three<00:00:22.850> four<00:00:23.850> five<00:00:28.880> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
different pieces three four five the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.060 
different pieces three four five the
next<00:00:30.269> step<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:31.349> take<00:00:31.529> your<00:00:32.399> roller<00:00:34.070> and

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
next step is to take your roller and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.799 
next step is to take your roller and
what<00:00:35.219> you're<00:00:35.370> gonna<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.360> you're<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.719> to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
what you're gonna do is you're going to

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.630 
what you're gonna do is you're going to
want<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.230> flatten<00:00:37.920> pieces<00:00:40.340> do<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.399> about

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
want to flatten pieces do it about

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.510 
want to flatten pieces do it about
fourth<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.690> an<00:00:42.780> inch<00:00:42.930> thick<00:00:43.230> work<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.129> pieces

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
fourth of an inch thick work the pieces

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.330 
fourth of an inch thick work the pieces
until<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.000> get<00:00:45.180> kind<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.350> square<00:00:46.590> shape<00:00:47.039> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
until you get kind of a square shape and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.580 
until you get kind of a square shape and
don't<00:00:47.969> worry<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.719> not<00:00:48.930> perfectly<00:00:49.469> square

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
don't worry if it's not perfectly square

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.250 
don't worry if it's not perfectly square
because<00:00:50.160> after<00:00:50.879> we<00:00:51.030> make<00:00:51.239> our<00:00:51.510> shape<00:00:51.809> we're

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
because after we make our shape we're

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.869 
because after we make our shape we're
gonna<00:00:52.350> take<00:00:52.649> our<00:00:52.829> slicer<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.610> we're<00:00:53.789> gonna

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
gonna take our slicer and we're gonna

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.260 
gonna take our slicer and we're gonna
even<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> edges<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> you're<00:00:59.879> gonna<00:00:59.969> take

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
even out the edges so you're gonna take

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.579 
even out the edges so you're gonna take
your<00:01:00.780> slicing<00:01:01.410> device<00:01:01.820> or<00:01:02.820> anything<00:01:03.530> like<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
your slicing device or anything like a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.710 
your slicing device or anything like a
ruler<00:01:05.100> anything<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.299> comfortably

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
ruler anything that you can comfortably

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.219 
ruler anything that you can comfortably
hold<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.290> use<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.189> shape<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.850> squares<00:01:09.240> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
hold and use to shape the squares so

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.289 
hold and use to shape the squares so
you're<00:01:10.350> gonna<00:01:10.470> take<00:01:10.770> them<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.180> going

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you're gonna take them and you're going

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.960 
you're gonna take them and you're going
to<00:01:12.420> try<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.630> give<00:01:12.869> them<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.350> more<00:01:13.979> square<00:01:14.760> like

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
to try to give them a more square like

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.050 
to try to give them a more square like
shape<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.509> even<00:01:15.990> shape<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.220> trim

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
shape a more even shape and just trim

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.350 
shape a more even shape and just trim
off<00:01:21.049> any<00:01:22.049> excess<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.280> may<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.640> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
off any excess that you may have and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.100 
off any excess that you may have and
once<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> perfect<00:01:25.619> square<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:27.900> can

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
once you have a perfect square you can

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.210 
once you have a perfect square you can
go<00:01:28.259> ahead<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.680> trace<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.250> square<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:31.220> then

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
go ahead and trace that square and then

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.969 
go ahead and trace that square and then
you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.640> mold<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.329> other<00:01:33.479> squares<00:01:34.200> after

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
you can mold all the other squares after

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.830 
you can mold all the other squares after
it<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.310> find<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.030> lot<00:01:36.180> easier<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.810> just

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it I find it's a lot easier to just

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.999 
it I find it's a lot easier to just
trace<00:01:37.770> one<00:01:38.130> bead<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> rest<00:01:40.710> just

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
trace one bead and then do the rest just

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.680 
trace one bead and then do the rest just
like<00:01:41.159> it

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.760 

that<00:01:44.470> way<00:01:44.680> they'll<00:01:45.040> be<00:01:45.070> somewhat<00:01:45.970> even<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
that way they'll be somewhat even and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.150 
that way they'll be somewhat even and
you<00:01:47.980> take<00:01:48.250> your<00:01:48.430> tool<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.720> press<00:01:50.160> against

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
you take your tool and you press against

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.620 
you take your tool and you press against
the<00:01:51.220> sides<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:54.040> this<00:01:54.070> use<00:01:54.850> your<00:01:54.880> finger<00:01:55.450> to

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
the sides like this use your finger to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.600 
the sides like this use your finger to
push<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.950> clay<00:01:58.230> and<00:01:59.230> keep<00:01:59.500> the<00:02:00.010> tool<00:02:00.280> on<00:02:00.490> the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
push the clay and keep the tool on the

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:11.850 
push the clay and keep the tool on the
other<00:02:00.730> side<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.520> now<00:02:09.790> we<00:02:09.850> have<00:02:10.240> nice<00:02:10.869> even

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
other side and now we have nice even

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.510 
other side and now we have nice even
beautiful<00:02:12.300> square<00:02:13.300> beads
