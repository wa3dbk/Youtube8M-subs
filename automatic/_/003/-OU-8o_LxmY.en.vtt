00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
as far as a finished product but some of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.680 
as far as a finished product but some of
the<00:00:43.559> things<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.890> look<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.280> body<00:00:44.910> work<00:00:45.030> wise<00:00:45.390> if

kind of body work you want to look for

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.889 
kind of body work you want to look for
straight<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.739> finished<00:00:50.700> body<00:00:50.940> as

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
straight and and finished body as

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.750 
straight and and finished body as
minimal<00:00:52.559> rust<00:00:52.770> as<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.190> possibly<00:00:53.550> get

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
minimal rust as you can possibly get

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.160 
minimal rust as you can possibly get
obviously<00:00:54.239> because<00:00:54.480> rust<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.840> what's<00:00:55.050> going

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
obviously because rust is what's going

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.619 
obviously because rust is what's going
to<00:00:55.199> kill<00:00:55.379> these<00:00:55.559> cars<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.610> one<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> tricks

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
to kill these cars so one of the tricks

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.420 
to kill these cars so one of the tricks
is<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:57.960> actually<00:00:58.260> excite<00:00:58.620> down<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.100> fenders

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
is will actually excite down the fenders

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.830 
is will actually excite down the fenders
and<00:00:59.460> look<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.940> how<00:01:00.030> straight<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.600> because

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and look see how straight it is because

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.420 
and look see how straight it is because
if<00:01:01.199> they're<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> little<00:01:01.680> bit<00:01:01.800> wavy<00:01:01.980> that's<00:01:02.309> an

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
if they're a little bit wavy that's an

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.860 
if they're a little bit wavy that's an
indication<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.090> there's<00:01:03.329> been<00:01:03.480> some<00:01:03.690> body

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
indication that there's been some body

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.780 
indication that there's been some body
work<00:01:04.080> done<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> whether<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.580> good

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
or bad you don't know until you actually

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.469

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
it's not necessary to say that wavy is

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.039 
it's not necessary to say that wavy is
bad<00:01:11.400> no<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.210> necessarily<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.990> know

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
fix it and another thing take a magnet

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.929 
fix it and another thing take a magnet
and<00:01:45.049> just<00:01:46.049> stick<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> car<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.700> there's

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and just stick it to the car if there's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.249 
and just stick it to the car if there's
good<00:01:48.149> steel<00:01:48.420> there<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> magnet<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.140> gonna

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
good steel there the magnet is gonna

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.230 
good steel there the magnet is gonna
stick<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.610> into<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.820> spot<00:01:51.060> where

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
stick if you get into a spot where

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.880 
stick if you get into a spot where
there's<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.450> lot<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.750> plastic<00:01:52.140> filler<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
there's a lot of plastic filler the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.319 
there's a lot of plastic filler the
magnet<00:01:53.250> won't<00:01:53.430> even<00:01:53.640> stick<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.060> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
magnet won't even stick to it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.450 
magnet won't even stick to it
and<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.350> could<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.530> buried<00:01:55.799> under<00:01:56.009> paint<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and that could be buried under paint and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
and that could be buried under paint and
look<00:01:56.670> okay<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.329> might<00:01:57.509> look<00:01:57.689> great<00:01:57.990> now<00:01:58.229> again

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
look okay it might look great now again

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.950 
look okay it might look great now again
plastic<00:01:59.280> fillers<00:01:59.579> may<00:01:59.880> be<00:01:59.939> not<00:02:00.180> bad<00:02:00.450> but

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
plastic fillers may be not bad but

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.389 
plastic fillers may be not bad but
you're<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.259> looking<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:01.829> awareness

of what's been done to it before yeah
absolutely<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.820> all<00:02:05.909> depends<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.360> again<00:02:06.869> what

you care are you gonna are you planning
on<00:02:29.909> using<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.450> if<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.989> are<00:02:31.109> then<00:02:31.439> look<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:31.799> oil

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
on using it if you are then look for oil

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.520 
on using it if you are then look for oil
leaks<00:02:32.310> obviously<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.329> 1956<00:02:34.140> if<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:34.409> an

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
leaks obviously in 1956 if it's an

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.599 
leaks obviously in 1956 if it's an
original<00:02:34.620> engine<00:02:35.099> you're<00:02:35.189> gonna<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.459> some

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
original engine you're gonna have some

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:36.740 
original engine you're gonna have some
wire<00:02:35.760> leaks<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.209> take<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.540> into

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
wire leaks so take that into

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.520 
wire leaks so take that into
consideration

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
consideration

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.500 
consideration
check<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.250> suspension<00:02:38.819> out<00:02:38.909> see<00:02:39.180> if<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.359> can

you know I mean if you wiggle it up and
down<00:02:43.010> if<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.219> shocks<00:02:44.459> are<00:02:44.700> decent<00:02:45.060> look<00:02:45.930> at

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
down if the shocks are decent look at

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.629 
down if the shocks are decent look at
the<00:02:46.200> shocks<00:02:46.470> look<00:02:46.829> at<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.069> frame<00:02:47.310> see<00:02:47.549> how

drive it that way all right well it's

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.409 
drive it that way all right well it's
you<00:04:30.159> know<00:04:30.250> it's<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.460> little<00:04:30.669> bit<00:04:30.759> nebulous<00:04:30.969> but

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
you know it's a little bit nebulous but

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.879 
you know it's a little bit nebulous but
the<00:04:31.930> answer<00:04:32.229> is<00:04:32.349> a<00:04:32.379> little<00:04:32.530> bit<00:04:32.740> nebulous

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
the answer is a little bit nebulous

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.350 
the answer is a little bit nebulous
because<00:04:33.550> it

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
because it

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.610 
because it
Brent<00:04:34.840> keeps<00:04:35.080> saying<00:04:35.319> it's<00:04:35.500> gonna

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
Brent keeps saying it's gonna

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.110 
Brent keeps saying it's gonna
independent<00:04:36.099> how<00:04:36.219> much<00:04:36.400> dough<00:04:36.639> you<00:04:36.699> want<00:04:37.000> to
