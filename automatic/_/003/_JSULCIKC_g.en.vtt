original complete common core kit now

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.820 
original complete common core kit now
when<00:00:06.569> we<00:00:06.690> tested<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.230> product<00:00:07.560> with

when we tested this product with
teachers<00:00:08.189> across<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.580> country<00:00:08.880> they<00:00:09.030> were<00:00:09.090> so

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480

the standards and we include language
arts<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.740> math<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.939> depending<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.480> what<00:00:27.660> grade

dividers and you'll see that there are
red<00:00:44.250> ones<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:45.510> math<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.559> blue

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
red ones for math and then we have blue

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.709 
red ones for math and then we have blue
ones<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.250> language<00:00:47.550> arts<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.450> way<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
dividers are set up is that these are

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.029 
dividers are set up is that these are
broken<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:51.030> by<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.469> Language<00:00:52.469> Arts<00:00:52.649> anchor

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.639 
standards mm-hmm and by the math domains
and<00:00:56.370> now<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> noticed<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> back<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and now I noticed on the back of the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.630 
and now I noticed on the back of the
standard<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.350> I<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.710> state<00:01:02.160> Mary's

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
standard you have and I can state Mary's

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.420 
standard you have and I can state Mary's
yes<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.960> look<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.350> these<00:01:04.500> cards<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.220> can

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
yes when you look at these cards you can

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.030 
yes when you look at these cards you can
see<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.750> verbage<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.439> standard<00:01:07.830> can

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
see that the verbage of a standard can

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.280 
see that the verbage of a standard can
get<00:01:08.220> very<00:01:08.460> long<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.240> vocabulary<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
get very long the vocabulary is at a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.350 
get very long the vocabulary is at a
very<00:01:10.350> high<00:01:10.590> level<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.180> this

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
very high level so to have this

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.940 
very high level so to have this
displayed<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:12.960> students<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.590> always

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
displayed for students is not always

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.370 
displayed for students is not always
beneficial<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.659> what<00:01:15.810> we've<00:01:15.960> done<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
beneficial so what we've done on the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.710 
beneficial so what we've done on the
back<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.740> each<00:01:16.890> card<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.580> really<00:01:18.240> broken<00:01:18.479> that

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
back of each card is really broken that

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.600 
back of each card is really broken that
down<00:01:18.750> into<00:01:19.140> kid-friendly<00:01:19.560> language<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.310> every

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
down into kid-friendly language so every

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.340 
down into kid-friendly language so every
one<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> standards<00:01:21.479> has<00:01:21.720> an<00:01:21.869> ican

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
one of the standards has an ican

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.140 
one of the standards has an ican
statement<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.310> tell<00:01:23.490> me<00:01:23.580> how<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> teacher

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
statement so tell me how would a teacher

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.480 
statement so tell me how would a teacher
actually<00:01:24.479> display<00:01:25.320> these<00:01:25.650> cards<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.340> her

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
actually display these cards in her

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.020 
actually display these cards in her
classroom

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
classroom

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.050 
classroom
well<00:01:27.509> actually<00:01:28.250> what<00:01:29.250> we've<00:01:29.369> done<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:29.729> Carson

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
well actually what we've done at Carson

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.270 
well actually what we've done at Carson
jalisa<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.600> actually<00:01:30.930> created<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.650> daily

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
jalisa is actually created a daily

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.069 
jalisa is actually created a daily
standards<00:01:32.729> pocket<00:01:33.090> chart<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.570> has<00:01:33.780> five

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
standards pocket chart it has five

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.859 
standards pocket chart it has five
pockets<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.430> went<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.090> small<00:01:36.479> size

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
pockets and we went with the small size

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.870 
pockets and we went with the small size
because<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.560> know<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.770> space<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.610> very

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
because we know that space is very

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580 
because we know that space is very
limited<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.450> classrooms<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.409> this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
limited in classrooms but because this

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.260 
limited in classrooms but because this
is<00:01:40.740> required<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.460> wanted<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.790> get<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> handy

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
is required we wanted to get a handy

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.819 
is required we wanted to get a handy
place<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.689> teachers<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.110> put<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> standards

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
place for teachers to put the standards

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.440 
place for teachers to put the standards
and<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.369> looks<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.790> would<00:01:44.909> fit<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.270> any

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
