00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello everyone welcome today 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.809
 for this new video 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.240
 so for this video we will assemble 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.219
 a little dress I did the same 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.890
 eyesight of the physical activity on 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.720
 in front of me here i have my sleeves td 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.019
 mention that go down a little bit 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.900
 like that here gape in front and my back and 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.130
 then at the bottom or two and a half years 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.230
 so once I have all the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.579
 pieces in front of me i'm going to start 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.590
 directly by the fox 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.020
 if a sewing teacher will go through 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.079
 there will tell you that you must first make a 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.200
 building then Matisse and cuttings 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.780
 by hand just like this all the way round 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.700
 above and below just for 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.180
 assemble all the parts and women and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.670
 ch 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.129
 we will make a point to the machine to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.500
 sew then to make this point there 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.809
 will take the most weight length 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.660
 wide of our sewing machine and we do not 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.760
 will no breakpoints for this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.500
 to be able to undo our culture 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.600
 since she defeats you anyway 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.310
 so to be able to serve your point 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.570
 then built on how did I do that 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.549
 insurgents you can also do one on 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.710
 proud so I'll start with everything 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.780
 assembled at 2 front and back and then 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.290
 we will assemble the eat together top 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.430
 and the bottom in front of the high and the low water 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.250
 then before the meeting the rounds 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.900
 I assemble the shoulders I assemble a 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.850
 loving so once I've assembled 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.820
 so shoulders and sleeves 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.520
 I am assembling the sides here is the dress is 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.490
 assembled on did not rotate we did not 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.770
 nothing done in terms of finishes 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.509
 so I passed them to the fitting 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.329
 retouching if necessary we will start 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.979
 the sewing of the arop so that's so we 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.729
 see that the dress is very very 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.939
 long and very wide front removed here at 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.950
 about 5 cm then on the arms we go 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.329
 withdraw also so we are 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.500
 here on the sides why withdraw to little 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.250
 close three centimeters on each side 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.250
 to be like that 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.060
 m 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.610
 no 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.510
 so here are all the steps 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.400
 which was easy to achieve 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.799
 first step I assembled the top and 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.840
 no wind as well as the top and the 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:40.129
 low back 2nd step 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.200
 g assembled here the third shoulders 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.540
 step here to myself to assemble the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.760
 sleeves 1 so I come here so my 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.440
 shoulders are assembled I come here 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.180
 check the symmetry of the seam there 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.879
 it must be as you see it 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.849
 here perfectly aligned if for example 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.470
 here I have a seam that is like those 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.260
 one for example offset from 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.780
 the other I will be able to rectify very 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.019
 easily this defect when I so 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.310
 just mandel they have me in front 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.489
 of assembly so one side and the other 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.230
 of course the symmetry of may sewing so 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.510
 this way here when I'm coming 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.040
 assembled but next side the seams 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.200
 will be in front of each other so 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.819
 in front and back this is what that is what 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.079
 is part of the finishes and what will 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.980
 allow us to obtain finishes 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.319
 perfect 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.720
 so once I checked well so 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.819
 the symmetry of the seam I come with 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.489
 my front iron passes and plated but 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.010
 sewing and open them like this then 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.500
 I come to make either insurgents be on 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.079
 spinning once I've checked 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.690
 this I ironed but sewing effect 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.669
 montsÃ»rs spinning I come then always 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.459
 openly 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.329
 I come to assemble the sleeves 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.400
 unlike other cultures that 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.989
 are quite simple the seam of the sleeves 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.130
 asks a bit of technique since 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.650
 it's something that's a little bit 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.780
 rounded so I filmed you 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.700
 how I proceeded so here are my 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.160
 explanations and tips and details 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.269
 of this culture then in theory for 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.030
 what is the assembly must we 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.410
 stay to assemble the sides so here 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.250
 the sides months and then we will sign 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.590
 with the side of the skirt 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.150
 but here you see I cut out of 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.190
 sale 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.519
 so I took the width of the bottom of the 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.919
 accord skirt and these are bands of 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.130
 12.5 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.900
 I forgot in demand issue here and 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.190
 so that will serve me the fascination 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.169
 so you can take something 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.220
 wide enough or not it's like you 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.340
 then we will take care of 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.690
 neckline mission for a little bit 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.120
 sewing on the shoulders I was going 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.010
 to be able to sew the finish here 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.330
 with the south would have once we have 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.490
 posed to our welfare rabe is 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.960
 finished so I had filmed a lot 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.600
 more details but since I had a 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.710
 virus on my computer 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.510
 all the details are gone so there 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.330
 you see the pictures of what we did 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.760
 and if you want to see how I have 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.650
 realized so these decorations with 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.690
 rhinestones there is the video that is 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.550
 available on my channel I you 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.750
 thanks for watching my video and I 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.170
 See you soon for many more 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.170
 tutorial 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.560
 he
