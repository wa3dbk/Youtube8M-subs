00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:11.010
 this week all is well except for a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.420
 small wound 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.900
 9 shoulders I have to work 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.920
 rise around the art of injury I 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.410
 do not know how it happened 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.359
 maybe I'm in front of the fans you 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.130
 have injuries from deposits that 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.990
 chart of times you get up with you 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.460
 you wake up a winter morning with 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.489
 you have sore shoulders you you 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.530
 ask what happened to leave or 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.200
 double and when you sleep on the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.210
 side with the comedy side completely 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.500
 heavy to find you in the morning you 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.879
 when you dream you have more 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.070
 small wounds so surely that's 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.390
 to arrive with the exact moment 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 so when I have scouts like 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.649
 sarah darby lady but if i get depressed 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.289
 hounsa in what I do and that's it 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.180
 things the shortest time 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.730
 but a second test shot 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.699
 I teach you how to train 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.899
 to dry to do all this despite that 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.039
 when you have injuries 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.989
 so what would I do to eat stuff 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.339
 like that but they are relays to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.439
 games me brothers moga 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.420
 no I just do menus 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.700
 take a little bit where I work the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.590
 form and gc i try to treat the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.299
 injury so in situations like 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.600
 I take whole bragging 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.820
 information or I also take m I 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.200
 put two ice cubes 20 minutes 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.630

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.350

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.420
 minutes 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.329

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.810

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.799
