down to 25 tell attorney I don't know
what<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.020> hell<00:05:32.199> happened<00:05:32.319> maybe<00:05:32.830> it's

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
what the hell happened maybe it's

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.309 
what the hell happened maybe it's
because<00:05:33.490> my<00:05:33.669> room<00:05:34.090> is<00:05:34.270> too<00:05:34.449> small<00:05:34.479> I<00:05:34.720> I<00:05:34.900> only

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
because my room is too small I I only

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.390 
because my room is too small I I only
have<00:05:35.560> like<00:05:35.590> 4<00:05:36.460> gigabyte<00:05:37.000> of<00:05:37.210> ROM<00:05:37.740> is<00:05:38.740> too<00:05:39.130> small

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
have like 4 gigabyte of ROM is too small

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.959 
have like 4 gigabyte of ROM is too small
for<00:05:39.460> recording<00:05:40.030> and<00:05:40.240> I'm<00:05:40.569> using<00:05:41.370> 64-bit<00:05:42.370> of

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
for recording and I'm using 64-bit of

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.010 
for recording and I'm using 64-bit of
Windows<00:05:43.389> 7

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
Windows 7

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.350 
Windows 7
maybe<00:05:44.590> it's<00:05:44.830> because<00:05:45.009> of<00:05:45.280> that<00:05:45.460> I<00:05:45.699> don't<00:05:46.150> know

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
maybe it's because of that I don't know

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.059 
maybe it's because of that I don't know
maybe<00:05:47.110> because<00:05:47.349> of<00:05:47.830> my<00:05:48.569> hard<00:05:49.569> drive<00:05:49.780> runs<00:05:50.710> too

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
maybe because of my hard drive runs too

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.200 
maybe because of my hard drive runs too

some of it I'm getting new a hard drive

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.570 
some of it I'm getting new a hard drive
maybe<00:05:55.620> after<00:05:56.620> all<00:05:56.740> or<00:05:56.949> something<00:05:57.370> like<00:05:57.520> that

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580
