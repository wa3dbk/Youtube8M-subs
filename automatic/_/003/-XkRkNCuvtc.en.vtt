 distinguished worldwide for being 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.649
 spearhead on this subject is necessary 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.780
 be able to know the files that from the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.009
 attentively and here you can see it 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.509
 the signature of alfonso salazar mendoza 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.640

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.380
 about a month and in which 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.450
 they tell me they have checked in all their 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.900
 archives of both the air force 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:21.400
 secretariat of the sea and marine defense and 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:24.400
 they do not have any documents or information 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.379
 only the case of the plane is 26 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.799
 that was made known by the 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.720
 Jaime Maussan and what is it that 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.900
 it is known is simply and simply 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.810
 has made known on television and good 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.720
 before this comes an answer like that is 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.299
 comes to this response from the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.530
 secretary of the defense in which then 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.950
 they tell me what 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.240
 there is no kind of 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.370
 information 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.130
 in the archives of the stories of the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.290
 national defense and that only the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.140
 information about the case of the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.820
 c-26 airplane on alleged objects 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.740
 flying identified and released 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.880
 to the whole society by means of 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.590
 communication 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.450
 he mentions that the air force 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.550
 American has not made any 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.860
 investigation 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.650
 concessive in the case of a 36 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.660
 and this dependency is then open to 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.350
 give any other report that is 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.270
 I requested 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.010
 and the crazy that was the answer that you 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.070
 send to that first letter that taking 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.590
 this chaplain president and that's me 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.230
 I think that all this must be opened 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.980
 information since countries like 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.069
 they are brazil peru ecuador argentina 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.230
 have released their reports on 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.659
 the unidentified flying objects 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.909
 the sighting and recovery of 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.129
 these objects in air spaces and in their 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.020
 territory writes or that you just 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.970
 send a new 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.390
 if we just request the same 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.080
 the tasks of defense 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.030
 Well, if you have files of these 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.530
 cases that were made known by the 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.990
 newspapers the national press the 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.280
 excelsior are of healthy brand the sun of 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.840
 populate in latest news the financial 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.010
 about the fall of flying objects not 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:22.980
 identified since the year of 1950 64 65 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:26.040
 77 88 94 2003 and that in some of the 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.510
 cited articles are referenced from 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.910
 military personnel who participated in the 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.160
 recovery of these objects in the case 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.770
 for example of the fifties then 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.510
 they could not be satellites since we know 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.880
 that is the year of 57 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.940
 the first satellite that was the sputnik 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.790
 was launched into space in cases like 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:50.820
 64 65 77 88 etcetera 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.350
 and we want to know also what information 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.760
 you have about the fall of these objects 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.590
 clear or about these cases 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.970
 specific you want me to have a 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.670
 answer to see what it was that 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.420
 it happened there that's because they are reports 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.289
 of newspapers about the fall of UFOs in 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.409
 Mexican territory 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:12.749
 of cuchi piles zacatecas in March 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:12.749
 1950 is another fallen object 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.560
 warrior in 1967 is the request for 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.600
 information of one that fell in the canyon 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.660
 of the sink in 1980 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:30.970
 Well, since 1877 it fell on the 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:33.010
 sierra and one that fell in 1880 outside of 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.100
 Guadalajara Jalisco I think so 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.380
 because it is not one or two are many 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.950
 the cases that have been disclosed in 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:45.130
 the national press and in it is given to 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.260
 know that military personnel participated 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.630
 in the recovery of these objects 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.210
 well then here we see that this 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.660
 letter as you can see here is 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.550
 Mexico DF October 14 , 2013 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.190
 generates the diploma of the staff 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.470
 salvador cienfuegos zepeda secretary of 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.780
 the present and good national defense 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.010
 then in 20 days then consider yourself 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.500
 alfonso that can give you an answer 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.030
 If so , and we report that as 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.490
 we are part of the group if you see that it is the 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.620
 most active phenomena research 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.820
 UFO in Mexico and that all this we have 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.210
 treated seriously as it should be 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.750
 they have been very respectful in their 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.310
 answers and we hope to see what we 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.680
 respond on this request we are going to 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:31.300
 see what the government's reaction is 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:34.210
 current to see if they accept 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.039
 because there are the reports with the 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.070
 dates are the names of the 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.870
 newspapers 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.370
 let's hope we know what the answer is 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.979
 by the authorities 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:48.240
 in this case military on the 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.240
 information that is being requested 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.699
 Y 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.890
 all right
