they<00:00:35.460> were<00:00:35.489> mainly<00:00:35.820> mascaras<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> only

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
they were mainly mascaras but I only

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.869 
they were mainly mascaras but I only
picked<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.680> mascaras<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.219> didn't<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.640> I

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
picked to the mascaras I didn't like I

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.880 
picked to the mascaras I didn't like I
think<00:00:39.360> there<00:00:39.480> was<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.719> five<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.739> six

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
think there was like five or six

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.180 
think there was like five or six
mascaras<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:42.059> didn't<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:44.010> I'm

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
mascaras that I just didn't like so I'm

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.040 
mascaras that I just didn't like so I'm
going<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.340> start<00:00:44.579> off<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.450> mascara<00:00:45.780> tom

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
going to start off with the mascara tom

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.350 
going to start off with the mascara tom
the<00:00:46.410> first<00:00:46.620> one<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.370> Revlon<00:00:47.730> double<00:00:48.090> twist

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the first one is the Revlon double twist

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.010 
the first one is the Revlon double twist
I<00:00:48.690> actually<00:00:49.379> did<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> review<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.640> one

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
I actually did a review of this one

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.990 
I actually did a review of this one
saying<00:00:52.020> how<00:00:52.410> i<00:00:52.440> hated<00:00:52.920> how<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.219> brush<00:00:53.670> gets

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
saying how i hated how the brush gets

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.760 
saying how i hated how the brush gets
like<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.210> clumpy<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.469> like<00:00:55.620> all

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
like really clumpy and it's like all

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.369 
like really clumpy and it's like all
stuck<00:00:56.129> up<00:00:56.160> there<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.899> if<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.020> look<00:00:58.199> inside

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
stuck up there and if you look inside

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.049 
stuck up there and if you look inside
there<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.539> gross<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:02.760> first

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
there it's like really gross the first

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.729 
there it's like really gross the first
couple<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.480> uses<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:04.080> was<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
couple of uses I was like this is a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.530 
couple of uses I was like this is a
really<00:01:05.309> good<00:01:05.430> mascara<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.000> think<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
really good mascara I think I'm going to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.570 
really good mascara I think I'm going to
like<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:07.770> after<00:01:08.040> you've<00:01:08.189> had<00:01:08.280> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
like this but then after you've had it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.429 
like this but then after you've had it
for<00:01:08.610> about<00:01:08.850> three<00:01:09.360> days<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.990> start<00:01:10.229> that's

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
for about three days it's start that's

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.920 
for about three days it's start that's
when<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.619> starts<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> get<00:01:11.040> clumpy<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:12.420> unless

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
when I starts to get clumpy so unless

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.770 
when I starts to get clumpy so unless
you<00:01:13.110> plan<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.350> purchasing<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.070> product

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
you plan on purchasing this product

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
you plan on purchasing this product
every<00:01:15.780> second<00:01:16.290> day<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.880> not<00:01:17.880> worth<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:19.640> next

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
every second day it's not worth it next

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
every second day it's not worth it next
mascara<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> didn't<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.570> much<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.159> lips

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
mascara I didn't like that much is lips

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.920 
mascara I didn't like that much is lips
this<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:23.460> great<00:01:24.180> laughs<00:01:25.400> whatever<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.820> lot<00:01:27.780> of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
this one great laughs whatever a lot of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.510 
this one great laughs whatever a lot of
you've<00:01:28.020> probably<00:01:28.229> seen<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:28.890> in

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you've probably seen this one it's in

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.230 
you've probably seen this one it's in
the<00:01:30.240> pink<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.049> green<00:01:31.229> container<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.240> this

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the pink and green container and this

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.660 
the pink and green container and this
one<00:01:33.509> wasn't<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:34.229> bad<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.460> didn't

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
one wasn't as bad as that one it didn't

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.350 
one wasn't as bad as that one it didn't
clump<00:01:36.000> up<00:01:36.180> or<00:01:36.390> anything<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.890> stayed

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
clump up or anything and it stayed

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.889 
clump up or anything and it stayed
relatively<00:01:39.360> clean<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.409> there<00:01:41.509> but<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.540> think

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
relatively clean in there but I think

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.810 
relatively clean in there but I think
the<00:01:43.170> problem<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the problem with this one is that the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.760 
the problem with this one is that the
formula<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.479> mascara<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.259> thin<00:01:46.590> that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
formula for the mascara is so thin that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.490 
formula for the mascara is so thin that
like<00:01:47.399> when<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.700> put<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.210> if<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.689> blink<00:01:49.170> within

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
like when I put it on if I blink within

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.749 
like when I put it on if I blink within
like<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.649> next<00:01:49.770> two<00:01:50.189> minutes<00:01:50.310> after<00:01:50.729> that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
like the next two minutes after that

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.490 
like the next two minutes after that
then<00:01:51.090> there's<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> huge<00:01:51.659> line<00:01:51.689> down<00:01:52.110> there<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
then there's a huge line down there and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.670 
then there's a huge line down there and
I<00:01:53.189> don't<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.670> how<00:01:54.119> big<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.899> brush<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.259> like

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
I don't like how big this brush is like

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.429 
I don't like how big this brush is like
if<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.979> compare<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.520> my<00:01:56.640> finger<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.450> like

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
if you compare it to my finger it's like

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.709 
if you compare it to my finger it's like
it's<00:01:59.340> fairly<00:01:59.670> close<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> size<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.630> my

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
it's fairly close to the size of my

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.899 
it's fairly close to the size of my
finger<00:02:00.930> which<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.680> bit<00:02:02.219> too<00:02:02.399> big<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.759> like

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
finger which is a bit too big I like

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.030 
finger which is a bit too big I like
smaller<00:02:03.270> brushes<00:02:03.570> they<00:02:04.350> have<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> lot<00:02:04.890> more

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
smaller brushes they have a lot more

but they look like that and I thought

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.819 
but they look like that and I thought
they<00:03:53.829> would<00:03:53.950> be<00:03:53.980> cute<00:03:54.340> because<00:03:54.519> um<00:03:55.829> they're

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
they would be cute because um they're

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.289 
they would be cute because um they're
fairly<00:03:57.069> small<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:57.700> I<00:03:57.730> could<00:03:57.940> wear<00:03:58.090> them<00:03:58.239> for

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
fairly small so I could wear them for

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.210 
fairly small so I could wear them for
like<00:03:58.750> just<00:04:00.660> casual<00:04:01.660> ish<00:04:02.079> occasions<00:04:02.920> I<00:04:03.010> guess

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
like just casual ish occasions I guess

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.520 
like just casual ish occasions I guess
like<00:04:03.459> if<00:04:03.730> I'm<00:04:04.630> going<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:05.049> like<00:04:05.139> a<00:04:05.170> family

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
like if I'm going to like a family

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.720 
like if I'm going to like a family
dinner<00:04:05.739> or<00:04:05.980> something<00:04:06.160> because<00:04:06.430> I<00:04:06.549> don't<00:04:06.700> want

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
dinner or something because I don't want

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.360 
dinner or something because I don't want
to<00:04:06.880> have<00:04:06.970> giant<00:04:07.660> lashes<00:04:08.019> for<00:04:08.170> that<00:04:08.319> but<00:04:09.160> the

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
to have giant lashes for that but the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.979 
to have giant lashes for that but the
one<00:04:09.519> thing<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:09.790> didn't<00:04:10.180> like<00:04:10.209> about<00:04:10.359> these<00:04:10.780> is

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
one thing I didn't like about these is

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.650 
one thing I didn't like about these is
that<00:04:11.380> my<00:04:11.920> actual<00:04:12.489> lashes<00:04:12.970> were<00:04:13.090> way<00:04:13.329> longer

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
that my actual lashes were way longer

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.479 
that my actual lashes were way longer
than<00:04:13.840> them<00:04:14.139> and<00:04:14.350> when<00:04:14.829> you<00:04:14.950> look<00:04:15.130> at<00:04:15.250> them<00:04:15.340> in

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
than them and when you look at them in

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.039 
than them and when you look at them in
here<00:04:15.670> like<00:04:15.819> oh<00:04:16.000> there's<00:04:16.359> no<00:04:16.479> way<00:04:16.600> my<00:04:16.750> last<00:04:16.900> she

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
here like oh there's no way my last she

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.469 
here like oh there's no way my last she
can<00:04:17.200> be<00:04:17.289> longer<00:04:17.590> than<00:04:17.620> those<00:04:17.859> but<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:19.299> only

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
can be longer than those but the only

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.000 
can be longer than those but the only
thing<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.810> really<00:04:19.870> did<00:04:20.139> for<00:04:20.289> me<00:04:20.380> was<00:04:20.530> slightly

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
thing I really did for me was slightly

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.210 
thing I really did for me was slightly
thickened<00:04:21.580> at<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:21.970> outside<00:04:22.390> of<00:04:22.750> them<00:04:23.169> of<00:04:24.010> my

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
thickened at the outside of them of my

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.670 
thickened at the outside of them of my
lashes

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
lashes

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.260 
lashes
so<00:04:24.820> it's<00:04:25.820> not<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.270> best<00:04:26.630> product<00:04:27.320> like<00:04:28.190> if<00:04:29.000> you

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
so it's not the best product like if you

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.420 
so it's not the best product like if you
have<00:04:29.479> short<00:04:29.509> lashes<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.560> you<00:04:30.919> just<00:04:31.070> want<00:04:31.280> a

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
have short lashes and you just want a

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.580 
have short lashes and you just want a
bit<00:04:31.610> longer<00:04:31.820> than<00:04:32.150> get<00:04:32.330> these<00:04:32.509> for<00:04:32.840> sure<00:04:33.020> but

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
bit longer than get these for sure but

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.170 
bit longer than get these for sure but
if<00:04:33.710> you're<00:04:33.830> like<00:04:33.979> me<00:04:34.250> who<00:04:34.430> has<00:04:34.520> fairly<00:04:34.880> long

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
if you're like me who has fairly long

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.480 
if you're like me who has fairly long
lashes<00:04:35.419> already<00:04:35.840> I<00:04:36.110> would<00:04:36.770> stay<00:04:37.070> away<00:04:37.100> from

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
lashes already I would stay away from

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.879 
lashes already I would stay away from
them<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.690> yeah<00:04:38.780> those<00:04:38.960> are<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.229> only<00:04:39.380> products

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
them so yeah those are the only products

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.830 
them so yeah those are the only products
I<00:04:40.009> could<00:04:40.160> actually<00:04:40.370> find<00:04:40.729> that<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.300> didn't

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
I could actually find that I didn't

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.010 
I could actually find that I didn't
absolutely<00:04:42.470> love<00:04:43.310> which<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.150> really<00:04:44.810> weird

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
absolutely love which is really weird

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.370 
absolutely love which is really weird
because<00:04:45.259> I<00:04:45.440> have<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.830> whole<00:04:46.100> bunch<00:04:46.280> of<00:04:46.460> makeup

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
because I have a whole bunch of makeup

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.480 
because I have a whole bunch of makeup
actually<00:04:48.380> there's<00:04:48.530> probably<00:04:48.590> more<00:04:48.979> I<00:04:49.220> could

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
actually there's probably more I could

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.430 
actually there's probably more I could
have<00:04:49.580> found<00:04:49.699> but<00:04:50.030> I<00:04:50.300> didn't<00:04:51.289> feel<00:04:51.380> like
