right now and another really good thing

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.650 
right now and another really good thing
about<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.699> game<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.539> don't

three different races you can choose in

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.500 
three different races you can choose in
the<00:02:13.140> game<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.650> picked<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.330> common<00:02:15.330> one

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
the game so I picked the common one

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.660 
the game so I picked the common one
which<00:02:15.750> many<00:02:16.110> players<00:02:16.350> use<00:02:16.650> because<00:02:16.860> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
which many players use because the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.970 
which many players use because the
explanation<00:02:18.210> of<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.480> says<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:19.050> he<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
explanation of it says that he is the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.250 
explanation of it says that he is the
perfect<00:02:20.220> warrior<00:02:20.580> for<00:02:20.910> warframe<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:22.140> a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
perfect warrior for warframe and it's a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.670 
perfect warrior for warframe and it's a
very<00:02:22.290> good<00:02:22.710> race<00:02:23.640> for<00:02:24.000> new<00:02:24.180> players<00:02:24.530> but<00:02:25.530> there

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
very good race for new players but there

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.350 
very good race for new players but there
are<00:02:25.830> two<00:02:25.980> others<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.700> really<00:02:27.120> don't<00:02:27.300> know

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
are two others that I really don't know

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.420 
are two others that I really don't know
much<00:02:27.540> about<00:02:27.890> well<00:02:28.890> there<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.070> just<00:02:29.280> did<00:02:29.400> a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
much about well there I just did a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.730 
much about well there I just did a
freaking<00:02:30.180> move<00:02:30.660> right<00:02:30.840> again<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.410> it's

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
freaking move right again it's it's

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.500 
freaking move right again it's it's
probably<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.190> lot<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.730> Borderlands<00:02:33.330> where

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
probably a lot like Borderlands where

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
probably a lot like Borderlands where
you<00:02:33.630> could<00:02:33.780> just<00:02:33.959> choose<00:02:34.200> your<00:02:34.230> other

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
you could just choose your other

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.890 
you could just choose your other
character<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.280> they<00:02:35.400> have<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.880> then<00:02:36.870> uh

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
character that they have and then uh

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.110 
character that they have and then uh
like<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.980> basic<00:02:38.250> like<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.400> new<00:02:38.520> profile<00:02:38.940> you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
like it's basic like a new profile you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.850 
like it's basic like a new profile you
just<00:02:39.270> start<00:02:39.450> from<00:02:39.600> start<00:02:40.320> over<00:02:40.530> again<00:02:40.590> and

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860
