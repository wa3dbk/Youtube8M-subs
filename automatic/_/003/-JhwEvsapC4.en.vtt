00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
picture doesn't really do it justice but

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.109 
picture doesn't really do it justice but
the<00:01:36.659> quality<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:38.159> really<00:01:38.579> really<00:01:38.880> good

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the quality is it's really really good

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.120 
the quality is it's really really good
is<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.049> good<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.560> come<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.829> like

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
is so good it's just come up just like

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.710 
is so good it's just come up just like
new<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.400> yet<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.790> other<00:01:41.939> side's<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
new and yet and the other side's do the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.030 
new and yet and the other side's do the
other<00:01:42.869> side<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.140> exactly<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.500> same<00:01:43.680> as<00:01:43.829> well

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
other side is exactly the same as well

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.130 
other side is exactly the same as well
there's<00:01:44.549> absolutely<00:01:44.909> no<00:01:45.119> green<00:01:45.420> stuff<00:01:45.810> left

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
there's absolutely no green stuff left

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.410 
there's absolutely no green stuff left
over<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.520> just<00:01:47.850> doing<00:01:48.030> absolutely

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
over and that is just doing absolutely

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.810 
over and that is just doing absolutely
nothing<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.770> literally<00:01:50.250> leaving

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
nothing that is just literally leaving

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.510 
nothing that is just literally leaving
them<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.030> there<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.509> six<00:01:51.720> months<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:53.280> just

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
them in there for six months and it just

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.670 
them in there for six months and it just
comes<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.140> think<00:01:55.590> that

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
comes out like that that I think that

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.010 
comes out like that that I think that
this<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.189> probably<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.700> best<00:01:56.880> example<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.750> how

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
this is probably the best example of how

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.230 
this is probably the best example of how
olive<00:01:58.590> oil<00:01:59.149> works<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:01.320> now<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.680> Roman<00:02:02.250> you

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
olive oil works and now this Roman you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.249 
olive oil works and now this Roman you
know<00:02:03.329> what<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.630> doesn't<00:02:03.899> really<00:02:04.020> make<00:02:04.200> that

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
know what it doesn't really make that

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.380 
know what it doesn't really make that
much<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.530> difference<00:02:04.860> -<00:02:05.189> top<00:02:05.399> two<00:02:05.670> are<00:02:05.939> before

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
much of difference - top two are before

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.690 
much of difference - top two are before
the<00:02:06.630> bottom<00:02:06.869> two<00:02:07.049> are<00:02:07.229> after<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the bottom two are after and the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.990 
the bottom two are after and the
pictures

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
pictures

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.670 
pictures
we<00:02:10.149> shall<00:02:10.330> I<00:02:10.600> wish<00:02:10.810> are<00:02:10.960> taking<00:02:11.230> pictures<00:02:11.560> in

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
we shall I wish are taking pictures in

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.020 
we shall I wish are taking pictures in
as<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.890> consignment<00:02:12.220> varamyr<00:02:12.790> because<00:02:12.940> the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
as a consignment varamyr because the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.430 
as a consignment varamyr because the
lighting<00:02:13.240> is<00:02:13.450> different<00:02:13.570> that's<00:02:14.080> annoying

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
lighting is different that's annoying

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.660 
lighting is different that's annoying
I'm<00:02:14.650> gonna<00:02:14.770> remember<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.070> for<00:02:15.310> next<00:02:15.340> time

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
I'm gonna remember that for next time

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.240 
I'm gonna remember that for next time
and<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.630> we've<00:02:16.930> got<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:17.140> green<00:02:17.500> crud<00:02:18.100> edge

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
and so we've got this green crud edge

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.400 
and so we've got this green crud edge
here<00:02:18.760> as<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.000> can<00:02:19.030> see<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.750> look<00:02:19.990> it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
here as you can see and look it

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.800 
here as you can see and look it
definitely<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.250> less<00:02:21.670> here<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.600> it's

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
definitely is less here and it's

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.860 
definitely is less here and it's
definitely<00:02:23.050> less<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:24.250> know<00:02:24.370> embedded<00:02:25.060> here

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
definitely less you know embedded here

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.420 
definitely less you know embedded here
and<00:02:26.050> it's<00:02:26.200> just<00:02:26.290> kind<00:02:26.710> of<00:02:26.740> like<00:02:26.800> eating<00:02:27.310> away

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
and it's just kind of like eating away

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.280 
and it's just kind of like eating away
slowly<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.090> reckon<00:02:28.480> if<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.690> was<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.900> leave<00:02:29.020> these

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
slowly I reckon if I was to leave these

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.410 
slowly I reckon if I was to leave these
in<00:02:29.440> there<00:02:29.620> for<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.860> year<00:02:30.130> perhaps<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.820> would<00:02:31.300> have

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
in there for a year perhaps I would have

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.020 
in there for a year perhaps I would have
better<00:02:31.720> results<00:02:32.230> or<00:02:32.380> again<00:02:32.920> maybe<00:02:33.580> every

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
better results or again maybe every

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.240 
better results or again maybe every
month<00:02:34.060> just<00:02:34.480> take<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.840> out<00:02:34.960> just<00:02:35.250> slightly

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
month just take it out just slightly

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.270 
month just take it out just slightly

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
just so gently just have a little you

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.800

touch<00:03:11.560> their<00:03:11.830> coins<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.730> completely<00:03:13.030> get

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
touch their coins and I completely get

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.270 
touch their coins and I completely get
that<00:03:13.480> they'd<00:03:13.930> rather<00:03:14.170> other<00:03:14.560> people<00:03:14.920> deal

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
that they'd rather other people deal

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.220 
that they'd rather other people deal
with<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.519> or<00:03:15.850> they<00:03:16.000> just<00:03:16.180> like<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.510> have<00:03:16.900> them

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
with it or they just like to have them

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.570 
with it or they just like to have them
in<00:03:17.350> their<00:03:17.500> natural<00:03:17.680> state<00:03:18.070> as<00:03:18.190> they<00:03:18.310> were<00:03:18.430> dug

in their natural state as they were dug

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
in their natural state as they were dug
out<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.850> ground<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.300> completely

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
out the ground and I completely

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.050 
out the ground and I completely
understand<00:03:20.170> that<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:21.070> but<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:21.640> mean<00:03:21.850> this<00:03:21.910> is

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
understand that and but I mean this is

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.699 
understand that and but I mean this is
just<00:03:22.090> this<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.600> literally<00:03:22.989> just<00:03:23.019> a<00:03:23.260> test<00:03:23.500> as<00:03:23.680> to

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
just this is literally just a test as to

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.290 
just this is literally just a test as to
see<00:03:23.980> if<00:03:24.100> this<00:03:24.250> works<00:03:24.519> or<00:03:24.700> not<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:25.060> probably

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
see if this works or not I probably

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.690 
see if this works or not I probably
won't<00:03:25.480> do<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.750> with<00:03:25.840> all<00:03:25.959> my<00:03:25.989> coins<00:03:26.340> but<00:03:27.340> you

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
won't do it with all my coins but you

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.340 
won't do it with all my coins but you
know<00:03:27.820> it's<00:03:28.090> just<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.330> test<00:03:28.540> actually<00:03:29.050> in<00:03:29.200> your

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
know it's just a test actually in your

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.860 
know it's just a test actually in your
hand<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:30.010> can<00:03:30.040> really<00:03:30.790> see<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.180> difference<00:03:31.690> I

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
hand you can really see the difference I

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.009 
hand you can really see the difference I
mean<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.680> top<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:34.150> top<00:03:34.330> one<00:03:34.570> obviously<00:03:34.900> is

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
mean the top the top one obviously is

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.050 
mean the top the top one obviously is
before<00:03:35.380> bottom<00:03:35.680> ones<00:03:35.800> after<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.550> just<00:03:36.850> see

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
before bottom ones after you just see

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.240 
before bottom ones after you just see
the<00:03:37.209> definition<00:03:37.900> in<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.680> bottom<00:03:39.070> when<00:03:39.220> it

the definition in the bottom when it
looks<00:03:39.459> like<00:03:39.670> some<00:03:39.880> of<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.030> definitions<00:03:40.330> gone

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
looks like some of the definitions gone

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.960 
looks like some of the definitions gone

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
look if you look at the top of the the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.979 
look if you look at the top of the the
his<00:04:03.220> Halfpenny<00:04:03.760> side<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.360> right<00:04:04.540> hand<00:04:04.570> side

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
then if you look at the kind of like the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.910 
then if you look at the kind of like the
six<00:04:06.610> and<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:06.850> three<00:04:06.910> up<00:04:07.870> there<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.739> can<00:04:08.890> see

six and the three up there you can see

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.190 
six and the three up there you can see
the<00:04:09.610> difference<00:04:10.000> between<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.510> 6<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.140> 3

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200

on the top and the bottom is it's more

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.610 
on the top and the bottom is it's more
pronounced<00:04:13.780> so<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:13.989> can<00:04:14.110> see<00:04:14.230> this<00:04:14.350> there's

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
pronounced so you can see this there's

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.130 
pronounced so you can see this there's
actually<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.040> 6<00:04:15.400> next<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.209> that<00:04:16.359> 6<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.049> you

around the side and in the top one it's
just<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.520> just<00:04:29.819> a<00:04:29.970> lot<00:04:30.240> more<00:04:30.270> definition<00:04:30.630> isn't

H above the shoes and then look in the
bottom<00:04:36.840> picture<00:04:37.020> there<00:04:37.289> are<00:04:37.530> two<00:04:37.650> different

basically and again the camera doesn't

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.140 
basically and again the camera doesn't
do<00:05:40.409> it<00:05:40.500> justice<00:05:40.889> so<00:05:41.430> there<00:05:41.580> you<00:05:41.639> go<00:05:41.759> my<00:05:41.880> friends

I<00:05:42.180> just<00:05:42.210> wanted<00:05:42.539> to<00:05:42.599> give<00:05:42.690> you<00:05:42.780> an<00:05:42.870> example<00:05:43.199> for

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
I just wanted to give you an example for

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.610 
I just wanted to give you an example for
six<00:05:43.770> months<00:05:44.130> in<00:05:44.250> olive<00:05:44.580> oil<00:05:44.699> actually<00:05:45.000> does

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
six months in olive oil actually does

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.990 
six months in olive oil actually does
it's<00:05:46.620> not<00:05:46.680> going<00:05:46.949> to<00:05:47.009> be<00:05:47.130> for<00:05:47.340> everybody<00:05:47.550> not

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
it's not going to be for everybody not

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.760 
it's not going to be for everybody not
everybody<00:05:48.030> will<00:05:48.479> want<00:05:48.599> to<00:05:48.690> do<00:05:48.900> it<00:05:49.050> but<00:05:49.620> with

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
everybody will want to do it but with

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.200 
everybody will want to do it but with
some<00:05:50.009> coins<00:05:50.280> it's<00:05:50.490> worth<00:05:50.639> a<00:05:50.789> go<00:05:50.969> it's

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
some coins it's worth a go it's

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.640 
some coins it's worth a go it's
definitely<00:05:51.570> worth<00:05:51.690> forego<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.139> conclusion

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
definitely worth forego the conclusion

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.879 
definitely worth forego the conclusion
is<00:05:52.800> that<00:05:52.830> it<00:05:53.250> definitely<00:05:53.550> has<00:05:54.030> an<00:05:54.180> effect<00:05:54.889> but

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
is that it definitely has an effect but

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.339 
is that it definitely has an effect but
I<00:05:56.159> think<00:05:56.639> that<00:05:56.849> maybe<00:05:57.030> a<00:05:57.479> year<00:05:57.930> and<00:05:58.050> two<00:05:58.320> years

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
I think that maybe a year and two years

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.920 
I think that maybe a year and two years
would<00:05:59.159> be<00:05:59.219> better<00:05:59.789> for<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:00.210> lot<00:06:00.419> of<00:06:00.509> these<00:06:00.630> coins

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
would be better for a lot of these coins

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.930 
would be better for a lot of these coins
and<00:06:01.199> I<00:06:01.919> think<00:06:02.130> that<00:06:02.219> you've<00:06:02.340> given<00:06:02.520> more

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
and I think that you've given more

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.370 
and I think that you've given more
definition<00:06:03.539> and<00:06:03.570> they've<00:06:03.780> come<00:06:03.990> out<00:06:04.080> looking

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
definition and they've come out looking

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.070 
definition and they've come out looking
even<00:06:04.620> more<00:06:04.650> sprightly<00:06:05.520> and<00:06:05.810> you<00:06:06.810> know<00:06:06.930> and

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
even more sprightly and you know and

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.140 
even more sprightly and you know and
maybe<00:06:07.259> consider<00:06:07.710> just<00:06:08.099> giving<00:06:08.340> over<00:06:08.520> a<00:06:08.550> bit<00:06:09.090> of

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
maybe consider just giving over a bit of

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.240 
maybe consider just giving over a bit of
a<00:06:09.240> rubdown<00:06:09.449> every<00:06:09.930> month<00:06:10.169> and<00:06:10.409> just<00:06:11.070> see<00:06:11.219> how

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
a rubdown every month and just see how

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.610 
a rubdown every month and just see how
see<00:06:11.820> if<00:06:11.909> that<00:06:12.090> has<00:06:12.240> an<00:06:12.360> effect<00:06:12.659> as<00:06:12.840> well<00:06:13.050> my

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
see if that has an effect as well my

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.170 
see if that has an effect as well my
conclusion<00:06:14.159> is<00:06:14.219> it<00:06:14.520> definitely<00:06:14.940> definitely

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
conclusion is it definitely definitely

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.810 
conclusion is it definitely definitely
is<00:06:15.659> a<00:06:15.719> as<00:06:16.469> a<00:06:16.530> positive<00:06:16.830> effect<00:06:17.370> there<00:06:17.490> anyway

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
is a as a positive effect there anyway

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.310 
is a as a positive effect there anyway
