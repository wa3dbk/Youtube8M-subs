&gt;&gt; Mac Finely : Ha HA!

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.500
Didn’t see that coming did you?

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.350
[pause]
Mac Finely here welcoming you to another episode

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.500
of Mac Marketing on Crittick.com,
A few weeks ago, I did a parody on a recent

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.131
Adidas campaign, it was a lot of fun,
But I can do no such thing with Nike’s new

00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:19.779
My Time Is Now campaign.

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.560
It’s far too,
Epic, they’ve pulled out all the bells and

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.619
whistles, and every shoe they own, special
effects,

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.320
Cinematography, it’s way too Fancy for me.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.390
I’ll never be able to compete with something
like that unless somebody paid me a large

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.440
sum of money.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.910
[pause]
Unless somebody, paid me, a large sum of money.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.100
Back in 2010 Nike unleashed the, Write the
Future campaign for the World Cup, and this

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.430
year,
2 years later, it seems Nike is back to, out

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.010
due their own record.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.359
With even more cameo’s, even
LeBron James makes an appearance.

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.360
This ad is for the 14th European championship.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.372
And it’s basically for everyone who’s
sat on a bench and wanted to go in, it’s

00:00:55.372 --> 00:01:00.190
a Coach, Put me IN! kind of ad and it makes
me want to go in, makes me remember the times

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.640
I did go in, I was a striker, these legs are
huge.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.530
The ad agency Wieden &amp; Kennedy, London put
this one together and dare I say, It will

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.549
be one to remember.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.070
Not only is it spectacular, action packed
and sprinkled with comedy, the damn things

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.070
interactive!

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.200
If you go on their YouTube page, you can click
the link below later, you can watch the whole

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.150
three minute ad, and there’s, Tunnels within
it.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.220
The tunnels are kind of like, Easter Eggs
in dvd’s, basically you find a hidden clickable

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.560
space on the video and it takes you to a new
video, or a game, or a picture, or, me.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.659
It doesn’t take you to me.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.350
I think this is a fantastic way of using the
technology that’s available to you and pushing

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.350
the limits.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.969
Last week I said the future of advertising
is on the way, and this is a perfect example.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.840
Commercials are becoming more of an interactive
branded experience.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.689
And the agencies are pushing the attention
span of their viewers.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.410
Commercials use to be 30 seconds long and
now this one’s all the way up to 3 minutes

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.240
and your going to watch it over and over again
looking for the tunnels.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.350
And then you’re going to watch MORE content.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.600
Commercials aren’t just dying out the week
they air on TV anymore: Now they are living

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.030
on, on YouTube.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.870
So what did you think, did you enjoy Nike’s
New campaign, did you go find all the tunnels,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.630
did you find the tunnels in, this video.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.630
Ha HA!

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.709
Didn’t see that coming did you?

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.379
