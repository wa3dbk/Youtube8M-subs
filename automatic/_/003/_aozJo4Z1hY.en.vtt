tense is that this could ever happen
again<00:00:49.940> basically<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.059> need<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> start<00:00:51.510> off<00:00:51.660> by

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
again basically you need to start off by

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.049 
again basically you need to start off by
taking<00:00:51.989> cover<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:52.890> sneaking<00:00:53.309> toward<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
taking cover then sneaking toward the

their<00:00:56.460> snipers<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:56.940> close<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:58.469> could<00:00:58.590> also<00:00:58.770> be

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
their snipers up close it could also be

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.650 
their snipers up close it could also be
a<00:00:59.039> lot<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.309> fun<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.550> use<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.850> mobility<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.539> get

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
a lot of fun to use as mobility to get

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.080 
a lot of fun to use as mobility to get
into<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> enemy<00:01:01.230> spawn<00:01:01.559> area<00:01:01.940> strategy<00:01:02.940> that

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
into the enemy spawn area strategy that

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.579 
into the enemy spawn area strategy that
has<00:01:03.120> designed<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:03.750> much<00:01:03.899> flatters<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.439> this

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
has designed very much flatters on this

wallet bullet deflection so you know
honestly<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.880> getting<00:01:24.150> into<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> base

in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.900> first<00:01:24.930> place<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.590> highly<00:01:25.770> preventable

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
in the first place is highly preventable

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.010 
in the first place is highly preventable
so<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.060> were<00:01:27.180> playing<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.600> riding<00:01:27.810> you

so if you were playing as riding you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
so if you were playing as riding you
might<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.290> well<00:01:28.320> consider<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.920> earned<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.460> right

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
might as well consider it earned a right

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.550 
might as well consider it earned a right
ins<00:01:30.150> two<00:01:30.299> main<00:01:30.509> modes<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.900> attack<00:01:31.229> were<00:01:31.500> a

ins two main modes of attack were a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.039 
ins two main modes of attack were a
sword<00:01:32.100> combo<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.820> straight<00:01:33.090> stab<00:01:33.450> you

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
sword combo and a straight stab you

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.690 
sword combo and a straight stab you
could<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> sword<00:01:34.619> combo<00:01:34.979> standing<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.549> or

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
could do the sword combo standing up or

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.429 
could do the sword combo standing up or
crouching<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> standing<00:01:36.900> combo<00:01:37.290> was

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
crouching but the standing combo was

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.679 
crouching but the standing combo was
usually<00:01:37.770> best<00:01:38.070> since<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.579> gave<00:01:38.790> him<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.060> speed

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
usually best since it gave him the speed

blocked<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> enemy<00:02:39.610> fire<00:02:39.819> with<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.150> sword

blocked the enemy fire with the sword

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.420 
blocked the enemy fire with the sword
and<00:02:40.629> it<00:02:40.930> actually<00:02:41.079> turned<00:02:41.500> him<00:02:41.709> around<00:02:41.860> so

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
and it actually turned him around so

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.770 
and it actually turned him around so
that<00:02:42.549> my<00:02:42.670> teammate<00:02:43.120> could<00:02:43.299> shoot<00:02:43.510> him<00:02:43.540> in<00:02:43.750> the
