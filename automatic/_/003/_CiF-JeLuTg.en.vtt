00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
yeah let's see there's nothing to slow

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.250 
yeah let's see there's nothing to slow
down<00:02:35.350> at<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.620> moment<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.600> we'll<00:02:37.810> go<00:02:37.959> slowly

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
down at the moment so we'll go slowly

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
down at the moment so we'll go slowly
wait<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.680> night<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.130> finish<00:02:44.640> go<00:02:45.640> find<00:02:47.280> some

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
people with long noses I need one

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.350 
people with long noses I need one
walking<00:02:52.000> around<00:02:52.329> ah

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.970 

okay<00:02:58.190> try<00:02:59.190> catch<00:02:59.400> one<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.610> these<00:02:59.700> walking<00:03:03.980> yeah

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.000 
okay try catch one of these walking yeah

I think yeah they walk slower they

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.180 
I think yeah they walk slower they
definitely<00:03:08.310> walk<00:03:08.580> slower<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:10.010> they<00:03:11.010> don't
