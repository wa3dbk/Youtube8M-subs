00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.189
 dear friends made this video today 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.509
 demonstrates how to transform 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:16.770
 pci feeders in the beginning of the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.630
 black variables take me 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.029
 pci power supplies you can 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.119
 buy them back or I think that in 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.670
 any five computer store 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.090
 Romanians have a pair then it is 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.420
 preferable to take that memory of 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.640
 switch to turn it off 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.910
 if these are not there I am fine too 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.340
 these others that are still tickets 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.570
 just that they work the same 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:51.020
 the switch we put it equal to 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:55.140
 take to unscrew me 20 this 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:59.300
 here above and once the network from 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:06.450
 all four April and before there 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:10.250
 will show such a thing then here 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.630
 you have to do this because these old people don't 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.720
 there is the switch we owe 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.409
 put it now I'll explain how it takes 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.290
 then this is the simple scheme 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.940
 make it easier to understand 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.210
 how the power supply works a bit too 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.580
 the water enters the current where the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.320
 current but the card and then with these 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.840
 threads that would be useful that go to 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.650
 bring the current into the computer or 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.040
 that besides giving the card current 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.430
 trent to this other that cost 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.590
 outlet goes under that with a go 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.310
 connected another wire which then leads 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:01.360
 all bechi computer monitor then 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:05.200
 we do not need this here and therefore it 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.560
 we cut these we believe and not there 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.790
 they serve but we need this thread a lot 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.790
 that we break it in half and go to it 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.070
 connect in a switch with the wire 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.880
 mental but in the inter and chic but on 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.300
 card 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.940
 and so we have a power supply with 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.060
 the emperor like this one just for 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.460
 the switch I made at home 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.080
 from then on you both know this thing 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.770
 to feed in which why not 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.030
 nothing changes 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.910
 just take these wires between 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.560
 the years to a length to like 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.370
 maybe even beat a little longer 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.760
 unfortunately it was too much too much leon 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.610
 to shorten under the dome 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:57.659
 everything goes from chaos to do it and then 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:03:01.079
 take the key for each color to use 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:04.500
 one black then type for red and black 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:09.440
 together or brown and black for 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:14.549
 each color s1 corresponding black 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:18.269
 then after that you have to take the 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.310
 box over buffaloes two passing holes 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.209
 1 all the black wires pass through 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.129
 during all the colored merits ea 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.859
 another thing about the feeder goes 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.139
 clean if there is a compressor all the way 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.690
 dust because with the dust there is more 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.930
 high risk of overheating 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:42.629
 then take off after jumping on board is 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:45.730
 done all this switch you want 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:49.150
 make another hole up here or sideways 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.170
 and type is this one 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.890
 once you 've made the hole, slip into it 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:01.410
 switch and then put it to the end 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:05.099
 of every ride this here that would be gods 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:08.080
 serving silver which is safer and not 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.970
 to not let you take the bill that 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.299
 if the voltage is no more than twenty times 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:18.850
 that is, it is not not chile 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:23.979
 do not worry, however, other than to twist 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:27.729
 threads in the decrees fc also ok this 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:38.560
 police contribution of the whole one 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:41.919
 Once closed, you will find it I know now 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:54.550
 to turn on the working engine that 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:57.930
 then works like yellow for a 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:01.599
 voltage 12 time red of five 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:05.500
 orange also 5 and this for 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:07.750
 each of the colors or in addition to 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.930
 coordinate them so you can combine them too 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:18.529
 the colored threads together that you will have more 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:22.879
 count for that 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:25.939
 and this power supply but in the end it is 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:29.299
 very useful that maybe bench without ce 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:30.199
 they are still the old one and you don't want to 

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:33.919
 throw it away 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:36.439
 do one of these and connect 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.359
 taking the natural as it did 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:42.099
 see in an old video and then 

00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:46.249
 correlated and functioning only we turn off e 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:49.149
 thank you all followed us and 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:52.609
 I also thank our bread and dear 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:55.359
 cameraman and riccardo grazzi riccardo e 

00:05:52.609 --> 00:05:55.359
 that's all for today
