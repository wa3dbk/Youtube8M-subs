question<00:01:32.499> should<00:01:33.499> I<00:01:33.770> enable<00:01:34.340> macros<00:01:34.849> and<00:01:35.149> you

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
question should I enable macros and you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.849 
question should I enable macros and you
always<00:01:35.569> want<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.869> answer<00:01:36.049> yes<00:01:36.469> to<00:01:36.529> this

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
always want to answer yes to this

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.239 
always want to answer yes to this
because<00:01:37.670> we<00:01:37.939> use<00:01:38.270> excels<00:01:38.959> own<00:01:39.229> macro<00:01:39.770> language

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
because we use excels own macro language

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:42.699 
because we use excels own macro language
to<00:01:40.759> control<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.329> communication<00:01:41.509> between<00:01:42.319> the

will not allow you to enable macros so

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.330 
will not allow you to enable macros so
just<00:01:56.029> go<00:01:56.179> to<00:01:56.209> tools<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.959> lower<00:01:57.590> your<00:01:57.859> security

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
just go to tools and lower your security

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.820 
just go to tools and lower your security
setting<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.029> then<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.299> will<00:01:59.419> allow

setting and then it will allow
to<00:01:59.980> run<00:02:00.160> macros<00:02:00.700> so<00:02:00.970> I'm<00:02:01.090> going<00:02:01.300> to<00:02:01.360> enable

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
to run macros so I'm going to enable

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.260 
to run macros so I'm going to enable
macros<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.930> then<00:02:05.230> it's<00:02:05.500> going<00:02:05.740> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
macros and then it's going to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.389 
macros and then it's going to
immediately<00:02:07.270> search<00:02:07.630> for<00:02:08.020> for<00:02:08.710> a<00:02:08.740> tester<00:02:09.250> to

immediately search for for a tester to

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.010

says<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.430> found<00:03:06.730> nine<00:03:07.410> tests<00:03:08.410> now<00:03:09.070> this<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.489> the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
says it found nine tests now this is the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.030 
says it found nine tests now this is the
perfect<00:03:09.940> time<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.360> rename<00:03:10.930> these<00:03:11.260> tests<00:03:11.739> if<00:03:11.860> we

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
perfect time to rename these tests if we

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.080 
perfect time to rename these tests if we
wish<00:03:12.690> cable<00:03:13.690> one<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:13.959> could<00:03:14.410> renamed<00:03:15.090> building

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
wish cable one I could renamed building

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.060 
wish cable one I could renamed building
35<00:03:17.550> outlet<00:03:18.550> 14<00:03:19.209> if<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.630> wished<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:20.739> forth

35 outlet 14 if I wished and so forth
and<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:21.340> on<00:03:21.840> instead<00:03:22.840> we'll<00:03:23.410> just<00:03:23.440> take<00:03:23.830> them

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
and so on instead we'll just take them

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.130 
and so on instead we'll just take them
in<00:03:24.130> sequential<00:03:24.610> order<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.390> can<00:03:25.570> store<00:03:25.870> up<00:03:25.989> to

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
in sequential order you can store up to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.820 
in sequential order you can store up to
250<00:03:26.769> tests<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.730> then<00:03:28.690> later<00:03:28.989> because<00:03:29.500> it's<00:03:29.709> a

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
250 tests and then later because it's a

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.350 
250 tests and then later because it's a
spreadsheet<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:30.519> could<00:03:30.730> go<00:03:30.880> into<00:03:31.090> those

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
spreadsheet I could go into those

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.509 
spreadsheet I could go into those
spreadsheet<00:03:31.959> cells<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.620> change<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.100> name<00:03:33.280> at

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
spreadsheet cells and change the name at

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.120 
spreadsheet cells and change the name at
my<00:03:33.550> leisure<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:35.140> let's<00:03:35.290> go<00:03:35.470> ahead<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.769> finish

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
my leisure so let's go ahead and finish

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.420 
my leisure so let's go ahead and finish
and<00:03:36.610> you'll<00:03:37.420> see<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.780> imports<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.830> spreadsheet

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
and you'll see it imports a spreadsheet

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.900 
and you'll see it imports a spreadsheet
for<00:03:40.060> each<00:03:40.180> cable<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:42.130> believe<00:03:42.580> me<00:03:42.730> when<00:03:42.880> you

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
for each cable and believe me when you

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.360 
for each cable and believe me when you
have<00:03:43.120> 250<00:03:44.050> on<00:03:44.170> there<00:03:44.410> it's<00:03:44.530> quite<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.800> show<00:03:45.130> to

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
have 250 on there it's quite a show to

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.009 
have 250 on there it's quite a show to
watch<00:03:45.550> these<00:03:45.910> tabs<00:03:46.300> being<00:03:46.750> created<00:03:47.380> by<00:03:47.530> Excel

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
watch these tabs being created by Excel

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.979 
watch these tabs being created by Excel
so<00:03:50.019> cable<00:03:50.860> 9<00:03:51.070> is<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.670> latest<00:03:52.030> spreadsheet<00:03:52.690> so

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
so cable 9 is the latest spreadsheet so

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.640 
so cable 9 is the latest spreadsheet so
let's<00:03:53.200> just<00:03:53.530> go<00:03:54.220> file<00:03:54.989> print<00:03:55.989> and<00:03:56.260> let's<00:03:56.470> see

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
let's just go file print and let's see

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:05.039 
let's just go file print and let's see
what<00:03:56.830> cable<00:03:57.100> 9<00:03:57.430> is<00:03:57.730> all<00:03:57.940> about

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.599 

we're<00:04:06.049> done<00:04:06.200> with<00:04:06.409> this<00:04:06.560> we<00:04:06.920> can<00:04:07.069> unplug<00:04:07.370> it

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
we're done with this we can unplug it

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:38.560 
we're done with this we can unplug it
and<00:04:07.640> shut<00:04:07.909> it<00:04:08.030> off<00:04:36.610> cable<00:04:37.610> 9<00:04:37.789> well<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.300> first

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
and shut it off cable 9 well the first

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.529 
and shut it off cable 9 well the first
thing<00:04:38.810> we<00:04:38.990> noticed<00:04:39.410> is<00:04:39.650> that<00:04:40.099> we<00:04:40.910> performed

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
thing we noticed is that we performed

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.469 
thing we noticed is that we performed
both<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:42.110> level<00:04:42.470> 1<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.430> level<00:04:43.729> 2<00:04:43.940> tests

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
both the level 1 and the level 2 tests

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.170 
both the level 1 and the level 2 tests
if<00:04:45.229> you<00:04:45.410> disapper<00:04:45.979> form<00:04:46.250> level<00:04:46.699> 1<00:04:46.910> you

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
if you disapper form level 1 you

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.629 
if you disapper form level 1 you
wouldn't<00:04:47.449> have<00:04:47.599> these<00:04:47.750> bottom<00:04:48.229> two<00:04:48.440> graphs<00:04:48.830> so

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
wouldn't have these bottom two graphs so

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.089 
wouldn't have these bottom two graphs so
we<00:04:49.789> completed<00:04:50.240> level<00:04:50.780> 1<00:04:50.990> continued<00:04:51.710> on<00:04:51.860> to

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
we completed level 1 continued on to

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.210 
we completed level 1 continued on to
level<00:04:52.280> 2<00:04:52.669> to<00:04:53.300> actually<00:04:53.750> connect<00:04:54.199> the<00:04:54.800> cable

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
level 2 to actually connect the cable
