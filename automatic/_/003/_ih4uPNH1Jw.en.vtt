00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
retwist it and it came out pretty much

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.530 
retwist it and it came out pretty much
flawless<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:52.870> I'll<00:01:53.650> put<00:01:54.159> that<00:01:54.190> video<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:54.820> here

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
flawless so I'll put that video in here

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.100 
flawless so I'll put that video in here
somewhere

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
somewhere

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.700 
somewhere
okay<00:01:57.330> so<00:01:58.330> here<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:58.630> is<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.780> technique<00:01:59.320> is<00:01:59.530> pretty

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
okay so here it is a technique is pretty

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.590 
okay so here it is a technique is pretty
much<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.070> same<00:02:00.250> as<00:02:00.549> you<00:02:00.670> can<00:02:00.790> see<00:02:00.970> I<00:02:01.000> did<00:02:01.420> take

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
much the same as you can see I did take

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.440 
much the same as you can see I did take
out<00:02:01.750> some<00:02:01.960> hair<00:02:02.350> in<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:03.190> back<00:02:03.940> because<00:02:04.120> there

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
out some hair in the back because there

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.450 
out some hair in the back because there
was<00:02:04.630> just<00:02:04.840> too<00:02:05.080> much<00:02:05.260> it<00:02:05.650> was<00:02:05.830> causing<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.310> lot

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
was just too much it was causing a lot

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.570 
was just too much it was causing a lot
of<00:02:06.490> tangling<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:09.280> pay<00:02:09.399> too<00:02:09.459> much

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
of tangling so don't pay too much

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.400 
of tangling so don't pay too much
attention<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:10.090> that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
attention to that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.449 
attention to that
but<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.590> technique<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.010> pretty<00:02:12.220> much<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
but the technique is pretty much the

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.890 
but the technique is pretty much the
same<00:02:12.610> just<00:02:12.670> wrapping<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.209> hair<00:02:13.360> around<00:02:13.420> the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
same just wrapping the hair around the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.640 
same just wrapping the hair around the
rod<00:02:14.110> I'm<00:02:14.650> twisting<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.160> hair<00:02:15.370> around<00:02:16.650> and

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
rod I'm twisting the hair around and

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.949 
rod I'm twisting the hair around and
make<00:02:18.310> sure<00:02:18.459> that<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.760> detangle<00:02:19.180> before<00:02:19.810> you

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
make sure that you detangle before you

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:31.480 
make sure that you detangle before you
twist

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.660 

and<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.150> just<00:02:32.330> noticed<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.810> one<00:02:33.140> was<00:02:33.380> like<00:02:33.670> the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
and I just noticed that one was like the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.080 
and I just noticed that one was like the
one<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.120> second<00:02:35.450> one<00:02:35.570> on<00:02:35.750> top<00:02:36.050> is<00:02:36.110> coming

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
one the second one on top is coming

I<00:03:33.900> did<00:03:34.260> not<00:03:34.470> only<00:03:34.860> because<00:03:35.160> it's<00:03:35.310> fibers<00:03:35.760> it's

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
I did not only because it's fibers it's

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.150 
I did not only because it's fibers it's
not<00:03:36.300> gonna<00:03:36.480> absorb<00:03:36.900> any<00:03:37.260> other<00:03:37.410> product<00:03:37.920> and

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
braid to make sure I don't cut my own

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.520 
braid to make sure I don't cut my own
hair<00:04:38.270> which<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.419> had<00:04:39.600> happen<00:04:39.960> on<00:04:40.080> one<00:04:40.260> of<00:04:40.290> my

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
just pull on it and tug away and it

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.140 
just pull on it and tug away and it
should<00:04:49.080> come<00:04:49.290> right<00:04:49.740> out<00:04:49.770> because<00:04:50.760> this<00:04:51.030> is

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
should come right out because this is

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.320 
should come right out because this is
not<00:04:51.300> interlocked<00:04:51.990> into<00:04:52.770> your<00:04:52.890> own<00:04:53.040> hair<00:04:53.400> just

not interlocked into your own hair just
literally<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.720> loop<00:04:54.930> around<00:04:55.200> a<00:04:55.260> braid<00:04:55.470> it

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
literally a loop around a braid it

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.600 
literally a loop around a braid it
should<00:04:55.980> come<00:04:56.130> right<00:04:56.340> out<00:04:56.960> painless<00:04:58.490> so<00:04:59.490> to

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
should come right out painless so to

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.180

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.590 

because<00:05:06.449> I<00:05:06.479> overlapped<00:05:07.050> my<00:05:07.350> own<00:05:07.560> hair<00:05:08.569> when<00:05:09.569> I

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
because I overlapped my own hair when I

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.330 
because I overlapped my own hair when I
did<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.960> crochet<00:05:10.380> I<00:05:10.410> could<00:05:10.770> pull<00:05:11.009> it<00:05:11.130> through

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
did the crochet I could pull it through

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.480 
did the crochet I could pull it through
the<00:05:11.460> bottom<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:15.319> just<00:05:16.319> start<00:05:16.680> unraveling<00:05:17.160> the

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
the bottom and just start unraveling the

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:33.140 
the bottom and just start unraveling the
hair<00:05:17.669> from<00:05:17.819> there

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.330 

I'm<00:05:34.110> just<00:05:34.350> gonna<00:05:34.530> speed<00:05:34.740> this<00:05:34.770> up<00:05:35.040> a<00:05:35.160> little

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
I'm just gonna speed this up a little

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.950 
I'm just gonna speed this up a little
bit<00:05:35.550> but<00:05:35.820> like<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.270> said<00:05:36.450> it's<00:05:36.630> a<00:05:36.690> loop<00:05:36.840> around

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
bit but like I said it's a loop around

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.490 
bit but like I said it's a loop around
your<00:05:37.230> braid<00:05:37.380> so<00:05:37.650> I<00:05:37.680> should<00:05:37.950> literally<00:05:38.340> slide

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
your braid so I should literally slide

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:50.980 
your braid so I should literally slide
right<00:05:40.500> off<00:05:41.360> just<00:05:42.360> like<00:05:42.510> that

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.719 

I<00:05:51.020> didn't<00:05:51.650> have<00:05:51.740> any<00:05:51.889> tangles<00:05:52.220> or<00:05:52.520> anything

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729
