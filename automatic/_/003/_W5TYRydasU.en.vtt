 the day is when we dragged to closed 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.049
 Park out of the closed while in tow 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.700

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.039
 with the car back to the closed park but 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.949
 It was necessary if Vladimir did not 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.460
 crossed the podium the finer genise was not 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.560
 protection 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.359
 but for example a team from Kazakhstan 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.550
 Astana and not a car practically 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.119
 pushed even 400 meters to the finish 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.529
 they finally burned the clutch and 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.950
 15 people from the team and pushed 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.469
 hands but remembering the last two 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.840

 giulio racer who blocked the way 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.880

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.390
 It remained as lined up in a caravan and 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.470
 first to come to the rescue 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.710

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.860
 Karginov he lost on this precious 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.200
 minutes that were not taken in essence 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.110

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.920
 in the end, not those minutes, those six minutes that 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.500
 Karginov had an advantage over the start 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.020
