00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello guys let's take a look at 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.890
 jelly bean novelties in the edition of 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.559
 samsung for the galaxy s iii 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.960
 official update 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.770
 we are doing the boot now let's see 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.939
 how long does it take to start e 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.779
 I remember that many also complained 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.029
 for the Italian release precisely for the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.160
 release in Italy a phenomenon of 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.269
 drain bacteria that is excessive consumption 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.230
 of the battery 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.840
 on this I must expound myself by saying that i 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.910
 early days is exactly like that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.000
 it seems that there is at the battery drain and the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.730
 battery lasts considerably little in 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.710
 following days then it resumes 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.110
 same applies to the shots if you have 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.289
 saw it snapped slightly before 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.719
 these are images taken like this 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.430
 however you always see the instant 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.420
 loading of applications and 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.480
 all but as you have noticed in 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.409
 some moments can take some shots 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.390
 like now 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.229
 here now it has loaded well first instead 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.020
 had made the shot to open the menu 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.470
 and this happens in the first days after having 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.840
 installed the jelly bean 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.430
 then I don't know why it disappears completely 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.590
 anyway 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.200
 we also see the folders that have been 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.460
 reorganized and are more similar to 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.110
 google version 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.820
 the notification bar has been 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.150
 also made more similar to that of 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.070
 google and see that the background below yes 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.070
 darkens as it lowers 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.710
 very nice bar then clearly i 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.939
 usual scroll buttons 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.040
 I remember that always with regards to 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.700
 notifications work like jelly 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.100
 bean 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.140
 so we have multiple notifications and 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.829
 however in the settings there is mode 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.110
 block we activate the and we configure the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.549
 thanks to the lock mode we could 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.880
 tell our phone not to 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.149
 disturb c in the modes selected by one 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.360
 certain time at a certain time of day 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.250
 or always then there are the contacts that 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.780
 are exceptions for example that of 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.100
 my employer than during 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.690
 working time can make me ring 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.370
 the phone always here in the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.530
 settings we see the accounts 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.420
 they were all gathered in the menu 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.120
 main settings from which 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.400
 we could add another account 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.190
 as I have already mentioned this 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.960
 edition does not contain multiview then 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.400
 the functionality to split the screen 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.340
 to use more applications 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.350
 at the same time 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.750
 that functionality has been promised that 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:44.330
 will be introduced by samsung in the android 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.630
 4.2 next update to right for 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.480
 those unfamiliar with this easter egg 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.960
 you have to click repeatedly repeatedly 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.510
 on the name of the task manager version 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.940
 holding down the center button from which 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.830
 we can just close the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.940
 applications switchando the verses 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.730
 the outside 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.360
 we ask neither one hour we press on google 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.380
 now the google icon in the center yes 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.140
 opens google now 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.710
 the google assistant for everyone 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.260
 our activities 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.290
 as you can see now there is little stuff 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.320
 however it tells you how long it takes 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.030
 to get home if you're at work 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.460
 how long to get to work yes 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.170
 you are at home but all those who can 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.910
 these are shown here 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.160
 information on public transport 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.240
 flight weather appointments we have 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.280
 fixed etcetera etc. 15 by a 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.010
 overview of what we need to do 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.560
 and also some useful indications 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.750
 let's return for a moment to the fluidity aspect 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.090
 in this case in the navigation on one 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.890
 flash player web page is still 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.670
 installed because it was updated by 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.670
 ice cream sandwich 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.320
 however the speed of redesign of the 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.780
 window and text is this here 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.360
 energy consumption report 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.430
 in my opinion it does not consume more than 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.070
 previous roms 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.800
 as you see in this screenshot later 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.070
 over 23 hours or even 40 percent 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.970
 I was almost always with battery 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:26.210
 the wifi turned on the phone was 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.490
 active sporadically as indeed it is 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.759
 is 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:34.970
 I have made a use of it let's say 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:38.750
 very poor just to see the 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.699
 schedule do some operation 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.620
 on the agenda some calculation with the 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.520
 calculator and little else 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.139
 therefore for a use we say bland 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.949
 he has no problem getting to the end 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.990
 day 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.810
 this is the second day of 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:59.490
 therefore we can use it safely 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.710
 even arriving on the third day arrives at 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.220
 evening of the third day if we do not do it 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.520
 the ruthless use as I have already said 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.340
 first the first two or three days after 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.580
 flashy jelly bean inexplicably 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.590
 we will find a much larger device 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.720
 of what is normally and which 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.080
 consumes much more energy 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.250
 I don't know why but then if you wait 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.250
 it gets better bye
