the opportunity to investigate this

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.919 
the opportunity to investigate this
flying<00:01:33.609> car<00:01:33.880> they<00:01:34.240> said<00:01:34.420> there<00:01:34.539> was<00:01:34.630> plenty<00:01:34.780> of

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
flying car they said there was plenty of

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.069 
flying car they said there was plenty of
elbow<00:01:35.109> room<00:01:35.229> out<00:01:36.039> there<00:01:36.149> in<00:01:37.149> New<00:01:37.450> Mexico<00:01:37.840> and

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
elbow room out there in New Mexico and

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.660 
elbow room out there in New Mexico and
so<00:01:38.170> when<00:01:38.289> I<00:01:38.320> came<00:01:38.409> by<00:01:38.859> I<00:01:38.890> realized<00:01:39.369> that<00:01:39.460> was

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
so when I came by I realized that was

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.969 
so when I came by I realized that was
true<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:40.149> I<00:01:40.420> kept<00:01:41.170> talking<00:01:41.439> about<00:01:41.499> this<00:01:41.740> sky

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
true and I kept talking about this sky

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.889 
true and I kept talking about this sky
car<00:01:42.219> and<00:01:42.490> building<00:01:43.210> this<00:01:43.299> flying<00:01:43.600> car<00:01:43.869> and

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
car and building this flying car and

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.139 
car and building this flying car and
somebody<00:01:44.439> did<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.829> search<00:01:45.039> and<00:01:45.189> realize<00:01:45.520> dr.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
somebody did a search and realize dr.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.910 
somebody did a search and realize dr.
paul<00:01:46.479> moller<00:01:46.659> in<00:01:46.869> Davis<00:01:47.140> California<00:01:47.289> had

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
paul moller in Davis California had

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.819 
paul moller in Davis California had
already<00:01:48.100> been<00:01:48.369> working<00:01:48.700> on<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:49.630> sky<00:01:50.229> car<00:01:50.469> and

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
already been working on this sky car and

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.429 
already been working on this sky car and
I<00:01:51.219> said<00:01:51.490> wait<00:01:51.640> I<00:01:51.700> gotta<00:01:52.060> talk<00:01:52.899> to<00:01:52.960> this<00:01:53.170> guy<00:01:53.409> and

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
I said wait I gotta talk to this guy and

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.520 
I said wait I gotta talk to this guy and
so<00:01:53.829> we<00:01:54.039> invited<00:01:54.490> him<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.420> New<00:01:55.539> Mexico<00:01:55.569> and<00:01:56.229> dr.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
so we invited him to New Mexico and dr.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.529 
so we invited him to New Mexico and dr.
paul<00:01:56.679> moller<00:01:56.799> came<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.219> New<00:01:57.340> Mexico<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:58.420> we

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
paul moller came to New Mexico and we

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.200 
paul moller came to New Mexico and we
spent<00:01:58.749> a<00:01:58.810> couple<00:01:58.960> of<00:01:59.049> days<00:01:59.200> together<00:01:59.409> and<00:02:00.210> we

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
spent a couple of days together and we

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.190 
spent a couple of days together and we
basically<00:02:02.109> develop<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:03.009> bond<00:02:03.219> and<00:02:03.929> grew<00:02:04.929> into<00:02:05.140> a

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
basically develop a bond and grew into a

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.080 
basically develop a bond and grew into a
friendship<00:02:05.590> over<00:02:05.889> the<00:02:05.920> years<00:02:06.009> for<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:06.969> last

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
friendship over the years for the last

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.740 
friendship over the years for the last
seven<00:02:07.479> years<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.530> we've<00:02:09.399> been<00:02:09.750> assistant

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
seven years and so we've been assistant

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.430 
seven years and so we've been assistant
in<00:02:10.929> trying<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.760> get<00:02:12.760> some<00:02:13.600> of<00:02:13.720> Mama's<00:02:14.020> products

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
in trying to get some of Mama's products

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.330 
in trying to get some of Mama's products
into<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:16.090> mainstream<00:02:17.040> because<00:02:18.040> they're<00:02:18.220> so

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
into the mainstream because they're so

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.160 
into the mainstream because they're so
advanced<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.060> different<00:02:19.540> they're<00:02:20.049> not

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
advanced and so different they're not

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.770 
advanced and so different they're not
easily<00:02:20.530> accepted<00:02:21.190> and

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
easily accepted and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.660 
easily accepted and
essentially<00:02:23.780> dr.<00:02:24.740> Mulder<00:02:24.980> tinker's<00:02:25.400> and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
essentially dr. Mulder tinker's and

interested in the flying car whereas now
we're<00:02:33.520> for<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.550> spaceport<00:02:35.090> is<00:02:35.210> appropriate

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
we're for the spaceport is appropriate

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.700 
we're for the spaceport is appropriate
to<00:02:35.780> introduce<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.670> flying<00:02:37.670> saucer<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.390> it's<00:02:39.350> a

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
to introduce a flying saucer and it's a

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.640 
to introduce a flying saucer and it's a
very<00:02:40.040> fun<00:02:40.700> educational<00:02:41.120> thing<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.050> we're

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
very fun educational thing that we're

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.800 
very fun educational thing that we're
trying<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:43.010> do<00:02:43.330> what<00:02:44.330> was<00:02:44.480> your<00:02:44.630> first

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
reaction when you saw his flying saucer

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.980 
reaction when you saw his flying saucer
it<00:02:49.190> was<00:02:49.580> kind<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.820> interesting<00:02:50.060> one<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:50.930> the

hibiscus flower and I've seen the same

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.700 
hibiscus flower and I've seen the same
thing<00:03:08.630> growing<00:03:09.020> up<00:03:09.140> as<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.290> kid<00:03:09.380> the

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
thing growing up as a kid the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.500 
thing growing up as a kid the
hummingbirds<00:03:10.130> you<00:03:10.910> know<00:03:11.030> doing<00:03:11.360> their

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
hummingbirds you know doing their

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.060 
hummingbirds you know doing their
pollination<00:03:11.870> they<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.770> know<00:03:12.830> inter<00:03:13.040> inter

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
pollination they you know inter inter

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.160 
pollination they you know inter inter
interfacing<00:03:13.850> with<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:14.000> hibiscus<00:03:14.240> flower<00:03:14.690> and

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
interfacing with a hibiscus flower and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.580 
interfacing with a hibiscus flower and
they<00:03:15.380> would<00:03:15.530> just<00:03:15.680> be<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:16.280> still<00:03:16.550> and<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.590> you

know what had floating dreams and dreams
I<00:03:22.730> would<00:03:22.790> was<00:03:23.210> flying<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.990> know<00:03:24.080> without<00:03:24.320> any

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
I would was flying you know without any

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.720 
I would was flying you know without any
just<00:03:25.550> fine<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:27.130> I'm<00:03:28.130> sure<00:03:28.280> we<00:03:28.430> have<00:03:28.520> a<00:03:28.550> lot

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
just fine and so I'm sure we have a lot

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.300 
just fine and so I'm sure we have a lot
of<00:03:28.760> those<00:03:28.940> types<00:03:29.450> of<00:03:29.570> dreams<00:03:29.750> has<00:03:30.310> cute

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
of those types of dreams has cute

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.240 
of those types of dreams has cute
children<00:03:31.520> anything<00:03:31.970> as<00:03:32.060> adults<00:03:32.270> and<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:32.810> I've

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
children anything as adults and so I've

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.360 
children anything as adults and so I've
always<00:03:34.250> believed<00:03:35.210> that<00:03:35.890> we<00:03:36.890> should<00:03:37.190> be<00:03:37.280> able

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
always believed that we should be able

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.730 
always believed that we should be able
to<00:03:37.490> do<00:03:37.580> that<00:03:37.730> we<00:03:37.880> can<00:03:38.030> land<00:03:38.150> people<00:03:38.480> on<00:03:38.570> Mars<00:03:38.780> we

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
to do that we can land people on Mars we

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.680 
to do that we can land people on Mars we
can<00:03:39.860> Land<00:03:40.040> Rovers<00:03:40.670> on<00:03:40.790> Mars<00:03:40.820> and<00:03:41.270> men<00:03:41.450> on<00:03:41.570> the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
can Land Rovers on Mars and men on the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.200 
can Land Rovers on Mars and men on the
moon<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.400> this<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.550> more<00:03:43.730> close<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.090> Earth

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
moon and this is more close to Earth

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.830 
moon and this is more close to Earth
than<00:03:44.240> people<00:03:45.460> realize<00:03:46.460> I<00:03:46.730> mean<00:03:46.940> it's<00:03:47.120> good

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
than people realize I mean it's good

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.410 
than people realize I mean it's good
stuff<00:03:48.050> we<00:03:48.260> can<00:03:48.410> do<00:03:48.560> but<00:03:48.830> it's<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.940> will<00:03:50.180> to

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
stuff we can do but it's the will to

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.300 
stuff we can do but it's the will to
want<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.690> pursue<00:03:51.050> it<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.380> so<00:03:51.800> an<00:03:52.040> auto

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
want to pursue it and so an auto

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.970 
want to pursue it and so an auto

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:43.989 
used to it I mean as automated flight
systems<00:04:41.569> so<00:04:41.959> it<00:04:42.199> can<00:04:42.409> basically<00:04:43.069> be<00:04:43.550> pointed

00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:43.999 
systems so it can basically be pointed

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:45.909
