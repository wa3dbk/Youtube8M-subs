00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
basically shingled in my hair and it's

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.270 
basically shingled in my hair and it's
still<00:00:05.670> kind<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:05.940> white<00:00:06.210> as<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.629> can<00:00:06.779> see<00:00:07.280> it's

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
still kind of white as you can see it's

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.100 
still kind of white as you can see it's
going<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.550> be<00:00:08.670> way<00:00:08.849> probably<00:00:09.150> until<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.840> dries

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
going to be way probably until it dries

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.299 
going to be way probably until it dries
um<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:11.130> don't<00:00:12.059> know<00:00:12.269> hopefully<00:00:12.980> what<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.070> dries

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
um I don't know hopefully what it dries

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.840 
um I don't know hopefully what it dries
it<00:00:14.340> won't<00:00:14.580> be<00:00:14.639> white<00:00:14.790> anymore<00:00:15.770> so<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.580> side

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
it won't be white anymore so this side

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.599 
it won't be white anymore so this side
is<00:00:18.650> like<00:00:19.650> bigger<00:00:19.980> than<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.520> side<00:00:21.289> because<00:00:22.609> in

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
is like bigger than this side because in

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.519 
is like bigger than this side because in
turn<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> suppose<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.300> see<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.260> did

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
turn the suppose you can see this I did

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.290 
turn the suppose you can see this I did
first<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:26.039> has<00:00:26.130> already<00:00:26.279> started<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.760> dry<00:00:26.970> so

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
first that has already started to dry so

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.540 
first that has already started to dry so
it's<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.660> drop<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.859> side<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.099> just

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
it's going to drop and this side I just

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.339 
it's going to drop and this side I just
finished<00:00:29.910> though<00:00:30.179> still<00:00:30.510> kind<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.840> wet<00:00:31.019> air

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
hasn't gotten and ride it so it still

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.510 
hasn't gotten and ride it so it still
kind<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.239> stretched<00:00:33.540> out<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.890> will<00:00:35.130> shrink

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
kind of stretched out but it will shrink

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.049

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
I think on this side of the other side I

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.220 
I think on this side of the other side I
mean<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:47.010> some<00:00:47.280> curlies<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.870> it's

have<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.860> look<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.790> sure<00:01:27.180> cuz<00:01:27.840> I'm

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
have to look that up to be sure cuz I'm

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.480 
have to look that up to be sure cuz I'm
not<00:01:28.110> potential<00:01:28.619> percent<00:01:28.920> sure<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:32.220> just

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
not potential percent sure so I just

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.740 
not potential percent sure so I just
went<00:01:32.790> through<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> conditioner<00:01:33.450> out<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.630> my

think this side actually looks a little
bit<00:03:07.209> better<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.709> this<00:03:08.890> side<00:03:09.160> is<00:03:09.190> where<00:03:09.760> i

surprised<00:03:55.780> because<00:03:55.959> I<00:03:56.290> was<00:03:56.470> first<00:03:56.680> doing<00:03:56.950> it

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
surprised because I was first doing it

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.280 
surprised because I was first doing it
and<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.489> was<00:03:57.579> all<00:03:57.730> white<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.239> it<00:03:58.690> was<00:03:58.870> it

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
and it was all white and it was it

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.500 
and it was all white and it was it
wasn't<00:03:59.590> really<00:03:59.680> looking<00:03:59.889> curly<00:04:00.609> I<00:04:00.819> was<00:04:01.299> kind

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
wasn't really looking curly I was kind

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.970 
wasn't really looking curly I was kind
of<00:04:01.540> like<00:04:01.630> I'm<00:04:02.200> probably<00:04:02.319> not<00:04:02.590> gonna<00:04:02.739> like<00:04:02.829> this

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
of like I'm probably not gonna like this

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.490 
of like I'm probably not gonna like this
probably<00:04:03.370> will<00:04:03.549> not<00:04:03.670> try<00:04:03.910> that's<00:04:04.090> good<00:04:04.440> but<00:04:05.440> I

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
probably will not try that's good but I

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.979 
probably will not try that's good but I
actually<00:04:05.709> do<00:04:06.040> like<00:04:06.069> it<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.639> what<00:04:07.359> I<00:04:07.389> like<00:04:07.630> most

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
actually do like it and what I like most

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.800 
actually do like it and what I like most
I<00:04:08.230> mean<00:04:08.350> it<00:04:08.620> doesn't<00:04:09.250> compare<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.670> kinky<00:04:10.510> curly

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
I mean it doesn't compare to kinky curly

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.020 
I mean it doesn't compare to kinky curly
is<00:04:10.930> still<00:04:11.139> better<00:04:11.319> it's<00:04:12.190> still<00:04:12.400> my<00:04:12.519> favorite

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
is still better it's still my favorite

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.180 
is still better it's still my favorite
but<00:04:13.600> I<00:04:13.870> guess<00:04:14.079> there's<00:04:14.260> like<00:04:14.470> thirty<00:04:14.739> dollars

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
but I guess there's like thirty dollars

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.529 
but I guess there's like thirty dollars
where<00:04:15.790> is<00:04:15.880> this<00:04:17.070> this<00:04:18.070> will<00:04:18.609> follow<00:04:18.880> I<00:04:19.180> think

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
where is this this will follow I think

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:20.879 
where is this this will follow I think
it's<00:04:19.690> like<00:04:19.840> two<00:04:20.049> or<00:04:20.200> three<00:04:20.229> dollars<00:04:20.500> or

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
it's like two or three dollars or

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.629 
it's like two or three dollars or
something<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:23.020> get<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.229> similar<00:04:23.530> effect<00:04:24.039> I

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
something and you get a similar effect I

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.070 
something and you get a similar effect I
don't<00:04:25.090> know<00:04:25.150> how<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.300> spell<00:04:25.360> in<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.690> morning

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.570 
don't know how to spell in the morning
but<00:04:26.440> hopefully<00:04:26.800> it'll<00:04:27.010> be<00:04:27.130> okay<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.400> was

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580

think<00:05:22.840> it's<00:05:23.200> heavy<00:05:23.380> enough<00:05:23.500> but<00:05:23.950> maybe<00:05:24.280> if<00:05:24.400> I

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
think it's heavy enough but maybe if I

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.890 
think it's heavy enough but maybe if I
can<00:05:24.550> find<00:05:24.730> a<00:05:24.850> condition<00:05:25.210> is<00:05:25.330> a<00:05:25.360> little<00:05:25.780> bit

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
can find a condition is a little bit

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.720 
can find a condition is a little bit
heavier<00:05:26.290> I<00:05:26.500> doubt<00:05:26.980> have<00:05:27.130> a<00:05:27.160> little<00:05:27.460> bit<00:05:27.550> less

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
heavier I doubt have a little bit less

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.440 
heavier I doubt have a little bit less
frizz<00:05:28.000> but<00:05:28.570> alright<00:05:28.840> guys<00:05:29.020> take<00:05:29.410> care
