and<00:00:31.830> lagers<00:00:31.980> their<00:00:32.430> glorious<00:00:32.910> golden<00:00:33.180> hue<00:00:33.630> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and lagers their glorious golden hue and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.020 
and lagers their glorious golden hue and
porters<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.770> stouts<00:00:34.829> their<00:00:35.340> full-bodied

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.680 

so<00:00:44.690> we<00:00:44.780> cut<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.050> grains<00:00:45.350> in<00:00:46.010> half<00:00:46.390> and<00:00:47.390> this<00:00:47.510> is

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
so we cut the grains in half and this is

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.320 
so we cut the grains in half and this is
what<00:00:47.900> would<00:00:48.410> have<00:00:48.560> actually<00:00:48.850> in<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:49.970> days<00:00:50.180> of

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
what would have actually in the days of

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.030 
what would have actually in the days of
the<00:00:50.450> old<00:00:50.600> corn<00:00:50.870> exchanges<00:00:51.590> this<00:00:51.740> would<00:00:51.920> have

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
the old corn exchanges this would have

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.780 
the old corn exchanges this would have
made<00:00:52.340> a<00:00:53.650> maltster<00:00:54.650> interested<00:00:55.280> in<00:00:55.370> buying<00:00:55.610> the

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
made a maltster interested in buying the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.140 
made a maltster interested in buying the
grain<00:00:56.000> or<00:00:56.210> not<00:00:56.420> now<00:00:57.170> we<00:00:57.200> have<00:00:58.150> scientific

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
grain or not now we have scientific

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.000 
grain or not now we have scientific
machines<00:00:59.660> in<00:00:59.870> the<00:00:59.960> boa<00:01:00.140> trees<00:01:00.500> but<00:01:00.770> this<00:01:00.860> is

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
machines in the boa trees but this is

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.329 
machines in the boa trees but this is
the<00:01:01.130> old<00:01:01.280> tried<00:01:01.580> and<00:01:01.610> tested<00:01:01.940> way<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:03.440> as<00:01:04.220> you

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
the old tried and tested way and as you

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.490 
the old tried and tested way and as you
can<00:01:04.490> see<00:01:04.760> we're<00:01:05.150> looking<00:01:05.180> for<00:01:05.540> a<00:01:05.570> nice<00:01:05.810> starchy

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
can see we're looking for a nice starchy

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.280 
can see we're looking for a nice starchy
white<00:01:06.890> finish<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:08.540> majority<00:01:09.050> of<00:01:09.080> those

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
white finish the majority of those

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.910 
white finish the majority of those
grains<00:01:09.680> are<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:10.550> they<00:01:10.910> will<00:01:11.120> continue<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.920> to

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
grains are and they will continue to to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.150 
grains are and they will continue to to
modify<00:01:13.370> as<00:01:13.790> as<00:01:14.510> the<00:01:14.720> crop<00:01:14.930> gets<00:01:15.110> riper<00:01:15.470> it's<00:01:16.040> on

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
modify as as the crop gets riper it's on

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.660 
modify as as the crop gets riper it's on
its<00:01:16.310> final<00:01:16.550> journey<00:01:16.970> now<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.260> Malthouse

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
its final journey now to the Malthouse

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.930 
its final journey now to the Malthouse
to<00:01:19.670> be<00:01:19.790> turned<00:01:20.060> into<00:01:20.380> malt<00:01:21.820> converted<00:01:22.820> into

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
to be turned into malt converted into

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.090 
to be turned into malt converted into
whole<00:01:23.270> which<00:01:24.200> is<00:01:24.320> then<00:01:24.470> already<00:01:24.740> for<00:01:25.010> the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
whole which is then already for the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:34.360 
whole which is then already for the
brewer<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:26.420> turn<00:01:26.660> into<00:01:26.869> the

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.090 

so<00:01:35.370> what<00:01:35.580> you've<00:01:35.700> got<00:01:35.730> is<00:01:35.960> greenwalt<00:01:37.050> as<00:01:37.830> you

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
so what you've got is greenwalt as you

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.820 
so what you've got is greenwalt as you
can<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.370> it's<00:01:38.490> no<00:01:38.640> longer<00:01:38.670> barley

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
can see it's no longer barley

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.270 
can see it's no longer barley
we've<00:01:41.180> been<00:01:42.180> molting<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.870> for<00:01:43.290> nine<00:01:43.980> days

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
we've been molting this for nine days

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.360 
we've been molting this for nine days
and<00:01:45.800> during<00:01:46.800> that<00:01:46.830> period<00:01:47.960> we've<00:01:49.130> allowed<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
and during that period we've allowed the

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.180 
and during that period we've allowed the
barley<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:52.640> quietly<00:01:53.640> germinate<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.190> through

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
barley to quietly germinate and through

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.600 
barley to quietly germinate and through
that<00:01:56.400> natural<00:01:56.580> process<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:58.350> starches<00:01:58.860> have

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
that natural process the starches have

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.720 
that natural process the starches have
been<00:01:59.850> modified<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.560> now<00:02:01.980> we<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.220> rub

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
been modified so that now we can rub

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.620 
been modified so that now we can rub
them<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.210> as<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:04.229> smooth<00:02:04.740> paste<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:06.150> you<00:02:06.390> can

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
them out as a smooth paste and you can

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.449 
them out as a smooth paste and you can
see<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.320> when<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.710> goes<00:02:07.950> off<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
see that when that goes off to the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.969 
see that when that goes off to the
