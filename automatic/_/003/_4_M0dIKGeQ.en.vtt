hi i'm jonathan from franklin and psycho
works<00:00:02.790> in<00:00:03.030> this<00:00:03.570> tutorial<00:00:03.810> we're<00:00:04.380> going<00:00:04.500> to

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
works in this tutorial we're going to

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.590 
works in this tutorial we're going to
show<00:00:04.650> you<00:00:04.859> how<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.040> pump<00:00:05.310> up<00:00:05.580> your<00:00:05.790> bicycle

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
show you how to pump up your bicycle

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.320 
show you how to pump up your bicycle
tire<00:00:07.099> now<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.160> first<00:00:08.460> thing<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.790> note<00:00:08.970> are

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
tire now the first thing to note are

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.000 
tire now the first thing to note are
that<00:00:09.389> there<00:00:09.660> are<00:00:09.690> two<00:00:09.929> different<00:00:10.139> kinds<00:00:10.889> of

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
that there are two different kinds of

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.150 
that there are two different kinds of
inner<00:00:11.400> tubes<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.059> road<00:00:12.660> wheels<00:00:12.980> first<00:00:13.980> one

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
inner tubes and road wheels first one

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.560 
inner tubes and road wheels first one
i'm<00:00:14.250> going<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.460> show<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:15.330> called<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
i'm going to show you it's called a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.930 
i'm going to show you it's called a
Schrader<00:00:15.809> valve<00:00:16.190> Schrader<00:00:17.190> valves<00:00:17.640> tend<00:00:17.850> to

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
Schrader valve Schrader valves tend to

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.820 
Schrader valve Schrader valves tend to
be<00:00:18.090> fatter<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.050> they<00:00:19.289> don't<00:00:19.439> have<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> little

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
be fatter and they don't have a little

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.099 
be fatter and they don't have a little
piston<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.580> holds<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.910> air<00:00:21.060> pressure<00:00:21.359> this

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
piston that holds the air pressure this

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.019 
piston that holds the air pressure this
right<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> Schrader<00:00:22.949> valve<00:00:23.310> it's

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
right here is a Schrader valve it's

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.240 
right here is a Schrader valve it's
easier<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.689> -<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.990> pump<00:00:25.199> up<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.890> we'll<00:00:26.039> start

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
easier the - to pump up so we'll start

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.429 
easier the - to pump up so we'll start
with<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:28.279> now<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.460> air<00:00:29.730> pump<00:00:30.230> actually<00:00:31.230> has

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
with this now this air pump actually has

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.440 
with this now this air pump actually has
the<00:00:31.650> capability<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.489> work<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:33.210> both

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the capability to work with both

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.470 
the capability to work with both
Schrader<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.290> Presta<00:00:35.040> valves<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.090> notice

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
Schrader and Presta valves and notice

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.389 
Schrader and Presta valves and notice
that<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.809> Schrader<00:00:37.079> hole<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.190> bigger<00:00:38.370> one

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.119 

so<00:00:44.910> all<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.090> need<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.449> is<00:00:45.629> hold<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.129> hold

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
so all you need to do is hold the hold

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.180 
so all you need to do is hold the hold
the<00:00:47.250> pump<00:00:47.460> over<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.969> valve<00:00:48.920> make<00:00:49.920> sure<00:00:50.070> you've

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the pump over the valve make sure you've

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.610 
the pump over the valve make sure you've
got<00:00:50.219> good<00:00:50.520> tension<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:52.019> flip<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
got good tension and then flip up the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.939 
got good tension and then flip up the
lever<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.040> lock<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.519> place<00:00:54.829> once<00:00:55.829> you've

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
lever to lock it in place once you've

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.170 
lever to lock it in place once you've
done<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.430> should<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> tight<00:00:57.059> enough

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
done that you should have a tight enough

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.100 
done that you should have a tight enough
seal<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.680> begin<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.040> pump<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.399> your<00:00:59.460> tire

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.450 

now<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.379> pump<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.739> want<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.009> think<00:01:05.190> about

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
now as you pump you want to think about

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.570 
now as you pump you want to think about
what<00:01:05.700> tire<00:01:05.970> pressure<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.899> inflate<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.259> to<00:01:07.580> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
what tire pressure to inflate it to the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.010 
what tire pressure to inflate it to the
sidewall<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> tire

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
sidewall of the tire

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.859 
sidewall of the tire
should<00:01:10.649> have<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.340> number<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.240> indicating

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
should have a number on it indicating

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.730 
should have a number on it indicating
the<00:01:13.380> max<00:01:13.680> tire<00:01:14.100> inflation<00:01:15.000> pressure<00:01:15.530> you<00:01:16.530> want

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the max tire inflation pressure you want

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
the max tire inflation pressure you want
to<00:01:16.830> go<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.009> about<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.580> max<00:01:17.820> pressure

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
to go to about the max pressure

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.910 
to go to about the max pressure
this<00:01:18.990> will<00:01:19.200> prevent<00:01:19.560> pops<00:01:21.050> so<00:01:22.050> let<00:01:22.200> prevent

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this will prevent pops so let prevent

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.210 
this will prevent pops so let prevent
things<00:01:23.190> from<00:01:24.649> popping<00:01:25.649> your<00:01:25.770> inner<00:01:25.950> tube

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
things from popping your inner tube

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.630 
things from popping your inner tube
generally<00:01:27.380> road<00:01:28.380> bike<00:01:28.590> tire<00:01:28.860> pressures<00:01:29.369> are

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
generally road bike tire pressures are

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.270 
generally road bike tire pressures are
going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:29.970> anywhere<00:01:30.420> from<00:01:30.960> between<00:01:31.170> 90<00:01:31.890> to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
going to go anywhere from between 90 to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.719 
going to go anywhere from between 90 to
120<00:01:33.090> Schrader<00:01:34.080> valves<00:01:34.500> tend<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.830> handle<00:01:35.250> lower

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
120 Schrader valves tend to handle lower

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
120 Schrader valves tend to handle lower
tire<00:01:36.149> pressures<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.590> one's<00:01:37.770> probably

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
tire pressures so this one's probably

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.649 
tire pressures so this one's probably
going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.369> good<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.789> 90<00:01:41.300> you<00:01:42.300> take<00:01:42.539> it

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
going to be good at about 90 you take it

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.899 
going to be good at about 90 you take it
off<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.679> just<00:01:43.890> release<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.399> valve<00:01:44.580> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
off you just release the valve and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.029 
off you just release the valve and
quickly<00:01:45.450> pull<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.380> pump<00:01:46.619> away<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.950> then<00:01:49.950> you

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
quickly pull the pump away so then you

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.550 
quickly pull the pump away so then you
want<00:01:50.190> to<00:01:50.250> make<00:01:50.399> sure<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.959> put<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.289> dust

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
want to make sure that you put the dust

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:01.350 
want to make sure that you put the dust
cap<00:01:52.860> back<00:01:53.789> in<00:01:54.030> place

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.730 

now<00:02:02.360> I'll<00:02:02.510> show<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.110> straight<00:02:03.320> or<00:02:03.560> the

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
now I'll show you the straight or the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.630 
now I'll show you the straight or the
Presta<00:02:04.220> valve<00:02:05.740> again<00:02:06.740> you've<00:02:07.070> got<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.430> dust

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
Presta valve again you've got the dust

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.420 
Presta valve again you've got the dust
cap<00:02:08.200> but<00:02:09.200> then<00:02:09.350> in<00:02:09.470> addition<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:10.040> having<00:02:10.340> to

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
cap but then in addition is having to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.940 
cap but then in addition is having to
take<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.820> off<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.350> knot<00:02:12.560> holds<00:02:12.860> the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
take that off so the knot holds the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.730 
take that off so the knot holds the
needle<00:02:13.250> in<00:02:13.370> place<00:02:13.840> you've<00:02:14.840> got<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.200> unscrew

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
needle in place you've got to unscrew

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.420 
needle in place you've got to unscrew
the<00:02:15.860> nut<00:02:16.210> so<00:02:17.210> that<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.480> can<00:02:17.660> push<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.020> needle

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
the nut so that you can push the needle

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.690 
the nut so that you can push the needle
up<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.940> down<00:02:20.060> like<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:21.310> pushing<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.580> needle

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
up and down like so pushing the needle

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.870 
up and down like so pushing the needle
up<00:02:23.030> will<00:02:23.570> release<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.170> air<00:02:24.290> pressure<00:02:24.590> so<00:02:24.980> to

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
up will release the air pressure so to

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.360 
up will release the air pressure so to
pump<00:02:26.090> up<00:02:26.240> this<00:02:26.420> tire<00:02:26.830> we're<00:02:27.830> going<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.010> use<00:02:28.160> the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
pump up this tire we're going to use the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.200 
pump up this tire we're going to use the
smaller<00:02:28.670> hole<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.810> head<00:02:30.020> of<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.410> pump

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
smaller hole and the head of this pump

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.820 
smaller hole and the head of this pump
do<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.360> same<00:02:32.600> thing<00:02:35.080> hold<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.320> place<00:02:36.470> nice

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
do the same thing hold it in place nice

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.260 
do the same thing hold it in place nice
and<00:02:37.100> tight<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.459> make<00:02:37.610> sure<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.910> have<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.060> good

and tight to make sure you have a good

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.980 
and tight to make sure you have a good
seal<00:02:40.030> then<00:02:41.030> flip<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.540> lever<00:02:43.450> now<00:02:44.450> as<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.750> said

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
seal then flip the lever now as I said

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.970 
seal then flip the lever now as I said
before<00:02:45.940> press<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.120> valves<00:02:47.480> tend<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.980> handle

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
before press the valves tend to handle

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.699 
before press the valves tend to handle
higher<00:02:49.250> air<00:02:50.120> pressure<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:51.440> we're<00:02:51.560> going<00:02:51.650> to

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
higher air pressure so we're going to

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.550 
higher air pressure so we're going to
pump<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.100> one<00:02:52.310> up<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.610> 120<00:02:55.930> alright<00:02:56.930> once

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
pump this one up to 120 alright once

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.699 
pump this one up to 120 alright once
you've<00:02:57.740> found<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.190> right<00:02:58.400> tire<00:02:58.640> pressure

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
you've found the right tire pressure

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.110 
you've found the right tire pressure
again<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.860> just<00:03:01.040> flip<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.280> lever<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:01.820> pull
