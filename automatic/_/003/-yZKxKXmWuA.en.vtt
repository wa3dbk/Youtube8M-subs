means it's locked in and it's not going

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
to fall off if you shake it but when you

shake it it rattles a lot and it's not

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.639 
shake it it rattles a lot and it's not
very<00:00:56.969> secure<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.570> still<00:00:57.780> shakes<00:00:58.260> around<00:00:58.559> a

lot<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.039> that's<00:00:59.190> again<00:00:59.520> because<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.940> doesn't

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
lot and that's again because it doesn't

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.729 
lot and that's again because it doesn't
have<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:00.750> male<00:01:00.930> nub<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.350> go<00:01:01.440> into<00:01:01.620> the

it's<00:01:03.600> only<00:01:03.750> wobbly<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.260> other<00:01:04.589> blasters<00:01:05.129> when

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
it's only wobbly on other blasters when

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.190 
it's only wobbly on other blasters when
it<00:01:05.430> actually<00:01:05.610> detaches<00:01:06.240> onto<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.720> blaster

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
it actually detaches onto this blaster

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.469 
it actually detaches onto this blaster
it's<00:01:07.409> very<00:01:07.590> smooth<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.189> very<00:01:08.280> solid<00:01:08.640> moving

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
it's very smooth and very solid moving

it's very smooth and very solid moving
back<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> priming<00:01:10.560> handle<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.920> prime

back here is the priming handle to prime
this<00:01:11.280> blaster<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:12.060> pull<00:01:12.270> back<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
this blaster you just pull back in the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.480 
this blaster you just pull back in the
slide<00:01:12.930> prime<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.560> pretty<00:01:13.770> smooth<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.100> since

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
slide prime is pretty smooth but since

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.160 
slide prime is pretty smooth but since
it's<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.700> springer<00:01:15.090> with<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> very<00:01:15.689> light<00:01:15.900> draw

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
it's a springer with a very light draw

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.330 
it's a springer with a very light draw
weight<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.530> would<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.710> pretty<00:01:16.860> difficult<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
weight it would be pretty difficult to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.160 
weight it would be pretty difficult to
mess<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.180> scope<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:18.840> doesn't

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
mess that up the scope up here doesn't

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.870 
mess that up the scope up here doesn't
magnify<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.740> anything<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.159> see<00:01:20.610> through

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
magnify or anything you can see through

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.580 
magnify or anything you can see through
it<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.330> rather<00:01:21.509> difficult<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.170> aim<00:01:22.200> with

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it but it's rather difficult to aim with

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.440 
it but it's rather difficult to aim with
it<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:23.220> kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.640> nuisance<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.119> actually

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it it's kind of a nuisance to actually

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.030 
it it's kind of a nuisance to actually
get<00:01:24.600> your<00:01:24.720> face<00:01:24.960> down<00:01:25.200> there<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.590> look<00:01:25.619> through

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
get your face down there to look through

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.620 
get your face down there to look through
that<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.670> think<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.000> site<00:01:27.180> looks<00:01:27.390> pretty

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that but I think that site looks pretty

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.120 
that but I think that site looks pretty
cool<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> grip<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.920> pretty

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
cool to the grip it's a pretty

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.319 
cool to the grip it's a pretty
comfortable<00:01:29.549> grip<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.909> seems<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
comfortable grip it seems like a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.480 
comfortable grip it seems like a
comfortable<00:01:31.200> size<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.740> little<00:01:32.040> notch<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
comfortable size this little notch is a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.920 
comfortable size this little notch is a
little<00:01:32.759> too<00:01:32.880> close<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> handguard<00:01:33.750> so

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
little too close to the handguard so

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.810 
little too close to the handguard so
it's<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> little<00:01:34.290> uncomfortable<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:34.890> me<00:01:35.159> but

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
it's a little uncomfortable for me but

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.609 
it's a little uncomfortable for me but
maybe<00:01:35.939> that's<00:01:36.240> because<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.840> big<00:01:37.049> hands<00:01:37.259> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
maybe that's because I have big hands to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.200 
maybe that's because I have big hands to
the<00:01:37.740> trigger<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> pretty<00:01:38.490> sloppy<00:01:38.790> trigger

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the trigger it's a pretty sloppy trigger

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.730 
the trigger it's a pretty sloppy trigger
to<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.450> honest<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> doesn't<00:01:40.079> feel<00:01:40.229> good<00:01:40.470> at<00:01:40.560> all

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
to be honest it doesn't feel good at all

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.740 
to be honest it doesn't feel good at all
it<00:01:41.100> doesn't<00:01:41.430> job<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.970> fine<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.479> doesn't

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you can see this is the extended

you can see this is the extended
position<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:55.170> then<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.530> pull<00:01:55.860> it

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
position and then you can pull it

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.499 
position and then you can pull it
forward<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.880> doesn't<00:01:57.180> really<00:01:57.270> lock

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
into place all that well it's sort of

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010 
into place all that well it's sort of
flimsy<00:01:59.130> plastic<00:01:59.430> but<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.299> can't<00:02:00.540> attach<00:02:00.810> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
flimsy plastic but you can't attach it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.510 
flimsy plastic but you can't attach it
if<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.469> wanted<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.799> store<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.250> something

if you wanted to store it or something
like<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> extended<00:02:03.719> position<00:02:03.780> it's

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
like that in the extended position it's

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.880 
like that in the extended position it's
very<00:02:04.560> flimsy

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
very flimsy

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.680 
very flimsy
you<00:02:05.920> compress<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.610> flexes<00:02:07.150> and<00:02:07.300> moves<00:02:07.420> down

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
you compress it it flexes and moves down

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.960 
you compress it it flexes and moves down
it's<00:02:08.140> not<00:02:08.259> usable<00:02:08.740> as<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.009> stock<00:02:09.340> at<00:02:09.520> all<00:02:09.610> or

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
it's not usable as a stock at all or

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.300 
it's not usable as a stock at all or
this<00:02:10.149> might<00:02:10.390> happen<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.980> will<00:02:11.980> show<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.160> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
this might happen I will show you the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:28.980 
this might happen I will show you the

blaster fired 45 duplicate 45 44 47 feet
per<00:02:29.140> second<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.800> as<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:30.010> can<00:02:30.160> see<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
per second so as you can see the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.130 
per second so as you can see the
performance<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.120> an<00:02:31.240> absolute<00:02:31.630> joke<00:02:31.900> it

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
performance is an absolute joke it

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.690 
performance is an absolute joke it
doesn't<00:02:32.410> fire<00:02:32.590> well<00:02:32.860> at<00:02:33.010> all<00:02:33.130> it's<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.400> single

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700

doesn't fire well at all it's a single
shot<00:02:33.910> blaster<00:02:34.300> that's<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.540> pain<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.870> butt

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
enough to go into other blasters but it

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.250 
enough to go into other blasters but it
will<00:02:57.519> fit<00:02:57.910> but<00:02:58.269> overall<00:02:58.570> it's<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.019> replica

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
will fit but overall it's a replica

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.720 
will fit but overall it's a replica

even advertise in big letters that it's

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.009 
even advertise in big letters that it's
a<00:03:05.800> nerf<00:03:06.010> gun<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.430> just<00:03:06.489> a<00:03:06.730> rebel<00:03:06.940> prop<00:03:07.360> made

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
a nerf gun it's just a rebel prop made

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.020 
a nerf gun it's just a rebel prop made
by<00:03:08.200> nerf<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.680> specifically<00:03:09.100> says<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.370> so

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
by nerf and it specifically says that so

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.550 
by nerf and it specifically says that so
if<00:03:10.180> you're<00:03:10.299> trying<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.690> actually<00:03:11.079> play<00:03:11.320> nerf

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560

if you're trying to actually play nerf
guns<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:12.070> would<00:03:12.250> not<00:03:12.430> recommend<00:03:12.610> this<00:03:13.000> at<00:03:13.239> all

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
guns I would not recommend this at all

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.270

the<00:03:13.870> price<00:03:14.110> in<00:03:14.290> my<00:03:14.410> opinion<00:03:14.769> is<00:03:14.890> too<00:03:15.070> high<00:03:15.250> for

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
the price in my opinion is too high for

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.130 
the price in my opinion is too high for
what<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.760> get<00:03:15.940> it's<00:03:16.150> not<00:03:16.510> a<00:03:16.540> well-made

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
what you get it's not a well-made

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.080 
what you get it's not a well-made
blaster<00:03:17.620> at<00:03:17.709> all<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:18.010> looks<00:03:18.220> okay<00:03:18.790> from<00:03:18.850> a

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
blaster at all it looks okay from a

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.370 
blaster at all it looks okay from a
distance<00:03:19.480> but<00:03:19.630> when<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.810> get<00:03:19.959> up<00:03:20.049> too<00:03:20.200> close

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.289 
distance but when you get up too close
to<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.769> doesn't<00:03:20.950> perform<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.880> stock<00:03:22.120> is

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.030 
to it it doesn't perform the stock is

flimsy everything is flimsy it doesn't
shoot<00:03:24.250> very<00:03:24.430> well<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.120> doesn't<00:03:25.299> look

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
shoot very well and it doesn't look

shoot very well and it doesn't look
particularly<00:03:26.140> realistic<00:03:26.799> to<00:03:27.220> any<00:03:27.489> movie

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
particularly realistic to any movie

particularly realistic to any movie
problem<00:03:28.180> but<00:03:28.390> even<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.750> buy<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:28.959> for<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.290> front

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440

problem but even to buy it for the front
extension<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.100> would<00:03:30.459> suggest<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:31.060> don't

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
extension I would suggest you don't

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.120 
extension I would suggest you don't
honestly<00:03:31.870> because<00:03:32.019> it<00:03:32.260> rattles<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:32.769> much<00:03:32.950> on

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
honestly because it rattles so much on

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.039 
honestly because it rattles so much on
any<00:03:33.280> other<00:03:33.400> nerf<00:03:33.640> guns<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.209> would<00:03:34.630> recommend<00:03:34.989> a

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
any other nerf guns I would recommend a

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.449 
any other nerf guns I would recommend a
Spectre<00:03:35.440> for<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.739> function<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.310> the

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
Spectre for that function that the

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.009 
Spectre for that function that the
barrel<00:03:36.760> extensions<00:03:37.180> look<00:03:37.360> very<00:03:37.600> similar

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
barrel extensions look very similar

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.960 
barrel extensions look very similar
inspectors<00:03:38.530> are<00:03:38.680> around<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.220> same<00:03:39.400> price<00:03:39.700> I

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
inspectors are around the same price I

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.130 
inspectors are around the same price I
know<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.209> lot<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.390> my<00:03:40.540> viewers<00:03:40.750> don't<00:03:40.930> really

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
know a lot of my viewers don't really

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.600 
know a lot of my viewers don't really
care<00:03:41.320> about<00:03:41.410> prop<00:03:41.799> stuff<00:03:42.070> like<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:42.340> but<00:03:42.519> I

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
care about prop stuff like this but I

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.100 
care about prop stuff like this but I
saw<00:03:42.760> Anna<00:03:42.940> target<00:03:43.269> wanted<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.600> review<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:43.989> out

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
saw Anna target wanted to review it out

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.410 
saw Anna target wanted to review it out
of<00:03:44.200> curiosity<00:03:44.410> so<00:03:45.310> that's<00:03:45.489> my<00:03:45.610> review<00:03:45.820> again

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
of curiosity so that's my review again

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.910 
of curiosity so that's my review again
probably<00:03:47.019> wouldn't<00:03:47.230> recommend<00:03:47.470> this<00:03:47.709> at<00:03:47.829> all

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
probably wouldn't recommend this at all

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.170 
probably wouldn't recommend this at all
but<00:03:48.190> just<00:03:48.310> in<00:03:48.489> case<00:03:48.519> you're<00:03:48.820> curious

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
but just in case you're curious

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.580 
but just in case you're curious
there's<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.630> review<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.200> will<00:03:50.290> have<00:03:50.410> more

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
there's the review you will have more

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.110 
there's the review you will have more
consistent<00:03:51.160> shots<00:03:51.370> which<00:03:51.579> allows<00:03:51.850> you<00:03:52.030> to

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
consistent shots which allows you to

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.670 
consistent shots which allows you to
actually<00:03:52.390> shoot<00:03:52.540> harder<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.140> further<00:03:53.320> than

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
actually shoot harder and further than

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.530 
actually shoot harder and further than
without<00:03:54.040> coating<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.670> moving<00:03:55.090> back<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.390> also

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
without coating and moving back I also

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.539 
without coating and moving back I also
added<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:56.140> lower<00:03:56.350> resistance<00:03:56.620> which<00:03:57.250> as<00:03:57.459> you

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
added a lower resistance which as you

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.039 
added a lower resistance which as you
can<00:03:57.579> see<00:03:57.730> there<00:03:58.000> that's<00:03:58.180> just<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.600> push<00:03:58.810> button

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
can see there that's just a push button

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.500 
can see there that's just a push button
moment
