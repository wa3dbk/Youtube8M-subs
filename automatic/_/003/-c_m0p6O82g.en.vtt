first nights just how did I learn it's a
like<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> bunch<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.400> space<00:01:15.000> junk<00:01:15.590> floating

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
like a bunch of space junk floating

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.149 
like a bunch of space junk floating
around<00:01:16.909> orbiting<00:01:17.909> my<00:01:18.210> life<00:01:18.619> life<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.830> actually

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
around orbiting my life life is actually

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.790 
around orbiting my life life is actually
you<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.400> full<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.270> lot

you know full of a lot

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.320 
you know full of a lot
finalities<00:01:22.800> it's<00:01:23.160> not<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.820> much<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.210> know

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
finalities it's not not so much you know

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.810 
finalities it's not not so much you know
it's<00:01:24.480> we're<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:25.080> gonna<00:01:25.290> end<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> big<00:01:26.550> final

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
it's we're all gonna end on a big final

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.480 
it's we're all gonna end on a big final
chord<00:01:27.300> with<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.500> know<00:01:28.620> everything<00:01:29.220> coming

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
chord with you know everything coming

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.930 
chord with you know everything coming
together<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.290> resolving<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.620> so<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.160> actually

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
together and resolving and so I actually

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.450 
together and resolving and so I actually
think<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:33.990> last<00:01:34.260> thoughts<00:01:34.620> you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.100> might

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
think your last thoughts you know might

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.100 
think your last thoughts you know might
be<00:01:35.610> something<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.030> oh<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.540> forgot<00:01:36.870> to<00:01:36.990> take

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
be something like oh I forgot to take

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.840 
be something like oh I forgot to take
the<00:01:37.229> garbage<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.800> or<00:01:38.130> something<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.640> this

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the garbage out or something like this

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.260 
the garbage out or something like this
so<00:01:39.780> you're<00:01:40.740> living<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.220> you're<00:01:41.369> leaving<00:01:41.490> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so you're living but you're leaving you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.910 
so you're living but you're leaving you
know<00:01:42.420> at<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.900> same<00:01:43.110> time<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.830> you

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
know at the same time and then so you

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.130 
know at the same time and then so you
sure<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.160> look<00:01:44.280> at<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.490> crap<00:01:45.270> that's<00:01:45.510> you<00:01:46.020> know

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
sure to look at the crap that's you know

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.980 
sure to look at the crap that's you know
dragging<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:46.950> kind<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.670> dirty<00:01:48.330> little<00:01:48.600> cloud

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
dragging a kind of dirty little cloud

00:01:48.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
dragging a kind of dirty little cloud
behind<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.070> know

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.380 

what<00:02:11.010> I<00:02:11.040> do<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> back<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:11.970> house<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
what I do in the back of the house is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.870 
what I do in the back of the house is
conduct<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.380> show<00:02:13.560> has<00:02:13.770> no<00:02:13.920> fixed<00:02:14.400> length<00:02:14.640> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
conduct the show has no fixed length the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.990 
conduct the show has no fixed length the
structure<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.420> very<00:02:15.780> very<00:02:16.110> elastic<00:02:16.850> what<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:17.880> do

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
structure is very very elastic what I do

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.700 
structure is very very elastic what I do
is<00:02:19.100> give<00:02:20.100> musical<00:02:21.060> cues<00:02:21.360> because<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.440> music

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
is give musical cues because the music

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.830 
is give musical cues because the music
is<00:02:22.770> connected<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:24.330> structure<00:02:24.810> and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
is connected to the structure and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.990 
is connected to the structure and
sometimes<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.530> music<00:02:25.620> responds<00:02:26.190> often<00:02:26.940> the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
sometimes the music responds often the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.140 
sometimes the music responds often the
music<00:02:27.240> responds<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.050> structure<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
music responds to the structure and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.940 
music responds to the structure and
other<00:02:30.150> way<00:02:30.300> around<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.780> course<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.860> to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
other way around of course I have to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.610 
other way around of course I have to
make<00:02:32.100> decisions<00:02:32.250> about<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.780> way<00:02:34.320> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
make decisions about the way the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.480 
make decisions about the way the
structure<00:02:35.310> expands<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.120> contracts<00:02:36.510> the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
structure expands and contracts the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.700 
structure expands and contracts the
amount<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.640> time<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.300> give<00:02:39.900> someone<00:02:40.350> to

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
amount of time to give someone to

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:52.990 
amount of time to give someone to
explain<00:02:41.430> what<00:02:41.640> they're<00:02:41.790> trying<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.090> explain

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.970 

this<00:02:54.000> piece<00:02:54.240> hums<00:02:54.600> along<00:02:54.990> with<00:02:55.470> itself

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
this piece hums along with itself

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.150 
this piece hums along with itself
it<00:02:56.970> sort<00:02:57.210> of<00:02:57.270> sings<00:02:57.570> along<00:02:57.840> with<00:02:57.990> itself<00:02:58.350> it's

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
it sort of sings along with itself it's

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.230 
it sort of sings along with itself it's
a<00:02:59.990> tune<00:03:00.990> in<00:03:01.230> one's<00:03:01.440> head<00:03:01.710> and<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.430> mean<00:03:02.640> if<00:03:02.880> you

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
a tune in one's head and I mean if you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.510 
a tune in one's head and I mean if you
say<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.660> sense<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.140> more<00:03:04.200> an<00:03:04.710> acoustic

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
say the sense it's more an acoustic

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.880 
say the sense it's more an acoustic
thing<00:03:05.760> it's<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.590> something<00:03:07.910> that<00:03:08.910> is<00:03:09.770> maybe<00:03:10.770> a

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
thing it's a something that is maybe a

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.620 
thing it's a something that is maybe a
little<00:03:10.950> bit<00:03:11.220> irrepressible

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.260 

not<00:03:18.530> only<00:03:18.680> becoming<00:03:19.070> incredibly<00:03:19.370> close<00:03:19.850> and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
not only becoming incredibly close and

not only becoming incredibly close and
then<00:03:20.420> very<00:03:20.660> far<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.260> then<00:03:21.560> close<00:03:21.740> and<00:03:22.550> closing

coming tighter and tighter until it

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.170 
coming tighter and tighter until it

becomes so incredibly small that you

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
cannot see anything at all although it
