00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.759
 hello that such friends is everything a new 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.930
 video I'm your friend jose 74 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.940
 later I will be uploaded the winning video 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.469
 but first of all I wanted to tell you 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.980
 something that has caught my attention 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.630
 I do not know if you have noticed 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.310
 Well, I recommend them practically 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.980
 right now to put all of them to sell all 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.970
 those that are gold contracts because they have 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.470
 raised its prices brutally ok or 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.410
 I did not imagine that 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.420
 these updates were going to put the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.179
 head market 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.300
 because a gold contract a contract of 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.710
 players were worth a thousand coins 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.640
 they found in quick purchase in my 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.339
 coins but with the gold contract of 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.940
 gold glittering gold prevented the contract 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:55.329
 normal gold was in 500 coins per 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.309
 There you can buy what you could but I 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.329
 It drew attention that the contract of 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:04.659
 bright gold is almost by three thousand 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.789
 I do not know if you guys knew that 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.619
 that if they do not know it is still there 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:10.650
 news so they start selling those 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.640
 contracts why 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.700

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.820
 30,000 coins are made in 30 envelopes and 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.400
 forgiveness in 30 contracts 60 thousand coins 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.480
 and of course 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.320

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.320
