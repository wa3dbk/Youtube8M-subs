00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
for about two minutes rigorously to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.380 
for about two minutes rigorously to
break<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:55.860> get<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:56.729> loose<00:01:56.970> inside

when you're going to camouflage

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.180 
when you're going to camouflage

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
something you get a lot of people start

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.590 
something you get a lot of people start
out<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.370> green<00:02:05.610> which<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> good<00:02:06.240> good

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
color but that the most important thing

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.630 
color but that the most important thing
is<00:02:09.330> when<00:02:09.780> using<00:02:09.990> spray<00:02:10.410> paint<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.890> want<00:02:11.490> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
is when using spray paint you want to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.900 
is when using spray paint you want to
end<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.480> color<00:02:13.220> that's<00:02:14.220> if<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.640> want<00:02:14.670> it

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
end with the color that's if you want it

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.250 
end with the color that's if you want it
to<00:02:15.000> be<00:02:15.120> light<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.600> want<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.840> end<00:02:15.989> with<00:02:16.140> your

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
to be light you want to end with your

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.949 
to be light you want to end with your
lightest<00:02:16.620> color<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.550> tracking<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.690> want<00:02:18.840> to

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
lightest color you tracking you want to

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.229 
lightest color you tracking you want to
be<00:02:19.050> dark<00:02:19.320> you<00:02:19.470> want<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> end<00:02:19.800> with<00:02:19.860> your

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
be dark you want to end with your

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.930 
be dark you want to end with your
darkest<00:02:21.239> color<00:02:21.420> because<00:02:21.720> aerosol<00:02:22.940> these

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
darkest color because aerosol these

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.479 
darkest color because aerosol these
aerosol<00:02:24.590> particles<00:02:25.590> work<00:02:25.739> they<00:02:25.950> spread<00:02:26.250> out

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
aerosol particles work they spread out

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.060 
aerosol particles work they spread out
and<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:26.850> they're<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.030> gonna<00:02:27.320> fan<00:02:28.320> out<00:02:28.350> over

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
and so they're just gonna fan out over

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.800 
and so they're just gonna fan out over
the<00:02:29.190> entire<00:02:29.489> thing<00:02:29.519> so<00:02:30.120> if<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.510> end<00:02:30.660> up<00:02:30.750> with

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
the entire thing so if I end up with

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.560 
the entire thing so if I end up with
brown<00:02:31.560> I'll<00:02:31.860> put<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> stripe<00:02:32.459> but<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.360> just

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
brown I'll put a stripe but it's just

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.300 
brown I'll put a stripe but it's just
going<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.780> all<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.590> particles<00:02:34.890> are<00:02:35.130> going<00:02:35.190> to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
going to all the particles are going to

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.220 
going to all the particles are going to
float<00:02:35.550> out<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.000> make<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.300> appear<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.840> be<00:02:36.930> much

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
float out and make it appear to be much

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.229 
float out and make it appear to be much
darker<00:02:37.500> or<00:02:38.160> much<00:02:38.370> more<00:02:38.580> Brown<00:02:38.820> than<00:02:38.850> what<00:02:39.150> it

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
darker or much more Brown than what it

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:39.620 
darker or much more Brown than what it
really<00:02:39.269> is

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
really is

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.960 
really is
so<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.530> keeping<00:02:41.100> stuff<00:02:41.310> light<00:02:41.610> because

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
so I like keeping stuff light because

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.410 
so I like keeping stuff light because
it's<00:02:42.120> easy<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.510> make<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.750> darker<00:02:43.320> in<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> end

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
it's easy to make it darker in the end

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.460 
it's easy to make it darker in the end
but<00:02:45.420> for<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.870> must<00:02:45.989> start<00:02:46.260> out<00:02:46.380> with<00:02:46.440> green
