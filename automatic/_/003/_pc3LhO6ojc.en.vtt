reviewed on my video idea to a few

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.670 
reviewed on my video idea to a few
months<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.869> months<00:01:06.869> ago<00:01:08.930> if<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.080> would<00:01:10.110> compare

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
months or months ago if I would compare

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.649 
months or months ago if I would compare
these<00:01:10.860> two<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.549> flower<00:01:11.850> lens<00:01:12.210> hood<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
these two this is a flower lens hood and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.710 
these two this is a flower lens hood and
this<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.900> not<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:14.340> has<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> 38<00:01:15.090> millimeter

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
this is not this one has a 38 millimeter

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.399 
this is not this one has a 38 millimeter
third<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.460> I<00:01:17.460> would<00:01:18.000> actually<00:01:18.150> say<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.110> one

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
third but I would actually say this one

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.469 
third but I would actually say this one
is<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.920> better<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.250> out<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.850> these<00:01:21.150> two

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
is the better one out of these two

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.719 
is the better one out of these two
that's<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.200> though<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.100> don't<00:01:23.400> want<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.610> talk

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that's that though I don't want to talk

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.940 
that's that though I don't want to talk
too<00:01:24.119> much<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.560> really

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
too much about this because this really

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.420 
too much about this because this really
bought<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.520> lens<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.330> lens<00:01:27.540> hood<00:01:27.860> so<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
bought this lens the lens hood so this

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.060 
bought this lens the lens hood so this
lens<00:01:29.610> hood<00:01:29.970> has<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> 52<00:01:30.979> millimeters<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.640> red

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
lens hood has a 52 millimeters the red

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.399 
lens hood has a 52 millimeters the red
so<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.790> catch<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.720> 51

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
so if I have to catch this on the 51

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.319 
so if I have to catch this on the 51

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
it looks like attached to the lens

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.440 
it looks like attached to the lens
itself<00:01:54.979> for<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> lens<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.390> is

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
itself for a lens like this it is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.550 
itself for a lens like this it is
actually<00:01:58.229> pretty<00:01:58.619> nice

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
actually pretty nice

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
as you can see it is really big though I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.589 
as you can see it is really big though I
say<00:02:04.790> quality<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.750> bad<00:02:06.110> but<00:02:07.239> if<00:02:08.239> you<00:02:08.420> think

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
say quality is bad but if you think

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.770 
say quality is bad but if you think
about<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.679> bill<00:02:10.039> it's<00:02:10.429> like<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.540> red
