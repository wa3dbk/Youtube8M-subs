00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
more charge as me it's not a complicated

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.569 
more charge as me it's not a complicated

then turn so they never want to be doing
this<00:02:53.600> combination<00:02:54.200> is<00:02:54.290> basically<00:02:54.620> half<00:02:54.890> a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
this combination is basically half a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.890 
this combination is basically half a
turn<00:02:55.220> can<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.790> make<00:02:55.940> into<00:02:56.300> a<00:02:56.330> vulture

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
turn can you make into a vulture

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.449 
turn can you make into a vulture
absolutely<00:02:57.770> but<00:02:57.950> that<00:02:58.070> means<00:02:58.220> you'll<00:02:58.370> be

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
absolutely but that means you'll be

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.490 
absolutely but that means you'll be
starting<00:02:58.760> them<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.239> seems<00:02:59.450> like<00:02:59.690> all<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.290> time

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
starting them it seems like all the time

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.949 
starting them it seems like all the time
so<00:03:00.620> you're<00:03:00.770> starting<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.130> right<00:03:01.310> side<00:03:01.720> lift<00:03:02.720> it

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
so you're starting on right side lift it

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.960 
so you're starting on right side lift it
turn<00:03:03.739> it<00:03:03.860> all<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.100> way<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.520> right<00:03:04.670> side

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
turn it all the way to the right side

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.720 
turn it all the way to the right side
that's<00:03:05.930> one<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.470> did<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> full<00:03:06.830> turn<00:03:07.070> that

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
that's one you did a full turn that

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.630 
that's one you did a full turn that
means<00:03:08.030> you're<00:03:08.150> gonna<00:03:08.239> repeat<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:08.660> combo<00:03:09.640> on

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
means you're gonna repeat that combo on

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.070 
means you're gonna repeat that combo on
the<00:03:10.760> same<00:03:10.970> side<00:03:11.209> all<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.600> time<00:03:11.630> they're<00:03:11.959> not

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
the same side all the time they're not

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.720 
the same side all the time they're not
gonna<00:03:12.170> be<00:03:12.320> switching<00:03:12.680> sides<00:03:12.860> so<00:03:13.100> I'll<00:03:13.280> show<00:03:13.610> it

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730

suppose<00:03:42.140> that's<00:03:42.350> how<00:03:42.470> much<00:03:42.650> usually<00:03:43.010> have<00:03:43.160> it

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
suppose that's how much usually have it

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.650 
suppose that's how much usually have it
turn<00:03:43.489> in<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.730> beginning<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.239> think<00:03:44.480> it's

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
turn in the beginning I think it's

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.360 
turn in the beginning I think it's
really<00:03:44.870> good<00:03:45.110> way<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.290> start<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.160> learn

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
really good way to start and to learn

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.740
