00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:10.900
 today we are going to learn to decorate a jar 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:14.320
 info to me with Christmas motive for me 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.170
 show you I'm going to use this jar of 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.449
 the compotes of the babies but you 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.210
 You can use the bottle and the size 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.429
 as they wish 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.550
 The first thing we're going to do is we're going to 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:30.230
 cut a strip of foami 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:36.640
 so tall 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:39.130
 until the lid and that when turning it over 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.630
 seat 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:46.420
 reach us to completely surround the 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.980
 bottle and that we were a bit tight 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.990
 if we can and we see here it is not cut 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.080
 just at the moment of sticking lenses the 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.760
 I'm going to stretch a bit so I can stay 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.170
 tight to paste the foami that 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.640
 I use this type of glue that is 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.760
 special to the way they get it 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.940
 very economical in any stationery what 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.460
 what I'm going to do is apply here in the 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.500
 edges because it's double glue 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.160
 contact before we must apply so much here 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.230
 as here and wait a few minutes until 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.670
 that is completely dry 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.310
 Now the glue is dry and I'm going to 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.110
 join it 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.119
 the good thing about this glue is that it unites 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.119
 very fast and very well 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.869
 and we have already lined work the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.780
 little pot to start then to work 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:43.710
 next I'm going to take a sphere of 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.070
 icopor hotelga by and I'm going to leave in 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.720
 half this I am working with the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.670
 sphere number 2 because it is a little bottle 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.110
 of compote but if you go to 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.679
 use a larger bottle or more 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.020
 small should look how big you want 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.670
 let it be the little ball I'm going to this 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.520
 I will use to 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.850
 the cheeks 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.119
 from my dad noel then I'm going to look at what 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.370
 So big, I wish I stayed, I go 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.530
 to work on this side that is where I 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.430
 stay 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.040
 the Union 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.040
 and I'm going to come and I'm going to hit here 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.290
 these two little balls at this moment already 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.030
 I have two cheeks let's say that in 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:33.959
 the post I'm going to take a piece of foami 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.560
 skin color and I'll place it on the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.390
 iron we will place the vial with 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.290
 the balls up so that they do not 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.670
 come to us and when we have the foam and 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.010
 pretty hot 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.989
 we will come 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.989
 to thermos form in this way 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.210
 and we are going to cut it in shape 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.680
 round 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.680
 giving it the shape of the face 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.450
 and now then we come and stick it 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.390
 having my face stuck I'm going to take 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.970
 a pastel chalk that we got in 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.970
 any stationery and I will come here 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.980
 and I'm going to blur it now with blush 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.819
 same as I use to make up 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.819
 I'm going to blush 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.239
 the caches 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.970
 having already this we are going to start with what 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.569
 that would be the decoration of the lid we are going to 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.710
 cut 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:59.100
 a triangle like that 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:03.200
 have the round sides these 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.200
 lateral and that here 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:12.900
 the length of here is just 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.900
 the turn in the lid of the jar that 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.750
 we have chosen if they have a machine 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.109
 then we can know it by hand 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.090
 machine and if not then we can sew it 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.090
 then by hand 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.270
 let's join the sides redonditos one 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.010
 with the other 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.150
 having already known the cap we're going 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.150
 then to turn it around 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.940
 and with silicone I'm going to come and I'm going to 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.940
 paste here to the top 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.630
 I have it stuck to the lid now that 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.840
 I'm going to do I've cut a strip of cloth 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.790
 shepherds of the stuffed animal and I'm going to paste 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.790
 here in the outline 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.930
 we have this same fabric that I place 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.580
 here on the edge I took a circle now 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.050
 what I'm going to do with this circle is 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.050
 I'm going to apply glue here 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:21.510
 and I'm going to do it with the same glue 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:24.080
 A) Yes 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.620
 so that I stay 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.270
 like a pompom that later I go to 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.510
 come and I'm going to hit him here 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.540
 we have what would be the hat 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.000
 let's now paint his eyes 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.710
 others can paint the way 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.300
 you want me I'm just going to 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.380
 make him 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.990
 some ovals 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:54.160
 I have black 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.860
 a circle of rosadito fabric like skin of 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:01.030
 peach and I will also make a pompom 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.400
 just as I did with the hat and 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:09.060
 I will place on the nose with silicone 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.060
 every time we're going to hit his nose 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:20.389
 now for the beard I buy 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:23.630
 this cord that I get it where 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:26.760
 they sell buttons and that kind of thing like 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:30.500
 beard cord 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.650
 to this cord what you have to do 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.480
 is to find him an hour and alarm and 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.180
 a cord begins to come out so that 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.570
 I ask that is what I use for the 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.570
 beard 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:47.240
 after having the cord I'm going to 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:51.240
 fold in several parts and with silicone 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.759
 I start to paste it from here, giving it this way 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.340
 the return for the cachetitos below 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:59.490
 from the nose until to the other side 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:04.510
 having already stuck his beard then 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:09.980
 that's how our little bottle looks 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:12.580
 decorated for Santa Claus and here 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.659
 the lid is left 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.659
 easy to put 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:22.850
 and so is our little doll 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.090
 well my friends once again I hope that
