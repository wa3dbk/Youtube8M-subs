00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
hey this is now too fast here and in

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.210 
hey this is now too fast here and in
this<00:00:12.540> video<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:13.170> will<00:00:13.230> talk<00:00:13.590> about<00:00:13.620> using

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
this video I will talk about using

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.360 
this video I will talk about using
different<00:00:14.640> type<00:00:15.300> of<00:00:15.560> lubricants<00:00:16.560> or<00:00:16.860> grease

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:17.370 
different type of lubricants or grease

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.210 
different type of lubricants or grease
when<00:00:18.240> you're<00:00:18.510> doing<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.960> brake<00:00:19.230> job<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.770> replace

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
when you're doing a brake job to replace

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.150 
when you're doing a brake job to replace
brake<00:00:20.610> pads<00:00:20.850> let's<00:00:21.150> say<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:22.039> when<00:00:23.039> you're

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
brake pads let's say and when you're

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.700 
brake pads let's say and when you're
replacing<00:00:24.060> brake<00:00:24.210> pads<00:00:24.480> typically<00:00:24.990> there's

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
replacing brake pads typically there's

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.640 
replacing brake pads typically there's
going<00:00:25.860> to<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.330> slide<00:00:27.330> pin<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:28.350> you'll<00:00:28.500> have

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
going to be a slide pin that you'll have

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.760 
going to be a slide pin that you'll have
to<00:00:28.770> remove<00:00:29.100> to<00:00:29.550> remove<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.940> caliper<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.770> on

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
to remove to remove the caliper and on

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.930 
to remove to remove the caliper and on
my<00:00:32.160> Nissan<00:00:32.609> arm<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.749> of<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.409> bolts<00:00:34.769> or<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
my Nissan arm one of the bolts or the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.770 
my Nissan arm one of the bolts or the
slide<00:00:36.210> pin<00:00:36.480> actually<00:00:37.260> has<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.499> rubber<00:00:38.780> bushing

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
slide pin actually has a rubber bushing

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.270 
slide pin actually has a rubber bushing
at<00:00:40.199> the<00:00:40.409> end<00:00:41.420> okay<00:00:42.449> so<00:00:43.140> there's<00:00:43.289> only<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.710> per

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
at the end okay so there's only one per

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.779 
at the end okay so there's only one per
side<00:00:44.749> but<00:00:45.800> many<00:00:46.800> years<00:00:47.100> ago<00:00:47.219> when<00:00:47.609> I<00:00:47.639> started

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
side but many years ago when I started

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.119 
side but many years ago when I started
doing<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.659> the<00:00:48.780> brake<00:00:48.960> job<00:00:49.199> on<00:00:49.409> my<00:00:49.829> Nissan

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
doing with the brake job on my Nissan

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.680 
doing with the brake job on my Nissan
Quest<00:00:50.339> I<00:00:51.329> was<00:00:51.960> using<00:00:52.339> this<00:00:53.339> type<00:00:53.609> of<00:00:53.819> synthetic

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
Quest I was using this type of synthetic

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.869 
Quest I was using this type of synthetic
grease<00:00:57.319> now<00:00:58.319> let<00:00:58.589> me<00:00:58.649> open<00:00:58.679> this<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.850> you

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
grease now let me open this up so you

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.539 
grease now let me open this up so you
can<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.239> what<00:01:00.389> it<00:01:00.479> looks<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.280> can

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:02.549 
can see what it looks like and you can

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.649 
can see what it looks like and you can
find<00:01:02.819> these<00:01:03.110> very<00:01:04.110> common<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:05.240> auto<00:01:06.240> stores

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
find these very common in auto stores

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.029 
find these very common in auto stores
and<00:01:08.360> basically<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.869> works<00:01:09.990> very<00:01:10.439> well<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
and basically it works very well it

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.590 
and basically it works very well it
works<00:01:11.689> as<00:01:12.689> far<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.729> quieting<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> brakes<00:01:15.210> if

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
works as far as quieting the brakes if

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.709 
works as far as quieting the brakes if
you<00:01:15.719> have<00:01:15.840> any<00:01:15.990> brakes<00:01:16.590> brake<00:01:17.100> noise<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.719> also

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
you have any brakes brake noise and also

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.020 
you have any brakes brake noise and also
it<00:01:18.899> lubricates<00:01:19.469> all<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:19.770> parts<00:01:20.100> there's<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it lubricates all the parts there's a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.609 
it lubricates all the parts there's a
diagram<00:01:21.329> here<00:01:21.750> showing<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.109> all<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
diagram here showing you all the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.609 
diagram here showing you all the
components<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:24.359> will<00:01:24.539> work<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.530> I

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
components that this will work for and I

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.950 
components that this will work for and I
still<00:01:25.829> use<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.159> however<00:01:27.030> when<00:01:27.329> I<00:01:27.359> apply<00:01:27.899> this

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
still use this however when I apply this

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.300 
still use this however when I apply this
stuff<00:01:28.500> onto<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.990> slide<00:01:30.990> pin<00:01:32.750> that<00:01:33.750> part<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
stuff onto the slide pin that part and I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.580 
stuff onto the slide pin that part and I
coat<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.420> end<00:01:36.719> after<00:01:37.560> X<00:01:38.490> number<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.090> years

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
coat this end after X number of years

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.469 
coat this end after X number of years
the<00:01:41.060> bushing<00:01:42.060> at<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.299> end<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:44.479> this

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the bushing at the end and I have this

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.050 
the bushing at the end and I have this
is<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> new<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.079> actually<00:01:46.499> did<00:01:47.429> the<00:01:47.579> bushing

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
is a new one actually did the bushing

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.770 
is a new one actually did the bushing
actually<00:01:48.630> started<00:01:49.109> swelling<00:01:49.679> and<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:51.509> got<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
actually started swelling and it got to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.800 
actually started swelling and it got to
a<00:01:51.810> point<00:01:51.869> where<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.939> was<00:01:53.939> able<00:01:53.969> to<00:01:54.210> remove<00:01:54.659> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
a point where I was able to remove it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.149 
a point where I was able to remove it
but<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.979> could<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:57.469> the<00:01:58.469> bolt<00:01:58.770> or<00:01:59.039> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
but I could not get the bolt or the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.609 
but I could not get the bolt or the
slide<00:01:59.429> pin<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.999> slide<00:02:00.210> back<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.840> that's

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
slide pin to slide back in and that's

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.980 
slide pin to slide back in and that's
because<00:02:02.149> there's<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.210> lot<00:02:03.359> of<00:02:03.390> grease<00:02:03.749> out

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
because there's a lot of grease out

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.469 
because there's a lot of grease out
there<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.530> brake<00:02:04.740> grease<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.280> use<00:02:05.490> that

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
there the brake grease that you use that

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.990 
there the brake grease that you use that
that<00:02:06.960> will<00:02:07.140> swell<00:02:07.619> swell<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.760> rubber<00:02:08.970> and

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
that will swell swell up that rubber and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.480 
that will swell swell up that rubber and
I<00:02:11.030> took<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.360> picture<00:02:11.600> of<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.530> bushing<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:15.490> was

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
I took a picture of the bushing that was

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.540 
I took a picture of the bushing that was
on<00:02:16.640> my<00:02:16.760> vehicle<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.770> as<00:02:18.770> you<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:18.980> see<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
on my vehicle and as you can see the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.140 
on my vehicle and as you can see the
bottom<00:02:20.000> one<00:02:20.030> here<00:02:20.510> is<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:22.310> one<00:02:22.520> that<00:02:22.730> was

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
bottom one here is the one that was

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.300 
bottom one here is the one that was
swollen<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.110> one<00:02:24.290> on<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.830> top<00:02:25.070> is

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
swollen and the one on the top is

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.540 
swollen and the one on the top is
actually<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.060> new<00:02:26.540> one<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.710> got<00:02:27.920> as<00:02:28.160> a

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
actually the new one that I got as a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.600 
actually the new one that I got as a
replacement<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:30.430> both<00:02:31.430> diameter<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.390> length

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
replacement and both diameter and length

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.010 
replacement and both diameter and length
increased<00:02:34.610> quite<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.820> bit<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.540> point<00:02:35.840> where

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
increased quite a bit to a point where

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.090 
increased quite a bit to a point where
the<00:02:36.230> slider<00:02:37.130> pin<00:02:37.460> would<00:02:37.610> not<00:02:38.650> slide<00:02:39.650> back<00:02:39.860> in

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
the slider pin would not slide back in

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.120 
the slider pin would not slide back in
and<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:41.840> couldn't<00:02:42.080> even<00:02:42.200> complete<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.620> brick

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
and I couldn't even complete the brick

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.830 
and I couldn't even complete the brick
job<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:45.040> did<00:02:46.040> some<00:02:46.130> research<00:02:46.490> and<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:47.630> found

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
job so I did some research and I found

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.800 
job so I did some research and I found
out<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:49.730> really<00:02:49.790> not<00:02:50.240> recommended<00:02:50.420> to

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
out that is really not recommended to

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.080 
out that is really not recommended to
use<00:02:51.050> these<00:02:51.230> type<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.440> grease<00:02:51.680> on<00:02:51.950> any<00:02:52.670> type<00:02:52.940> of

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
use these type of grease on any type of

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.460 
use these type of grease on any type of
rubber<00:02:53.240> parts<00:02:53.600> so<00:02:54.400> sometimes<00:02:55.400> you'll<00:02:55.790> see<00:02:56.470> at

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
rubber parts so sometimes you'll see at

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.830 
rubber parts so sometimes you'll see at
the<00:02:57.530> end<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.010> slide<00:02:58.280> pin<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:59.660> got

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
the end of the slide pin you got

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.400 
the end of the slide pin you got
bushings<00:03:00.620> like<00:03:00.770> this<00:03:02.140> or<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.380> type<00:03:03.680> and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
bushings like this or this type and

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.750 
bushings like this or this type and
these<00:03:06.410> ones<00:03:06.830> can<00:03:07.100> come<00:03:07.310> from<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.580> company

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
these ones can come from a company

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.570 
these ones can come from a company
called<00:03:07.880> Carson<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.950> there's<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.010> hardware<00:03:10.250> kit

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
called Carson and there's a hardware kit

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.660 
called Carson and there's a hardware kit
that<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.060> buy<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:12.410> replace<00:03:12.770> any<00:03:14.170> components

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
that you buy to replace any components

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.800 
that you buy to replace any components
on<00:03:16.670> your<00:03:16.700> brake<00:03:17.030> now<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:19.280> proper<00:03:19.820> grease<00:03:20.600> to

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
on your brake now the proper grease to

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.710 
on your brake now the proper grease to
use<00:03:21.050> on<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.830> slide<00:03:22.070> pin<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.690> anything<00:03:23.690> that

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
use on the slide pin and anything that

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.880 
use on the slide pin and anything that
has<00:03:23.959> rubber<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:25.570> civil<00:03:26.570> I'd<00:03:26.739> okay

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
has rubber is civil I'd okay

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.150 
has rubber is civil I'd okay
and<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:29.239> glide<00:03:29.570> it's<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:31.750> lubricant<00:03:32.920> for<00:03:33.920> brake

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
and so glide it's a lubricant for brake

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.810 
and so glide it's a lubricant for brake
parts<00:03:34.900> but<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:36.260> does<00:03:36.500> not<00:03:36.709> have<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.280> effect<00:03:37.670> of

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
parts but it does not have the effect of

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.650 
parts but it does not have the effect of
this<00:03:38.630> other<00:03:38.840> one<00:03:39.080> here<00:03:39.230> where<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.830> will<00:03:39.980> cause

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
this other one here where it will cause

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.600 
this other one here where it will cause
the<00:03:42.430> rubber<00:03:43.430> bushings<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:43.970> swell<00:03:44.650> so<00:03:45.650> there's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
the rubber bushings to swell so there's

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.580 
the rubber bushings to swell so there's
other<00:03:46.790> companies<00:03:47.030> that<00:03:47.239> make<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.690> locally<00:03:48.560> I

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
other companies that make it locally I

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.030 
other companies that make it locally I
can<00:03:48.860> only<00:03:49.550> find<00:03:49.880> Napa<00:03:50.269> that<00:03:50.480> can<00:03:51.440> buy<00:03:51.590> from<00:03:51.920> a

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
can only find Napa that can buy from a

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.460 
can only find Napa that can buy from a
store<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.519> think<00:03:53.180> another<00:03:53.420> company<00:03:53.780> called<00:03:53.959> HGS

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
store I think another company called HGS

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.270 
store I think another company called HGS
HGS<00:03:55.340> also<00:03:55.700> sell<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.959> same<00:03:57.170> thing<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:57.950> Glide

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
HGS also sell the same thing so Glide

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.780 
HGS also sell the same thing so Glide
actually<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:58.850> think<00:03:58.940> this<00:03:59.150> is<00:03:59.269> made<00:03:59.450> by<00:03:59.480> HTS<00:04:00.790> 3m

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
actually I think this is made by HTS 3m

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.750 
actually I think this is made by HTS 3m
also<00:04:02.150> has<00:04:02.330> a<00:04:02.360> silicone<00:04:03.110> paste<00:04:03.410> that<00:04:04.400> they<00:04:04.550> sell

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
also has a silicone paste that they sell

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.060 
also has a silicone paste that they sell
for<00:04:04.910> brakes<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:06.380> cost<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.620> lot<00:04:06.739> more<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.010> think

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
for brakes it cost a lot more I think

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.030 
for brakes it cost a lot more I think
that<00:04:07.400> one<00:04:07.760> is<00:04:07.850> about<00:04:07.970> $20<00:04:08.930> each<00:04:09.110> this<00:04:09.530> one<00:04:09.800> and

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
that one is about $20 each this one and

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.009 
that one is about $20 each this one and
Knapp<00:04:10.250> I<00:04:10.459> believe<00:04:10.850> was<00:04:11.030> around<00:04:11.300> five<00:04:11.570> five

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
Knapp I believe was around five five

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.670 
Knapp I believe was around five five
dollars<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:13.930> let<00:04:14.930> me<00:04:15.019> quickly<00:04:15.140> show<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.530> what

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
dollars so let me quickly show you what

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.820 
dollars so let me quickly show you what
this<00:04:15.950> looked<00:04:16.190> like<00:04:16.280> here<00:04:17.709> squeeze<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:18.739> little

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
this looked like here squeeze a little

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.910 
this looked like here squeeze a little
bit<00:04:18.979> out

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
bit out

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:29.230 
bit out
so<00:04:21.920> this<00:04:22.250> is<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.760> SIL<00:04:23.120> glide<00:04:24.490> okay<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:28.240> after

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
so this is the SIL glide okay and after

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.040 
so this is the SIL glide okay and after
switching<00:04:30.280> from<00:04:31.280> this<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:32.180> this<00:04:32.450> on<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.810> slide

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
switching from this to this on the slide

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.100 
switching from this to this on the slide
pin<00:04:33.380> I've<00:04:34.160> had<00:04:34.370> no<00:04:34.520> issues<00:04:34.930> where<00:04:35.930> the

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
pin I've had no issues where the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.720 
pin I've had no issues where the
bushings<00:04:37.060> swelled<00:04:38.060> up<00:04:38.500> so<00:04:39.500> anyways<00:04:40.190> I<00:04:40.370> want<00:04:40.610> to

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
bushings swelled up so anyways I want to

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.690 
bushings swelled up so anyways I want to
just<00:04:41.360> quickly<00:04:41.720> go<00:04:41.900> over<00:04:42.860> this<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.490> show<00:04:43.640> you
