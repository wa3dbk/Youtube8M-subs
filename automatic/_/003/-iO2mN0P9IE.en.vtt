00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.540
 it's facing the new champion of France 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.040
 of league 2 metz that laval at home 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.110
 must get his hold 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.510
 a win and the tangos would be sure to 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.460
 stay in league 2 a pressure match 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.529
 that we will have to play without three 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.320
 Injured owners couturier karim 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.489
 coulibaly and baby a victory over the 5 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.560
 last matches only for 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.380
 Laval and it will be necessary to realize 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.759
 what can look like an exploit the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.920
 doctors on their side do not want to 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.460
 end their great season with a 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.630
 defeat 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 they are deprived of many players 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.940
 marshall keshi good johan spell to mylan or 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.950
 still teixeira but what's left over 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.020
 two consecutive wins and no goals 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.970
 cashed the task looks arduous for 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 the Lavalers all the more than put a 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.650
 a golden opportunity to open the scoring 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.810
 the beginning of the match 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.910
 diafra sakho on a first occasion and 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.370
 it is the post that saves the Laval residents 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.960
 1 diafra sakho who is looking for the title of 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.390
 top scorer and needs a lot 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.880
 marked in this meeting for that the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.140
 Laval reaction is interesting and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.180
 this attack is a bit too much 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.180
 scramble to produce a result 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.399
 a match under extreme tension at the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.579
 half-time we stay at 0 to 0 and laval does not 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.880
 must it's 25 to a favorable outcome 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.020
 from another team 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.310
 so you have to mark during the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.649
 second period to be truly 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.950
 quiet and not to see her maintaining 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.270
 that to oneself 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.030
 it starts well with this strike 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.500
 amazing saved by thomas didillon who 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.049
 holds for once this season 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.829
 instead of johann carrasso who is 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.939
 on the bench the Laval corner with this 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.500
 balloon at the far post for a 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.030
 discount 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.039
 it's still saved with gloves 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.259
 laval who are pushing to score that goal 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.020
 who would change everything is always on the 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.640
 threatens to cash in one from 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.649
 my tits playing the game a little bit 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.090
 quieter 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.519
 the end of the match approaches balloon 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.280
 contrÃ© excellent opportunity for them 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.959
 Laval but it's still the 2nd column 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.340
 pole in this match and after that of 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.500
 put in first period here is a 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.959
 for Laval and Laval who do not 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.829
 fail to score but who are going 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.459
 make it out 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:26.139
 0 0 in the end but the waltz maintained in 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.940
 league 2 in favor of the defeat of 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.579
 chateauroux on the ground of brest 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.620
 laval finishes this championship at the ten 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.730
 seventh place and is the first team 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.920
 non-relegation 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.510
 but that's of course so is champion and 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.510
 playing next season in league 1
