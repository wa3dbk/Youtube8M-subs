coachbuilt
concept<00:01:54.230> rather<00:01:54.410> than<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:55.270> Roma<00:01:56.270> home<00:01:56.590> we

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590

layout and you know I think fitting the
shower<00:02:04.040> inside<00:02:04.780> or<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.840> toilets<00:02:06.470> I<00:02:06.620> should

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
shower inside or the toilets I should

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.990 
shower inside or the toilets I should
say<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:08.810> actually<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:10.100> know<00:02:10.220> quite<00:02:10.520> good<00:02:10.790> in

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
say is actually you know quite good in

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.110
