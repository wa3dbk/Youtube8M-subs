00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
 My name is Evgeniy Green This video 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.700
 castes on how to improve your life 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.139
 interesting you wondered ever over 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.910
 this question I have a very long time 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:18.740
 I thought and I know the solution in what 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.480
 there are problems that you 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.539
 constantly come across here think 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.000
 which is cardinally qualitatively serious 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.400
 changed in your life for the last 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.059
 year is there something really 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.680
 such weighty significant significant to 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.380
 Unfortunately, most 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.329
 there is no such thing to boast 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.550
 can not 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.070
 so think right now what u 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.350
 spheres of your life are lagging behind and they are required 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.860
 pull up now we won't take much 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.160
 spheres 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.440
 take at least three major directions 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:58.199
 is your health your income and yours 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.149
 women's attitude ie questions 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.449
 seducing building relationships 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.979
 these three important aspects that each 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.020
 friend very cool complement and 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.490
 organize the center such a good picture 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.630
 of life 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.670
 it is clear that there may be some more 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.799
 directions but at least in these three 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.930
 directions need something to improve in 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.850
 your health 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.509
 do you need to rebuild yours somehow 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:34.619
 relationship women and whether to close 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:36.869
 time to increase your income at all 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.740
 the question is how to keep up more 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.759
 do yes because when you do 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.280
 in general every day all the time something 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.310
 doing that 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.580
 very many cases and household and 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.450
 the work and affairs of other people around 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.220
 which are there but yes 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.600
 the next problem is how to create exactly 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.460
 quality improvement in my life i 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 I recommend you to do this all 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:10.160
 break into four major categories by 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.220
 urgency and importance will be urgent and 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.390
 unimportant and non-urgent will not be important 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.200
 non-urgent important and urgent important four 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.790
 Such large blocks urgent are not important this 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.769
 standard daily routine 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.920
 who do you do for example there 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.360
 to wash the dishes to clean up something to wash 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.340
 its above where it is 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.290
 standard routine tasks like this 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.030
 take out the trash drastically from them 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.459
 essentially nothing changes that is 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.080
 if you forgot today to do well in 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.200
 principle, this will not be any better 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.200
 worse 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.720
 for example, urgent and important matters are 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.690
 such when someone needs urgently 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.030
 call do something before some 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.000
 time today then something is something 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.510
 immediately immediately decide what 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.400
 really burns went non-urgent 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.530
 unimportant well such cases can be attributed 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.110
 just read jokes on the internet 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.970
 watch video on youtube climb 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.220
 just so social networks yes that is 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.950
 watch some movie this body 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.820
 just not urgent and not important when 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.549
 part of your time 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.120
 also directed to these matters 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:21.260
 the next 4 is very interesting and useful 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.850
 categories of non-urgent but important matters 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.299
 there are those that you basically can 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.370
 today do not but they are weighty 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.459
 value in your life they will create 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.799
 major changes in life for example 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.980
 This is the solution to the question of how to increase your 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.450
 income or how there learn to seduce 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.269
 girls understand that if you are today 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.590
 you will not die from this 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.920
 for this very reason you can 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.200
 delay the solution of this question but if 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.410
 you will spend some of your time on 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.840
 the solution of these problems will then go 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.660
 changes and improvements in my life everything 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.410
 other squares yes here these here 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.350
 places 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.570
 what time is highlighted in black they 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.480
 do not improve your life and they 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.110
 support or wasted squander 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.770
 your time 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.440
 and here category non-urgent but important and this 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.600
 cases that are aimed at the future 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.000
 on development on changing your various 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.070
 directions for you to be later 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.800
 got some time 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.280
 Essentially new results that you 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.280
 want to
