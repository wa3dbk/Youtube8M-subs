Jalil pinner and some walk-ons yeah but

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.120 
Jalil pinner and some walk-ons yeah but
I<00:02:27.600> think<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.110> good<00:02:28.140> news<00:02:28.350> there<00:02:28.710> is<00:02:28.860> it's

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
I think the good news there is it's

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.580 
I think the good news there is it's
given<00:02:29.400> Julia<00:02:29.700> pen<00:02:29.940> or<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> lot<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.720> lot<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.260> reps

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
given Julia pen or a lot of lot of reps

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.830 
given Julia pen or a lot of lot of reps
and<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.980> lot<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.190> chance<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.670> become<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.600> big

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
and a lot of chance to become that big

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.650 
and a lot of chance to become that big
back<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.380> i<00:02:34.770> think<00:02:35.010> that's<00:02:35.330> that's<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.510> big

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
back and i think that's that's a big

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.200 
back and i think that's that's a big
deal<00:02:36.840> actually<00:02:37.410> for<00:02:37.680> him<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.950> be<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.250> big<00:02:38.460> to

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
deal actually for him to be the big to

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.360 
deal actually for him to be the big to
be<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.450> big<00:02:39.600> back<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.500> getting<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.190> lot<00:02:41.340> of

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
one last thing we got to see I think

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.360 
one last thing we got to see I think
that<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.320> foot<00:03:10.500> middle<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:10.830> defensive<00:03:11.220> line

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
that the foot middle of defensive line

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.800 
that the foot middle of defensive line
might<00:03:11.580> have<00:03:11.700> been<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.820> little<00:03:12.000> thin<00:03:12.360> we<00:03:12.600> saw<00:03:12.780> a
