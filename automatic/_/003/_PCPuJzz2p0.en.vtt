know this is a good effort to get the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.350 
know this is a good effort to get the
trains<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.400> closet<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.240> are

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
trains out of the closet that there are

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.870 
trains out of the closet that there are
millions<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> buried<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.590> there<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.310> think

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
millions of buried out there and I think

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.030 
millions of buried out there and I think
everybody<00:01:30.270> should<00:01:30.329> take<00:01:31.110> an<00:01:31.259> active<00:01:31.619> part<00:01:31.650> in

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
