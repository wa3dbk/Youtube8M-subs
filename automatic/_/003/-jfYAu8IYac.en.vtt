00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
greater reverence which is really a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.270 
greater reverence which is really a
ripoff<00:02:48.010> yeah<00:02:50.160> don't<00:02:51.160> suggest<00:02:51.520> that<00:02:52.000> i<00:02:53.280> don't

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280

know<00:02:54.310> i<00:02:54.490> mean<00:02:54.640> it's<00:02:54.820> better<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.360> i<00:02:56.100> think

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
know i mean it's better but i think

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.960 
know i mean it's better but i think
something<00:02:57.280> that<00:02:57.430> would<00:02:57.610> be<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.700> lot<00:02:57.940> better

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
something that would be a lot better

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.490 
something that would be a lot better
than<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.540> would<00:02:58.750> be<00:02:58.840> using<00:02:59.140> something<00:02:59.350> like

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
than that would be using something like

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.480 
than that would be using something like
the<00:02:59.740> vampirism<00:03:00.190> or<00:03:01.260> when<00:03:02.260> tennis<00:03:02.860> tennis<00:03:03.160> was

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
the vampirism or when tennis tennis was

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.000 
the vampirism or when tennis tennis was

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
why you really bring money into the

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.850 
why you really bring money into the
wilderness<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:01.180> whole<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:02.110> if<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:02.739> were<00:04:02.830> to

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
wilderness the whole and if you were to

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.259 
wilderness the whole and if you were to
die<00:04:03.070> with<00:04:03.250> money<00:04:03.489> before<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.830> still<00:04:05.830> keep<00:04:06.040> it

so<00:04:07.470> that's<00:04:08.470> cool<00:04:08.739> but<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:10.090> main<00:04:10.269> reason<00:04:10.300> i

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
so that's cool but the main reason i

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.900 
so that's cool but the main reason i
think<00:04:11.170> this<00:04:11.260> update<00:04:11.650> is<00:04:11.680> significant<00:04:12.459> is<00:04:12.610> the

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
think this update is significant is the

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.580 
think this update is significant is the
fact<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:13.209> it's<00:04:13.390> going<00:04:13.510> to<00:04:13.570> be<00:04:13.690> saving<00:04:14.170> more

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
fact that it's going to be saving more

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.039 
fact that it's going to be saving more
inventory<00:04:14.980> space<00:04:15.489> so<00:04:16.299> like<00:04:16.480> let's<00:04:16.690> say<00:04:16.750> fruit

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
inventory space so like let's say fruit

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.590 
inventory space so like let's say fruit
of<00:04:17.140> abandon<00:04:17.709> sand<00:04:18.100> she<00:04:19.090> didn't<00:04:19.269> really<00:04:19.359> feel

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
of abandon sand she didn't really feel

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.830 
of abandon sand she didn't really feel
like<00:04:19.660> looting<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.440> coins<00:04:21.300> really<00:04:22.300> there's<00:04:22.510> no

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
like looting the coins really there's no

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.910 
like looting the coins really there's no
reason<00:04:23.260> not<00:04:23.410> to

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
reason not to

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.700 
reason not to
