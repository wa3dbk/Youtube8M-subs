 farmer right away 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:56.600
 van duijnen is not the best friend in the 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 Problems Kramer picks up alcohol here 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.550
 mountain base

 he lays a front room is for ado 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.149
 the hague and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.160

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.390
 game 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.460
 they are still fighting against 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.620
 relegation currently occupy the 14th 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.060
 place in the premier league Ajax is on the 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.980
 second place and that seems the highest 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.660
 feasible and by winning ado can 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.770
 ajax strengthen that place 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.420
 The last time this game was 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.800

 April 2014 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.400
 ajax could become the champion that day 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.260
 although the team had to go around 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.870
 championship will be postponed 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.420
 feyenoord won against psv and so had Ajax 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.460
 just be patient 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.549

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.250

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.560
 ajax once and that was calculated 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.560
 against ado 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.900
 on top of between politics and not only 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.959

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.040
 engine 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.049
 hot 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.670
 the last time ajax walked home 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.370
 after the low was in 2010 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.430

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.920
 never hedge with more than one 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.690
 goal difference from Ajax in Amsterdam 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.459
