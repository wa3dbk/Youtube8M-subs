staring at my hand for a while and and

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.800 
staring at my hand for a while and and
you're<00:01:17.950> just<00:01:18.100> staring<00:01:18.549> at<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.240> tips<00:01:19.539> of<00:01:19.689> the

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
you're just staring at the tips of the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.459 
you're just staring at the tips of the
fingers<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.649> then<00:01:21.459> you<00:01:21.850> move<00:01:22.840> your<00:01:22.869> glance

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 
fingers and then you move your glance

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:27.120 
fingers and then you move your glance
away<00:01:23.770> slightly<00:01:24.429> and<00:01:24.939> back<00:01:25.929> to<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.740> fingers

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
away slightly and back to the fingers

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.489 
away slightly and back to the fingers
and<00:01:27.340> you'll<00:01:27.459> notice<00:01:27.909> that<00:01:28.060> they<00:01:28.240> change<00:01:28.630> but

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499 
and you'll notice that they change but

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.559 
and you'll notice that they change but
the<00:01:29.619> idea<00:01:29.979> is<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.130> you<00:01:30.429> need<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.850> be<00:01:31.389> looking

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
the idea is that you need to be looking

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:33.899 
the idea is that you need to be looking
long<00:01:31.990> enough<00:01:32.289> until<00:01:32.529> you're<00:01:33.069> just<00:01:33.219> about<00:01:33.639> your

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
long enough until you're just about your

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.019 
long enough until you're just about your
eyes<00:01:34.029> are<00:01:34.240> just<00:01:34.270> about<00:01:34.779> going<00:01:35.109> to<00:01:35.380> tear<00:01:36.159> up<00:01:36.369> you

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:37.029 
eyes are just about going to tear up you

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:39.029 
eyes are just about going to tear up you
look<00:01:37.240> away<00:01:37.539> slightly<00:01:37.899> take<00:01:38.619> your<00:01:38.799> gaze<00:01:39.009> away

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
look away slightly take your gaze away

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.249 
look away slightly take your gaze away
and<00:01:39.639> come<00:01:39.819> straight<00:01:40.179> back<00:01:40.209> you'll<00:01:40.719> notice<00:01:41.109> a

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
and come straight back you'll notice a

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.709 
and come straight back you'll notice a
