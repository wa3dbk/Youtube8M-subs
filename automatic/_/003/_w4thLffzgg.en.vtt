00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 The staff, my name is Celso, just listened. 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.919
 particular direction 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.389
 my phone 96 64 8 444 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.910
 I'm here to post a video today 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.610
 to show what to do 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.650
 at the beginning of each class as well as at the time 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.840
 of the exam 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.310
 okay, let's go step by step 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.109
 first when entering the vehicle 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:32.340
 check that the door is closed because 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:35.460
 done that we're gonna step on 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.660
 on the clutch to check the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.879
 distance 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.200
 You have to feel comforted if you have 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.329
 to a lock on the seat just behind the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.010
 feet adjust the seat and check again 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.000
 as well as backrest should also be well 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.180
 positioned 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.170
 each student enjoys a distance in the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.960
 boat here is more convenient 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.309
 done that we will hit the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.549
 mirrors my car to a regulation 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.090
 inside the rearview mirror 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.790
 I need to see a little of my car and the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.220
 street until the end 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.590
 only this correct position within the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.110
 driver 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.070
 then we fixed the side mirror 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.400
 right also to internal adjustment 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.570
 I need to see some of the car and the street with 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.920
 as far as possible ok the rear view 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.450
 you need to adjust 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.310
 placing the rear glass inside the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.700
 rear view mirrors 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.470
 we put the seat belt and the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.110
 pedals again 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.649
 we need the brake first then 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.320
 in the clutch puts the vehicle on point 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.670
 dead 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.670
 done that started the engine 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.320
 it is not necessary to accelerate the vehicle 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:13.300
 only with the foot on the brake the vehicle 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.270
 connected floor again in the clutch 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.610
 I put first gear 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.650
 that light on the red panel indicates the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.520
 parking brake 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:32.750
 so let's go down and tighten it 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:35.510

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.310

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.100
 Baruto watches the rearview mirror and also 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.040
 We need a sponge out of the vehicle to 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.600
 the class - great security can leave 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.390
 at the end of class 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.840
 when stopping the vehicle you are there with the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.280
 foot 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.010
 in this position on the brake and clutch 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.180
 independent of the gait that stops 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.400
 off 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.570
 it is necessary to place the vehicle in a 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.519
 neutral point also the neutral 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:17.140
 release clutch and pull the parking brake 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.140
 no need to press this button 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:25.250
 switch off the engine and then use 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:28.040
 first clutch and putting the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.750
 vehicle is always hit first 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.010
 or the reverse 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.560
 ok ok then this is sequence 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.230
 both to power on and off 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.920
