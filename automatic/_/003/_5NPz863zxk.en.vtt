00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.780
 yes 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.600
 [Music] 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.130
 If carla already started practically 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.930
 most active part of this demonstration 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.930
 four fighters have gone down 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.470
 we are going to take care of ourselves and also another team 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.850
 but is doing coverage work 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.850
 of protection for what 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.890
 what we are seeing then is when 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.270
 have passed these four commands of the 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.210
 aircraft that is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.720
 height of 50 meters approximately 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.720
 windows 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.130
 let's talk briefly with the 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.989
 Lieutenant who does not tell him to explain 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.150
 this part of the exercise are 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.180
 developing at this moment our 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.360
 part consists in releasing some operators 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.479
 specials which will pick up the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.950
 pilot dropped in the simulation 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.229
 and the helicopter the second helicopter 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.729
 is giving you protection is not 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.830
 giving coverage to the aircraft that has 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.670
 left the staff the staff that is 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.500
 there on earth he is in charge of rescuing the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.619
 Fallen pilot does not provide protection 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.509
 to later collect it the aircraft that 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.380
 normally cheered up is not like the drag 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.689
 in when 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.820
 unfortunately this is correct this is 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.509
 the doctrine that is used not in case of 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.549
 happen in the vrae or in a war 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.890
 conventional where one can apply 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.940
 this kind of doctrine that is with which 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.860
 we work 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.480
 that there are supposedly those who continue 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.040
 attacking people who have come down 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.690
 of paper 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.490
 that's right with that is this 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.560
 second aircraft which gives you 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.510
 coverage to this staff we will 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.840
 we call house chlorine 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.940
 is why is close air support the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.900
 which will fight the staff that this 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.900
 will help 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.510
 and also 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.860
 perform a demonstration of 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.860
 search and rescue 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.849
 at this moment he is describing for 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.910
 the public the growth that was 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.090
 talking with us what is 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.810
 practically the same as the pilot of the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.160
 crew that has fallen after being killed 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.160
 the ship he was traveling 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.450
 so they speak very realistically because 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:23.300
 we see that there are opposing forces that 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.600
 they are still firing at supposedly 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.890
 commands 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.890
 during which it has fallen in 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.170
 the mission of the people who have come down 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.540
 to rappel to have once stay alive 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.000
 to the crewmember because this is the 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.720
 Simulation of a rescue in combat is 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.600
 say that they have enemy forces to 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:55.670
 preventing them forward is 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.770
 this operation we are going to talk with 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.660
 older employees explains what it is that 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.180
 you are doing this right now 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.730
 we are appreciating the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.130
 recovery of a staff in an area 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.400
 isolated is a simulation of a 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.360
 recovery of a downed pilot 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.360
 in a hostile area 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.209
 an attack on search pack and 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.680
 rescue in combat where we can 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.300
 appreciate an aircraft high 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.650
 performance mirage-2000 that is 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.070
 fulfilling a rescue function to 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.620
 umbrella to 1500 feet tall and a 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.410
 1,025 helicopter depending on escort 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.750
 also depending on coverage and the 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.880
 special operations personnel that 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.250
 have recovered the staff there is once 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.650
 recovered this crewman who fell in 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.200
 combat action as they are going to 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.460
 carry is going to return the neurons and is the 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.960
 same aircraft that you can 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.240
 appreciate there that has served for the 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.090
 insertion of combatants in the 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.040
 moved to rappel 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.740
 is going to be the one that will extract the pilot 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.590
 the pilot previously 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.259
 and driving it to the aircraft is done 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.360
 a personal report previously isolated 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.710
 already done within your unit in which 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.569
 the recognition to the 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.250
 authentication of it with photographs 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:14.169
 and keywords and with this traces 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.169
 digital once you are identified 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.389
 for that, it prevents the pilot from being 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.449
 rather recovered by enemies like this 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.370
 is that it happens in such a combat situation 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.650
 Once the pilot can make an enemy 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.509
 disguised then one proceeds 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.479
 authentication without authentication is 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:34.030
 correct the package is successful and everything is 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.440
 proceeds to the withdrawal in real terms 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.050
 this is what is done in nations 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.810
 emergent like this is in case of front 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.639
 external and internal front also in case 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.750
 to have crews staff 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.460
 downed air 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.930
 the special operations force of 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.560
 the air force of Peru are in the 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.630
 ability to recover staff isolated 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.650
 these are the operational capabilities that 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.850
 they have the operations forces 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.860
 specials of the air force but 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.420
 currently units of the officers 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.050
 commands and pilots are put into practice 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.030
 in this exercise 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.949
 and the air means as is a means 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.169
 flexible and versatile has the facility 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:10.400
 to reach any point of the way 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:11.780
 faster so that we as 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.340
 forces special versions of the 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.530
 air force of Peru we are in the 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.360
 ability to perform the recovery of 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.580
 staff also provide the 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.780
 first aid in combat other 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.169
 ability that we have is also the 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.350
 Combat air traffic control is to address 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:29.230
 the combat aircraft for 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.940
 the elimination of threats within a 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.260
 hostile zone 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.260
 thank you very much shame
