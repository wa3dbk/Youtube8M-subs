00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.280
 intense food directly from nature trillion collectors 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.300
 Have you ever wondered if we should all be as general? 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.440
 there would be food for all 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.220
 the population would grow to the point of forming the great modern cities 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.470
 this is the theme of today's biology chart 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.540
 Let's take a trip back in time and follow up on problems in the criminal unit. 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.869
 tension - production 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.240
 distribution 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.220
 food preservation 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.990
 and advances in medicine as and prevention of diseases 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.649
 and note that these two factors 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.170
 has much to do with the growth of the human population on earth 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.920
 To know all this with the mass of penne alla that is starting now 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.780
 if you are an entrepreneur eike batista collages country conjur 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.170

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.910
 following second file could allow any other team but I did not want 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.950
 talk to nobody 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.890

 average enem plus s 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.260
 we humans are different from other animals there are other animals 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.239
 a Bahraini neighbor 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.809
 the rival 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.809
 others the newest album ginga 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.029
 nowadays is marked by balance 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:26.130
 military police officers from around the world 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.209
 it is a habit of reading they still own the house of other animals 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.869
 also weighs against abc 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:36.069
 My dream of your father. 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.719
 my start 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.609
 Luis loved this does not mean that proof and when you 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.569
 that it invests in a unique experience 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.689
 if anyone has a prize money to achieve a millennium 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.209
 only twice in the head 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.149
 no, she will put an end 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:54.639
 I do not know 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.819
 the little face other ways to get food 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.189
 because at this stage there is a complexity of its own beacon 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.219
 by the fair 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:07.849
 in the most serene is the expiration of the contract hand explained the human being 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.359
 get their staple foods in different ways 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.379
 to raise animals for slaughtering fruit and vegetable 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.759
 large scale industrialization of dairy cereals 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.230
 But it was not always so 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.310
 The search for food has made humans during most of their 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.249
 That's how it was in the nose. 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:34.370
 in a distraction from the southern trio points 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.380
 which has not been fixed in the same place for a long time and are always 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.299
 shifting in search of food 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.760
 the Flemish is a team that is cozy king's house 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.809
 if he fed on several animals, only the magazine was arrested 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:52.979
 points in half an hour with food were the cases moving to another 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.869
 place 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:57.289
 hard life of dudu 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:01.709
 was the smallest reading on hunter never knew if he would have enough food 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:05.649
 and also have shelter for 76 thousand 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.179
 the fast predators and spend a lot of time and energy with it 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:15.179
 as meningitis and seagull do until today 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.930
 a man in hunter and real estate broker 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.609
 find the bottom line 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.960
 there came out that many people did not have 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.930
 it's a lot of people 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.930
 wanted to raise children in these conditions 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.400
 the uncertainty of finding food a constant need for displacement 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.900
 difficult for the survival of children to be created 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:44.189
 the offspring of humans depending entirely on adults capable blast 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:48.299
 to get your first contract April then defend yourself 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.600
 after having gained the parents have to be responsible for the feeding 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.129
 in defense of the best 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.889
 in addition earlier this month 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.889
 alien crisis lasts for many years 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:08.979
 and food needs are also higher in children than in 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.009
 adults 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.510
 proportionally 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.500
 organisms need a larger amount of protein 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.690
 than that of adults 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.690
 because they are in the growth phase 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.330
 You have to find food. 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.979
 you may find April addiction and fragility of children resulting 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.830
 high infant mortality rate 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.080
 all this we can conclude that during the period of history in which the 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.080
 man was a hunter and collector 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.409
 the population was very small 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.150
 over time the sign of life has changed 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.430
 of one-year trunk collector became a farmer from pt 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.009
 in front of that cited discounted territory to raise animals 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:54.120
 its dependence on the external market has 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.259
 the man can dedicate himself to the construction of shelters but at least 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.810
 fixed housing 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.770
 made social relations more complex 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.340
 the production of instruments and tools such as these 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.050
 on here 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.969
 she agrees to marry the cultivation of the land and the preparation of food 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:18.639
 with greater availability of food and the appearance of new requirements the 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.999
 human beings are to develop other Turkish skills 

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:27.549
 not all did the same tasks while many contacts create manuals 

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:33.210
 let's produce tools look for a messiah was built cassation 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.740
 with this structure the population does not regret 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:42.559
 in the last century even evaluating ccg graphics at the decisive moment of 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:44.419
 population in a short time 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:49.160
 the industrialization and accelerated development of technology have contributed 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.669
 for this expansion 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.050
 with these resources 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.900
 the man may have 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.729
 both formed environment and increase food production now as it is 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.580
 who industrialization and even praises him to modify agriculture 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.899
 increasing production abroad 

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:09.349
 1 as only she who was wrong on the ball these things of the bragantino with marquei 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:10.629
 but I think that's it, right? 

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:12.520
 good night cinderela 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.770
 of medication on duty 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.069
 legalize agriculture 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:18.499
 Hi guys alone 

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:22.089
 increase the autonomy of one dimension 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:28.590
 none of them techniques of irrigation and soil fertilization development 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.610
 of pesticides
