00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.540 
ready it kind of sucks but I do somehow
Garchomp<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.770> he<00:00:50.129> withdraws<00:00:50.520> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
Garchomp here and he withdraws to

Garchomp here and he withdraws to
ninjask<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.420> evade<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.949> earthquake<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.610> that's

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
ninjask to evade my earthquake so that's

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.720 
ninjask to evade my earthquake so that's
kind<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.180> annoying<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:55.160> his<00:00:56.160> berry<00:00:56.370> gives<00:00:56.610> him

baton<00:01:05.909> passes<00:01:06.270> into<00:01:06.510> Garchomp<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:08.119> obviously

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
baton passes into Garchomp and obviously

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.670 
baton passes into Garchomp and obviously
I<00:01:09.299> don't<00:01:09.390> like<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.750> matchup<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.439> switch

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680

into gyarados but unfortunately he
doesn't<00:01:14.310> earthquakey<00:01:14.909> outrages<00:01:15.720> ah<00:01:15.950> that's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
doesn't earthquakey outrages ah that's

switches into yanmega and I hate these
things<00:01:47.909> these<00:01:48.420> things<00:01:48.659> are<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.960> my<00:01:49.140> biggest

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
completely forgot about bug buzz that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.580 
completely forgot about bug buzz that
was<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.649> bad<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.070> my<00:01:59.189> part<00:01:59.219> I<00:02:00.590> was

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
was just really bad on my part I was

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.609 
was just really bad on my part I was
thinking<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.130> he'd<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.430> do<00:02:03.119> something

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
thinking that he'd like do something

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.670 
thinking that he'd like do something
whatever<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> was<00:02:05.880> bad

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
whatever so I was bad

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.180 
whatever so I was bad
and<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.700> guess<00:02:08.940> he<00:02:09.410> either<00:02:10.410> predicts<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and I guess he either predicts the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.710 
and I guess he either predicts the
switch<00:02:11.490> or<00:02:11.850> something<00:02:12.210> else<00:02:12.570> because<00:02:13.440> he<00:02:14.720> used

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
switch or something else because he used

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.980 
switch or something else because he used
bug<00:02:15.960> buzzing<00:02:16.140> Lucario<00:02:16.710> which<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.220> what

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
bug buzzing Lucario which is like what

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.580 
bug buzzing Lucario which is like what
really<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:21.180> I'm<00:02:21.870> thinking<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.470> he's

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
really so I'm thinking that he's

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.470 
really so I'm thinking that he's
probably<00:02:22.740> going<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.040> switch<00:02:23.430> expecting<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
probably going to switch expecting the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.420 
probably going to switch expecting the
extreme<00:02:24.780> speed<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:25.800> go<00:02:25.980> with<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.130> close

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
extreme speed so I go with a close

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.880 
extreme speed so I go with a close
combat<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.180> it's<00:02:27.990> not<00:02:28.200> good<00:02:28.410> for<00:02:28.440> me<00:02:28.740> because

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
combat and it's not good for me because

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.190 
combat and it's not good for me because
um<00:02:30.410> he<00:02:31.410> just<00:02:31.440> goes<00:02:31.920> air<00:02:32.130> /<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:33.600> do<00:02:33.720> take<00:02:34.020> down

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
um he just goes air / and I do take down

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.310 
um he just goes air / and I do take down
yanmega<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.520> that's<00:02:35.790> really<00:02:35.970> bad<00:02:36.209> for<00:02:36.480> me<00:02:36.630> as

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
yanmega but that's really bad for me as

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.300 
yanmega but that's really bad for me as
you<00:02:37.380> might<00:02:37.620> expect<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.200> um<00:02:40.440> he's<00:02:40.980> witches<00:02:41.220> in

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
you might expect so um he's witches in

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.180 
you might expect so um he's witches in
the<00:02:41.400> stupid<00:02:41.730> yellow<00:02:41.940> rat<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:44.010> just

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
the stupid yellow rat and I just

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.680 
the stupid yellow rat and I just
experienced<00:02:44.550> me<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.730> death<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.120> mean<00:02:45.239> stats<00:02:45.540> are

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
experienced me to death I mean stats are

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.220 
experienced me to death I mean stats are
visible<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.320> think<00:02:46.560> it's<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.739> static<00:02:47.220> x<00:02:47.459> that's

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
visible I think it's the static x that's

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.100 
visible I think it's the static x that's
pretty<00:02:49.230> annoying<00:02:50.330> because<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.750> know<00:02:51.840> now<00:02:52.080> I

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
pretty annoying because you know now I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.440 
pretty annoying because you know now I
don't<00:02:52.920> out<00:02:53.100> speed<00:02:53.370> pretty<00:02:53.730> much<00:02:53.820> anything<00:02:54.120> I'm

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
don't out speed pretty much anything I'm

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.210 
don't out speed pretty much anything I'm
much<00:02:54.930> force<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.320> use<00:02:55.440> extreme<00:02:55.650> speed<00:02:56.040> on

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
much force to use extreme speed on

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.490 
much force to use extreme speed on
something<00:02:56.610> next<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:59.450> hidden<00:03:00.450> comes<00:03:00.690> his

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
something next and hidden comes his

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.370 
something next and hidden comes his
Lucario<00:03:03.410> eventually<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:07.080> have<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.290> use

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
Lucario eventually and I have to use

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.229 
Lucario eventually and I have to use
extreme<00:03:07.560> speed<00:03:07.860> illness<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.400> mean<00:03:08.730> I'm<00:03:09.030> hoping

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
extreme speed illness I mean I'm hoping

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.310 
extreme speed illness I mean I'm hoping
he<00:03:09.450> doesn't<00:03:09.570> use<00:03:09.810> extreme<00:03:10.020> speed<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:11.120> and

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
he doesn't use extreme speed to and

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.320 
he doesn't use extreme speed to and
thankfully<00:03:13.320> he<00:03:13.620> doesn't<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.610> get<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.940> crit

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
thankfully he doesn't and I get a crit

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.920 
thankfully he doesn't and I get a crit
on<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.730> both<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.940> cars<00:03:18.150> go<00:03:18.390> down<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:18.900> I

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
on it so both the cars go down so I

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.449 
on it so both the cars go down so I
guess<00:03:19.019> return<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.560> static<00:03:20.010> hacks<00:03:20.220> there<00:03:20.430> i

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
guess return is the static hacks there i

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.729 
guess return is the static hacks there i
guess<00:03:20.700> i<00:03:20.880> don't<00:03:20.940> even<00:03:21.150> know<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:23.280> um<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:24.560> send<00:03:25.560> in

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
guess i don't even know so um I send in

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.850 
guess i don't even know so um I send in
deoxys<00:03:26.489> any<00:03:27.330> switches<00:03:27.570> back<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:28.049> ninjask<00:03:28.530> and

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
deoxys any switches back in ninjask and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.190 
deoxys any switches back in ninjask and
then<00:03:29.820> just<00:03:30.000> goes<00:03:30.180> down<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.660> guess<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.019> wanted

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
then just goes down I guess you wanted

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.320 
then just goes down I guess you wanted
to<00:03:31.290> see<00:03:31.380> what<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.530> switched<00:03:31.799> it<00:03:31.890> in<00:03:31.950> first<00:03:32.330> me

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
to see what I switched it in first me

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.729 
to see what I switched it in first me
since<00:03:33.510> I'm<00:03:33.600> metagross<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.260> obviously<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.650> have

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
since I'm metagross and obviously I have

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.590 
since I'm metagross and obviously I have
to<00:03:34.799> switch<00:03:34.980> here<00:03:35.220> ducks<00:03:35.820> isn't<00:03:36.239> going<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.480> be

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
to switch here ducks isn't going to be

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.170 
to switch here ducks isn't going to be
damaging<00:03:36.989> medic<00:03:37.230> girls<00:03:37.410> anytime<00:03:37.769> soon<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.489> I

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
damaging medic girls anytime soon and I

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.479 
damaging medic girls anytime soon and I
switch<00:03:39.420> into<00:03:39.630> Garchomp<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.440> he<00:03:41.310> bullet

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
switch into Garchomp and he bullet

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.670 
switch into Garchomp and he bullet
punches<00:03:42.110> so<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.140> good<00:03:43.320> thing<00:03:43.440> I<00:03:43.500> switched<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.590> I

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
punches so a good thing I switched and I

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.110 
punches so a good thing I switched and I
have<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:46.980> get<00:03:47.130> rid<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:47.400> metagross<00:03:47.850> and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
have to get rid of this metagross and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.100 
have to get rid of this metagross and
the<00:03:48.180> only<00:03:48.269> thing<00:03:48.360> i<00:03:48.480> can<00:03:48.540> do<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.780> really<00:03:49.049> is

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
the only thing i can do that really is

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.930 
the only thing i can do that really is
earthquake<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.739> kind<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.100> his<00:03:50.280> Garchomp<00:03:50.700> left

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
earthquake I kind of his Garchomp left

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.050 
earthquake I kind of his Garchomp left
and<00:03:51.209> but<00:03:52.200> um<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.799> don't<00:03:53.459> think<00:03:53.579> he<00:03:53.790> really<00:03:54.030> wants

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
and but um I don't think he really wants

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.470 
and but um I don't think he really wants
to<00:03:54.959> switch<00:03:55.200> into<00:03:56.420> him<00:03:58.579> at<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.610> moment<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.239> um

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
to switch into him at the moment so um

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.979 
to switch into him at the moment so um
my<00:04:00.870> Garchomp<00:04:01.620> low<00:04:01.980> HP<00:04:02.310> now<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:06.630> have<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.870> get

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
my Garchomp low HP now and I have to get

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.800 
my Garchomp low HP now and I have to get
rid<00:04:07.049> of<00:04:07.110> this<00:04:07.200> metagross

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.800 

that's<00:04:11.810> what<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:11.959> do<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:14.000> incomes<00:04:14.480> is<00:04:14.780> a

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
that's what I do and incomes is a

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.050 
that's what I do and incomes is a
Garchomp<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.829> I'm<00:04:16.639> like<00:04:16.840> crap<00:04:18.609> he<00:04:19.609> uses

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
Garchomp and I'm like crap he uses

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.750 
Garchomp and I'm like crap he uses
outrage<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:22.630> that<00:04:23.630> kos<00:04:24.080> Garchomp<00:04:24.620> and<00:04:24.800> his<00:04:25.669> is

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
outrage and that kos Garchomp and his is

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.730 
outrage and that kos Garchomp and his is
actually<00:04:25.880> jolly<00:04:26.300> he<00:04:26.540> didn't<00:04:26.780> win<00:04:26.870> his<00:04:26.990> DTI<00:04:27.440> so

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
actually jolly he didn't win his DTI so

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.230 
actually jolly he didn't win his DTI so
he's<00:04:27.860> gonna<00:04:27.979> have<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.220> beat<00:04:28.370> my<00:04:28.490> deoxys<00:04:29.060> too

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
he's gonna have to beat my deoxys too
