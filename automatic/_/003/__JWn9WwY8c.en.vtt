00:00:20.447 --> 00:00:21.914
My name is Nelson Mandela.

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:24.064
Amandla!

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:30.964
You are Winnie Madikizela.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.957
The first black social worker
they've ever had.

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:36.261
And you're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:40.578
I heard you have
a lot of girlfriends.

00:00:41.222 --> 00:00:42.226
I'm different.

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:48.440
This is your final warning!

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.818
They're not breaking any laws.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.243
Something has to change.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.253
For fifty hours we have been talking
peace and nonviolence.

00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:03.104
Not anymore.

00:01:05.927 --> 00:01:09.878
Aluminum powder mixed with an acid catalyzes. And you've got...

00:01:17.948 --> 00:01:20.973
If the Blacks take over,
our country is finished.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.268
What is it that you personally want?

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:26.812
I have beautiful children
and a beautiful wife.

00:01:26.978 --> 00:01:29.147
I want them to walk free
on their own land.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.860
The situation on the streets
is out of control.

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:38.949
Somebody want me.

00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:44.870
The accused are responsible
for acts of sabotage

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:47.916
with the intention
of overthrowing the government.

00:01:48.082 --> 00:01:50.502
Nelson Mandela, do you plead guilty,

00:01:50.668 --> 00:01:51.628
or not guilty?

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:52.921
My Lord,

00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:56.300
it is not I but the government
that should plead guilty.

00:01:57.902 --> 00:02:01.179
You'll never leave here. You'll never
touch a woman or a child again.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.516
It's a pity they didn't hang you.

00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:05.777
I'm going to make sure
you wish they had.

00:02:10.342 --> 00:02:12.983
The more they oppress us,
the harder we fight.

00:02:14.563 --> 00:02:16.951
Freedom. It is an ideal for which

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:18.447
I am prepared

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:19.920
to die.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.577
Shall we begin?
