city<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.190> think<00:02:07.140> except<00:02:08.140> for<00:02:08.170> no<00:02:08.710> honest

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.570 

so<00:02:18.210> everything<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:18.870> treat<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.460> if<00:02:20.460> you

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
so everything is for treat and so if you

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.190

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.720 

I<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.130> keep<00:02:29.250> repeating<00:02:29.700> myself

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730
