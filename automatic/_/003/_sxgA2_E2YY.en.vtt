00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.009
 Good morning to talk to after 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.750
 unsure play day last night four 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.849
 The league is out of hibernation 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.590
 But the FC Bayern I woke up 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.290
 not feel or well if you 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.049
 looks after the 1 4 in wolfsburg now 1 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.510
 1 against Schalke you can say so had 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.000
 she did not imagine that 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.920
 a point of knowing know little appreciates 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.260
 asiaten he counted many or so 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.300
 maybe even six there is still a lot 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.410
 air upwards as you can see and the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.599
 champions league will be back soon 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.669
 in front of the door, the viola still has a lot 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.100
 I think so interesting to do 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.630
 because ultimately it was so in the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.579
 have already capitulated everything 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.530
 already congratulated on the championship and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.450
 now only one problem have two play 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.370
 was a crisis or now 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.800
 the special situation owed with 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.730
 the space reference of a correct one 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.820
 I would not yet be in crisis 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.079
 speak so you have now seen that 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.149
 teams also like wolfsburg noticed 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.739
 I know how to hurt bavaria 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.149
 think schalke is with a whole 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.440
 other intention came there 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.300
 somehow they wanted a point 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.949
 get and then we also made it 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.270
 it's tough against one 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.090
 Team like Schalke then with 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.400
 his tactical concept by roberto di 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.680
 matteo then comes to crack 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.810
 and then, of course, all the less 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.070
 heavy area must say again that 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.890
 jerome boateng again a bit 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.750
 had to pay something wrong altogether 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.479
 then run again is the last 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.520
 limb in the chain and the stopgap 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.030
 long, so to speak, one of the crisis 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.990
 I do not want to talk now but it 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.310
 is actually such a hint 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.450
 I find the important thing 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.820
 the champions league and you have to 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.140
 just watch out 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.909
 aproz boateng one has little word 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.829
 looked at yours yesterday after 17 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.240
 minutes down his brother is after 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.860
 Although played 90 minutes but seen 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.180
 you do not really have them either 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.979
 was so a bit emblematic of the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.780
 Schalke the only ones who have crawled 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.950
 although they were one more I had 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.909
 but the impression of it all the same 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.920
 satisfied 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.000
 I also think that with the point 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.340
 are satisfied because you have to see 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.780
 behind bavaria and wolfsburg are the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.090
 teams very close together since 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.770
 it's about every point 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.079
 gladbach leverkusen schalke are yes the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.580
 three candidates in munich point 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.320
 is to take 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.240
 of course a success on the other 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.550
 side has kevin prince boateng 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.100
 actually never really in this 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.750
 Season at least shows why he 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.220
 actually has such a name why he 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.700
 perhaps also be a leader 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.530
 want 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.350
 one did not say that wants his 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.340
 currently not in training I have 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.320
 ever seen 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.100
 I've wondered what's up 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.660
 he just stays here the whole time 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.790
 So sometimes difficult to need a 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.930
 a little behind kick this role 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.610
 takes a bit better because of it 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.540
 are still important games now synonymous 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.550
 back in the champions league 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.290
 for example schalke and bavaria of course 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.390
 the big topics today at sport1 de 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.430
 looks ahead to the day today 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.170
 live again next football tonight 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.150
 the bundesliga also real madrid 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.400
 catch-up game from the World Cup will be too 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.260
 very exciting and 13 clock press conference 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.190
 others may conclude 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.959
 still your opinion 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.720
 Yesterday they wanted was very hard 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.350
 Done now does everything better for him 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.420
 They definitely have a great 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.760
 additional option so i found now 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.230
 wolfsburg is now against bavaria 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.520
 won but to confirm that she 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.810
 actually a team are the 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.280
 Danes become dangerous then they have to 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.620
 stop such games in frankfurt too 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.360
 are able to attract luck had that 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.800
 have managed to balance with 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.070
 other school with security again 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.230
 got a real good gain 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.030
 I just think exciting what others 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.220
 school actually be that way now 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.330
 says because I think it's somewhere 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.519
 step back is when you join 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.980
 Chelsea was what his youth dream also 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.019
 was and then after such a short time already 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.459
 came back and after that 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.900
 a wm you played even if 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.370
 He supplement player was more at now 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.190
 the wm but important things done 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.560
 even before I am there 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.610
 curious what he says and I think 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.930
 that he definitely has an advantage 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.970
 for wolfsburg and again for the 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.500
 be bundesliga thank you thorsten 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.900
