00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:13.549
 It is a cargo Hata of the career car's in charge today 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:18.160
 In this video, you notice or feel that it is this collection failure after you change your job 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:23.860
 I would like to talk about what to do when I do 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:29.770
 After all it is the most important thing so as not to fail in job change 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:34.810
 It is to confirm as much as possible before you change your job 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:38.170
 Well, as a matter of fact, it is something to be understood before actually joining the company 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.980
 After all there is a limit 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.790
 so 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:48.040
 Well I once concurrent positions while I also Hey shame in those who had you allowed to consulting 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:53.160
 Even though it was you 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:56.190
 I say I quit in a short period and I would take a consultation in two days 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:03.059
 There was also a case 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.559
 How You know me also a matter of fact two school buildings has been no king de Well'd change jobs company is a real place 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.670
 It's weird to say that the company 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.320
 After all I do not know 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.320
 It's a shame that in such a case it will come out 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:25.730
 Well that's about what to do when it happens 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:31.290
 Even if you think that you are different from the company you were thinking of drawing and you think it is really 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:34.630
 I think it is necessary to calmly determine if it is a failure 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.890
 Right after joining that company 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:46.960
 I can not, so I have various stress after all 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:48.420
 It is not uncommon for people not to get along smoothly with people around them because they don't understand each other . 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.540
 Ne 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:58.060
 Because 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.060
 I think that many things are not a few faces that say it this time solves 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:18.610
 Boo Boo Fu still unexpected could have been here useless 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.740
 his 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:27.920
 It feels like I'm settled in this company, and it's a child Garatsu and that 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.630
 Impressions have also changed in the past 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:36.280
 It is a set meal that I decided hard with air thugs and 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:41.470
 If there is a star there and quit in a short time, that 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.360
 After all, the next of chaste Why splash of say career achievements to the detection also will be studying old 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.620
 You'll ne nano 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:53.209
 The older you are, the more side you are 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:59.760
 Because you should avoid eating for a short period of time 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:05.230
 It is important to first consider whether it is really a company that is not good enough 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:12.900
 Well earnestly but I think that I want to ask so as not to be that snap judgment 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.900
 But in it to say that is so is because there also are I Well ridiculous company 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:23.690
 Though we considered enough, it is this company after all 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:26.240
 Is clear that Tteyuu serious serious condition that much problem is referred to as a very There is not 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.730
 If it is then that 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:37.700
 On the contrary , I think it would be better to start job change activities as soon as possible 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:41.900
 The only caveat is to stop suddenly 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:47.410
 The basic is patience in that company, while continuing the work 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:51.910
 In parallel, it is that Tteyuu want you to go to job search 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.180
 As I said it is the Tteyuu to the shop and Te after you've examined quit in the short term 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.670
 To 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:04.569
 It means that I quit in that short term, I will pull my leg 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:11.500
 Not'm so is better to another large office Robo job search as a cut or the other here is that it is no good day 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:12.990
 You need not suffer from the economic anxiety as applicants destination of the impression may is it then the real problem 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.290
 right 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:23.400
 If you do so, you 're not worried 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:27.509
 You can reduce the risk of jumping into a company with high problems again 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:32.479
 I will not repeat the same mistake of water 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.479
 I think that I want you to change your job carefully
