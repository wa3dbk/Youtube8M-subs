00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:23.880
 to make such a star we need 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:28.130
 square we add up the path then everyone got 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.130
 all in Russian, we fold the side 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.899
 from this old 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:48.810
 then turn down too doing with 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:57.610
 next strip this side 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:01:05.410
 an Internet and also all the rest turned out 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:12.060
 lines to them we bend the side all sides 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:18.880
 we have bent to the stripes and now 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:26.110
 turning it was hard once again dad 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:29.250
 so now we need to make your 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.910
 these are the lines that we most easily 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.420
 they need to be inside and it will turn out like this 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.420
 figurine 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:52.080
 then what we do is take this side along 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.080
 prefab lines 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.860
 drop down 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.900
 what we do 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:23.650
 click here 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:27.150
 make a cam then flip and with 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.150
 this side do the same 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.640
 with 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.610
 the cat must be exactly in the middle 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.610
 fuck only on the shaft thursday 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.510
 I read this should be such 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.310
 details need to do five take here 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:21.819
 this little corner bend up 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:25.870
 overturn all such details needed 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:32.610
 make five now our parts need 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:37.930
 connect take this little corner I insert 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:43.450
 overturn this nodule hiding 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:47.350
 this is how we connect all 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.200
 details better all parts combine when 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.780
 grab with glue to 5 detail can be 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.349
 It was inserted loosely because the details 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.230
 will crumble 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:02.040
 so I glued all the details and stars 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.040
 need to give shape 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:15.430
 i'm already giving a little bit all this 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:17.289
 forked at the edges of the part is desirable 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:22.690
 glue together because 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:25.770
 in another 6 star will not work 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.770
 just fall apart 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.959
 Well, such an asterisk
