supposed to be telling us the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.580 
supposed to be telling us the
temperature<00:00:07.950> outside<00:00:08.330> and<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:10.080> indicator

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
temperature outside and this indicator

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.820 
temperature outside and this indicator
is<00:00:10.800> supposed<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.219> be<00:00:11.370> telling<00:00:11.730> us<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.830> time

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
is supposed to be telling us the time

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.540 
is supposed to be telling us the time
and<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.370> gear<00:00:14.610> selection<00:00:15.650> as<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.369> see

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and the gear selection as you can see

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.700 
and the gear selection as you can see
there's<00:00:17.880> no<00:00:18.270> pixels<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.930> left<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.380> just<00:00:19.560> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
there's no pixels on the left and just a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.620 
there's no pixels on the left and just a
few<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> right<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.609> so<00:00:21.150> we're<00:00:21.480> going<00:00:21.570> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
few on the right and so we're going to

a couple of pieces of foam which we're

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.520 
a couple of pieces of foam which we're
going<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> cut<00:00:43.770> from<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.940> larger<00:00:45.539> piece<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.079> a

q-tip in fact the foam that we're going

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.569 
q-tip in fact the foam that we're going
to<00:00:52.110> use<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.680> kind<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.980> stuff<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.399> you

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
to use is this kind of stuff that you

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.540 
to use is this kind of stuff that you
see<00:00:54.090> most<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> electronic<00:00:55.620> equipment<00:00:56.219> has

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
see most of the electronic equipment has

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.639 
see most of the electronic equipment has
a<00:00:56.850> box<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> bottom<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> so

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
a box with this at the bottom of it so

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.200 
a box with this at the bottom of it so
that's<00:00:58.800> what<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> first<00:00:59.699> step<00:00:59.969> is

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
that's what this is so the first step is

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.029 
that's what this is so the first step is
to<00:01:00.510> take<00:01:00.930> off<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.199> five<00:01:01.500> clips<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.980> are

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
to take off the five clips that are

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.490 
to take off the five clips that are
holding<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.489> front<00:01:02.730> case<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.149> front<00:01:03.570> bezel<00:01:04.170> on

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
holding the front case on front bezel on

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.899 
holding the front case on front bezel on
there's<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.909> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
there's one here and then here the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.649 
there's one here and then here the
hidden<00:01:09.119> one<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:10.850> one<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
hidden one here one down here on the

shrunk

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
shrunk

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.770 
shrunk
and<00:02:11.680> make<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:13.530> press<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:15.330> ribbon<00:02:16.330> cable<00:02:16.660> up

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and make it press the ribbon cable up

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.699 
and make it press the ribbon cable up
against<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.230> circuit<00:02:17.530> board<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:19.709> hopefully

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
against the circuit board and hopefully

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.500 
against the circuit board and hopefully
make<00:02:20.890> better<00:02:21.069> contact<00:02:21.519> than<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.819> was<00:02:22.000> okay<00:02:22.480> so

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
make better contact than it was okay so

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.080 
make better contact than it was okay so
our<00:02:22.870> little<00:02:23.110> piece<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.319> foam<00:02:23.650> has<00:02:24.160> been<00:02:24.489> cut

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
our little piece of foam has been cut

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.240 
our little piece of foam has been cut
and<00:02:25.360> I've<00:02:25.480> poked<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.930> hole<00:02:26.110> with<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.709> toothpick

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
and I've poked a hole with a toothpick

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.589 
and I've poked a hole with a toothpick
and<00:02:27.519> I'm<00:02:28.209> going<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.510> insert<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:29.290> tie<00:02:29.920> wrap<00:02:30.599> into

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
and I'm going to insert a tie wrap into

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:41.400 
and I'm going to insert a tie wrap into
it<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:38.349> get<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.650> into<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.750> position<00:02:41.260> we

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
it so and to get it into the position we

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.069 
it so and to get it into the position we
need<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:42.180> we're<00:02:43.180> going<00:02:43.299> to<00:02:43.360> take<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.630> tie<00:02:43.810> wrap

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
need it we're going to take the tie wrap

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.140 
need it we're going to take the tie wrap
and<00:02:44.290> put<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:44.829> widget<00:02:45.250> in<00:02:45.459> between<00:02:45.880> the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
and put it in widget in between the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.140 
and put it in widget in between the
ribbon<00:02:46.630> cable<00:02:47.079> and<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:48.130> pink<00:02:48.370> foam<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.910> has

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
ribbon cable and the pink foam that has

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.220 
ribbon cable and the pink foam that has
shrunk<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.980> grab<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.160> other<00:02:51.310> side<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.230> now

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
shrunk and grab the other side and now

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.509 
shrunk and grab the other side and now
we<00:02:53.860> will<00:02:54.040> simply<00:02:54.540> pull<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:56.079> follow<00:02:56.290> through

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.330 

so<00:03:00.519> that<00:03:00.730> exceeds<00:03:01.239> extends<00:03:02.170> both<00:03:02.709> sides<00:03:03.069> of

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
so that exceeds extends both sides of

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.160 
so that exceeds extends both sides of
the<00:03:03.459> ribbon<00:03:03.640> cable<00:03:06.120> okay<00:03:07.120> so<00:03:07.180> remove<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.989> tie

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
the ribbon cable okay so remove the tie

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.350 
the ribbon cable okay so remove the tie
wrap<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.739> what<00:03:09.459> we're<00:03:09.640> going<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.819> do<00:03:09.940> now<00:03:10.120> is

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
wrap and what we're going to do now is

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.460 
wrap and what we're going to do now is
take<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.720> tweezers<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.849> push<00:03:12.849> the<00:03:13.150> foam<00:03:13.470> back

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
take the tweezers and push the foam back

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.420 
take the tweezers and push the foam back
toward<00:03:15.359> the<00:03:17.010> factory-installed<00:03:18.540> pink<00:03:19.540> foam
