00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.860
 today i will tell you about how more 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.439
 qualitatively with more coefficient 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.890
 efficacy to train playing in 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.750
 wall 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.939
 you can't always afford 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.859
 play the card sometimes for a reason 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.570
 lack of a partner sometimes for a reason 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.269
 just the absence of a card for one way or another 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.519
 reasons but the wall is always near you 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.769
 you can come and play tennis 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.449
 any time 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:44.390
 but in order to play well the wall 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.729
 need for yourself but without yourself 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.979
 make me do your favorite three 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.350
 simple rules first when you play 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:54.619
 in the wall you definitely need on the wall 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.690
 draw a target here already without us 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:58.010
 drew targets 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.680
 a little bit low then i'm actually by 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.540
 drew a little more and higher 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.449
 and put the second 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.729
 you need to decide which one 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.860
 the amount of how much you will beat 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.530
 ball with one rebound or 2 rebounds I 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.259
 would personally recommend to all beginners and 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.840
 not even novice fans playing 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.350
 wall with 2 bounces because it gives 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.000
 more time to approach the sword for more 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.370
 quality processing then this ball and 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.230
 the rhythms of the game are more garden even in the wall 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.020
 more consistent with the rhythm of the game 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.960
 which you then get by playing on 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.670
 the whole was a whole city and the third very 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.070
 important point you have to set yourself 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.100
 aim how many hits do you want 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.659
 hold on target either in total 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.700
 you should i should hit the target 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.770
 there on the right so many times or so 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.020
 that time I have to hit the target without 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.180
 mistakes if you set yourself a task 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.159
 get 10 times more than 9 you start 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.740
 again so on options may be 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.630
 any but what i see basically 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.430
 going on people come to the wall and they 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.350
 just so right left beat no 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.270
 have something not something turns out 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.150
 it turns out don't take the ball again from it 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.289
 it is clear that the whole game is very chaotic 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.940
 aimlessly that is they nothing 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.090
 work out the only thing you have 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.640
 I get better at this point is 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.200
 your sense of the ball is that you stop 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.090
 miss the ball well such a skill you 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.920
 As a rule, you get for the first 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.200
 few lessons and then you want 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.070
 do I still progress now 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.500
 I will show in general how here if I wanted 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.230
 play the wall and work something out for 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.320
 of my own two hands how I would do it 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.590
 i will play as i said with 2 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.590
 rebound 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.200
 I have to go to the sword all the time 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.410
 after each stroke I move if 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.080
 the ball flew a little shorter now I still 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.380
 closer to 7 ah because almost I move away 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.050
 I try all the time here the target data 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.150
 I do not have some height 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.250
 I give a specific square because 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.080
 squares are very small whole my 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.390
 the game right now has a certain amount 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.769
 meaningfulness by her foot position is always 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.780
 same here error occurred me I 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:19.500
 went on now I need again 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.500
 return the game to your goal 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.640
 Here's something like this game wall 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.020
 if you comply 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.900
 3 not strict rules you have a goal 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.330
 drawn you have a task goal 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.880
 internal and you chose a certain 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.060
 rhythm number of bounces that you 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.010
 do you allow the ball 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.060
 bounced off the ground before you put 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.060
 blow thanks see our lessons and 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.730
