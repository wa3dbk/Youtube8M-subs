00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.389
 Hi, this is lost and the light and I 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.160
 his lead spiridon genes we will 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.290
 talk about becoming a different light and then from 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.269
 most important tools of the photographer 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.550
 start with the basics today we 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.910
 consider a pilot pulse light 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.560
 soft and hard light camera settings 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.380
 studio first thing we'll talk about today 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.300
 this is a feature of studio shooting contrast 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.160
 from the street where we soot is not given to manage 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.820
 With the studio light, we owe it in full 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.380
 least 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.600
 it is advisable to start working in 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.210
 classic studio where you will not 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.030
 interfere with beautiful stone paper locks 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.399
 and white walls that give 1000 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.140
 stray reflexes light frolic on 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.160
 the pilot is not a pulse for simpler 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.020
 pilot this constant he shines always 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.910
 pulsed gives a powerful beam of light behind 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.469
 short time photo studio 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.300
 usually equipped with pulsed light 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.309
 flashes trigger with 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.350
 special device synchronizer 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.590
 the cottage is already knocking to use the misfortune 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.860
 light and let hundreds of times more powerful constantly 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.900
 if it burned always what would become 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.390
 it is a great pity therefore this most powerful 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.430
 beam fires in a split second 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.100
 besides this the candle is divided into soft 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.500
 and hard and let's see what 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.020
 they differ from each other actually 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.159
 everything is very simple and the difference is determined 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.830
 light-shadow border 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.780
 in hard light it is noticeable by example 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.720
 you can see that the picture light has a clear 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.140
 border and in soft light the transition from 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.570
 light to shade more smoothly the sun zenith 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.030
 for example gives us harsh light from the sun 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.979
 through the clouds soft drawings for 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.380
 studio monoblock there are many 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.189
 nozzles each of them gives perhaps 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.439
 light drawing 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.240
 hard light gives us a portrait plate 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.850
 as not difficult to guess and uses in 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.470
 mainly for portraits 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.330
 usually large very well 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.310
 imitates direct sunlight 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.900
 the reflector is mainly used for 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.570
 additional lighting tube models 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.200
 one of the hardest sources gives 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.670
 very narrow light beam 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.740
 in order for this most holy tank 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.230
 make directional use honeycomb 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.440
 friends are generally called grit and for example 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.360
 honeycomb dish and without 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.150
 see on the background a portrait of cassats draws 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.550
 croup soft same pattern is obtained when 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.800
 using the softbox he gives 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.330
 quite soft drawing and even 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.710
 small sized software lighting 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.900
 enough your area 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.180
 Car boxes usually this help 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.040
 illuminates a large number of people either 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.230
 i use sun as imitation 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.840
 through the clouds coming from the hard 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.680
 to soft one can call three boxing this 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.000
 Russian Growth Software 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.160
 however, you can even 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.290
 soft box gave a hard figure but about 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.630
 this next issue well and of course 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.580
 we only disassembled the main nozzles 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.230
 there are many more 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.660
 and the last thing we talk about today 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.280
 This is the camera settings for shooting studio 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.170
 studio can sleep only on manual 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.010
 mode so as from to pan goes on 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.200
 pilot light 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.090
 and the impulse to me as I said much 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.190
 more powerful therefore we are simply 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.830
 get an overexposed frame shutter we 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.800
 set for one 125 seconds if you do 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.260
 shutter speed is shorter then the shutter curtain is not 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.030
 will have time to work and you will succeed 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.709
 photos with a black strip on the shelf 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.239
 for some special types of filming 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.880
 shutter speed can be set to length 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.800
 for example in a mixed light about him I, too 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.080
 sure to tell the rest 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.790
 In cases, it remains unchanged until 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.880
 sensitivity we set the minimum 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.160
 it was usually worth it as opposed to the suite 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.400
 shutter speed and aperture control directly 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.340
 with the amount of light on a par with the setting 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.810
 the candy bars themselves aren't worth it always 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.890
 leave position 8 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.319
 how to be 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.600
 say here is the principle unless the foundations 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.910
 the paths of a novice photographer following 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.459
 releases I will be more and more 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.200
 lift the veil of the secret of working with 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.280
 with light 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.770
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.580
 likes in general support me thanks for 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.580
 attention is removed
