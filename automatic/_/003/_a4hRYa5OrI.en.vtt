00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.710 
were getting energized I think before
that<00:01:41.369> kind<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.759> says<00:01:41.909> him<00:01:42.060> coming<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.539> don't

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
that kind of says him coming so I don't

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.660 
that kind of says him coming so I don't
know<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:42.960> getting<00:01:43.890> injured<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> trigger

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
know if getting injured with the trigger

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.700 
know if getting injured with the trigger
but<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.479> definitely<00:01:45.689> didn't<00:01:46.170> spark<00:01:46.500> something

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
but it definitely didn't spark something

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.889 
but it definitely didn't spark something
so<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.819> was<00:01:47.939> definitely<00:01:48.090> him<00:01:48.360> he<00:01:48.479> was<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> foul

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
so it was definitely him he was a foul

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.779 
so it was definitely him he was a foul
and<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.500> hurt<00:01:49.649> or<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> player<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.429> we<00:01:50.610> weren't

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
and it hurt or a player so we weren't

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.480 
and it hurt or a player so we weren't
take<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.750> him<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.409> obviously<00:01:53.159> we

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
take it to him and you know obviously we
