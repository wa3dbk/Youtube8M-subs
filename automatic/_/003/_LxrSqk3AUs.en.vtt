and we're in Orange County so sometimes
it's<00:01:41.909> hard<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.360> actors<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.840> come<00:01:42.930> from<00:01:43.079> LA

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
it's hard to get actors to come from LA

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.010 
it's hard to get actors to come from LA
and<00:01:43.799> they<00:01:44.490> had<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> casting<00:01:45.119> session<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.780> said

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and they had a casting session and said

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.330 
and they had a casting session and said
well<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.409> didn't<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.860> anybody<00:01:47.040> good

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
well we really didn't get anybody good

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.219 
well we really didn't get anybody good
so<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> student<00:01:48.030> cast<00:01:48.270> himself<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
so the student cast himself as the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.590 
so the student cast himself as the
father<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.220> completely<00:01:50.850> ruined<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.360> show

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
father and it completely ruined the show

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.359 
father and it completely ruined the show
you<00:01:51.659> didn't<00:01:52.020> believe<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.470> was<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> real<00:01:52.799> family

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you didn't believe it was a real family

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.580 
you didn't believe it was a real family
you<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.149> believe<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.350> premise

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you have to believe for that premise

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.090 
you have to believe for that premise
that<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.689> bizarre<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> family<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.979> it

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that as bizarre as the family is that it

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.149 
that as bizarre as the family is that it
has<00:01:59.280> some<00:01:59.579> sense<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.090> reality<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.159> right

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
has some sense of reality to it right

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.679 
has some sense of reality to it right
and<00:02:02.399> that's<00:02:02.549> what<00:02:02.729> I'm<00:02:02.820> curious<00:02:03.030> about<00:02:03.299> is

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
and that's what I'm curious about is

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.920 
and that's what I'm curious about is
what<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.189> makes<00:02:05.909> an<00:02:06.119> audience<00:02:06.600> sort

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
what is it that makes an audience sort

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.169 
what is it that makes an audience sort
of<00:02:07.079> glob<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.610> series<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
of glob on to the series and the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.940 
of glob on to the series and the
characters<00:02:09.599> versus<00:02:10.020> not<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.440> I'm<00:02:10.560> sure<00:02:10.800> it's

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
characters versus not and I'm sure it's

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.030 
characters versus not and I'm sure it's
not<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.129> sign

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
not a sign

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.580 
not a sign
yeah<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.970> isn't<00:02:13.269> science<00:02:13.660> it's<00:02:14.050> an<00:02:14.230> art<00:02:14.379> there

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
yeah it isn't science it's an art there

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.410 
yeah it isn't science it's an art there
but<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:15.190> know<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.459> characters<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.120> think<00:02:16.150> are

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
but you know the characters I think are

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.910

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.710 
was casting it in and the direction in
that<00:03:20.470> particular<00:03:20.950> series<00:03:21.220> there<00:03:21.850> but<00:03:22.389> yeah<00:03:22.690> I

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
that particular series there but yeah I

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.690 
that particular series there but yeah I
think<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.350> concept<00:03:23.739> was<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.950> good<00:03:24.220> concept

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
think the concept was a good concept

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.180 
think the concept was a good concept
there<00:03:25.000> but<00:03:25.480> when<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:25.780> take<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.019> 22<00:03:26.709> year<00:03:27.010> old

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
there but when you take a 22 year old

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.460 
there but when you take a 22 year old
guy<00:03:27.489> even<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.000> guy<00:03:28.269> with<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.450> beard<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.019> say<00:03:29.230> hi

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
guy even a guy with a beard and say hi

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.280 
guy even a guy with a beard and say hi
I'm<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.680> dad<00:03:30.069> it<00:03:30.959> doesn't<00:03:31.959> seem<00:03:32.139> like<00:03:32.260> a

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
I'm the dad it doesn't seem like a

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.750 
I'm the dad it doesn't seem like a
family<00:03:32.709> -<00:03:32.829> it<00:03:32.920> seems<00:03:33.130> like<00:03:33.220> students

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
family - it seems like students

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.180 
family - it seems like students
play-acting<00:03:34.359> at<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.630> point<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:34.989> time<00:03:35.190> it's

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
play-acting at that point in time it's

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.069 
play-acting at that point in time it's
why<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:36.849> know<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.000> revised<00:03:37.510> whether<00:03:37.900> they're

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
why you know I revised whether they're

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.479 
why you know I revised whether they're
my<00:03:38.200> students<00:03:38.620> or<00:03:38.769> they're<00:03:38.920> people<00:03:39.250> out<00:03:39.340> in<00:03:39.430> the

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
my students or they're people out in the

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.629 
my students or they're people out in the
world<00:03:39.700> we're<00:03:39.970> making<00:03:40.239> web<00:03:40.419> series<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:41.639> you

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
world we're making web series that you

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.250 
world we're making web series that you
need<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.940> find<00:03:43.180> real<00:03:43.359> actors<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:44.019> be<00:03:44.139> the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
need to find real actors to be the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.409 
need to find real actors to be the
actors<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.919> know<00:03:45.280> we'd<00:03:45.609> all<00:03:45.730> like<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:45.940> pretend

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
actors I know we'd all like to pretend

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.629 
actors I know we'd all like to pretend
that<00:03:46.599> we<00:03:46.810> can<00:03:46.959> act<00:03:47.169> but<00:03:47.470> we<00:03:47.620> all<00:03:47.769> can't<00:03:48.069> act<00:03:48.340> and

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
that we can act but we all can't act and

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.690 
that we can act but we all can't act and
so<00:03:49.419> it's<00:03:49.780> really<00:03:50.139> worth<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.680> effort<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.010> go<00:03:51.400> to

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
so it's really worth the effort to go to

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.000 
so it's really worth the effort to go to
a<00:03:52.299> theater<00:03:52.599> department<00:03:53.200> somewhere<00:03:53.410> go<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:53.889> a

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
a theater department somewhere go to a
