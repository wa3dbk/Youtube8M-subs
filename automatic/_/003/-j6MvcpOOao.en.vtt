all<00:00:01.500> right<00:00:01.650> folks<00:00:01.890> that's<00:00:02.040> when<00:00:02.250> people<00:00:02.370> will

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
all right folks that's when people will

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.930 
all right folks that's when people will
concern<00:00:03.060> an<00:00:03.300> issue<00:00:03.480> with<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.430> hematite<00:00:05.430> rock

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
concern an issue with the hematite rock

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.059 
concern an issue with the hematite rock
this<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.420> hematite<00:00:06.839> which<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.620> basically<00:00:07.919> an

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
this is hematite which is basically an

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.780 
this is hematite which is basically an
iron<00:00:08.220> oxide<00:00:09.230> their<00:00:10.230> concern<00:00:10.950> was<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.639> was

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
iron oxide their concern was that I was

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.610 
iron oxide their concern was that I was
getting<00:00:11.969> voltage<00:00:12.630> due<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.080> fact<00:00:13.469> that

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
getting voltage due to the fact that

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.120 
getting voltage due to the fact that
there's<00:00:14.299> metal<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.990> electrode<00:00:16.619> or<00:00:16.800> this

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
there's metal on this electrode or this

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.529 
there's metal on this electrode or this
I'll<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.699> clip<00:00:17.910> itself

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
I'll get a clip itself

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.029 
I'll get a clip itself
so<00:00:19.020> tonight<00:00:19.320> they're<00:00:19.470> thinking<00:00:19.740> I'm<00:00:19.830> getting

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
so tonight they're thinking I'm getting

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.950 
so tonight they're thinking I'm getting
the<00:00:20.130> votes<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.520> do<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.850> met<00:00:21.270> are<00:00:21.390> here<00:00:21.750> and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the votes to do the met are here and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.939 
the votes to do the met are here and
they<00:00:22.769> think<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.039> wire<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.820> rock<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.390> wet

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
they think the wire the rock is on wet

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.150 
they think the wire the rock is on wet
and<00:00:26.359> the<00:00:27.359> wetness<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.869> traveling<00:00:28.260> past<00:00:28.740> that

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
and the wetness is traveling past that

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.120 
and the wetness is traveling past that
and<00:00:29.400> basically<00:00:30.210> they're<00:00:30.510> thinking<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.199> this

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and basically they're thinking that this

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.760 
and basically they're thinking that this
is<00:00:32.550> an<00:00:32.850> electrode<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> I'm<00:00:34.020> using<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
is an electrode and I'm using that the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.830 
is an electrode and I'm using that the
Copperheads<00:00:35.250> electrode<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> very<00:00:36.480> valid

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
Copperheads electrode it's a very valid

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.069 
Copperheads electrode it's a very valid
argument<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.309> city<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.670> about<00:00:38.850> how<00:00:39.780> this

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
argument but the city is about how this

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.130 
argument but the city is about how this
is<00:00:40.290> not<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.829> got<00:00:41.610> copper<00:00:42.149> notice<00:00:42.960> how<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
is not I got copper notice how the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.010 
is not I got copper notice how the
copper<00:00:43.680> which<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.030> rotor<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.510> raggin

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
copper which is the rotor of the raggin

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.319 
copper which is the rotor of the raggin
rock<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.800> sitting<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.039> top<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> copper<00:00:47.670> is

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
rock is sitting on top the copper is

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.830 
rock is sitting on top the copper is
going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.110> black<00:00:50.120> probe<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.420> means<00:00:51.660> it's

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
going to the black probe it means it's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.590 
going to the black probe it means it's
negative<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.320> mean<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.600> lecturer

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
negative I mean just be the lecturer

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.299 
negative I mean just be the lecturer
that<00:00:54.629> will<00:00:54.899> corrode<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> rock<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
that will corrode and the rock is the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.970 
that will corrode and the rock is the
positive<00:00:56.690> some<00:00:57.690> won't<00:00:57.870> put<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.410> will<00:00:58.739> show<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
positive some won't put I will show you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.720 
positive some won't put I will show you

millivolts there in spots of the rock

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.789 
millivolts there in spots of the rock
gave<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> different<00:01:12.450> voltages<00:01:12.840> notice

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
gave you different voltages notice

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.510 
gave you different voltages notice
that's<00:01:13.950> positive<00:01:14.640> 300<00:01:15.680> millivolts<00:01:16.710> now<00:01:17.189> watch

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that's positive 300 millivolts now watch

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.130 
that's positive 300 millivolts now watch
one<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.790> take<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> metal<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.750> alligator

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
one I take the metal of the alligator

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.490 
one I take the metal of the alligator
clip<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.979> put<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> damp<00:01:20.670> rag<00:01:21.500> you

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
clip and put it on the damp rag you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.080 
clip and put it on the damp rag you
notice<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:22.950> negative<00:01:23.570> see<00:01:24.950> negative<00:01:26.090> 400

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
notice I get negative see negative 400

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.020 
notice I get negative see negative 400
millivolts<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.820> do<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.030> again<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> rock

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
millivolts and do it again to the rock

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.230 
millivolts and do it again to the rock
positive<00:01:33.030> voltage<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:34.670> that's<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> best<00:01:36.060> way

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
positive voltage so that's the best way

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.690 
positive voltage so that's the best way
I<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.450> prove<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.780> I'm<00:01:37.619> not<00:01:37.890> using<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
I can prove that I'm not using the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.120 
I can prove that I'm not using the
electrode<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.750> light<00:01:40.409> using<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> metal

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
electrode on the light using the metal

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.219 
electrode on the light using the metal
on<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.909> alligator<00:01:42.630> clip<00:01:43.250> but<00:01:44.250> yeah<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:45.229> can

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
on the alligator clip but yeah I can

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.789 
on the alligator clip but yeah I can
pretty<00:01:46.409> much<00:01:46.500> use<00:01:47.240> any<00:01:48.240> metal<00:01:48.960> as<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> negative

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
pretty much use any metal as a negative

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.370 
pretty much use any metal as a negative
electrode<00:01:50.220> even<00:01:50.490> graphite<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.049> one<00:01:52.229> is

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
electrode even graphite on this one is

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.690 
electrode even graphite on this one is
this<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.649> haematite<00:01:53.009> -<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.549> see

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
this is haematite - and you can see

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.800 
this is haematite - and you can see
there's<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> gold<00:01:54.560> there's<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.649> gold<00:01:56.719> 90<00:01:57.719> that's

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
there's a gold there's a gold 90 that's

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.920 
there's a gold there's a gold 90 that's
gold<00:01:58.140> coated<00:01:58.439> magnet<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:59.610> actually<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.479> new

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
gold coated magnet it's actually a new

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.480 
gold coated magnet it's actually a new
diamond<00:02:01.320> magnet<00:02:02.540> you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.570> see<00:02:04.490> it's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
diamond magnet you can see it's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.930 
diamond magnet you can see it's
attracted<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:07.429> entire<00:02:08.429> rock

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
attracted to the entire rock

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.070 
attracted to the entire rock
so<00:02:10.300> we'll<00:02:10.660> take<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:10.960> gold-plated<00:02:12.810> don't<00:02:13.810> see

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
so we'll take this gold-plated don't see

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.270 
so we'll take this gold-plated don't see
here<00:02:15.810> I'll<00:02:16.810> take<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:17.290> take<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.220> copper<00:02:18.580> out

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
here I'll take this take the copper out

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.350 
here I'll take this take the copper out
this<00:02:21.280> might<00:02:21.460> be<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.610> little<00:02:21.700> difficult<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.150> can

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
this might be a little difficult you can

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.690 
this might be a little difficult you can
see<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.950> gold<00:02:24.220> magnet<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:27.190> other<00:02:27.310> side

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
see the gold magnet is on the other side

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.410 
see the gold magnet is on the other side
of<00:02:27.760> them<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:29.590> alligator<00:02:30.430> clip<00:02:30.640> they<00:02:31.240> said

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
of them the alligator clip they said

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.490 
of them the alligator clip they said
everyone<00:02:31.600> do<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:31.840> gonna<00:02:31.990> put<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.260> gold

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
everyone do is gonna put this gold

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.300 
everyone do is gonna put this gold
magnet<00:02:32.860> onto<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.580> wet<00:02:34.450> cloth<00:02:35.130> maybe<00:02:36.130> we

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
magnet onto the wet cloth maybe we

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.820 
magnet onto the wet cloth maybe we
should<00:02:36.460> get<00:02:36.550> some<00:02:36.730> voltage<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:39.370> can<00:02:39.580> see

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.000 

we're<00:02:45.400> getting<00:02:45.610> voltage<00:02:45.940> from<00:02:46.750> gold<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.530> gold

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
we're getting voltage from gold and gold

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.070 
we're getting voltage from gold and gold
is<00:02:48.190> a<00:02:48.250> negative<00:02:48.790> electrode<00:02:49.150> on<00:02:49.300> this<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.720> now

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
is a negative electrode on this and now

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.630 
is a negative electrode on this and now
people<00:02:53.290> might<00:02:53.530> say<00:02:53.740> I'm<00:02:53.890> getting<00:02:54.220> value<00:02:54.520> at<00:02:54.610> a

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
people might say I'm getting value at a

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.030 
people might say I'm getting value at a
clip<00:02:54.820> on<00:02:54.940> there<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:58.150> that's<00:02:58.510> that's<00:02:59.040> voltage

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
clip on there but that's that's voltage

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.360 
clip on there but that's that's voltage
from<00:03:00.520> a<00:03:00.580> negative<00:03:01.150> gold<00:03:01.390> electrode<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.370> mean

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
from a negative gold electrode I mean

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.630 
from a negative gold electrode I mean
that's<00:03:03.520> a<00:03:03.610> voltage<00:03:03.940> from<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.270> gold<00:03:05.070> no<00:03:06.070> I<00:03:06.100> can't

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
that's a voltage from a gold no I can't

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.280 
that's a voltage from a gold no I can't
grant<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:06.910> can't<00:03:07.180> guarantee<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.870> this<00:03:08.020> gold

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
grant I can't guarantee that this gold

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.910 
grant I can't guarantee that this gold
I'm<00:03:08.890> pretty<00:03:09.160> sure<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.250> golds<00:03:09.640> up<00:03:09.790> pure<00:03:10.680> but<00:03:11.680> yeah

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
I'm pretty sure I golds up pure but yeah

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.370 
I'm pretty sure I golds up pure but yeah
it's<00:03:12.340> interesting<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.970> fact<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.240> gold<00:03:13.750> it's

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
it's interesting the fact that gold it's

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.500 
it's interesting the fact that gold it's
nice<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:14.680> interesting<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.700> see<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:15.940> gold

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
nice just interesting to see that gold

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.100 
nice just interesting to see that gold
could<00:03:16.840> be<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:17.050> negative<00:03:17.560> electrode<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.870> can

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
could be a negative electrode and so can

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.560 
could be a negative electrode and so can
other<00:03:20.710> electrodes<00:03:21.220> like<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.640> got<00:03:22.270> aluminum

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
other electrodes like I got aluminum

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:31.020 
other electrodes like I got aluminum
wire<00:03:22.930> here<00:03:26.430> we're<00:03:27.430> getting<00:03:29.490> 1.5<00:03:30.490> pretty<00:03:30.880> much

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
wire here we're getting 1.5 pretty much

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.190 
wire here we're getting 1.5 pretty much
and<00:03:32.490> we<00:03:33.490> grab<00:03:33.700> some<00:03:33.730> random<00:03:34.210> I<00:03:34.750> don't<00:03:35.080> know<00:03:35.140> if

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
and we grab some random I don't know if

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.410 
and we grab some random I don't know if
it's<00:03:35.320> a<00:03:35.410> good<00:03:35.610> yeah<00:03:36.610> that's<00:03:36.880> not<00:03:37.030> good<00:03:37.210> piece

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
it's a good yeah that's not good piece

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.170 
it's a good yeah that's not good piece
but<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:38.020> understand<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.550> interesting

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
but you understand this is interesting

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.350 
but you understand this is interesting
you<00:03:40.660> usually<00:03:40.840> don't<00:03:41.050> see<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.620> copper<00:03:42.370> being<00:03:43.210> a

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
you usually don't see the copper being a

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.420 
you usually don't see the copper being a
positive<00:03:43.780> life<00:03:43.930> do<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.650> mean<00:03:44.800> you<00:03:45.220> usually

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
positive life do you I mean you usually

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.280 
positive life do you I mean you usually
see<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.000> pot<00:03:46.210> copper<00:03:46.750> as<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.080> positive

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
see the pot copper as the positive

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.570 
see the pot copper as the positive
lecture<00:03:47.710> you<00:03:47.830> never<00:03:48.010> see<00:03:48.160> it<00:03:48.220> as<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.340> negative

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
lecture you never see it as a negative

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.160 
lecture you never see it as a negative
electrode<00:03:49.290> it's<00:03:50.290> especially<00:03:50.680> interesting

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
electrode it's especially interesting

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.580 
electrode it's especially interesting
but<00:03:53.170> yeah

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
but yeah

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.670 
but yeah

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
does it rock is called hematite in get

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.330 
does it rock is called hematite in get
on<00:03:56.800> eBay

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
on eBay

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
on eBay
it's<00:03:57.970> basically<00:03:58.540> iron<00:03:58.780> oxides<00:03:59.320> actually<00:04:00.360> mine

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
it's basically iron oxides actually mine

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.590 
it's basically iron oxides actually mine
