the Nvidia physics engine tell us a
little<00:00:34.739> bit<00:00:35.010> about<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.399> character

little bit about the character

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.220 
little bit about the character
progression<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.510> how<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> characters<00:00:37.110> are

progression and how the characters are

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.299 
progression and how the characters are
created<00:00:37.940> sure<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.300> actually<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.050> Raiders<00:00:40.649> we

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
created sure so actually in Raiders we

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.069 
created sure so actually in Raiders we
have<00:00:41.430> what's<00:00:41.610> called<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> classlist<00:00:42.510> system

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
have what's called the classlist system

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.660 
have what's called the classlist system
meaning<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.559> when<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.160> create<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> character

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
meaning that when you create a character

class as you level up you gain skill

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.420 
class as you level up you gain skill
points<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.050> use<00:00:49.500> those<00:00:49.649> skill<00:00:49.980> points<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
points and use those skill points to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.790 
points and use those skill points to
choose<00:00:51.020> different<00:00:52.020> skills<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.440> abilities

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and you get to basically build the class

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.479 
and you get to basically build the class
that<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.840> want<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> game

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that you want to be so what the game

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.819 
that you want to be so what the game
will<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.879> store<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.180> casual<00:00:58.079> versus<00:00:58.800> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
system we take advantage of the Nvidia

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.370 
system we take advantage of the Nvidia
physics<00:01:27.150> engine<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:27.570> allow<00:01:27.750> monsters<00:01:28.259> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
physics engine and we allow monsters to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.170 
physics engine and we allow monsters to
actually<00:01:28.710> physically<00:01:29.100> grabbed<00:01:29.490> players<00:01:29.909> and

additionally<00:01:40.939> we<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.479> system<00:01:42.960> that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
additionally we have a system that

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.870 
additionally we have a system that
allows<00:01:43.500> characters<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.130> actually<00:01:44.369> break<00:01:44.640> off

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
allows characters to actually break off

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.789 
allows characters to actually break off
pieces<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.420> monsters<00:01:45.960> or<00:01:46.229> equipment<00:01:46.530> from<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
pieces of monsters or equipment from the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.889 
pieces of monsters or equipment from the
monsters<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.460> use<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> against<00:01:48.270> them<00:01:48.360> so

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
monsters and use it against them so

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.240 
monsters and use it against them so
maybe<00:01:49.049> you're<00:01:49.229> fighting<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> giant<00:01:49.619> dragon

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
maybe you're fighting a giant dragon

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.100

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.280 

what<00:02:26.010> type<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.220> group<00:02:26.700> configurations<00:02:27.570> do<00:02:28.200> you

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
what type of group configurations do you

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.130 
what type of group configurations do you
have<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:30.120> right<00:02:30.270> now<00:02:30.300> our<00:02:30.420> standard<00:02:31.050> group

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
have so right now our standard group

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.170 
have so right now our standard group
configuration<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.830> about<00:02:32.010> five<00:02:32.250> players<00:02:32.550> I'm

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
configuration is about five players I'm

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.940 
configuration is about five players I'm
in<00:02:33.360> terms<00:02:33.570> of<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> actual<00:02:33.960> class<00:02:34.500> makeup

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
in terms of the actual class makeup

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.490 
in terms of the actual class makeup
again<00:02:35.160> since<00:02:35.460> we<00:02:35.580> have<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> class<00:02:35.940> system

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
again since we have a class system

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.200 
again since we have a class system
usually<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:38.370> either<00:02:38.460> has<00:02:38.670> one<00:02:38.940> designated

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
usually it either has one designated

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.660 
usually it either has one designated
full<00:02:39.840> specs<00:02:40.200> healer<00:02:40.560> or<00:02:40.740> we<00:02:41.190> have<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.370> couple

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
full specs healer or we have a couple

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.340 
full specs healer or we have a couple
different<00:02:41.760> hybrid<00:02:42.300> healers<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.320> really

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
different hybrid healers so it really

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.690 
different hybrid healers so it really
depends<00:02:43.740> on<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.890> group<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.370> depends<00:02:44.580> on

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
depends on the group and it depends on

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.890 
depends on the group and it depends on
how<00:02:44.790> good<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:45.120> are<00:02:45.270> if<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.510> have<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.630> really

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
how good you are if you have a really

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.690 
how good you are if you have a really
good<00:02:46.020> group<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.890> know<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.310> monsters

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
good group and you know the monsters

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.070 
good group and you know the monsters
that<00:02:47.730> you're<00:02:47.910> fighting<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.690> should<00:02:48.900> be<00:02:49.020> able

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
that you're fighting you should be able

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.800 
that you're fighting you should be able

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
to get by with very minimal healing

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
to get by with very minimal healing

example<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.240> system<00:03:21.540> what<00:03:21.660> we<00:03:21.690> have<00:03:21.900> work

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
example of the system what we have work

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.870 
example of the system what we have work
you<00:03:22.530> can<00:03:22.680> break<00:03:22.830> off<00:03:23.010> pieces<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.400> monsters<00:03:23.850> and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
you can break off pieces of monsters and

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.580 
you can break off pieces of monsters and
use<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.209> against<00:03:24.510> them<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:24.660> in<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:25.410> other

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
use it against them so in this other

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.500 
use it against them so in this other
case<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:26.130> lizard<00:03:26.430> man<00:03:26.580> had<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.820> giant<00:03:27.150> mace

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
case that lizard man had a giant mace

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.820 
case that lizard man had a giant mace
