never right at the top but always in the
top<00:00:22.310> 10<00:00:22.699> so<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:23.470> especially<00:00:24.470> specifically

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.370 
top 10 so and especially specifically
here<00:00:25.520> around<00:00:25.699> four<00:00:26.029> I<00:00:26.300> know<00:00:26.840> put<00:00:27.050> it<00:00:27.140> in<00:00:27.230> top<00:00:27.349> 10

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
here around four I know put it in top 10

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.560 
here around four I know put it in top 10
again<00:00:27.770> like<00:00:27.949> you<00:00:28.039> said<00:00:28.070> and<00:00:28.519> after<00:00:29.179> four

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
again like you said and after four

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.579 
again like you said and after four
rounds<00:00:29.720> you're<00:00:29.990> looking<00:00:30.199> pretty<00:00:30.380> good<00:00:30.410> to

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
rounds you're looking pretty good to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.140 
rounds you're looking pretty good to
make<00:00:30.710> them<00:00:30.830> in<00:00:30.949> yeah<00:00:31.849> I've<00:00:32.089> got<00:00:32.419> now<00:00:32.689> a<00:00:32.720> 3<00:00:33.620> 5<00:00:34.160> 7<00:00:34.610> 8

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
make them in yeah I've got now a 3 5 7 8

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.900 
make them in yeah I've got now a 3 5 7 8
so<00:00:35.650> looking<00:00:36.650> good<00:00:36.769> it<00:00:37.430> seems<00:00:37.640> like<00:00:37.699> the

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
so looking good it seems like the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.729 
so looking good it seems like the
British<00:00:38.180> Oh<00:00:38.300> specifically<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.379> European

British Oh specifically the European

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
racers have gotten faster as the race

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.180 
racers have gotten faster as the race
goes<00:00:41.420> on<00:00:41.750> you<00:00:41.989> know<00:00:42.019> round<00:00:42.500> number<00:00:42.710> one<00:00:42.860> it<00:00:43.129> was

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
goes on you know round number one it was

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.400 
goes on you know round number one it was
all<00:00:43.339> Americans<00:00:43.790> on<00:00:43.940> top<00:00:44.150> and<00:00:44.390> then<00:00:44.570> you<00:00:45.140> bloody

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
all Americans on top and then you bloody

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.100 
all Americans on top and then you bloody
brits<00:00:45.680> have<00:00:45.770> been<00:00:45.890> catching<00:00:46.160> up<00:00:46.250> after<00:00:46.489> that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
brits have been catching up after that

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.779 
brits have been catching up after that
we're<00:00:48.110> not<00:00:48.199> used<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.530> jumps<00:00:48.890> no<00:00:49.489> you<00:00:49.550> saw<00:00:49.760> a

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
we're not used to the jumps no you saw a

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.700 
we're not used to the jumps no you saw a
car<00:00:50.059> leaving<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.420> floor<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:50.989> once<00:00:51.320> we<00:00:51.469> get<00:00:51.590> the

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
car leaving the floor so once we get the

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.560 
car leaving the floor so once we get the
hang<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.129> few<00:00:52.609> jump<00:00:52.879> sections<00:00:53.270> out<00:00:53.390> there

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
hang of the few jump sections out there

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.180 
hang of the few jump sections out there
I<00:00:53.600> guess<00:00:53.809> we<00:00:53.960> catch<00:00:54.320> up<00:00:54.350> a<00:00:54.620> little<00:00:54.649> bit<00:00:55.010> with

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
I guess we catch up a little bit with

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.670 
I guess we catch up a little bit with
these<00:00:55.609> guys<00:00:55.820> just<00:00:56.090> fling<00:00:56.899> out<00:00:57.079> there<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:57.590> the

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
these guys just fling out there and the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.349 
these guys just fling out there and the
jumps<00:00:58.129> are<00:00:58.219> just<00:00:58.399> like<00:00:58.550> corners<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:59.059> them<00:00:59.210> they

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
jumps are just like corners to them they

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.389 
jumps are just like corners to them they
meet<00:00:59.539> them<00:00:59.660> every<00:00:59.899> weekend<00:01:00.289> where<00:01:00.469> we<00:01:00.710> meet

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
meet them every weekend where we meet

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.099 
meet them every weekend where we meet
the<00:01:01.430> corners<00:01:01.850> but<00:01:02.090> not<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:02.660> often<00:01:02.809> we<00:01:02.989> have

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
the corners but not so often we have

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.340 
the corners but not so often we have
jumps<00:01:03.469> like<00:01:03.590> this<00:01:04.840> specifically<00:01:05.840> for<00:01:06.050> me<00:01:06.080> I've

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
jumps like this specifically for me I've

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.440 
jumps like this specifically for me I've
got<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.770> wait<00:01:07.310> for<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.640> jumps<00:01:07.940> now<00:01:08.090> just<00:01:08.360> to

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
got the wait for the jumps now just to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.590 
got the wait for the jumps now just to
drop<00:01:08.660> it<00:01:08.810> on<00:01:08.899> top<00:01:08.929> of<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.289> step<00:01:09.649> ups<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.600> like

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
drop it on top of the step ups and like

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.060 
drop it on top of the step ups and like
the<00:01:11.720> table<00:01:11.899> top<00:01:12.200> triple<00:01:12.590> at<00:01:12.679> the<00:01:12.710> end<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:12.979> the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
the table top triple at the end of the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.580 
the table top triple at the end of the
stray<00:01:13.369> just<00:01:13.789> just<00:01:14.390> got<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.690> weight<00:01:14.899> of<00:01:15.110> just

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
stray just just got the weight of just

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.710 
stray just just got the weight of just
doing<00:01:16.160> it<00:01:16.340> naturally<00:01:16.459> now<00:01:16.940> where's<00:01:17.209> the

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
doing it naturally now where's the

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.020 
doing it naturally now where's the
beginning<00:01:18.050> of<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.170> race<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:18.470> felt<00:01:18.679> myself

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
beginning of the race I felt myself

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.520 
beginning of the race I felt myself
inside<00:01:20.030> outside<00:01:20.080> jumped<00:01:21.080> a<00:01:21.110> little<00:01:21.140> bit<00:01:21.410> too

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
inside outside jumped a little bit too

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.830 
inside outside jumped a little bit too
far<00:01:21.770> jumping<00:01:22.220> a<00:01:22.250> bit<00:01:22.399> sure<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:23.119> now<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:23.780> we

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
far jumping a bit sure so now that we

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.449 
far jumping a bit sure so now that we
got<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.080> range<00:01:24.319> of<00:01:24.530> where<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:24.830> drop<00:01:25.099> it<00:01:25.280> in<00:01:25.369> on

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
got the range of where to drop it in on

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:26.859 
got the range of where to drop it in on
the<00:01:25.490> jumps<00:01:25.849> and<00:01:25.970> stuff<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.209> guess<00:01:26.360> we've<00:01:26.539> we've

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
the jumps and stuff I guess we've we've

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.889 
the jumps and stuff I guess we've we've
caught<00:01:27.410> up<00:01:27.530> this<00:01:27.709> afternoon<00:01:28.239> they<00:01:29.239> talk<00:01:29.869> about

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
caught up this afternoon they talk about

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.300 
caught up this afternoon they talk about
one<00:01:30.289> of<00:01:30.319> the<00:01:30.470> things<00:01:30.649> that<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:30.950> car<00:01:31.099> does

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
one of the things that the car does

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.710 
one of the things that the car does
differently<00:01:31.700> made<00:01:31.849> motors<00:01:32.179> that<00:01:32.300> it<00:01:32.420> jumps

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
differently made motors that it jumps

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.800 
differently made motors that it jumps
differently<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:34.580> doesn't<00:01:34.849> go<00:01:34.970> very<00:01:35.000> well<00:01:35.300> mid

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
differently it doesn't go very well mid

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.870 
differently it doesn't go very well mid
mothers<00:01:36.110> don't<00:01:36.259> jump<00:01:36.590> anywhere<00:01:37.310> near<00:01:37.580> as<00:01:37.819> good

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
mothers don't jump anywhere near as good

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.589 
mothers don't jump anywhere near as good
as<00:01:38.179> as<00:01:39.310> rumor<00:01:40.310> because<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.729> Rimma<00:01:40.970> seems<00:01:41.420> to

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
as as rumor because the Rimma seems to

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:42.790 
as as rumor because the Rimma seems to
obviously<00:01:41.989> with<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.170> way<00:01:42.319> out<00:01:42.470> of<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.560> back

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
obviously with the way out of the back

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.710 
obviously with the way out of the back
you<00:01:43.489> can<00:01:43.640> obviously<00:01:43.729> fling<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.390> up<00:01:44.479> on<00:01:44.630> the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
you can obviously fling it up on the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.809 
you can obviously fling it up on the
jump<00:01:44.989> get<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.500> tail<00:01:45.679> in<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.920> air<00:01:46.069> and<00:01:46.670> then

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
jump get the tail in the air and then

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.790 
jump get the tail in the air and then
rip<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:47.209> get<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.420> back<00:01:47.660> but<00:01:47.929> mid<00:01:48.560> motor

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
rip it and get it back but mid motor

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.370 
rip it and get it back but mid motor
pitch<00:01:49.160> is<00:01:49.310> very<00:01:49.340> different<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.239> usually<00:01:51.229> the

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
pitch is very different and usually the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.979 
pitch is very different and usually the
wing<00:01:51.700> usually<00:01:52.700> has<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.149> strength<00:01:53.599> to<00:01:53.720> push

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
wing usually has the strength to push

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:56.139 
wing usually has the strength to push
the<00:01:54.110> back<00:01:54.259> of<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.440> car<00:01:54.649> down<00:01:54.800> a<00:01:54.860> lot<00:01:55.149> where's

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
the back of the car down a lot where's

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.699 
the back of the car down a lot where's
mid<00:01:56.360> mother<00:01:56.569> you<00:01:56.720> can<00:01:56.929> kind<00:01:57.229> of<00:01:57.289> filling<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.649> up

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
mid mother you can kind of filling it up

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.119 
mid mother you can kind of filling it up
and<00:01:57.920> then<00:01:58.009> hang<00:01:58.280> it<00:01:58.310> there<00:01:59.379> but<00:02:00.379> yeah<00:02:00.590> it's<00:02:00.890> a

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:01.129 
and then hang it there but yeah it's a

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:04.029 
and then hang it there but yeah it's a
the<00:02:01.629> mid-<00:02:02.629> after<00:02:02.899> and<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.289> can't<00:02:03.530> really<00:02:03.679> jump

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
the mid- after and you can't really jump

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.490 
the mid- after and you can't really jump
like<00:02:04.369> scrubbing<00:02:04.789> it<00:02:05.000> sideways<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.569> stuff<00:02:05.780> you

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
like scrubbing it sideways and stuff you

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.290 
like scrubbing it sideways and stuff you
have<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.679> kind<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:07.009> square<00:02:07.340> everything<00:02:07.670> up<00:02:07.940> and

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
have to kind of square everything up and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.080 
have to kind of square everything up and
minima<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.319> can<00:02:09.580> obviously<00:02:10.580> come<00:02:10.849> round

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
minima you can obviously come round

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.280 
minima you can obviously come round
faster<00:02:11.569> because<00:02:11.660> i<00:02:11.810> think<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.020> midmost

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
faster because i think the midmost

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.020 
faster because i think the midmost
carrying<00:02:12.709> more<00:02:12.800> corner<00:02:13.069> speed<00:02:13.250> obviously<00:02:13.459> as

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
carrying more corner speed obviously as

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.180 
carrying more corner speed obviously as
why<00:02:14.420> it's<00:02:14.599> showing<00:02:14.660> on<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.110> high<00:02:15.260> grip<00:02:15.500> but

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
why it's showing on the high grip but

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.890 
why it's showing on the high grip but
then<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.580> have<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.730> square<00:02:17.150> up<00:02:17.360> for<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.660> jump

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
then you have to square up for the jump

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.390 
then you have to square up for the jump
whereas<00:02:18.170> midmar<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.709> kind<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.040> carry<00:02:19.310> a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
whereas midmar you kind of carry a

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.459 
whereas midmar you kind of carry a
little<00:02:19.670> bit<00:02:19.790> less<00:02:19.940> corner<00:02:20.269> speed<00:02:20.510> but<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.290> can

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469 
little bit less corner speed but you can

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.440 
little bit less corner speed but you can
completely<00:02:21.799> pin<00:02:22.129> it<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.489> way<00:02:22.609> out<00:02:22.640> doesn't

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
completely pin it on the way out doesn't

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.910 
completely pin it on the way out doesn't
matter<00:02:23.540> where<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:23.900> kind<00:02:24.319> of<00:02:24.379> hit<00:02:24.469> the<00:02:24.620> jump

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
matter where you kind of hit the jump

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.550 
matter where you kind of hit the jump
and<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.310> can

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and you can

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.050 
and you can
control<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.220> bring<00:02:26.489> it<00:02:26.520> back<00:02:26.640> down<00:02:26.819> I

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
control it and bring it back down I

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.640 
control it and bring it back down I
think<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.510> co<00:02:27.660> approved<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.200> obviously<00:02:28.530> at

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
think the co approved that obviously at

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.350 
think the co approved that obviously at
the<00:02:28.739> Royals<00:02:29.280> here<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.459> few<00:02:29.700> weeks<00:02:29.760> back<00:02:30.090> where

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
the Royals here a few weeks back where

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.780 
the Royals here a few weeks back where
he<00:02:30.630> wasn't<00:02:31.410> always<00:02:31.500> necessarily<00:02:31.980> online<00:02:32.520> but

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
he wasn't always necessarily online but

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.430 
he wasn't always necessarily online but
he<00:02:32.880> was<00:02:32.970> just<00:02:33.000> carrying<00:02:33.420> he<00:02:34.170> was<00:02:34.290> just

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
he was just carrying he was just

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.080 
he was just carrying he was just
carrying<00:02:34.650> speed<00:02:35.130> just<00:02:35.340> bellowing<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.880> round

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
carrying speed just bellowing it round

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.300 
carrying speed just bellowing it round
catching<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.720> sideways<00:02:37.140> almost<00:02:37.770> upside<00:02:38.160> down

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
catching it sideways almost upside down

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.339 
catching it sideways almost upside down
sometimes<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.569> think<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.780> proved<00:02:40.140> just

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
sometimes so I think that proved just

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.000 
sometimes so I think that proved just
how<00:02:40.470> much<00:02:40.680> more<00:02:40.950> balanced<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:42.739> remote<00:02:43.739> cause

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
how much more balanced the remote cause

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.830 
how much more balanced the remote cause
I<00:02:44.190> across<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.730> board<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.120> manufacturers<00:02:45.720> I

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
I across the board for manufacturers I

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.229 
I across the board for manufacturers I
don't<00:02:46.019> think<00:02:46.200> any<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.440> them<00:02:46.620> or<00:02:47.220> jump<00:02:47.880> as<00:02:48.060> good

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
don't think any of them or jump as good

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.000 
don't think any of them or jump as good
as<00:02:48.390> any<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.630> their<00:02:48.810> man<00:02:49.019> if<00:02:49.140> any<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.680> their

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
as any of their man if any of their

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.240 
as any of their man if any of their
remote<00:02:50.819> version<00:02:51.269> cars<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.380> after<00:02:53.040> four

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
remote version cars and after four

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.470 
remote version cars and after four
strong<00:02:53.519> runs<00:02:53.790> today<00:02:53.970> do<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.300> have<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
strong runs today do you have a

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.170 
strong runs today do you have a
different<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:56.040> know<00:02:56.130> mindset<00:02:56.910> going<00:02:57.030> into

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
different you know mindset going into

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.030 
different you know mindset going into
tomorrow's<00:02:57.630> final<00:02:57.959> round<00:02:58.170> or<00:02:58.380> are<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:58.890> kind

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
tomorrow's final round or are you kind

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.759 
tomorrow's final round or are you kind
of<00:02:59.130> focused<00:02:59.459> on<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.730> main<00:02:59.850> event<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.810> was<00:03:01.590> gonna

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
of focused on the main event I was gonna

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.800 
of focused on the main event I was gonna
I<00:03:01.860> was<00:03:02.220> going<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.489> test<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.819> few<00:03:02.850> things<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.480> mean

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
I was going to test a few things I mean

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.080 
I was going to test a few things I mean
I<00:03:03.840> might<00:03:04.170> try<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.739> might<00:03:05.130> try<00:03:05.340> one<00:03:05.640> less<00:03:05.850> right

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
I might try I might try one less right

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.030 
I might try I might try one less right
on<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.269> rear<00:03:06.480> spring<00:03:06.780> but<00:03:07.019> I'm<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:07.620> focused

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
on a rear spring but I'm just focused

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.680 
on a rear spring but I'm just focused
now<00:03:08.190> with<00:03:08.370> what<00:03:08.549> I<00:03:08.580> have<00:03:08.850> it's<00:03:09.239> good<00:03:09.480> it's

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
now with what I have it's good it's

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.970 
now with what I have it's good it's
consistent<00:03:10.260> hopefully<00:03:10.560> it's<00:03:10.650> gonna<00:03:10.739> be<00:03:10.860> some

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
consistent hopefully it's gonna be some

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.890 
consistent hopefully it's gonna be some
crashes<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.940> finals<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:12.630> pick<00:03:12.780> up

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
crashes in the finals and I can pick up

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.839 
crashes in the finals and I can pick up
some<00:03:13.080> spots<00:03:13.709> from<00:03:13.890> there<00:03:14.069> but<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.340> think<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.760> have

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
some spots from there but I think I have

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.910 
some spots from there but I think I have
the<00:03:14.880> speed<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.900> have<00:03:16.380> now<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.799> that's

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
the speed and that I have now and that's

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.199

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
day one you know if you notice the lap

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.680 
day one you know if you notice the lap

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
times about dental I the 28 29 and then

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.510 
times about dental I the 28 29 and then
they<00:04:54.810> just<00:04:54.990> said<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.230> same<00:04:55.410> which<00:04:55.620> is<00:04:55.650> really

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
they just said the same which is really

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.740 
they just said the same which is really
good<00:04:56.730> you<00:04:56.760> want<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.090> always<00:04:57.270> want<00:04:57.450> a<00:04:57.510> really

nice<00:04:57.900> consistent<00:04:58.410> right<00:04:58.590> it<00:04:59.160> is<00:04:59.280> quite

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
nice consistent right it is quite

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.370 
nice consistent right it is quite
similar<00:04:59.760> grip<00:05:00.210> level<00:05:00.480> to<00:05:00.600> Asha<00:05:00.720> turf<00:05:01.050> what

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
similar grip level to Asha turf what

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.830 
similar grip level to Asha turf what
it's<00:05:01.830> just<00:05:01.980> a<00:05:02.070> little<00:05:02.310> bit<00:05:02.580> more<00:05:02.790> give<00:05:03.090> on<00:05:03.330> the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
it's just a little bit more give on the

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.710 
it's just a little bit more give on the
on<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.620> clay<00:05:04.950> so<00:05:05.430> it's<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.090> little<00:05:06.240> bit<00:05:06.360> easier

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
on the clay so it's a little bit easier

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.530 
on the clay so it's a little bit easier
to<00:05:06.750> drive<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:08.700> know<00:05:08.820> having<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.180> couple<00:05:09.480> of

the final because I'm not gonna be TQ in
it<00:05:47.640> but<00:05:48.360> I<00:05:48.540> mean<00:05:48.840> if<00:05:49.110> I<00:05:49.260> had<00:05:49.380> to<00:05:49.470> choose<00:05:49.530> I<00:05:49.860> will

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
it but I mean if I had to choose I will

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.530 
it but I mean if I had to choose I will
choose<00:05:50.190> maybe<00:05:50.490> second<00:05:50.850> or<00:05:50.970> third<00:05:51.150> will<00:05:51.330> be<00:05:51.420> the

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
choose maybe second or third will be the

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.020 
choose maybe second or third will be the
best<00:05:51.720> place<00:05:52.080> I<00:05:52.320> think<00:05:52.980> you<00:05:53.610> think<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:53.940> the

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
best place I think you think that the

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.520 
best place I think you think that the
tracks<00:05:54.240> gonna<00:05:54.420> be<00:05:54.510> tough<00:05:54.720> to<00:05:54.840> race<00:05:54.990> on<00:05:55.170> because

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
tracks gonna be tough to race on because

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.650 
tracks gonna be tough to race on because
of<00:05:55.770> some<00:05:56.310> of<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.430> obstacles<00:05:56.640> and<00:05:57.030> just<00:05:57.210> the

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
of some of the obstacles and just the

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.940 
of some of the obstacles and just the
speed<00:05:57.900> that<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.200> cars<00:05:58.410> are<00:05:58.530> traveling<00:05:58.890> in

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
speed that the cars are traveling in

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.380 
speed that the cars are traveling in
nearly<00:05:59.220> every<00:05:59.310> section<00:05:59.670> of<00:05:59.760> the<00:05:59.850> track<00:05:59.970> yeah

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
nearly every section of the track yeah

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.110 
nearly every section of the track yeah
the<00:06:00.630> government<00:06:01.380> so<00:06:01.620> fast<00:06:02.010> and<00:06:02.310> obviously<00:06:02.970> the

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
the government so fast and obviously the

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.990 
the government so fast and obviously the
Jones<00:06:03.810> on<00:06:04.200> the<00:06:04.230> grip<00:06:04.740> level<00:06:05.160> it's<00:06:05.580> gonna<00:06:05.820> be

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
Jones on the grip level it's gonna be

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000 
Jones on the grip level it's gonna be
hard<00:06:06.180> to<00:06:06.210> raise<00:06:06.480> well<00:06:06.930> you<00:06:07.500> know<00:06:07.680> it<00:06:07.740> should<00:06:07.920> be

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
hard to raise well you know it should be

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.190 
hard to raise well you know it should be
