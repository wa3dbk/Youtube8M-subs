okay<00:00:00.570> guys<00:00:00.780> I<00:00:00.930> want<00:00:00.960> to<00:00:01.110> talk<00:00:01.290> about<00:00:01.469> why

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
okay guys I want to talk about why

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.679 
okay guys I want to talk about why
people<00:00:01.829> fail<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.639> increase<00:00:03.240> their<00:00:03.510> vertical

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
people fail to increase their vertical

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.410 
people fail to increase their vertical
explosion<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.799> want<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.220> lay<00:00:05.430> down<00:00:05.460> exactly<00:00:06.299> how

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
explosion I want to lay down exactly how

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.940 
explosion I want to lay down exactly how
you<00:00:06.600> can<00:00:06.690> start<00:00:07.080> increasing<00:00:07.350> your<00:00:07.710> vertical

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
you can start increasing your vertical

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.450 
you can start increasing your vertical
in<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.429> next<00:00:09.120> two<00:00:09.360> weeks<00:00:09.599> or<00:00:09.870> quicker<00:00:10.460> the

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
in the next two weeks or quicker the

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.640 
in the next two weeks or quicker the
first<00:00:11.700> thing<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.150> what<00:00:12.750> why<00:00:13.019> do<00:00:13.080> people<00:00:13.469> not

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
first thing is what why do people not

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.680 
first thing is what why do people not
succeed<00:00:14.070> first<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> lack<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.059> knowledge<00:00:15.299> of

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
succeed first is a lack of knowledge of

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.380 
succeed first is a lack of knowledge of
correct<00:00:16.170> principles<00:00:16.920> second<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> lack<00:00:18.359> of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
correct principles second is a lack of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.290 
correct principles second is a lack of
knowledge<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:19.230> correct<00:00:20.039> practices<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
knowledge of correct practices and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.480 
knowledge of correct practices and
techniques<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.710> basically<00:00:23.130> that's<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
techniques so basically that's the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.269 
techniques so basically that's the
difference<00:00:23.789> between<00:00:23.850> what<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.380> versus

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
difference between what you do versus

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.009 
difference between what you do versus
how<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.420> there's<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.960> big

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
how you do it and there's a big

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.300 
how you do it and there's a big
difference<00:00:28.320> I'm<00:00:28.650> going<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.830> go<00:00:28.920> into<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
difference I'm going to go into that a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.279 
difference I'm going to go into that a
little<00:00:29.429> bit<00:00:29.640> later<00:00:29.789> third<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.840> all<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.109> lack

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
little bit later third of all is a lack

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.400 
little bit later third of all is a lack
of<00:00:31.320> discipline<00:00:32.009> or<00:00:32.219> ability<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.360> apply<00:00:33.690> proper

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
of discipline or ability to apply proper

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.010 
of discipline or ability to apply proper
principles<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.219> techniques<00:00:36.020> consistently

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
principles and techniques consistently

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.860 
principles and techniques consistently
over<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> period<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.309> time<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.360> last<00:00:39.629> one

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
over a period of time and the last one

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.900 
over a period of time and the last one
is<00:00:40.020> simply<00:00:40.379> lack<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.770> proper<00:00:41.129> nutrition<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
is simply lack of proper nutrition the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.310 
is simply lack of proper nutrition the
first<00:00:42.180> thing<00:00:42.360> you've<00:00:42.480> got<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.719> understand<00:00:43.170> is

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
first thing you've got to understand is

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.220 
first thing you've got to understand is
strength<00:00:43.770> plus<00:00:44.340> quickness<00:00:44.539> equals<00:00:45.539> explosion

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
strength plus quickness equals explosion

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.229 
strength plus quickness equals explosion
strength<00:00:46.710> plus<00:00:46.980> quickness<00:00:47.070> equals<00:00:47.700> explosion

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
strength plus quickness equals explosion

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.450 
strength plus quickness equals explosion
so<00:00:48.420> when<00:00:49.050> strengthening<00:00:49.770> quickness<00:00:50.160> are

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
so when strengthening quickness are

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.160 
so when strengthening quickness are
applied<00:00:50.820> during<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.300> same<00:00:51.660> muscle

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
applied during the same muscle

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.160 
applied during the same muscle
contraction<00:00:53.239> explosion<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> result<00:00:54.870> so

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
contraction explosion is the result so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.229 
contraction explosion is the result so
you've<00:00:55.800> got<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> maximize<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.879> muscle

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you've got to maximize your muscle

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.420 
you've got to maximize your muscle
strength<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.870> you've<00:00:58.440> got<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.680> maximize<00:00:59.280> your

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
strength and you've got to maximize your

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.790 
strength and you've got to maximize your
muscle<00:00:59.640> quickness<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.800> neurological

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
muscle quickness and neurological

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.969 
muscle quickness and neurological
response<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.550> create<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.059> explosion<00:01:03.979> now

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
response to create that explosion now

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.730 
response to create that explosion now
endurance<00:01:05.519> versus<00:01:05.820> explosion<00:01:06.650> you<00:01:07.650> know

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
endurance versus explosion you know

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320 
endurance versus explosion you know
training<00:01:08.040> your<00:01:08.220> explosion<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.880> counter

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
training your explosion is counter

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
training your explosion is counter
intuitive<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.500> out<00:01:10.619> there<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.979> train

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
intuitive you go out there and you train

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.520 
intuitive you go out there and you train
for<00:01:11.220> an<00:01:11.520> hour<00:01:11.689> working<00:01:12.689> very<00:01:13.020> hard<00:01:13.260> you're

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
for an hour working very hard you're

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.870 
for an hour working very hard you're
sweating<00:01:14.010> you're<00:01:14.040> training<00:01:14.369> hard<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
sweating you're training hard and you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.490 
sweating you're training hard and you
feel<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.390> burn<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.869> think<00:01:16.080> you're<00:01:16.229> training

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
feel the burn you think you're training

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.340 
feel the burn you think you're training
correctly<00:01:16.830> most<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:19.110> have

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
correctly most of you are not you have

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.510 
correctly most of you are not you have
to<00:01:19.560> train<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.040> what's<00:01:20.189> called<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
to train in what's called the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
to train in what's called the
improvement<00:01:21.270> zone<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.630> you're<00:01:21.990> maximum

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
improvement zone if you're maximum

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.950 
improvement zone if you're maximum
vertical<00:01:22.680> jump<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.250> 32<00:01:23.759> inches<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.299> you're

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
vertical jump is 32 inches and you're

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.990 
vertical jump is 32 inches and you're
most<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.530> your<00:01:25.650> training<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.189> done<00:01:26.400> jumping<00:01:26.880> at

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
most of your training is done jumping at

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.530 
most of your training is done jumping at
a<00:01:27.590> 12-inch<00:01:28.590> intensity<00:01:29.430> you're<00:01:30.210> training

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
a 12-inch intensity you're training

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.109 
a 12-inch intensity you're training
yourself<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.079> jump<00:01:31.320> 12<00:01:31.619> inches<00:01:32.009> over<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.880> long

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
yourself to jump 12 inches over a long

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.700 
yourself to jump 12 inches over a long
period<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.540> time<00:01:33.630> you're<00:01:34.049> training<00:01:34.439> you're

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
period of time you're training you're

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.370 
period of time you're training you're
jumping<00:01:35.340> endurance<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.200> all

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
jumping endurance and so this is all

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.490 
jumping endurance and so this is all
about<00:01:37.619> quality<00:01:38.400> versus<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> quantity<00:01:39.689> let<00:01:40.439> me

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
about quality versus the quantity let me

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.660 
about quality versus the quantity let me
give<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.710> another<00:01:40.860> example<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> were<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
give you another example if you were a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.580 
give you another example if you were a
sprinter<00:01:42.060> training<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> hundred<00:01:43.409> meter

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
sprinter training for the hundred meter

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.469 
sprinter training for the hundred meter
dash<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.280> your<00:01:44.759> coach<00:01:45.000> said<00:01:45.210> you've<00:01:45.360> got<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
dash and your coach said you've got to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.999 
dash and your coach said you've got to
run<00:01:45.689> two<00:01:45.899> miles<00:01:46.110> every<00:01:46.350> day<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:46.890> going

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
run two miles every day and it's going
