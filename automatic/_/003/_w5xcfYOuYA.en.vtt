from<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.620> start<00:02:11.800> of<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:11.980> Academy<00:02:12.490> so<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:13.030> know

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
from the start of the Academy so I know

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.050 
from the start of the Academy so I know
that<00:02:14.170> he<00:02:14.320> can<00:02:14.470> tell<00:02:14.680> me<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.370> give<00:02:15.550> me<00:02:15.580> brutal

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
that he can tell me and give me brutal

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.910

honest<00:02:16.570> opinions<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.200> can<00:02:17.380> do<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.560> same<00:02:17.740> to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
honest opinions and I can do the same to

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.490 
honest opinions and I can do the same to
him<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.370> think<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:19.570> communication<00:02:20.350> and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
him so I think the communication and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.410 
him so I think the communication and
working<00:02:20.770> relationship<00:02:21.370> will<00:02:21.580> work<00:02:21.970> quite

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
working relationship will work quite

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.220 
working relationship will work quite
well<00:02:22.800> looking<00:02:23.800> forward<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.130> it
