00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:14.110
 This blizzard I do not have enough strength to 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.560
 open the door and then close it 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.090
 guys iceland and we are on a test drive 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.400
 I need a driver discovery sport 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.410
 did not expect such weather in the last 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.900
 half an hour we probably struck advanced 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.810
 three hundred meters we have a caravan now we 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.140
 discovery we pull out defender 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.610
 literally dragging them on the cable because 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.610
 no other choice but still 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:42.280
 we hope that we have the best weather 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.899
 I just break my own now 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.760
 it seems we are now ready to go pulled out 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.210
 last car and we 'll go now 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.670
 forward 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.250
 we hope that the weather still roam 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.010
 and we can more in a calmer 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.370
 setting tell you what discovery 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.100
 sport 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.160
 good what he has flaws and what 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.870
 different from freelander ii which by 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.870
 shift came go 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.670
 Alas 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.920
 the elements did not subside hydra meteorologists gave 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.020
 help in this area of ​​Iceland speed 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.479
 winds exceeded 200 kilometers per hour 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.979
 snowstorm from yes cannot be reduced visibility 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.380
 car with included 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.270
 foglights and emergency lights could 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.750
 discern no more than a dozen 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.990
 meters 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.469
 slightly behind the lead and lost everything 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.929
 the road 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.119
 movement speed did not exceed 15 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.609
 kilometers per hour and through the snow drifts 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.670
 had to haul cars in tow 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:56.039
 clinging them to defender s in general not 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.619
 test and endurance testing machines and 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.560
 on driving skills and yet 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.110
 some conclusions can be made first and 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.170
 the main discovery sport car at all 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.220
 other than freelander to replace 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.379
 to whom he came 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.989
 although technically the filling is very similar 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.459
 and after all discovery sport is built on 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.739
 upgraded platform 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.440
 Ranger to his faith and that in his 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.930
 all born from freelander a and motor 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.139
 and the same I managed to ride the version with 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.299
 240 strong petrol turbo and on 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.810
 190 turbo diesel engine 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.810
 horses 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.609
 both work in tandem with 9 speed 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.139
 with a machine to fight off-road 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.639
 helps all-wheel drive transmission 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:39.299
 terrain response 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:41.220
 and a decent ground clearance of 212 millimeters so 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.769
 what discovery sport is different 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.810
 in that it is slightly lower but longer 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.370
 freelander a and besides the five local 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.130
 options are offered cars with 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.079
 landing formula 5 + 2 I mean with 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.959
 third row of seats for teens 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.000
 also that the level of equipment and 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.150
 quality finishing materials raised 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.560
 to a new height and and traces it to the beginner 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.550
 may not reach out 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.000
 that freelander he walked away 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.040
 it is a fact including in the price the most 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.340
 modest discovery sport with a 150-strong 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.730
 Diesel pipes estimated at 950,000 million 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.960
 rubles is expensive and the price of top versions 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.870
 approaching two and a half 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.670
 million so the price niche which 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.630
 held freelander practically 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.750
 released 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.790
 what's more remarkable discovery sport 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.330
 if he has any special advantages 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.830
 or disadvantages about this I will tell in 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.830
 upcoming issues of the magazine behind the wheel
