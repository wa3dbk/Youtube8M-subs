00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 the history of the great kingdoms tells 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.560
 the story that one einar petterson 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.420
 scan twist went to sea fleeing 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.759
 his captivity at the hands of the army 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.460
 Japanese was the year 1941 when the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.949
 chance and the marine currents led to 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.039
 ainara to an unknown archipelago 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.990
 somewhere in the Pacific Ocean 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.390
 there I would discover a world totally 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.000
 new in which the evolution of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.130
 species would have followed a ways 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.969
 totally different from the rest of the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.329
 planet the archipelago baptized more 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.850
 late as ji ji ji yai islands was 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.800
 inhabited by a series of strange races 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.079
 of small mammals that had 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.989
 developed its appendices the salts of 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.230
 an extraordinary way adapting in 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.360
 each case to your needs 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.649
 despite the fantastic discovery of 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.010
 Indar was not until 1957 when the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.530
 German naturalist will do 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.960
 He made a scientific study about 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.869
 them collecting the data in the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.560
 monograph vaughn of will come rino grad in 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:16.189
 ttia eat the ri no serious or southers 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.520
 according to the baptisms pump that were a 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.490
 species of animals that by isolation 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.020
 they evolved in different ways 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.960
 using their noses for 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.659
 more disparate functions among them 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.119
 we found some that used the 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.880
 long nasal appendages to fish 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.090
 others to walk and hold on to 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.210
 other branches to perch on the ground 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.700
 and catch insects with their sticky tails 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.009
 the stump teacher who picked up on his 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.470
 book all the data on these 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.890
 small beings and I accompany them with a 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.140
 series of sketches that unfortunately is 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.080
 the only thing that has been preserved about 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.149
 them since the atomic tests that 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.399
 carried out in the area at the beginning of 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.649
 the 70s provoked a series of 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.180
 seismic movements that sank everything 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.460
 the archipelago and with the whole 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.700
 the evidence of this strange redoubt 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.970
 zoo included the pond teacher 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.260
 that according to account disappeared together 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.260
 with the archipelago
