00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
into it so we care about finally

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.359 
into it so we care about finally
releasing<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> child<00:01:07.560> dreamed<00:01:07.950> of

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
releasing it what if a child dreamed of

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.679 
releasing it what if a child dreamed of
becoming<00:01:08.490> something<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.210> than<00:01:09.510> what

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
becoming something other than what

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.490 
becoming something other than what
society<00:01:09.720> had<00:01:10.260> intended

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.539 

what<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.680> child<00:01:13.710> aspired<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.490> something

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
what if a child aspired to something

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.440 
what if a child aspired to something
greater<00:01:16.549> there's<00:01:17.549> enough<00:01:17.759> lot<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.030> time<00:01:18.180> spent

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
greater there's enough lot of time spent

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.289 
greater there's enough lot of time spent
encrypted<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> film<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.820> feel<00:01:21.000> that

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
encrypted in the film do you feel that

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.719 
encrypted in the film do you feel that
adds<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.200> story<00:01:22.469> I<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:23.219> it<00:01:23.490> does<00:01:23.700> very

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
adds to the story I think it does very

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.510 
adds to the story I think it does very
much<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.450> when<00:01:25.079> it<00:01:25.200> comes<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.649> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
much so when it comes to the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.940 
much so when it comes to the
introduction<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.210> Krypton<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.740> see

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
introduction of Krypton you get to see

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.740 
introduction of Krypton you get to see
how<00:01:29.100> alien<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> world<00:01:29.819> it<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.299> comparison

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
how alien the world it is in comparison

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.870 
how alien the world it is in comparison
to<00:01:30.780> earth<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.069> get<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> see<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> huge

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
to earth and so you get to see the huge

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.580 
to earth and so you get to see the huge
difference<00:01:33.360> between<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.750> two<00:01:33.869> peoples<00:01:34.319> and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
difference between the two peoples and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.209 
difference between the two peoples and
therefore<00:01:36.049> cavils<00:01:37.049> dilemma<00:01:37.530> when<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> comes

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
therefore cavils dilemma when it comes

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.399 
therefore cavils dilemma when it comes
to<00:01:38.429> choice<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.240> great<00:01:39.390> thing<00:01:39.539> about<00:01:39.569> Krypton

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
to choice the great thing about Krypton

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.929 
to choice the great thing about Krypton
featuring<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:40.920> much<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.429> you<00:01:41.520> say<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.789> does

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
featuring so much as you say it does

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.539 
featuring so much as you say it does

that job boy inside he's always been
Clark<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.950> he<00:01:50.009> always<00:01:50.130> knows<00:01:50.869> that<00:01:51.869> he<00:01:52.409> is

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759

essentially<00:01:57.899> there's<00:01:58.110> definitely<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> dual

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
essentially there's definitely a dual

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.490 
essentially there's definitely a dual
