that so I put mine like that barber and
really<00:03:16.390> bend<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.799> really<00:03:18.040> want

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.290 

you<00:03:23.960> really<00:03:24.319> want<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:25.100> make<00:03:25.250> sure<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:26.120> move

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
you really want to make sure you move

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.150 
you really want to make sure you move
your<00:03:26.569> like<00:03:27.080> hip<00:03:27.319> bones<00:03:27.590> out<00:03:28.209> bend<00:03:29.209> your<00:03:29.540> knees

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
your like hip bones out bend your knees

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.620 
your like hip bones out bend your knees
and<00:03:31.160> then<00:03:32.260> squeeze<00:03:33.260> your<00:03:33.950> abs<00:03:34.360> your<00:03:35.360> belly

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
and then squeeze your abs your belly

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.199 
and then squeeze your abs your belly
muscles<00:03:35.900> because<00:03:36.830> you<00:03:37.700> don't<00:03:37.880> want<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.090> go

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
muscles because you don't want to go

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.610 
muscles because you don't want to go
because<00:03:38.569> if<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:38.780> don't<00:03:38.900> squeeze<00:03:39.410> those

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
because if you don't squeeze those

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.230 
because if you don't squeeze those
you're<00:03:39.800> going<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.010> go<00:03:40.100> like<00:03:40.250> really<00:03:40.610> back<00:03:40.940> down

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
you're going to go like really back down

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.120 
you're going to go like really back down
and<00:03:41.450> hurt<00:03:41.720> your<00:03:41.870> wrist<00:03:42.050> or<00:03:42.440> land<00:03:42.740> on<00:03:42.830> your<00:03:42.980> head

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
and hurt your wrist or land on your head

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.400 
and hurt your wrist or land on your head
so<00:03:43.420> if<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.540> squeeze<00:03:44.810> those<00:03:44.990> you'll<00:03:45.170> go<00:03:45.290> down

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
so if you squeeze those you'll go down

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.870 
so if you squeeze those you'll go down
slower<00:03:45.800> and<00:03:46.160> land<00:03:46.430> on<00:03:46.640> wrist<00:03:47.300> softer<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:49.730> if

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
slower and land on wrist softer so if

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.340 
slower and land on wrist softer so if
you<00:03:50.000> don't<00:03:50.150> have<00:03:50.270> very<00:03:50.360> good<00:03:50.480> add<00:03:50.720> muscles<00:03:51.170> you

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
you don't have very good add muscles you

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.610 
you don't have very good add muscles you
might<00:03:51.530> want<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:51.800> work<00:03:51.980> those<00:03:52.280> out<00:03:52.550> because

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
might want to work those out because

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.560 
might want to work those out because
it's<00:03:54.620> gonna<00:03:54.800> hurt<00:03:54.980> it<00:03:55.550> off<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:57.700> now<00:03:58.700> I'm<00:03:59.180> going
