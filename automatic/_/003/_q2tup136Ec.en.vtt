now you're gonna pour about half of your

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.210 
now you're gonna pour about half of your
batter<00:02:13.420> into<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.110> bowl<00:02:14.290> doesn't<00:02:14.590> have<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.100> be

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
batter into the bowl doesn't have to be

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.670 
batter into the bowl doesn't have to be
exact<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.850> will<00:02:16.000> rise<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.750> lot<00:02:17.140> when<00:02:17.530> it's

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
exact it will rise a lot when it's

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.130 
exact it will rise a lot when it's
baking<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.580> we're<00:02:19.420> gonna<00:02:19.510> bake<00:02:19.780> two<00:02:20.110> cakes

baking and we're gonna bake two cakes
we're<00:02:20.740> gonna<00:02:20.830> bake<00:02:21.100> two<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.460> these<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:21.850> save

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
we're gonna bake two of these so save

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.300 
we're gonna bake two of these so save

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
the other half of your batter go do you

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.280 
the other half of your batter go do you
there<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:25.090> have<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.720> now<00:02:26.020> you're<00:02:26.170> gonna

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
there you have it and now you're gonna

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.190 
there you have it and now you're gonna
heat<00:02:26.620> your<00:02:26.650> oven<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.190> 330<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:28.960> are<00:02:29.050> gonna

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
heat your oven to 330 and we are gonna

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.290 
heat your oven to 330 and we are gonna
slow<00:02:29.740> bake<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.400> reason<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.910> do<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.120> is

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
slow bake it the reason I do this is

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.480 
slow bake it the reason I do this is
because<00:02:31.660> it's<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.230> very<00:02:32.260> dense<00:02:32.740> cake<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.400> you

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
because it's a very dense cake so you

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.430 
because it's a very dense cake so you
don't<00:02:33.700> want<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.120> burn<00:02:34.300> so<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.170> set<00:02:35.350> it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
don't want it to burn so you just set it

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.160 
don't want it to burn so you just set it
to<00:02:35.560> 330<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.370> then<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.610> bake<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.820> for<00:02:37.120> about<00:02:37.270> 28

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
to 330 and then you bake it for about 28

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.290 
to 330 and then you bake it for about 28
minutes<00:02:38.590> but<00:02:38.950> just<00:02:38.980> keep<00:02:39.340> your<00:02:39.520> eye<00:02:39.550> on<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.850> and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
minutes but just keep your eye on it and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.720 
minutes but just keep your eye on it and
you<00:02:40.810> can<00:02:40.990> use<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> toothpick<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:42.130> poke<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.520> in

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
you can use a toothpick to poke it in

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.030 
you can use a toothpick to poke it in
and<00:02:43.030> out<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.510> cake<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:44.290> see<00:02:44.470> if<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.770> ready

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
and out of the cake to see if it's ready

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.580 
and out of the cake to see if it's ready
once<00:02:45.850> both<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.180> your<00:02:46.480> cakes<00:02:46.780> are<00:02:47.050> done<00:02:47.290> baking

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
once both of your cakes are done baking

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.170 
once both of your cakes are done baking
you're<00:02:47.800> gonna<00:02:48.070> remove<00:02:48.610> them<00:02:48.790> from<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.150> oven

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
you're gonna remove them from the oven

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.140 
you're gonna remove them from the oven
and<00:02:49.810> allow<00:02:49.900> them<00:02:50.410> plenty<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:51.070> time<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.490> cool

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
and allow them plenty of time to cool

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.090 
and allow them plenty of time to cool
because<00:02:52.780> if<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.470> do<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:53.740> while<00:02:53.950> they're

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
because if you do this while they're

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.920 
because if you do this while they're
still<00:02:54.340> warm<00:02:54.610> they<00:02:54.820> are<00:02:54.850> gonna<00:02:55.030> fall<00:02:55.330> apart<00:02:55.480> and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
still warm they are gonna fall apart and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.260 
still warm they are gonna fall apart and
now<00:02:56.350> we<00:02:56.410> are<00:02:56.680> gonna<00:02:56.800> shape<00:02:57.160> them<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.490> look<00:02:58.030> like

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
now we are gonna shape them to look like

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.380 
now we are gonna shape them to look like
a<00:02:58.480> science<00:02:58.930> beaker<00:02:59.490> look<00:03:00.490> at<00:03:00.640> these<00:03:00.760> they<00:03:01.150> just

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
a science beaker look at these they just

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.100 
a science beaker look at these they just
