00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.799
 I read from undemanding 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.229
 the end 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.229
 This book is the story of the correspondence 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.230
 one in no longer young 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.679
 and weird 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.399
 you are parks 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.399
 that in Halle with is a journalist 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.359
 if in the department visions 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.510
 and a dispute is a teacher at a village school 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.810
 she writes to her beloved record 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.770
 sign back 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.770
 until the end, the two of them stay with each other 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.940
 they summon love until the end 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.220
 and claim that his beloved beyond Mr. facts 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.670
 against all probability 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.670
 the sadness of the loneliness of aging 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.120
 until the end 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.680
 is she meeting each other 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.710
 perhaps 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.050
 is not one 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.490
 the two awake 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.960
 we are in the mountains 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.050
 Anushka 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.280
 Constantini after and smooth Hellmich 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.240
 go through 'mix them together 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.240
 beating heart 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.280
 he goes down 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.670
 as if he had 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.670
 an invisible burden on his back 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.790
 more corn field down 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.420
 and stay on the ground for a while 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.060
 pressed the hand to the place 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.670
 our human heart 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.540
 to suspect 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.780
 you give 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.110
 and soon under something invisible 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.320
 the sky seems to be on him 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.320
 but before he got away from Ben 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.320
 he was heard 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.600
 the word he secretly spoke 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.609
 nobody would have 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:11.819
 a nobody heard it 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.759
 and this is done 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.609
 therefore, she descends the slope 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.609
 go with her pluck Stauder journeyman Wolgast 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.269
 she is not trying to laugh trains lies the flutter of her smile 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.129
 To be enough you are only twice in life 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.539
 only twice 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.539
 at the beginning of the path and at the very end 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.869
 but she does not know 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.499
 she did not suspect it and shines 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:39.779
 ignorant 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.779
 the lighter 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:46.439
 one thing stays the touch 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.059
 hang in the branches 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.559
 she turns back 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.709
 and puts the cloth gently around the shoulders again 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.899
 Once a handful of snow fall from one of the firs on the head 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.269
 and slips her Amazon coat collar as she looks up 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:08.049
 a bird sits at the top of the tree and speaks 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.829
 she looks past a bird in the clouds as a mistake Erfort flown 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.079
 but no 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.079
 he sits there addressing 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.429
 she descends the slope Cannes 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.909
 and kills in the run the soft dead of the none 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.199
 with all the strength she has against the tree trunks 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.639
 and some snow falls in the snow 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.329
 who seems to be of a different nature in the foreground 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.489
 he's on the digi 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.709
 dark 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.920
 as if he were the essence of the earth 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.750
 to grab
