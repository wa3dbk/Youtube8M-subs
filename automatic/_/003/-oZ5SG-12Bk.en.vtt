you<00:01:35.710> finally<00:01:35.950> get<00:01:36.190> a<00:01:36.250> handle<00:01:36.580> on<00:01:36.670> how<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.910> game

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
you finally get a handle on how the game

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.210 
you finally get a handle on how the game
plays<00:01:37.390> but<00:01:38.050> once<00:01:38.230> you<00:01:38.320> get<00:01:38.440> it<00:01:38.560> down<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:39.040> game

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
plays but once you get it down the game

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.190 
plays but once you get it down the game
to<00:01:39.340> come<00:01:39.520> so<00:01:39.730> much<00:01:39.880> more<00:01:40.090> enjoyable<00:01:40.210> new<00:01:41.050> to

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
to come so much more enjoyable new to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.270 
to come so much more enjoyable new to
the<00:01:41.290> series<00:01:41.470> though<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:41.830> that<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.040> can<00:01:42.100> now

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
the series though is that you can now

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.710 
the series though is that you can now
toggle<00:01:42.700> between<00:01:42.760> three<00:01:43.210> different<00:01:43.240> speeds

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
toggle between three different speeds

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.480 
toggle between three different speeds
with<00:01:43.990> Sonic<00:01:44.410> that<00:01:44.560> starts<00:01:44.830> with<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.010> continuous

take<00:01:47.590> off<00:01:47.740> out<00:01:47.920> of<00:01:47.950> sprint<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.700> can<00:01:48.850> even

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
take off out of sprint and you can even

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.610 
take off out of sprint and you can even
give<00:01:49.270> yourself<00:01:49.540> another<00:01:49.810> burst<00:01:50.080> of<00:01:50.230> speed<00:01:50.350> by

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
give yourself another burst of speed by

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.440 
give yourself another burst of speed by
holding<00:01:50.950> down<00:01:50.980> ZL<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.670> perform<00:01:52.000> sonic

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
coinciding with a different environment

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.670 
coinciding with a different environment
sure<00:04:13.359> they're<00:04:13.629> not<00:04:13.810> all<00:04:13.989> songs<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:14.500> will<00:04:14.590> get

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
sure they're not all songs that will get

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.960 
sure they're not all songs that will get
stuck<00:04:14.889> in<00:04:14.979> your<00:04:15.069> head<00:04:15.280> but<00:04:15.519> I<00:04:15.549> did<00:04:15.760> have<00:04:15.940> a

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
stuck in your head but I did have a

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.610 
stuck in your head but I did have a
particular<00:04:16.449> fondness<00:04:16.690> for<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.169> title<00:04:17.470> theme

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
particular fondness for the title theme

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.349 
particular fondness for the title theme
in<00:04:17.889> lost<00:04:18.190> world<00:04:18.370> does<00:04:18.579> feel<00:04:18.760> short<00:04:19.060> in<00:04:19.150> terms

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
in lost world does feel short in terms

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.819 
in lost world does feel short in terms
of<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:19.539> number<00:04:19.780> of<00:04:19.810> levels<00:04:20.169> it<00:04:20.260> has<00:04:20.289> as<00:04:20.680> there

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
of the number of levels it has as there

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.560 
of the number of levels it has as there
are<00:04:20.889> only<00:04:21.010> four<00:04:21.370> main<00:04:21.549> stages<00:04:21.789> at<00:04:22.090> each<00:04:22.240> will

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
are only four main stages at each will

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.939 
are only four main stages at each will
but<00:04:22.990> that<00:04:23.080> doesn't<00:04:23.380> mean<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.620> won't<00:04:23.710> get<00:04:23.919> a

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
but that doesn't mean you won't get a

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.469 
but that doesn't mean you won't get a
lot<00:04:24.010> of<00:04:24.250> playtime<00:04:24.610> out<00:04:24.789> of<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:25.030> there<00:04:25.389> are

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
lot of playtime out of it there are

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.330 
lot of playtime out of it there are
multiple<00:04:25.870> hidden<00:04:26.020> stages<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.620> conquer<00:04:27.039> time

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
multiple hidden stages to conquer time

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.800 
multiple hidden stages to conquer time
trials<00:04:27.729> for<00:04:27.880> each<00:04:27.970> level<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.449> just<00:04:28.599> trying<00:04:28.750> to

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
trials for each level and just trying to

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.480 
trials for each level and just trying to
collect<00:04:29.020> all<00:04:29.260> five<00:04:29.470> red<00:04:29.710> rings<00:04:29.919> at<00:04:30.070> each<00:04:30.190> stage

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
collect all five red rings at each stage

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.710 
collect all five red rings at each stage
will<00:04:30.760> give<00:04:30.940> you<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.060> run<00:04:31.330> for<00:04:31.539> your<00:04:31.599> money

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
will give you a run for your money

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.600 
will give you a run for your money
though<00:04:32.349> you<00:04:32.409> surely<00:04:32.830> clock<00:04:33.039> in<00:04:33.220> multiple

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
though you surely clock in multiple

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.159 
though you surely clock in multiple
hours<00:04:33.760> tackling<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.450> death<00:04:34.630> of<00:04:34.750> six

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
hours tackling the death of six

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.050 
hours tackling the death of six
so<00:04:35.440> overall<00:04:35.979> Sonic<00:04:36.550> lost<00:04:36.669> world<00:04:36.789> is

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
so overall Sonic lost world is

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.310 
so overall Sonic lost world is
definitely<00:04:37.479> an<00:04:37.570> interesting<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.139> creative

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
definitely an interesting and creative

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.990 
definitely an interesting and creative
game<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:38.919> is<00:04:39.010> enjoyable<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.580> play<00:04:39.610> as

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
game it is enjoyable to play as

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.910 
game it is enjoyable to play as
zoom<00:04:40.270> around<00:04:40.390> stages<00:04:40.930> fully<00:04:41.140> different<00:04:41.500> ideas

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
zoom around stages fully different ideas

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.860

but<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:42.580> may<00:04:42.790> find<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.240> distaste<00:04:43.600> for<00:04:43.690> the

but you may find it distaste for the

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
multiple hours into it until things

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.180 
multiple hours into it until things
start<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.660> become<00:04:49.780> clear<00:04:50.260> it's<00:04:50.770> not<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.070> say

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
start to become clear it's not to say

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.530 
start to become clear it's not to say
that<00:04:51.310> everything<00:04:51.580> controlled<00:04:52.000> perfectly

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
that everything controlled perfectly

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.270 
that everything controlled perfectly
well<00:04:52.720> because<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.170> didn't<00:04:53.500> but<00:04:53.890> for<00:04:54.040> the<00:04:54.130> most

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
well because it didn't but for the most

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.800 
well because it didn't but for the most
part<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:54.670> just<00:04:54.850> has<00:04:54.970> a<00:04:55.000> steep<00:04:55.300> learning<00:04:55.330> curve

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
part it just has a steep learning curve

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.570 
part it just has a steep learning curve
but<00:04:56.110> overall<00:04:56.560> you're<00:04:56.890> looking<00:04:57.100> at<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.220> good<00:04:57.430> and
