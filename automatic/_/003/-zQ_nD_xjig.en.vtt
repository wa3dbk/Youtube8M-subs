because they're little stronger than the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.720 
because they're little stronger than the

ease the flying Pikmin to knock him down
we<00:00:36.739> have<00:00:36.890> enough<00:00:37.129> of<00:00:37.219> them<00:00:37.690> and<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.899> red<00:00:39.079> ones

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
and the rock ones are stronger so when

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:42.970 
and the rock ones are stronger so when
he<00:00:41.480> is<00:00:41.660> down<00:00:41.870> we<00:00:42.019> can<00:00:42.140> do<00:00:42.260> more<00:00:42.410> damage<00:00:42.649> in<00:00:42.949> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.550 
a little clone here you're gonna want to
run<00:01:34.520> under<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.120> so<00:01:35.690> stay<00:01:35.900> under<00:01:36.230> his<00:01:36.350> shadow

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
run under it so stay under his shadow

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.100 
run under it so stay under his shadow
here<00:01:36.980> and<00:01:37.190> that's<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:37.970> easiest<00:01:38.420> way<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.690> avoid

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
here and that's the easiest way to avoid

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.870 
here and that's the easiest way to avoid
that<00:01:39.410> without<00:01:40.340> getting<00:01:40.400> in<00:01:40.670> too<00:01:40.730> much<00:01:40.820> trouble

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
that without getting in too much trouble

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.280 
that without getting in too much trouble
you<00:01:41.600> can<00:01:41.900> charge<00:01:42.290> him<00:01:42.380> now<00:01:43.810> when<00:01:44.810> he's<00:01:45.020> little

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
you can charge him now when he's little

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.350 
you can charge him now when he's little
his<00:01:45.620> enemies<00:01:46.040> are<00:01:46.160> flying<00:01:46.400> out<00:01:46.550> but<00:01:47.330> I

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
his enemies are flying out but I

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.910 
his enemies are flying out but I
recommend<00:01:47.960> against<00:01:48.260> that<00:01:48.410> because<00:01:48.650> you

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
recommend against that because you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.620 
recommend against that because you
weren't<00:01:49.040> actually<00:01:49.160> knock<00:01:49.460> him<00:01:49.640> down<00:01:49.850> he'll

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
weren't actually knock him down he'll

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.770 
weren't actually knock him down he'll
just<00:01:50.780> kind<00:01:50.960> of<00:01:50.990> shake<00:01:51.170> him<00:01:51.380> off<00:01:51.550> so<00:01:52.550> wait<00:01:53.390> until

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
just kind of shake him off so wait until

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.360 
just kind of shake him off so wait until
all<00:01:53.990> his<00:01:54.140> little<00:01:54.320> flying<00:01:54.650> dudes<00:01:54.890> are<00:01:54.980> gone<00:01:55.160> and

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
all his little flying dudes are gone and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.790 
all his little flying dudes are gone and
then<00:01:55.700> shake<00:01:56.000> him<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.470> bring<00:01:57.470> him<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.620> the

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
then shake him and bring him to the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.590 
then shake him and bring him to the
ground<00:01:58.010> we're<00:01:58.310> halfway<00:01:58.490> done<00:01:58.640> we<00:01:59.300> just<00:01:59.450> gotta

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
ground we're halfway done we just gotta

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.060 
ground we're halfway done we just gotta
do<00:01:59.660> this<00:01:59.720> two<00:01:59.960> more<00:02:00.110> times<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.710> we<00:02:00.890> should

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
do this two more times and we should

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.610 
do this two more times and we should
kill<00:02:01.370> him<00:02:01.510> maybe<00:02:02.510> a<00:02:02.630> third<00:02:02.870> time<00:02:03.170> if<00:02:03.410> we're

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
kill him maybe a third time if we're

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.170 
kill him maybe a third time if we're
unlucky<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.610> haven't<00:02:04.910> done<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.060> much

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
unlucky and haven't done that much

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.750 
unlucky and haven't done that much
damage<00:02:05.450> but<00:02:06.260> now<00:02:06.470> he<00:02:06.530> should<00:02:06.980> I<00:02:07.100> present<00:02:07.610> like

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
damage but now he should I present like

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.569 
damage but now he should I present like
a<00:02:07.790> wall<00:02:08.209> kind<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.720> thing<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:10.039> easy<00:02:10.219> way<00:02:10.519> to

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
a wall kind of thing the easy way to

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.880 
a wall kind of thing the easy way to
avoid<00:02:10.939> this<00:02:11.180> one<00:02:11.510> is<00:02:12.349> just<00:02:12.409> going<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.739> wait

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
avoid this one is just going to wait

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.320 
avoid this one is just going to wait
still<00:02:13.189> for<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> bit

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
still for a bit

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.300 
still for a bit
and<00:02:14.930> then<00:02:15.050> we<00:02:15.140> start<00:02:15.380> studying<00:02:15.650> his<00:02:15.770> he's<00:02:16.280> a

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
and then we start studying his he's a

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.670 
and then we start studying his he's a
little<00:02:16.670> Hornet<00:02:17.090> shadows<00:02:17.450> we're<00:02:18.020> gonna<00:02:18.110> run<00:02:18.440> at

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
little Hornet shadows we're gonna run at

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.680 
little Hornet shadows we're gonna run at
them<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.760> you'll<00:02:19.940> see<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.270> we<00:02:20.390> start<00:02:20.600> going

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
them so you'll see that we start going

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.650 
them so you'll see that we start going
forward<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.710> that<00:02:21.860> kind<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.070> avoids<00:02:22.460> them<00:02:22.820> so

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
forward and that kind of avoids them so

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.230 
forward and that kind of avoids them so
that's<00:02:24.410> easiest<00:02:24.830> way<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.040> avoid<00:02:25.280> them<00:02:25.520> once

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
that's easiest way to avoid them once

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.380 
that's easiest way to avoid them once
again<00:02:26.360> lock<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:26.960> send<00:02:27.440> your<00:02:27.530> pic<00:02:27.710> without<00:02:28.010> him

again lock on send your pic without him

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.760 
again lock on send your pic without him

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
attack him shazam easy another third oh

attack him shazam easy another third oh
I'm<00:02:34.370> in<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.610> fourth<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.060> final<00:02:35.120> attack<00:02:35.900> he's

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
I'm in the fourth and final attack he's

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.380 
I'm in the fourth and final attack he's
going<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.350> do<00:02:36.500> he's<00:02:36.800> gonna<00:02:37.400> circle<00:02:38.000> our<00:02:38.120> men

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
going to do he's gonna circle our men

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.170 
going to do he's gonna circle our men
and<00:02:38.680> starter<00:02:39.680> he's<00:02:40.280> gonna<00:02:40.400> keep<00:02:40.610> us<00:02:40.760> locked<00:02:40.970> in

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
and starter he's gonna keep us locked in

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.720 
and starter he's gonna keep us locked in
which<00:02:42.050> can<00:02:42.590> be<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.890> bit<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.280> tricky<00:02:43.520> one<00:02:43.700> to

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
which can be a bit of a tricky one to

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.610 
which can be a bit of a tricky one to
get<00:02:43.880> out<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.780> we<00:02:44.870> have<00:02:44.990> to<00:02:45.080> turn<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:45.380> right

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
get out of so we have to turn this right

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.130 
get out of so we have to turn this right
once<00:02:45.830> we<00:02:45.980> see<00:02:46.160> his<00:02:46.370> men<00:02:46.640> his<00:02:47.600> little<00:02:47.840> Hornet

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
once we see his men his little Hornet

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.740 
once we see his men his little Hornet
men<00:02:48.790> coming<00:02:49.790> two<00:02:49.850> attackers<00:02:50.180> were<00:02:50.510> going<00:02:50.690> to

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
men coming two attackers were going to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.390 
men coming two attackers were going to
attack<00:02:50.840> him<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:51.590> we've<00:02:51.710> got<00:02:51.830> him<00:02:51.950> locked<00:02:52.130> on

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400

when await their common phrase we're

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.100 
when await their common phrase we're
gonna<00:02:54.860> charge<00:02:55.490> him<00:02:55.790> I<00:02:56.000> fly<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.750> pick<00:02:56.900> more

on<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.820> ground<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.450> start<00:03:06.260> attacking<00:03:06.590> the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
on the ground and start attacking the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.790 
on the ground and start attacking the
actual<00:03:07.610> wall<00:03:07.910> like<00:03:08.240> a<00:03:08.270> circle<00:03:08.780> around<00:03:08.840> us<00:03:09.230> and

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
actual wall like a circle around us and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.400 
actual wall like a circle around us and
that'll<00:03:10.130> get<00:03:10.370> will<00:03:10.610> lose<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.820> few<00:03:11.120> sure<00:03:11.420> not<00:03:12.230> the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
that'll get will lose a few sure not the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.949 
that'll get will lose a few sure not the
best<00:03:12.680> way<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:12.920> do<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.220> but<00:03:13.570> it<00:03:14.570> doesn't<00:03:14.840> matter

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
best way to do it but it doesn't matter

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.470 
best way to do it but it doesn't matter
it's<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.230> final<00:03:15.709> wave<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:16.640> as<00:03:17.060> long<00:03:17.240> as<00:03:17.330> you

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
it's the final wave so as long as you
