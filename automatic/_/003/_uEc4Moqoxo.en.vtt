00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
one I think it's like 32 brush I don't

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.999 
one I think it's like 32 brush I don't
remember<00:01:17.939> exactly<00:01:18.299> how<00:01:18.840> much<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.320> costs<00:01:19.860> me

remember exactly how much it costs me
but<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.759> was<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:23.479> cannot<00:01:24.479> say

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
but I think it was like I cannot say

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
but I think it was like I cannot say
exactly<00:01:25.290> how<00:01:25.770> much<00:01:25.830> anyway

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
exactly how much anyway

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.870 
exactly how much anyway
