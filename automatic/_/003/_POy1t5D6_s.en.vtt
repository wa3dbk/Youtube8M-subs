trick<00:03:51.360> we're<00:03:51.540> going<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.690> take<00:03:51.900> some<00:03:52.080> of<00:03:52.170> this

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
trick we're going to take some of this

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.170 
trick we're going to take some of this
baking<00:03:52.709> powder<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.370> I'm<00:03:53.700> going<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:53.910> take<00:03:54.120> a

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
baking powder and I'm going to take a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.020 
baking powder and I'm going to take a
full<00:03:54.480> tablespoon<00:03:55.080> or<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> soup<00:03:55.950> spoons<00:03:56.430> worth

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
full tablespoon or a soup spoons worth

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.300 
full tablespoon or a soup spoons worth
or<00:03:57.330> so<00:03:57.510> on<00:03:59.000> like<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.860> that<00:04:01.860> right<00:04:02.130> in

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
or so on like that and that right in

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.030 
or so on like that and that right in
there<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:02.640> our<00:04:02.760> cream<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.299> tartar<00:04:03.780> is<00:04:04.769> going

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
there and our cream of tartar is going

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.650 
there and our cream of tartar is going
to<00:04:05.100> get<00:04:05.280> just<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:06.030> pinch<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:09.030> what<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.180> mean<00:04:09.420> by<00:04:09.480> a

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
to get just a pinch and what I mean by a

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.090 
to get just a pinch and what I mean by a
pinch<00:04:10.080> is<00:04:10.620> just<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.190> tip<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.549> knife<00:04:13.100> like

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
pinch is just the tip of the knife like

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.619 
pinch is just the tip of the knife like
that

00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:16.629 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:20.110 

and<00:04:17.629> watch<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.889> chemical<00:04:19.340> reaction<00:04:19.879> that<00:04:20.030> we

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
and watch the chemical reaction that we

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.219 
and watch the chemical reaction that we
get<00:04:20.329> now<00:04:20.599> the<00:04:21.169> bubbling<00:04:23.500> of<00:04:24.500> our<00:04:24.830> batter<00:04:26.229> and

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
get now the bubbling of our batter and

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.589 
get now the bubbling of our batter and
now<00:04:28.219> the<00:04:28.280> baking<00:04:28.729> powder<00:04:28.939> is<00:04:29.240> not<00:04:29.419> only

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
now the baking powder is not only

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.540 
now the baking powder is not only
reacting<00:04:30.259> with<00:04:30.439> the<00:04:30.469> liquid<00:04:31.069> but<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.430> is

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
reacting with the liquid but it is

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.550 
reacting with the liquid but it is
reacting<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:32.240> chemical<00:04:32.719> reaction<00:04:33.020> with<00:04:33.379> that

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
reacting a chemical reaction with that

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.950 
reacting a chemical reaction with that
citric<00:04:34.099> acid<00:04:34.699> I<00:04:34.819> put<00:04:35.060> in<00:04:35.180> there<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:35.509> don't<00:04:35.900> know

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
citric acid I put in there I don't know

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.719 
citric acid I put in there I don't know
if<00:04:36.080> you<00:04:36.139> can<00:04:36.289> see<00:04:36.469> the<00:04:36.620> bubbles<00:04:37.009> working<00:04:37.550> yet

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
if you can see the bubbles working yet

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.990 
if you can see the bubbles working yet
but<00:04:38.000> now<00:04:38.599> we<00:04:38.659> take<00:04:38.930> our<00:04:39.110> diced<00:04:39.409> strawberries

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
but now we take our diced strawberries

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.809 
but now we take our diced strawberries
let's<00:04:41.000> add<00:04:41.270> them<00:04:41.509> in<00:04:41.689> there<00:04:42.340> mix<00:04:43.340> them<00:04:43.580> in

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
let's add them in there mix them in

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:48.070 
let's add them in there mix them in
lightly<00:04:44.509> so<00:04:44.900> we<00:04:44.990> don't<00:04:45.169> crush<00:04:45.409> them<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:47.080> over

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
lightly so we don't crush them and over

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.450 
lightly so we don't crush them and over
to<00:04:48.169> the<00:04:48.259> grill<00:04:48.469> we<00:04:48.650> go<00:04:48.830> here's<00:04:49.159> another

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
to the grill we go here's another

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.399 
to the grill we go here's another
important<00:04:50.000> part<00:04:50.150> about<00:04:50.389> making<00:04:50.539> pancakes<00:04:51.229> or

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:51.409 
important part about making pancakes or

anything in a no recipe lifestyle we
want<00:04:54.349> to<00:04:54.440> have<00:04:54.620> precise<00:04:55.340> portioning<00:04:55.969> we<00:04:56.120> want

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
want to have precise portioning we want

want to have precise portioning we want
each<00:04:56.509> pancake<00:04:57.139> to<00:04:57.319> be<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.590> same<00:04:57.860> size<00:04:58.430> so<00:04:59.210> that

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
each pancake to be the same size so that

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.119 
each pancake to be the same size so that
they<00:04:59.509> cook<00:04:59.539> the<00:05:00.110> same<00:05:00.319> and<00:05:00.560> they<00:05:00.620> cook<00:05:00.860> at<00:05:01.009> the

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
they cook the same and they cook at the

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.309 
they cook the same and they cook at the
same<00:05:01.370> rate<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:01.879> some<00:05:02.180> aren't<00:05:02.360> mushy<00:05:02.719> or<00:05:02.900> wet

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
same rate and some aren't mushy or wet

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.409 
same rate and some aren't mushy or wet
in<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.620> middle<00:05:03.650> and<00:05:04.009> some<00:05:04.400> are<00:05:04.550> overcooked<00:05:05.030> so

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
in the middle and some are overcooked so

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.510 
in the middle and some are overcooked so
I<00:05:05.449> use<00:05:05.629> an<00:05:05.810> ice<00:05:05.930> cream<00:05:06.199> scoop<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.979> get<00:05:07.099> the<00:05:07.250> same

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
I use an ice cream scoop to get the same

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.420 
I use an ice cream scoop to get the same
sized<00:05:07.909> pancakes<00:05:08.440> exactly<00:05:09.440> each<00:05:09.680> time<00:05:10.069> on<00:05:10.279> the

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
sized pancakes exactly each time on the

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.279 
sized pancakes exactly each time on the
griddle<00:05:10.639> first<00:05:11.389> thing<00:05:11.539> we'll<00:05:11.659> do<00:05:11.750> is<00:05:11.779> test<00:05:12.169> the

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
griddle first thing we'll do is test the

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.570 
griddle first thing we'll do is test the
griddle<00:05:12.680> with<00:05:12.710> some<00:05:13.009> water

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
griddle with some water

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.409 
griddle with some water
oh<00:05:14.020> my<00:05:15.020> yes<00:05:15.620> let's<00:05:16.279> say<00:05:16.550> that<00:05:16.699> that's<00:05:16.849> hot<00:05:17.180> and

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
oh my yes let's say that that's hot and

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.439 
oh my yes let's say that that's hot and
now<00:05:17.840> we've<00:05:18.199> got<00:05:18.469> our<00:05:18.789> mixture<00:05:19.789> and<00:05:19.939> see<00:05:20.270> if<00:05:20.360> I

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
now we've got our mixture and see if I

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.290 
now we've got our mixture and see if I
can<00:05:20.599> show<00:05:21.560> you<00:05:21.620> the<00:05:21.889> bubbling<00:05:22.490> going<00:05:22.849> on<00:05:23.000> in

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
can show you the bubbling going on in

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.730 
can show you the bubbling going on in
here<00:05:23.569> because<00:05:23.719> of<00:05:23.990> that<00:05:24.110> chemical<00:05:24.440> reaction

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
here because of that chemical reaction

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.459 
here because of that chemical reaction
so<00:05:25.250> with<00:05:25.699> my<00:05:25.849> ice<00:05:26.060> cream<00:05:26.479> scoop<00:05:26.870> I<00:05:27.050> take<00:05:27.319> an

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:27.469 
so with my ice cream scoop I take an

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:31.990 
so with my ice cream scoop I take an
even<00:05:27.800> portion<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.639> even<00:05:29.180> scoop<00:05:29.800> add<00:05:30.879> it<00:05:31.879> to

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
even portion and even scoop add it to

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.519 
even portion and even scoop add it to
the<00:05:32.089> griddle<00:05:32.330> so<00:05:32.539> each<00:05:32.960> of<00:05:32.990> these<00:05:33.259> pancakes

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:33.529 
the griddle so each of these pancakes

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:42.980 
the griddle so each of these pancakes
will<00:05:33.949> be<00:05:34.069> the<00:05:34.159> same<00:05:34.370> size

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.949 

as<00:05:44.249> the<00:05:45.249> pancakes<00:05:45.849> cook<00:05:46.240> you<00:05:46.419> start<00:05:46.689> to<00:05:46.809> see

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:46.959 
as the pancakes cook you start to see

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.320 
as the pancakes cook you start to see
them<00:05:47.110> get<00:05:47.349> dry<00:05:47.770> around<00:05:48.369> the<00:05:48.459> outside<00:05:48.969> of<00:05:49.209> the

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
them get dry around the outside of the

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.730 
them get dry around the outside of the
pancake<00:05:49.749> and<00:05:49.899> look<00:05:50.110> at<00:05:50.229> the<00:05:50.349> amount<00:05:50.559> of

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
pancake and look at the amount of

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.260 
pancake and look at the amount of
bubbles<00:05:51.159> that<00:05:51.399> are<00:05:51.490> coming<00:05:51.759> out<00:05:51.879> of<00:05:51.999> this

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
bubbles that are coming out of this

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.779 
bubbles that are coming out of this
this<00:05:52.569> is<00:05:52.899> leavening<00:05:53.679> just<00:05:54.039> like<00:05:54.219> a<00:05:54.249> muffin

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
this is leavening just like a muffin

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.059 
this is leavening just like a muffin
would<00:05:55.029> be<00:05:55.240> or<00:05:55.419> any<00:05:55.569> other<00:05:55.869> baked<00:05:56.199> good<00:05:56.499> and<00:05:56.709> how

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
would be or any other baked good and how

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.600
