week as you know we know so far because
well<00:01:17.610> from<00:01:17.850> what<00:01:18.060> I'm<00:01:18.210> thinking<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.840> kind<00:01:18.960> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
well from what I'm thinking it's kind of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.899 
well from what I'm thinking it's kind of
my<00:01:19.140> theory<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.500> think<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:20.100> well<00:01:20.430> first<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.820> all

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
my theory I think that well first of all

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.580 
my theory I think that well first of all
I<00:01:20.939> think<00:01:21.090> fried<00:01:21.630> bear<00:01:21.810> killed<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> kid<00:01:22.409> I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
I think fried bear killed the kid I

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.870 
I think fried bear killed the kid I
don't<00:01:22.650> think<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> same<00:01:23.280> kid<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.729> as

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
don't think that's the same kid and as

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.090 
don't think that's the same kid and as
we<00:01:24.030> saw<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> TV<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.810> possibly<00:01:25.770> taking

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
we saw on the TV it's possibly taking

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.390 
we saw on the TV it's possibly taking
place<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.400> 1983<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.420> even<00:01:27.659> 1987<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.220> death

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
place in 1983 not even 1987 so the death

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.230 
place in 1983 not even 1987 so the death
that<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.610> saw<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> end<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> games

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
that we saw the end of the games

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
that we saw the end of the games
probably<00:01:30.869> isn't<00:01:31.229> even<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.530> bite<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.799> 87<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
probably isn't even the bite of 87 that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.980 
probably isn't even the bite of 87 that
kid<00:01:32.520> look<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.700> he's<00:01:32.939> not<00:01:33.119> surviving<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.750> at

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
kid look like he's not surviving that at

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.050 
kid look like he's not surviving that at
all<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.799> mean<00:01:35.070> who<00:01:35.189> knows<00:01:35.310> maybe<00:01:35.579> somehow

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
all but I mean who knows maybe somehow

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.340 
all but I mean who knows maybe somehow
it's<00:01:36.450> gonna<00:01:36.600> end<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.840> being<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> bite<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.229> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
it's gonna end up being the bite of a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.929 
it's gonna end up being the bite of a
seven<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:37.860> kind<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.070> weird<00:01:38.280> seeing

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
seven but it's just kind of weird seeing

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.789 
seven but it's just kind of weird seeing
that<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> original<00:01:39.689> phone<00:01:39.900> call<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.560> this

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
that the original phone call is in this

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.410 
that the original phone call is in this
game<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:41.909> happens<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
game and it just so happens to be the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.030 
game and it just so happens to be the
same<00:01:42.600> phone<00:01:42.840> call<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.470> had<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> bite<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.920> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
same phone call that had the bite of a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.710 
same phone call that had the bite of a
7/10<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.880> putting<00:01:45.090> they're<00:01:45.270> reversed

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
7/10 and it's putting they're reversed

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.719 
7/10 and it's putting they're reversed
which<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.229> weird<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.770> lot<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.520> people<00:01:47.670> are

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
which is weird a lot of people are

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.889 
which is weird a lot of people are
saying<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> actually<00:01:48.210> playing<00:01:48.570> while

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
saying this is actually playing while

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.240 
saying this is actually playing while
you're<00:01:49.079> playing<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.380> game<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> just

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
you're playing the game and you just

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.249 
you're playing the game and you just
kind<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:51.270> know<00:01:51.390> you're<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.689> focused<00:01:51.930> on

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
kind of you know you're so focused on

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.179 
kind of you know you're so focused on
the<00:01:52.409> actual<00:01:52.680> game<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.979> don't<00:01:53.100> actually

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
the actual game that you don't actually

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.039 
the actual game that you don't actually
hear<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.390> also<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.720> first<00:01:54.930> like
