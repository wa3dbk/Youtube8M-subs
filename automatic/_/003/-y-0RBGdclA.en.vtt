00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
appearance of this I think as far as the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.580 
appearance of this I think as far as the
dial<00:02:08.250> lay<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.119> an<00:02:09.509> easier<00:02:09.989> dial<00:02:10.319> and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
dial lay it is it's an easier dial and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.309 
dial lay it is it's an easier dial and
read<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.159> think<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.790> has<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.480> way<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.900> bit<00:02:13.110> more

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
read I think it has in a way a bit more

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.009 
read I think it has in a way a bit more
of<00:02:13.409> a<00:02:13.530> classic<00:02:14.010> look<00:02:14.040> about<00:02:14.519> it<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.659> don't

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
of a classic look about it and I don't

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.839 
of a classic look about it and I don't
like<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.470> mention<00:02:16.769> other<00:02:16.860> brands<00:02:17.430> generally

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
like to mention other brands generally

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.899 
like to mention other brands generally
but<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.959> me<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.170> think<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.709> has<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> slight<00:02:20.280> Patek

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
but to me I think it has a slight Patek

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.240 
but to me I think it has a slight Patek
feel<00:02:21.870> about<00:02:22.080> about<00:02:22.319> it'll<00:02:22.620> lay<00:02:22.800> out<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.159> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
feel about about it'll lay out of the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.640 
feel about about it'll lay out of the
dial<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.730> saying<00:02:24.180> look<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.599> Bataclan<00:02:25.230> it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
dial and saying look like a Bataclan it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.559 
dial and saying look like a Bataclan it
has<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.310> light<00:02:26.610> attack<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> basic

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
has that that light attack the basic

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.390 
has that that light attack the basic
layout<00:02:28.019> which

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
layout which

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.339 
layout which
just<00:02:28.700> terrific<00:02:28.819> it's<00:02:29.689> a<00:02:29.840> step<00:02:30.079> up<00:02:30.200> in

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
just terrific it's a step up in

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.350 
just terrific it's a step up in
certainly<00:02:31.069> visual<00:02:31.640> quality<00:02:32.090> as<00:02:32.209> well

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
certainly visual quality as well

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.179 
certainly visual quality as well
definitely<00:02:33.110> different<00:02:33.379> it<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:33.799> step<00:02:34.040> up

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
definitely different it is a step up

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:35.770 
definitely different it is a step up
from<00:02:34.370> from<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.030> previous<00:02:35.299> designs<00:02:35.569> which

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
from from the previous designs which

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.130 
from from the previous designs which
were<00:02:35.900> using<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.230> 501<00:02:36.860> which<00:02:37.569> only<00:02:38.569> as<00:02:38.810> far<00:02:39.049> as

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
were using the 501 which only as far as

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.170 
were using the 501 which only as far as
design<00:02:39.409> was<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.860> greatest<00:02:40.220> movement<00:02:40.430> in

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
design was in the greatest movement in

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.030 
design was in the greatest movement in
the<00:02:41.329> range<00:02:41.569> it's<00:02:42.019> got<00:02:42.200> four<00:02:42.470> very<00:02:42.680> clearly

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
the range it's got four very clearly

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.720 
the range it's got four very clearly
defined<00:02:43.540> areas<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:45.260> time<00:02:45.470> display<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:46.430> date

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
defined areas the time display the date

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.720 
defined areas the time display the date
pointer<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.810> day<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.230> month<00:02:48.500> display<00:02:49.430> and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
pointer the day and month display and

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.339 
pointer the day and month display and
then<00:02:50.209> finishing<00:02:50.599> it<00:02:50.689> off<00:02:50.780> with<00:02:51.079> the<00:02:51.200> moon

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
then finishing it off with the moon

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.349 
then finishing it off with the moon
phase<00:02:51.620> display<00:02:52.040> which<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.640> think<00:02:52.939> they're<00:02:53.150> nice

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
phase display which I think they're nice

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.199 
phase display which I think they're nice
and<00:02:53.420> clean<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:53.959> easy<00:02:54.409> to<00:02:54.500> read<00:02:55.120> wonderful<00:02:56.120> out

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
and clean and easy to read wonderful out

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.140 
and clean and easy to read wonderful out
and<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:56.989> good<00:02:57.019> balance<00:02:57.650> for<00:02:57.769> how<00:02:58.010> they<00:02:58.250> put<00:02:59.090> it

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
and a good balance for how they put it

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.180 
and a good balance for how they put it
all<00:02:59.239> together<00:02:59.359> as<00:02:59.720> well<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.530> quite<00:03:00.950> like

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
all together as well and I quite like

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.330 
all together as well and I quite like
the<00:03:01.400> design<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:02.450> second<00:03:02.840> hand<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:04.099> sweep

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
the design of the second hand the sweep

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.430 
the design of the second hand the sweep
second<00:03:04.730> hand<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:05.299> was<00:03:05.540> that<00:03:06.019> little

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
second hand it was that little

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.440 
second hand it was that little
counterbalance<00:03:07.370> at<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.579> ending<00:03:07.940> one<00:03:08.299> of<00:03:08.359> the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
counterbalance at the ending one of the

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.180 
counterbalance at the ending one of the
things<00:03:08.599> I<00:03:08.720> do<00:03:08.780> like<00:03:08.900> about<00:03:09.139> the<00:03:09.620> inclusion<00:03:10.129> of

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
things I do like about the inclusion of

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.759 
things I do like about the inclusion of
the<00:03:10.370> SW<00:03:11.239> turn<00:03:11.480> under<00:03:11.690> strike<00:03:11.900> one<00:03:12.139> movement<00:03:12.620> is

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
the SW turn under strike one movement is

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.670 
the SW turn under strike one movement is
it<00:03:12.920> is<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.430> fills<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:14.000> case<00:03:14.209> back<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.409> when<00:03:15.590> you

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
it is it fills the case back so when you

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.020 
it is it fills the case back so when you
turn<00:03:15.889> that<00:03:16.040> watch<00:03:16.220> over<00:03:16.430> they<00:03:16.579> have<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.730> look<00:03:16.909> at

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
turn that watch over they have a look at

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.879 
turn that watch over they have a look at
what's<00:03:17.180> inside<00:03:17.359> yeah<00:03:17.959> competitor<00:03:18.590> by<00:03:18.709> that

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
what's inside yeah competitor by that

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.819 
what's inside yeah competitor by that
one<00:03:19.099> it's<00:03:19.400> substantial<00:03:20.120> yeah<00:03:20.359> yeah<00:03:20.870> yeah<00:03:21.260> and

one it's substantial yeah yeah yeah and
as<00:03:22.040> what<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.250> mentioned<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:23.120> does<00:03:23.359> have<00:03:23.689> a<00:03:23.720> great

as what I mentioned it does have a great
appearance<00:03:24.439> there<00:03:24.680> in<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.859> back<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.159> watch

distance to the edge of the case so it

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.720 
distance to the edge of the case so it
