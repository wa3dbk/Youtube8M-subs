00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.450
 seen 17 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.889
 now let's see how you format it 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.029
 install our computer 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.970
 installing the ubuntu operating system 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.880
 remember kubuntu there is a little clarification 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.880
 a link below in description on how 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.019
 dry as the first boot device of the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.199
 our computer 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.290
 our cd dvd player which is a lot 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.480
 so it is important to set this if not 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.899
 do you know how to set from your 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.280
 bios yours as first from yours 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.920
 virus as your first boot your reader 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.030
 cd dvd i recommend you to watch this 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.219
 video guide 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.969
 once this is done enter the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.680
 yours your cd and co inside there 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.359
 it will surely be kubuntu if we are 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.449
 speaking of kubuntu reboot e 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.129
 I'll show what happens just fine 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.560
 inserted is automatically part of the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.260
 your cd with no damage will be found 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.290
 kubuntu this screen will appear a 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.930
 I know a little black is normal because it is 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.650
 uploading from our cd player the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.670
 operating system ok 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.210
 we await all your proceedings of 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.020
 mn miccoli that charges perfect, here it is 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.000
 here kubuntu perfect first of all 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.970
 we choose our language 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.860
 in this case we find Italian for 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.960
 perfect italian 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.360
 once found the Italian test 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.390
 kubuntu installs kubuntu on trial 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.189
 kubuntu is normal we can without 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.590
 install our operating system 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.899
 kubuntu we can try to see 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.640
 to suit our needs 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.469
 if not let's go to install kubuntu 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.880
 click on install co.re.co here 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:09.190
 he asks us about the minimum requirements he has 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.890
 at least 5.8 gigabytes of free space on the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.000
 on the computer and we have it both 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.130
 Internet connection 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.890
 yes i have internet connection 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.870
 then in the software room of crazy pieces 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.090
 I don't recommend putting the bank up 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.650
 this but I suggest to put the check 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.140
 on download updates during 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.970
 installation which is a perfect thing 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.760
 in this case in the meantime that is 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.340
 installing the operating system downloads 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.520
 and also installs packages ie 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.260
 updates in this case I in 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.430
 this case I have to kick it for you only 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.650
 show how it's done 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.050
 ok once this is done let's go e 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.560
 we click on forward once on forward 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.990
 guide uses the entire drive drove 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.230
 excuse me to use whole disk then 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.130
 what it does in this case does nothing else 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.170
 which formed repeat format delete 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.590
 everything that's on your hard 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.890
 disk and install the operating system 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:10.150
 ubuntu driven use inside the whole 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.270
 disk set vlm I do not recommend in 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.870
 except in some cases the entire disk in 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.800
 then here it is imposed encrypted lm either 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.810
 here the same thing with cd to do 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.920
 formatter installs the first or 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.900
 manual if we click on manual there 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.420
 he asks in a few words here it is 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.150
 in primary here once if we 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:40.010
 we put on use the entire disc indicates us 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.640
 how do you say our hard drive that 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.810
 we have in this case mine is a 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.790
 virtual hard drive because it is 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.629
 viewing a computer inside a 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.310
 computer and tells us the space to the whole 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.200
 rest 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.310
 so once this is done let's go e 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:02.420
 click on install perfect fused 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.700
 time zone time zone Italy is fine I don't know 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.120
 how much will be gotti of the files and in the 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.909
 meanwhile I don't know when it will be loaded 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.470
 this video however Italy italy 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:17.120
 the region 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:20.329
 italy ahead and we have the keyboard 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.680
 Italian keyboard and help us too 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.630
 symbols click on next

 as your username password 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.880
 we confirm the password vishous cius 17 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.380
 is giving the right name of the transcript 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.240
 computer vice 17 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.190
 logically virtual box because it is 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.639
 using a virtual box to virtualize 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.620
 a computer inside a computer then below 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.169
 written it requires password 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.490
 staff to log in access 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:06.889
 automatically fine is simple 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.620
 if you want the computer once that 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.240
 turned on you need to charge the 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.550
 your operating system is needed 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.599
 let's say write here write our own 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.180
 password 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:22.370
 then we click on this if the case 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.830
 we want to encrypt it for more 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.870
 safety we put the check also on 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.419
 this figure in the personal folder 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.860
 if not we want it to load 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.180
 automatically our system 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.180
 operating without 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.949
 ask for our password 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:42.380
 then click you put the ball yes 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.360
 on log in automatically once 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.930
 This is done up ahead 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.440
 ok thanks for choosing kubuntu in 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.419
 this case the 13:10 version is a point 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.130
 designed to be simple explored 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:58.520
 which some children will also appear 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.139
 written below see what's there 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.229
 installation 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.849
 I make a nice cut so it shows you 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.210
 in the end what happens 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:10.070
 ok the installation is complete 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.080
 the only thing we have left now from 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.900
 to do is gradually 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:19.490
 now we wait for it to restart 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.419
 these writings clearly do not appear 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.050
 you worry 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:28.370
 at this point it appears it says in English 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.509
 but don't worry press center reads 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.330
 from the end 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:34.430
 sending in a few words restarts not there 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.449
 worry this little picture is the 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.370
 kubuntu virtual machine given by 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:42.830
