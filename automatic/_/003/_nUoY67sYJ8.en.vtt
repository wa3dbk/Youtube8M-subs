00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.950
 and now they can play their game 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.100
 normal as I always tell you and I know that already 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.380
 They are tired of being repeated every day 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.320
 good not every day but that they have 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.520
 there was an installation of the sims 3 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.360
 but this is just and necessary 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.840
 As I always tell you, check the game 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.660
 if they do not throw any mistake at you it's not 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.840
 need to install the crack now yes they 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.460
 throws some mistake or if it does not leave us 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.010
 enter the game we will go to the team 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.130
 to the disc we are going to give right click 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:59.160
 open and here we are going to get into the 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.969
 Vitality eye folder here come two 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.759
 cracks 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:07.929
 this had never happened to me but they try 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:11.879
 to install first this is not that in 

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:14.499
 the game if it does not help you install in this 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:18.159
 check in again if you continue without 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:21.000
 serve them install this ok this is for 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:23.360
 the expansion this is copied 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.710
 and it sticks in program files 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.000
 electronic arts 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:34.260
 winners gaming and here it hits ok and 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.390
 the other one that is for the base game is going 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.520
 to copy they give him on disk what he is 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.940
 of the electronic program of the 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:47.730
 sims 3 gaming and here they stick a 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:49.370
 base game folder ok but I repeat 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.740
 again 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.860
 that they first check the game before 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.740
 put any crack ok 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.889
 While it is now what I'll do 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.039
 I'm going to reduce the game and we're going to move on 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:07.189
 the view of the game right now in a moment 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:11.259
 then I will tell you if you need the 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:14.020
 crack believes that crack needs and good 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:17.960
 here 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.639
 we are already in the game and how 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.280
 can improve it perfectly 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:25.270
 need no crack as well as a 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.270
 history or run 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:31.760
 it served perfectly but as always 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.640
 I tell them it also depends on the game 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.670
 depends on the version depends on many 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.400
 factors ok so no no no no 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.940
 Illusion and you keep trying them 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.580
 if it does not work for them, ok but good, now 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.220
