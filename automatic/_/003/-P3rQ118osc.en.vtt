 put any photo or any image or 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.299

 to seven thousand seven thousand six hundred this 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.870
 copy of windows our original this 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.080
 it happens obviously because your windows do not 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.940
 is activated and to do it you should only 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.090

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.670
 and well the first thing you should do is 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.080
 double click with a mouse here on my 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.540
 pc 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.460
 once it is open, go to the disc 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:09.869
 hard where you have windows installed 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.360
 then go to the windows folder 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.909
 and once in the windows folder you must 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.299
 look for a folder called system32 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:21.690
 what is this that is here and what you should 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:24.900
 do now it's up to l right click with 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.439
 the mouse and you click on delete 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.450
 yes when you say that to fly this 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.280
 folder you need permissions 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.079
 administrator just tell him that 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.720
 continue is a folder without major 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.030
 importance 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.810
 once deleted your windows will be 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.150
 activated 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.520

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.140
 paper or wallpaper as they say 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.140
 in English of pirates of the Caribbean 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.610
 and as you can see now windows allows 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.430
 change the wallpaper in addition 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.800
