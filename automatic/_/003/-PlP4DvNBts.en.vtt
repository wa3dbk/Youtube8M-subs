00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
goes for a freaking endeavor I'm like

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.440 
goes for a freaking endeavor I'm like
what<00:04:32.229> though<00:04:32.470> is<00:04:32.740> this<00:04:33.220> endeavor<00:04:34.150> on<00:04:34.419> a

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
what though is this endeavor on a

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.770 
what though is this endeavor on a
freaking<00:04:34.870> Chi<00:04:35.260> ramp<00:04:35.530> I<00:04:35.740> don't<00:04:36.280> even<00:04:36.340> know<00:04:36.520> but

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
freaking Chi ramp I don't even know but

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.270 
freaking Chi ramp I don't even know but
I<00:04:37.780> guess<00:04:38.020> it<00:04:38.200> worked<00:04:38.380> because<00:04:38.530> you<00:04:38.830> know<00:04:38.919> he<00:04:39.160> is

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
I guess it worked because you know he is

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.770 
I guess it worked because you know he is
minus<00:04:39.550> two<00:04:39.669> special<00:04:40.000> attacks<00:04:40.210> so<00:04:40.419> I<00:04:40.450> don't

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
minus two special attacks so I don't

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.090 
minus two special attacks so I don't
even<00:04:40.870> think<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.260> Draco<00:04:41.500> meteor<00:04:41.650> woulda<00:04:41.919> killed

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
even think a Draco meteor woulda killed

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.060 
even think a Draco meteor woulda killed
me<00:04:42.220> so<00:04:42.460> I<00:04:42.790> guess<00:04:42.940> that's<00:04:43.060> cool<00:04:43.300> I<00:04:43.600> guess<00:04:44.139> so<00:04:45.010> I

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
me so I guess that's cool I guess so I

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.280 
me so I guess that's cool I guess so I
guess<00:04:45.220> bug<00:04:45.490> was<00:04:45.729> I<00:04:46.090> kind<00:04:46.720> of<00:04:46.840> just<00:04:46.990> death

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
guess bug was I kind of just death

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.629 
guess bug was I kind of just death
fought<00:04:47.500> her<00:04:47.590> this<00:04:47.740> thing<00:04:47.919> and<00:04:48.100> I<00:04:48.220> didn't<00:04:48.490> know

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
fought her this thing and I didn't know

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.330 
fought her this thing and I didn't know
bug<00:04:49.030> was<00:04:49.440> neutral<00:04:50.440> to<00:04:50.560> bug<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:50.950> thought<00:04:51.130> if<00:04:51.310> you

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
bug was neutral to bug I thought if you

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.610 
bug was neutral to bug I thought if you
use<00:04:51.610> bug<00:04:51.910> buzz<00:04:52.120> on<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.360> bug-type<00:04:52.570> your<00:04:52.960> resisted

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
use bug buzz on a bug-type your resisted

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.620 
use bug buzz on a bug-type your resisted
but<00:04:54.220> i<00:04:54.370> guess<00:04:54.520> not<00:04:54.550> but<00:04:55.150> for<00:04:55.330> some<00:04:55.419> stupid

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
but i guess not but for some stupid

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.000 
but i guess not but for some stupid
reason<00:04:55.750> he<00:04:55.990> goes<00:04:56.139> for<00:04:56.289> Focus<00:04:56.560> Blast<00:04:56.590> which<00:04:56.889> is

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
reason he goes for Focus Blast which is

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.650 
reason he goes for Focus Blast which is
