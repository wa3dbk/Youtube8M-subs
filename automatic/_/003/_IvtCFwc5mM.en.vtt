00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.770
 how we finished here 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:13.209
 this place is horrible we had everything 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.750
 but it's a movie star what 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:19.300
 remember you are afraid that people 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.070
 say that you have embarked on this work 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.199
 to fight against that image of 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.359
 superhero jibe for nothing for that 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.470
 20 years ago I refused and I said no 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.900
 have man 4 and that's why 4 you make a 4 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.640
 if you do this, it's because they organize you 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.860
 like everyone else that is not 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.560
 relevant 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.560
 about to destroy what's left of your 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.330
 career we should have done that 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.680
 reality that we were offered street 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.680
 You know I 'm right, shut up 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.770
 of the 90 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.430
 you go what if you rest a while 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.540
 pay attention to me you are the genuine 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.540
 we will come back 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.010
 you are permanent 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.280
 it's a God 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.119
 because you do not wear your wings and fucking 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.119
 straw suit 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.930
 I'm going to suffocate 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.890
 let's go back and let's show them what 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.570
 we are capable I have the opportunity to 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.570
 do something right I should take advantage of it 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.490
 erase that smile of the face you give me life
