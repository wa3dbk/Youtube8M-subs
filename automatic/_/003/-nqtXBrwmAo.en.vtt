fall<00:03:07.170> into<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.470> trap<00:03:07.530> sure<00:03:11.450> it's<00:03:12.450> much

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
fall into that trap sure it's much

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.730 
fall into that trap sure it's much
better<00:03:13.110> than<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.380> baby<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.800> reckon<00:03:15.230> Gerry<00:03:16.230> DiMasi
