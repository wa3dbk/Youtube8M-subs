00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 chain3 the television more knowing that 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.029
 the proper empanadas were never worked 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.610
 ok this lent 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.550
 ok very well what do you think if we start 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.799
 for saying that I use a puff pastry I know if 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.800
 let's use in this case half a kilo 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.039
 of flour flour 5 grams of salt 5 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.800
 grams of salt 400 grams of butter 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.350
 or failing margarine for the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.900
 Pastoral of pasta and 300 milliliters of 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.660
 water since good I want to tell you 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.309
 that we're also going to do some with one 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.800
 pasta that has to make cakes that 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.110
 we can not stop saying that the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.360
 puff pastry we can not fry it because no 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.579
 you can fry we're going to bake in 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.079
 this case and now yes I am already at 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.079
 kitchen and also here the click 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.660
 let's place our 5 grams of salt 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.270
 very good 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.270
 we are going to place approximately 50 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.270
 grams of butter ok 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.230
 if you are incorporating the water please 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.230
 very well 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.500
 step by step 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.030
 I am very cautious but good I am with a 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.100
 expert then if he tells me that he 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.410
 says it will do something recommended the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.020
 things without fear 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.640
 and this and it's the chef forgot the era 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.930
 so put the butter until 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.940
 was doing the outside raul in this 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.880
 moment and forgot to put the butter 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.140
 and when it starts to hang it's going to be what 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.510
 that made it start to start 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.880
 intersperse the butter and suddenly 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.950
 when they bake they get up in caracas 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.420
 exactly then a good story 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.760
 I love the stories of the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.880
 Gastronomy are really fun 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.580
 is very similar to this mass is very 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.430
 simple to have an expert like you 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.500
 but here we have several fillings 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.640
 we can do the filling you told me the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.630
 typical is a tuna to the vizcaína 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.690
 American we have some proposals 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.680
 different as are the cottage cheese 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.480
 spinach with cheese that is happening to them 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.730
 you can go saying spinach only 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.430
 they skip a little we sauté spinach 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.430
 with a little garlic since they are well 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.070
 We would do what chiles are 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.440
 serranos very well and with a little bit of 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.520
 onion so thundered and we mix the 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.410
 Tomato that seasoning and incorporate the 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.230
 shrimp and we take it out almost quickly 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.790
 as a tip so that the shrimp 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.400
 blanqueen you have to make a shock 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.110
 thermal we are going to put the moments 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.850
 same 10 seconds in boiling water 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.360
 we passed water 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.410
 and ready as thermal shock shock 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.960
 very good thermal 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.250
 we already have our dough we are going to take a 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.410
 little bit of flour on the bottom 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.180
 very well so that it does not stick 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.610
 our dough we are going to draw four points 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.990
 four cardinal points what I'm going 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.440
 pulling from here these questions I wanted to 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.890
 presume that this is the mass and this is 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.840
 the frying dough that is with yeast 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.670
 exactly you will not appreciate it from here 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.980
 so we can say it here we already have 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.890
 also another one that is for the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.940
 we also have here ready list 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.890
 but we are going to do them this time 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.200
 but I want to tell you that the canainpa 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.630
 is giving us some hotel courses and 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.070
 so that he will give them but also 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.690
 What if I want to tell you that they give you some 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.580
 wonderful courses all the chips of the 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.220
 Canainpa are wonderful and always 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.870
 they have something very important to teach 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.360
 well here we are going to incorporate in the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.270
 center let's drop four points this 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.850
 point hundred we should leave an edge 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.870
 to counteract the doubles we're going 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.200
 to do 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.000
 and we're going to cover our butter with 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.330
 the four tips that 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.400
 we took out a while ago and well covered 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.500
 so that fat does not go away 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.500
 leave for some reason ok 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.310
 now if I recommend you do not try 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.380
 roll the roller in this way because the 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.950
 fat is going to disperse is a way 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.300
 very bad then let's try some 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.000
 hits 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.170
 and this will help them come 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.170
 my little hand claudio graf 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.260
 this is a citizen applause can I 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.640
 work very well we have a little bit of 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.810
 flour whenever you work with a little 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.760
 of flour both in the bottom 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.680
 as the top part above for 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.140
 prevent us from sticking our roller 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.550
 and on the back work table that 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.420
 let's do what we know 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.280
 as simple folds as well as we can 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.810
 identify this type of fold what 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.270
 we can relate to the doubles of a 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.000
 more typical triptych that simple 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.350
 it's the first doubles and we're going to undo 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.450
 this step four times 420 times 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.920
 the size that I had long and what 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.010
 we are doing and that is going to be 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.930
 four times and they will fold it in 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.010
 of triptych for the right and then 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.080
 appears or vice versa or vice versa 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.480
 with detail here and it's like a very rule 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.210
 general the amount of fat we're going to 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.030
 use is always going to be 50 per 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.860
 percent in relation to the total weight of your 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.569
 dough 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:39.030
 to fit in a good the mind of 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:42.060
 our dough will weigh one kilo and one kilo 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.219
 a mass we are going to put half a kilo of 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.540
 butter and we carry the second doubles 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:48.280
 very good second doubles 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.380
 we can give an account here is where he has not 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.380
 touched the fat with the dough 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.120
 it tends to change color another thing is 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.430
 that people can already buy their pasta 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.830
 of puff pastry of course fine but not 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.360
 There is how you know how to do it and know that 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.810
 we are doing not that is very nice 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.760
 this we are going to let it rest at least one 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.310
 Cooling time 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.910
 so that the magnesia butter case 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.590
 take suffered because a better result 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.330
 It seems very good to me because here 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.220
 we have of course the puff pastry already 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:26.430
 nervous 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.430
 so he can touch us and it 's cold 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.930
 then we are going to extend it 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.790
 another little detail that there is in a pasta 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.860
 puff pastry and what a nice puff that beard 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.790
 It's beautiful, I hope I like it 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:43.980
 like to feel the textures of the masses 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:46.200
 of making a thick dough for him has a 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.170
 Very nice size in the specific case 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.820
 of a puff pastry between less weight 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:55.950
 Sustaga is going to raise more 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.350
 remember that the weight is loaded like that 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:01.170
 I declare then between less weight have 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.090
 will be able to raise better we knead as of 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.900
 how long to how much to put in 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.419
 wide to make our empanadas 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.100
 the thickness of the dough 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:12.350
 half centimeter of 10 centimeters and 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.930
 let's help a cutter that is 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:19.139
 the size that you already want to obtain 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:21.330
 with the circuits that I have to go 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:23.220
 but we can still see and here 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:30.229
 We fill in and at what temperatures 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:30.229
 we bake at 200 degrees 220 minutes 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.750
 as that quality more or less 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:39.210
 Well, how generous they are 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.610
 remove those given the recipe if you want 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.560
 more I invite you to subscribe to the channel 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.750
 youtube and so you can have with you 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.320
 our virtual recipe book when 

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.320
 you need
