adapter this USB 2 SATA adapter you can
see<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.710> per<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:21.000> hard<00:00:21.270> drive<00:00:21.449> of

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
see that this per to the hard drive of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.679 
see that this per to the hard drive of
this<00:00:21.750> laptop<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.699> these<00:00:23.699> two<00:00:24.029> go<00:00:24.269> into<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
this laptop and these two go into the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.390 
this laptop and these two go into the
computer<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.680> I'm<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> connect<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.369> to
