00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.150
 [music] 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.310
 hello my dear so today 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.170
 I do this gentle spring manicure 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.029
 [music] 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.130
 Well, I 'll start of course with the cuticle 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.020
 apply this sally hansen tool 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.510
 I have already told him more than once 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.970
 literally a small amount on our 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.340
 for about half a minute this is quite 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.960
 enough because the funds are very 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.040
 strong 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.640
 [music] 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.640
 here 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.240
 I will continue to use this 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.250
 metal tool if you still have 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.380
 little skill it is better to use here 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.420
 such less traumatic have wooden 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.920
 wand 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.790
 I will move the cuticle very much 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.030
 neatly 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.610
 not pressing hard on the whole bed 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.650
 my cuticle is already very soft therefore 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.390
 This work does not give me much trouble 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.559
 procedure if you still have it 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.400
 hard dry 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.890
 then be extremely careful neat 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.690
 because 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.790
 strong pressure you can 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.320
 injure your nail and therefore you had 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.320
 just grow unevenly 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.490
 I washed my hands and now I will degrease 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.210
 nails and for this I will use here 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.280
 rimmel wipes for removal 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.280
 varnish very convenient thing 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.870
 there is no need 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.870
 need 7 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.480
 next is the time the basics I use 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.210
 remedy for russian brand style 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.130
 wine to strengthen nails with acrylic and 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.260
 iron 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.330
 on the basis of course varnish is applied 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.520
 much smoother besides of course this 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.380
 protection when using bright varnishes 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.180
 so that the nails are not painted but in 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.240
 some degree of a hundred per cent to 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.920
 unfortunately helps and of course 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.090
 a kind of nail strengthening and 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.920
 let's get down to staining as 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.250
 primary color I will use varnish 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.440
 by isadora shoes 730 this is very 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.650
 beautiful or fishing lilac shade 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.050
 very gentle unfortunately from the first layer 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.650
 it does not overlap uniform 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.220
 stripes and of course specks on the principle 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.490
 post the second layer everything looks already 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.929
 pain when you stand 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:50.929
 [music] 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.980
 I will use it as decoration 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.370
 110 glitter from golden rouse 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.270
 it is of course also a very harmful varnish with it 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.780
 it is necessary to tinker so that the liquid 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.060
 the same picture from the first layer 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.170
 superimposed very badly but again 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.120
 the second layer solves this problem 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.610
 I want to mention one more minus to 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.090
 remove these sparkles see need 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:34.840
 a lot of free time and very healthy 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:37.030
 nervous system so now 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.250
 get a good result we need 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.600
 repeat and above procedure shown 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.860
 again 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.860
 [music] 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.399
 [music] 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.360
 [music] 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.979
 [music] 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.930
 Well, I put the veins that's what I have 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.730
 it turned out and the next one I will need 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.870
 apply top topcoat 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.010
 I use this completely simple 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.280
 clear varnish he is already a little bit 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.930
 painted but no of course the top will interfere 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.470
 cover i need to on to 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.290
 the point glittered with glossy shine and for 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.100
 order to prolong the manicure life in 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.260
 principle 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.500
 it will last for me for another day 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.400
 three and every day i will cover 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.400
 clear top top coat 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.399
 Well, the final touch after all 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.839
 manipulations i need to soften the cuticle 

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:02.259
 I will use this 

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:04.389
 intensive cream from nivea for dry skin 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:08.249
 hands he is very thick so me 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.819
 It will take literally a drop on 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:12.819
 every nail 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:16.629
 and then I will do a kind of massage 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:19.930
 which also does not hurt well and balances in 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:26.150
 principle, you can rub into the skin of the hands 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:29.240
 [music] 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.760
 By the way, I really love this cream and after 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.240
 its my long-suffering dry skin of hands 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:42.360
 on really transforming 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:44.099
 [music] 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.710
 here is my spring manicure 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:49.439
 ready to sleep it does not take much 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.360
 time for this all thank you very much 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:53.990
