gonna get a MacBook Air and maybe even

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.670 
gonna get a MacBook Air and maybe even
try<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.790> Chromebook<00:02:31.330> on<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.350> see<00:02:32.500> how<00:02:32.530> it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
try a Chromebook on this and see how it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.010 
try a Chromebook on this and see how it
looks<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.310> we'll<00:02:33.850> be<00:02:33.970> right<00:02:34.060> back<00:02:34.300> guys

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.210 

alright<00:02:38.020> so<00:02:38.260> we<00:02:38.380> backed<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.650> camera<00:02:39.010> up<00:02:39.070> just

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
alright so we backed the camera up just

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.010 
alright so we backed the camera up just
a<00:02:39.280> little<00:02:39.489> bit<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:39.790> can<00:02:39.910> get<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.180> good<00:02:40.600> look<00:02:40.810> at

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
a little bit so I can get a good look at

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.350 
a little bit so I can get a good look at
what<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:41.800> looks<00:02:41.860> like<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.640> here<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.330> a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
what this looks like and here is a

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.170 
what this looks like and here is a
Chromebook<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.620> believe<00:02:44.980> this<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.160> about<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.550> 11

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
Chromebook I believe this is about a 11

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.650 
Chromebook I believe this is about a 11
inch<00:02:46.330> Chromebook<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.459> one<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.540> them

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
inch Chromebook that is one of them

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.790 
inch Chromebook that is one of them
actually<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.080> first<00:02:50.200> Chromebook<00:02:50.650> from

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
actually the first Chromebook from

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.100 
actually the first Chromebook from
Samsung<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.270> we've<00:02:52.420> got<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.690> propped<00:02:52.930> up

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
Samsung and so we've got it propped up

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.530 
Samsung and so we've got it propped up
on<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.680> stand<00:02:54.100> so<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:54.940> what<00:02:55.360> its<00:02:55.480> gonna

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
on the stand so this is what its gonna

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.420 
on the stand so this is what its gonna
look<00:02:55.660> like<00:02:55.810> it's<00:02:56.170> got<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.320> nice<00:02:56.560> elevation<00:02:57.130> or

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
look like it's got a nice elevation or

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.420 
look like it's got a nice elevation or
angle<00:02:57.760> for<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.209> be<00:02:58.270> able<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.450> type<00:02:58.750> with<00:02:59.020> no

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
angle for you to be able to type with no

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.400 
angle for you to be able to type with no
problem<00:03:00.430> whatsoever<00:03:00.780> here<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.930> can<00:03:02.080> see<00:03:02.260> the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
problem whatsoever here you can see the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.130 
problem whatsoever here you can see the
back<00:03:02.650> now<00:03:03.370> with<00:03:03.700> this<00:03:03.880> one<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.630> doesn't<00:03:04.840> use

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
back now with this one it doesn't use

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.760 
back now with this one it doesn't use
the<00:03:05.320> upper<00:03:05.680> two<00:03:06.450> little<00:03:07.450> rubber<00:03:07.770> stoppers

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
the upper two little rubber stoppers

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.370 
the upper two little rubber stoppers
here<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:10.239> does<00:03:10.510> want<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.840> slide<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.170> little

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
here and it does want to slide a little

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.890 
here and it does want to slide a little
bit<00:03:11.800> because<00:03:12.430> there's<00:03:12.820> nothing<00:03:12.970> up<00:03:13.269> top<00:03:13.300> here

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
bit because there's nothing up top here

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.810 
bit because there's nothing up top here
the<00:03:14.350> nice<00:03:14.530> thing<00:03:14.560> on<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:14.950> Chromebook<00:03:15.250> is<00:03:15.640> it

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
the nice thing on the Chromebook is it

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.790 
the nice thing on the Chromebook is it
actually<00:03:16.239> has<00:03:16.420> some<00:03:16.720> little<00:03:17.230> rubber<00:03:17.380> feet<00:03:17.590> up

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
actually has some little rubber feet up

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.250 
actually has some little rubber feet up
here<00:03:17.980> too<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:18.550> it's<00:03:19.510> not<00:03:19.630> gonna<00:03:19.780> slide<00:03:19.959> that

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
here too so it's not gonna slide that

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.830 
here too so it's not gonna slide that
much<00:03:20.500> but<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:21.190> will<00:03:21.370> slide<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.820> little<00:03:22.209> bit<00:03:22.360> so

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
much but it will slide a little bit so

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.840 
much but it will slide a little bit so
you<00:03:23.500> know<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:23.739> is<00:03:23.890> more<00:03:24.100> probably<00:03:24.459> tailored

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
you know this is more probably tailored

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.290 
you know this is more probably tailored
for<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.180> MacBook<00:03:25.360> Pro<00:03:25.780> MacBook<00:03:26.200> Air<00:03:26.440> line<00:03:27.300> but

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
for the MacBook Pro MacBook Air line but

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.430 
for the MacBook Pro MacBook Air line but
I<00:03:28.330> did<00:03:28.540> want<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.750> just<00:03:28.959> kind<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.200> do<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.350> quick

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
I did want to just kind of do a quick

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.860 
I did want to just kind of do a quick
sampling<00:03:30.010> with<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.340> Chromebook<00:03:30.880> in<00:03:31.060> here<00:03:31.300> just

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
sampling with a Chromebook in here just

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.259 
sampling with a Chromebook in here just
to<00:03:31.989> see<00:03:32.170> how<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.500> looked<00:03:32.739> so<00:03:33.550> we'll<00:03:34.060> go<00:03:34.239> ahead

and move on to the MacBook series and
do<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.760> little<00:03:38.909> sample<00:03:39.150> how<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.659> looks<00:03:39.900> we'll

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
do a little sample how that looks we'll

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.509 
do a little sample how that looks we'll
be<00:03:40.290> right<00:03:40.440> back<00:03:40.590> guys<00:03:40.769> on<00:03:41.010> pause<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.310> video

be right back guys on pause the video
one<00:03:41.700> more<00:03:41.790> time<00:03:44.629> okay<00:03:45.629> so<00:03:45.659> we<00:03:45.989> have<00:03:46.110> the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
one more time okay so we have the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.270 
one more time okay so we have the
13-inch<00:03:46.980> MacBook<00:03:47.220> Air<00:03:47.849> and<00:03:48.470> this<00:03:49.470> does<00:03:49.680> fit<00:03:50.129> it

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
13-inch MacBook Air and this does fit it

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.880 
13-inch MacBook Air and this does fit it
a<00:03:50.459> lot<00:03:50.670> better<00:03:51.260> we're<00:03:52.260> gonna<00:03:52.379> flip<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.799> around

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
a lot better we're gonna flip it around

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.899 
a lot better we're gonna flip it around
here<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.940> I'll<00:03:54.000> show<00:03:54.299> you<00:03:54.330> slid<00:03:55.170> off<00:03:55.909> right

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
here and I'll show you slid off right

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.420 
here and I'll show you slid off right
there<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.510> does<00:03:57.750> actually<00:03:58.019> fit<00:03:58.290> flush<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.280> does

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
there it does actually fit flush it does

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.690 
there it does actually fit flush it does
fit<00:03:59.760> on<00:03:59.909> the<00:04:00.170> for<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.950> Chula<00:04:02.220> rubber<00:04:02.459> feet<00:04:02.610> up

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
fit on the for the Chula rubber feet up

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.880 
fit on the for the Chula rubber feet up
here<00:04:02.849> but<00:04:03.090> for<00:04:03.810> some<00:04:03.989> reason<00:04:04.319> this<00:04:04.500> wants<00:04:04.799> to

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
here but for some reason this wants to

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.470 
here but for some reason this wants to
slide<00:04:05.129> I<00:04:05.159> think<00:04:05.430> almost<00:04:06.000> worse<00:04:06.180> than<00:04:06.209> the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
slide I think almost worse than the

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.039 
slide I think almost worse than the
Chromebook<00:04:06.900> wants<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.290> slide<00:04:07.530> but<00:04:08.840> there<00:04:09.840> you

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
Chromebook wants to slide but there you

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.479 
Chromebook wants to slide but there you
see<00:04:10.200> what<00:04:10.319> it<00:04:10.440> looks<00:04:10.590> like<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:10.980> does<00:04:11.099> almost

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
see what it looks like it does almost

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.220 
see what it looks like it does almost
fit<00:04:11.670> flush<00:04:12.000> up<00:04:12.209> here<00:04:12.390> against<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:12.750> back<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.200> is

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
fit flush up here against the back it is

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.159 
fit flush up here against the back it is
using<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.890> little<00:04:14.099> rubber<00:04:14.250> stoppers<00:04:15.169> up

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
using the little rubber stoppers up
