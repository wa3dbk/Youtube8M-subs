at<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.730> can<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:26.939> also<00:00:27.119> make<00:00:27.539> computers<00:00:28.289> more

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
at but can we also make computers more

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.620 
at but can we also make computers more
intelligent<00:00:29.060> can<00:00:30.060> they<00:00:30.119> actually<00:00:30.300> make

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
intelligent can they actually make

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.780 
intelligent can they actually make
something<00:00:30.949> this<00:00:31.949> sort<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.219> knows<00:00:32.430> what<00:00:32.460> you

almost<00:02:11.920> run<00:02:12.250> over<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.790> people<00:02:13.060> who<00:02:13.090> are

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
almost run over the people who are

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.630 
almost run over the people who are
behind<00:02:13.480> me<00:02:13.720> who<00:02:14.530> had<00:02:14.860> come<00:02:15.100> up<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.459> take<00:02:15.610> a

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
behind me who had come up to take a

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.370 
behind me who had come up to take a
photo<00:02:16.150> they<00:02:16.269> compared<00:02:16.540> on<00:02:16.660> their<00:02:16.780> cameras

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
photo they compared on their cameras

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.570 
photo they compared on their cameras
they<00:02:17.590> don't<00:02:17.739> watch<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.459> they're<00:02:18.550> not

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
they don't watch it and they're not

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.090

watching<00:02:18.790> where<00:02:19.030> they're<00:02:19.180> going<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:20.980> think

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
watching where they're going so I think

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.650 
watching where they're going so I think
that's<00:02:21.340> one<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.580> things<00:02:21.760> that's<00:02:21.940> compelling

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
that's one of things that's compelling

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.870 
that's one of things that's compelling
about<00:02:22.780> these<00:02:22.989> devices<00:02:23.260> as<00:02:23.620> well<00:02:23.800> they<00:02:24.519> allowed

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
about these devices as well they allowed

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.520 
about these devices as well they allowed
the<00:02:25.180> technology<00:02:25.720> get

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
the technology get

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.120 
the technology get
Zook<00:02:27.190> actually<00:02:27.520> live<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.440> believe<00:02:29.440> more<00:02:29.770> fully

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130
