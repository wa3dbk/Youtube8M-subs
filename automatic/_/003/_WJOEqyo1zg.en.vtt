00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:11.349
 what's up everyone talks to them mark mex 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.450
 politicians because we are in the reviews 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.639
 of the vector and well I've heard 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.740
 comments that it is in his rifle that 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.109
 better goes until the moment after the 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.810
 Last update apparently was also 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.179
 rifle that goes better that's what I've 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.250
 listened to but not personal is to say that 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.500
 I like it very much indeed this is a 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.500
 but my rifle is not his rifle 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.320
 favorite nor am I not one of those who 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.970
 they believe that it is the best function but good 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.010
 we'll talk about the best rifle in 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.230
 next videos but I repeat guys this 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.730
 weapon I stop pretty pretty well even 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.130
 much better than before due to the 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.380
 update that came out does things from 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.810
 a desire and good guys in the episode 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.430
 previous of the pv w asked me to 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.710
 give many more details of the 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.810
 accessories even though I believed that 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.790
 it was quite complete Serbs so 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.280
 good guys can be a case and in 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.690
 this video we're going to correct that and we're going 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.239
 to cover even more accessories 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.640
 in particular the vector and bertsos in 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.170
 As for the peepholes I the truth 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.240
 always opined that they are unnecessary 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.580
 regardless of the weapon that is but 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.799
 especially in this weapon that is the 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.009
 vector the look that brings of default is 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.720
 very very comfortable to use therefore if 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.390
 you put a peephole then 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.299
 do without it without affecting yourself 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.640
 for nothing but a very good accessory that 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.490
 you can add to this weapon is the look 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.740
 in laser since the vector especially goes 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.289
 super good when firing from the hip and 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.899
 let's go with a laser sight it gives you a 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.360
 incredible accuracy and good guys with 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.240
 muffler say about you 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.890
 considerably reduces the damage that was 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.020
 before but from the last 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.060
 update have totally balanced 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.550
 this is pretty much better 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.500
 using the muffler what yes 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.569
 I highly recommend guys and that's 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.880
 basically any circus boss is 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.250
 that you put it in or recharge it but that 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.229
 basically to load faster or 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.390
 well the extended loaders this is 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.270
 to have more bullets you can also go 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.700
 very very very good if you put something to it 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.590
 the precision that in fact this weapon is 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.810
 pretty accurate I remember when I 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.510
 I was using said I need this thing 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.850
 even when I was running the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.460
 challenges of this weapon without accessories and 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.070
 no advantages 70 then note that this weapon 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.600
 it's very, very, very precise, obviously it's going 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.520
 to have its recoil like any weapon 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.800
 but I repeat it is very accurate however 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.420
 you can increase the pressure even more if 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.520
 you put an accessory like the hilt 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.650
 that I personally always put him 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.600
 designer almost to all weapons or well 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.280
 the refounded that as you know is for 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.070
 put a little faster and give some 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.500
 more precision and good guys the canyon 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.570
 long personally do not notice a 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.550
 very very remarkable difference 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.370
 so maybe you can do without this 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.250
 accessory the vector has a very good 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.590
 balance between the bullets it brings and the 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.510
 quickly with which he shoots it so 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.820
 well that's enough will go very very 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.070
 fine whether it puts you as a silencer or 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.270
 if you only take away differences 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.550
 Of course it's obviously going to kill you 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.070
 with one bullet less if you do not put the 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.440
 initiator but this is going much better 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.600
 Now with a silencer and a boy then 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.220
 this has been basically everything 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.890
 in any suggestion that they want 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.300
 let something else want them to 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.700
 talk is that they want it to encompass more 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.810
 things of the difficult ones with all 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.430
 trust say it here in the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.020
 comments yes, good I say goodbye
