00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 welcome to other flames of god laws 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.589
 today we will talk about more fit fragment of 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.589
 monolith 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.290
 here we have a pin and let's go 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.500
 beginning to apply a bit of your 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.500
 skills 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.040
 the first thing is laments and mikko in the 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.330
 famous wheel that when we launched it we 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.880
 we go to the speed of movement of 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.350
 enemy and ours increases this we 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.570
 it serves to work more more to the 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.040
 enemies we can also use it when 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.140
 an enemy escape do not have rank 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.610
 we can launch but also a million 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.150
 to be able to give the persecution more 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.150
 quickly 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.270
 how are we going to play alone everything is 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.220
 add that life brutal attacks is 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.810
 very important besides that we paste the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.310
 passively deactivate when we activate the 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.170
 skill we increase our mature and 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.910
 the attacks up to a maximum of 40% 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.440
 this comes in handy to increase 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.520
 our damage since we hit with the 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.520
 hit ability on the ground 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.440
 as I said before we hit the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.240
 hit ability on the ground and the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.250
 reason is the following with this skill 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.890
 we paste in area and reduce speed 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.410
 of the enemy attack plus 50% 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.180
 of extremadura is the damage as you will see if 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.400
 we combine brutal life attack and 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.970
 then we use hit on the ground the damage 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.970
 it will be much greater 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.229
 and the next the definitive unit 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.820
 Unstoppable strength plus fit is thrown towards 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.070
 one point and we throw all the enemies 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.329
 that rogue in the area to the air in 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.950
 this ability serves to control a 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.780
 tim fain since we left everyone 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.649
 incapacitated and the allies will have the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.649
 opportunity to hit first 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.350
 I forgot to say at the beginning 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.299
 passive but now I will put here the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.860
 granite shield skill more and you 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.450
 has a survival that is 10 per 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.549
 one hundred percent his maximum life every 10 seconds 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.200
 that we have hit them will recharge the 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.220
 true that this advantage makes us be 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.220
 pretty good in the single top 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.150
 Now we discuss your sequence 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.210
 skills 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.280
 as you see, I upload attacks first 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.630
 brutal and then hit on the ground already 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.730
 which is a good combination of Marfi's 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.140
 at least at level 1 we will go up 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.610
 seismic fragments so that the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.620
 enemies have less speed to 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.520
 flee and as always we will respect the 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.590
 final order of life 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.550
 next we will talk about 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.550
 more fit equipment 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.220
 we'll start with a cloth wood and 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.739
 five life portions if the enemies 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.630
 are more damage we will catch the tav of 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.489
 ninjas in case of being more enemy than 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.349
 incapacitate we should catch the 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.270
 mercury the first of objects of 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.430
 tanks that we will catch will be the weighing of 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.930
 rand wing this object is very important 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.180
 as a tank since it gives us a tremendous 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.360
 survival remember that first object 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.160
 that we have to buy in that pack will be 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.990
 the heart of gold 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.510
 another object that suit you more fit 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.700
 is the spine mesh because it gives us 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.569
 a lot of armor and we bounce 30% of 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.939
 it damages the objective 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.200
 we will make a good ice heart for 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.150
 that we control the enemy masses 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.349
 besides that our character reduces 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.540
 the attack speed on the target 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.849
 besides the ice heart also what 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.409
 do so we will count the damages and the 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.170
 our armor increases the and we will do 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:03.120
 more damage a good solar layer never 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.189
 it comes badly because it gives us life and armor 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.200
 with this water we have much more against 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.329
 the enemies and we also hurt in 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.219
 area thanks to its unique passive and by 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.349
 last we can catch the angel of the 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.090
 saves since it gives us armor and 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.310
 magic resistance we can also 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.750
 resurrect to continue fighting and in case 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.370
 that we have more magicians we can 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.900
 catch us then the veil of the fairy 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.909
 death since it gives us much more 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.230
 magical resistance and the barrier the 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.819
 passive barrier comes to us phenomenal 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.819
 since we stopped a spell 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.350
 now we will talk about how it should be 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.020
 play with more files 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.580
 we must play quite defensively and 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.650
 that we are still not at our point 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.930
 strong but give him a tip do not fear 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.250
 for your life we ​​have the passive and we 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.320
 It gives a lot of advantage to hold the line 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.450
 since it always recharges at 10 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.040
 seconds when they are not impacted anymore to 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.350
 level 6 we can put it a little more 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.270
 aggressive but not because no sensitivity 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.850
 it's safe to fight one against one 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.160
 here change our game we are more 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.990
 hard we have more skills and we have 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.690
 security will kill enemies or 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.790
 control them more fite at level 6 with 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.260
 our last one we can throw ourselves 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.690
 head against the group of enemies and 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.690
 control the situation in case 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.980
 we want to win we should 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.200
 use the cv to chase an enemy 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.090
 we slowed it down and with our 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.070
 companions we could tear down the most 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.480
 sad one against one is pretty good 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.190
 if you wear a mesh of thorns since 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.380
 We report the damage and kept us going over the 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.400
 experiences in case we still do not have 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.230
 the mesh of thorns 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.680
 we should take off the fighting next to 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.680
 our mates 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.940
 good friends, I hope you serve this 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.760

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.440
 only two and as I always say I hope that 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.840
