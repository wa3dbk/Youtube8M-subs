00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
through this or you know in the process

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.440 
through this or you know in the process
or<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.550> know<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.820> watch<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
just got hurt like the big

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.440 
just got hurt like the big
recommendations<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.969> would<00:00:42.090> make<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> you

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
recommendations that I would make to you

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.799 
recommendations that I would make to you
is<00:00:42.570> number<00:00:43.050> one<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.670> look<00:00:44.670> look<00:00:45.000> hard<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.570> do<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
is number one to look look hard and do a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.600 
is number one to look look hard and do a
lot<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.050> research<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.039> surgeon<00:00:47.460> that's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
lot of research on the surgeon that's

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.250 
lot of research on the surgeon that's
going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> surgery<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.170> know

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
going to do the surgery because you know

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.110 
going to do the surgery because you know
that's<00:00:49.440> obviously<00:00:49.920> make-or-break<00:00:50.670> deal

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that's obviously make-or-break deal

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.020 
that's obviously make-or-break deal
there<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.469> then<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.129> really<00:00:53.820> try<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
there and and then just really try to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.180 
there and and then just really try to
follow<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> protocol<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.649> don't<00:00:56.039> let

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
follow the protocol if you can don't let

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.330 
follow the protocol if you can don't let
them<00:00:56.309> cast<00:00:56.610> your<00:00:56.850> arm<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:58.320> immobilize<00:00:59.160> you

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
them cast your arm up and immobilize you

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.380 
them cast your arm up and immobilize you
because<00:00:59.609> then<00:00:59.730> you're<00:00:59.850> going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.180> lot

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
because then you're going to get a lot

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.540 
because then you're going to get a lot
of<00:01:00.510> muscle<00:01:00.840> atrophy<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.350> basically<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:02.520> I

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
of muscle atrophy so basically what I

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.160 
of muscle atrophy so basically what I
have<00:01:02.760> done<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.239> now<00:01:03.300> I'm<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> brace<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:04.019> me

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
have done and now I'm the brace with me

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.500 
have done and now I'm the brace with me
now<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.610> hard<00:01:05.820> plastic<00:01:06.060> race

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
now but it's just a hard plastic race

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.740 
now but it's just a hard plastic race
that<00:01:06.780> basically<00:01:07.260> kept<00:01:07.439> me<00:01:07.530> at<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.680> 90<00:01:08.750> 90

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
that basically kept me at a 90 90

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.620 
that basically kept me at a 90 90
degrees<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.830> my<00:01:10.950> elbow<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.270> kind

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
degrees with my elbow and it just kind

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.780 
degrees with my elbow and it just kind
of<00:01:12.689> velcroed<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.530> off<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.520> able<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
of velcroed on and off so I was able to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.780 
of velcroed on and off so I was able to
take<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.060> off<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.570> started<00:01:15.960> physical<00:01:16.170> therapy

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
take it off and started physical therapy

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.340 
take it off and started physical therapy
basically<00:01:17.790> right<00:01:18.299> away

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
basically right away

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.570 
basically right away
leading<00:01:20.130> up<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.909> away<00:01:21.150> from

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
leading up and away from

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.020 
leading up and away from
away<00:01:23.090> from<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:23.450> surgery<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.880> anyway<00:01:25.880> that's

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
away from the surgery so anyway that's

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.970 
away from the surgery so anyway that's
kind<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.690> big<00:01:26.870> recommendations<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:27.920> I

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
kind of the big recommendations that I

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.450 
kind of the big recommendations that I
would<00:01:28.130> make<00:01:28.660> as<00:01:29.660> far<00:01:29.900> as<00:01:30.050> rehab<00:01:30.440> goes<00:01:30.740> right

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
would make as far as rehab goes right

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.770 
would make as far as rehab goes right
now<00:01:31.610> I'll<00:01:31.760> start<00:01:32.000> doing<00:01:32.120> some<00:01:32.390> strengthening

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
now I'll start doing some strengthening

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.680 
now I'll start doing some strengthening
stuff<00:01:33.370> with<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:34.520> arms<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.090> full<00:01:35.360> range<00:01:35.570> of

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
stuff with the arms so full range of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.630 
stuff with the arms so full range of
motion<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.470> obviously<00:01:36.890> start<00:01:37.160> really<00:01:37.430> light

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
motion and obviously start really light

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.540 
motion and obviously start really light
really<00:01:37.820> high<00:01:38.090> reps<00:01:38.420> with<00:01:39.020> curls<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:40.490> know

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
really high reps with curls and you know

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.950 
really high reps with curls and you know
just<00:01:40.730> kind<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:40.940> build<00:01:41.150> back<00:01:41.360> up<00:01:41.570> from<00:01:41.780> there<00:01:41.900> so

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
just kind of build back up from there so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.680 
just kind of build back up from there so
everything's<00:01:42.710> going<00:01:42.920> well<00:01:43.390> you<00:01:44.390> know<00:01:44.510> pretty

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
everything's going well you know pretty

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.050 
everything's going well you know pretty
optimistic<00:01:44.900> about<00:01:45.470> how<00:01:46.100> everything<00:01:46.520> went<00:01:46.700> so

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
optimistic about how everything went so
