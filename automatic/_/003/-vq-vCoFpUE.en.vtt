this<00:01:08.759> soft<00:01:09.119> rubber<00:01:09.509> so<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
this soft rubber so that's not going to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.990 
this soft rubber so that's not going to
damage<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.409> ipad<00:01:13.409> at<00:01:13.560> all<00:01:13.799> really<00:01:14.580> does<00:01:14.790> look

nice let's get the ipad and pop it into
the<00:01:18.900> case<00:01:19.280> now<00:01:20.280> i'm<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.729> start<00:01:20.970> at<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the case now i'm going to start at the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.380 
the case now i'm going to start at the
top<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.720> think<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.799> fit<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
top I think to fit it it's just going to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.750 
top I think to fit it it's just going to
be<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.750> matter<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.700> popping<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.750> one<00:01:27.990> side

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
be a matter of popping it in to one side

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.210 
be a matter of popping it in to one side
like<00:01:29.760> so<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:30.710> manipulating<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.830> into

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
like so and then manipulating it into

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.030 
like so and then manipulating it into
the<00:01:32.310> case<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:32.940> it's<00:01:33.750> all<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.170> clips<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.740> as

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the case and it's all just clips in as

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.840 
the case and it's all just clips in as
you<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.330> in<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:36.690> while<00:01:37.229> that's<00:01:37.470> nice

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.429 
interesting this this bottom section
what<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.790> allows<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.330> do<00:01:48.510> is<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:49.140> can

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
going to damage your iPad and then you

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.260 
going to damage your iPad and then you
can<00:01:55.049> actually<00:01:55.200> keep<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.369> ipad<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> case

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
can actually keep the ipad in the case

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.649 
can actually keep the ipad in the case
and<00:01:57.630> sit<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:59.030> on<00:02:00.030> your<00:02:00.710> keyboard<00:02:01.710> dock<00:02:02.189> or

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
and sit this on your keyboard dock or

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.080 
and sit this on your keyboard dock or
perhaps<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.960> normal<00:02:04.380> ipad<00:02:05.280> dock<00:02:05.549> just<00:02:05.970> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
perhaps the normal ipad dock just the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.259 
perhaps the normal ipad dock just the
dock<00:02:06.270> by<00:02:06.479> itself<00:02:06.780> without<00:02:07.020> removing<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.269> ipad

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
dock by itself without removing the ipad

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.899 
dock by itself without removing the ipad
from<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.689> case<00:02:09.899> now<00:02:10.829> i<00:02:10.860> think<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.579> that<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
from the case now i think that that is a

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.929 
from the case now i think that that is a
brilliant<00:02:12.769> design<00:02:13.769> it's<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:14.610> looking<00:02:14.849> out

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
brilliant design it's just looking out

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.780 
brilliant design it's just looking out
from<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.329> back<00:02:15.510> view<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.159> flap

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
from the back view so this is the flap

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.850 
from the back view so this is the flap
that<00:02:18.090> comes<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.900> allow<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.380> dock<00:02:19.620> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
that comes up to allow you to dock the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.010 
that comes up to allow you to dock the
ipad<00:02:20.220> without<00:02:20.520> removing<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.150> now<00:02:21.690> there<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:21.989> a

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
be a little bit firmer it certainly

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.750 
be a little bit firmer it certainly
works<00:03:19.950> very<00:03:20.250> well<00:03:20.750> top<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.560> case<00:03:23.040> you've

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
got cut out there for the earphone

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.270 
got cut out there for the earphone
socket<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.670> also<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> microphone<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.500> power

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
socket and also the microphone the power

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.190 
socket and also the microphone the power
on/off<00:03:29.640> button<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.209> another<00:03:30.660> rubberized

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
on/off button is another rubberized

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.810 
on/off button is another rubberized
button<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:31.980> again<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.430> be<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.640> little

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
button so again you have to be a little

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.650 
button so again you have to be a little
bit<00:03:32.930> firmer<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.590> turn<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.340> ipad<00:03:35.700> on<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.570> off
