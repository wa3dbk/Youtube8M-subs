00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.610
 snow snow 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.340
 you have heard because today is 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.700
 my nose is a bit clogged that is too 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.610
 the reason why I only this video 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.329
 this Saturday published today 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.610
 and not only on monday 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:33.420
 So my body temperature went away 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.969
 It was only 38 degrees Celsius 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.000
 but the snuff really prevented me 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.100
 yes the 10 correspond to the microphone 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.100
 then you would certainly have something to come 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.800
 probably now is understood too 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.680
 a bit duller with my voice 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.780
 but right here but the video will be 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.910
 not too long now and I start 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.320
 now only with my top 5 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.320
 favorite bounty hunter 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.190
 So on place 5 I have no nobis 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.259
 Chosen probably many 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.960
 not of you that it is such a thing 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.270
 Russi other who possesses the ability 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.990
 your skeleton on the minimal size 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.030
 to squeeze together from the possession of 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.030
 lengthen any end stretcher readers 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.310
 whip and defeat obi wan 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.509
 kenobi was in close combat but was 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.759
 finally killed by annika yes 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.759
 your special skills and through 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.090
 the extraordinary weapon puts you 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.740
 for me something special as I had 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.539
 again two times especially in one sentence 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.659
 Oh great 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:49.270
 but no matter and yes it was not like that yet 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.270
 my favorite but at least fifth place 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.720
 in fourth place is also a woman 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:00.319
 namely to the essence that is a credit 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.149
 and can thus change their look to 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.990
 I like your weapons variety 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.910
 especially her sniper rifle 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.180
 when I first got the 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.040
 second episode looked said that 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.660
 is a pretty horny part 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.849
 So if I were a sniper I would have 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.239
 probably also one in length 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.280
 Has 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:24.680
 I do not think that's special 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.090
 Modern is well women should be too 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.950
 not let down with her 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.810
 occupation and there I think it's right 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.269
 that she works as a bounty hunter 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.230
 and they are thus against the stronger 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.940
 but biological sex interspersed 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.640
 unfortunately she suffers a ridiculous 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.000
 death by attacks you do not 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.920
 is justified because she also with the 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.500
 spring worked together and 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.500
 also holds small emotions 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.019
 in third place is a druid 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.019
 Type of hot tg 88 are assassins 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.390
 droids and they developed their own 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.780
 intelligence and needs brought themselves 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.660
 the builder devils not at them the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.299
 ganglion with her long legs like her 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.470
 Keep your arms and with the robot 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.319
 heads looking for something 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.840
 it gives us such a consequence where they are in the 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.310
 senate building storm 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.709
 that out of one but it is not 88 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.870
 and yes it is also something new druiden 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.349
 sniper sniper rifle 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.349
 to see 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.010
 about my place two namely kidman 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.870
 I already have a ten facts 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.959
 video made 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.069
 he has a lot of great ones 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.480
 Specification on his equipment 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.010
 to think ahead with his and 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.620
 tactical skill is one too 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.769
 the best head of the galaxy 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.420
 long cherished after death and the 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.440
 sympathy did not necessarily show that 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.359
 sympathetic but funny acts book or 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.700
 his plane just crashed in 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.700
 I'm sorry about South Africa, though 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.199
 and at number one is like christo 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:25.419
 a previously determined where i do not even 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.900
 He knows why he is the number one 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:32.020
 but i thought it was cool but i can 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.069
 at least say to him this was only 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.229
 sometimes expresses and that something to him 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:41.470
 gives mystical and his fighting style 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.330
 with the kyoto war helmes legendary and 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.639
 Nevertheless, the duel survived in the 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.970
 box a mine after star wars the clone 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.440
 was favorite 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.360
 yes I hope you liked it right away 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.389
 is a cool outtake the home straight 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.729
 made here in one of the last sentences 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:02.889
 and they will not be there until next 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:10.050
 times without a cold and looks that him 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:10.050
 gives something mystical mystical
