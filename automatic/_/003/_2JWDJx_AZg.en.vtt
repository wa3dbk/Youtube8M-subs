4-6-2<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:31.500> areas<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:40.270> already<00:01:40.390> used<00:01:40.540> it

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
4-6-2 so areas I have already used it

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.270 
4-6-2 so areas I have already used it
probably<00:01:42.190> not<00:01:42.310> much<00:01:43.800> it<00:01:44.800> makes<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.100> really

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
probably not much it makes a really

probably not much it makes a really
weird<00:01:45.550> sound<00:01:45.970> when<00:01:46.509> its<00:01:46.660> first<00:01:46.930> turned<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.640> so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
weird sound when its first turned on so

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
weird sound when its first turned on so
that<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.710> back<00:01:53.039> we<00:01:54.039> have<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.729> dial<00:01:55.149> to<00:01:55.479> how

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
that on the back we have the dial to how

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.050 
that on the back we have the dial to how

shutter<00:02:03.610> or<00:02:04.119> something<00:02:04.830> then<00:02:05.830> on<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.130> bottom

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
shutter or something then on the bottom

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.279 
shutter or something then on the bottom
is<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.640> hot<00:02:06.880> shoe<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.690> which<00:02:07.899> makes<00:02:08.170> it

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
is a hot shoe and which makes it

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.130 
is a hot shoe and which makes it
automatic<00:02:08.830> with<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.070> camera<00:02:09.550> so<00:02:09.929> I'll<00:02:10.929> show

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
automatic with the camera so I'll show

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:26.270 

now<00:02:17.980> if<00:02:18.070> we<00:02:18.160> turn<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.489> up

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.750 

so<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.550> have<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.660> thing<00:02:28.930> at<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.580> head<00:02:30.580> of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
so you can have the thing at the head of

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.100 
so you can have the thing at the head of
the<00:02:31.000> camera<00:02:31.360> at<00:02:31.980> 90<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:34.240> then<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.810> says<00:02:34.960> on<00:02:35.050> the
