water even if you're not tanking because
you'll<00:01:06.260> pull<00:01:06.440> so<00:01:06.710> much<00:01:06.979> damage<00:01:07.250> you'll<00:01:07.490> easily

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
you'll pull so much damage you'll easily

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.390 
you'll pull so much damage you'll easily
pull<00:01:08.060> off<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.390> air<00:01:08.509> tank<00:01:08.890> also<00:01:09.890> takes<00:01:10.160> walk

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
pull off the air tank also takes walk

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.100 
pull off the air tank also takes walk
whenever<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.910> current<00:01:11.240> tank<00:01:11.450> get<00:01:11.690> static

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
whenever the current tank get static

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.610 
whenever the current tank get static
wound<00:01:12.320> on<00:01:12.500> it

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.430 

so<00:01:18.580> after<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.210> conductive<00:01:19.750> water<00:01:19.960> pool<00:01:20.200> takes

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
so after the conductive water pool takes

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.470 
so after the conductive water pool takes
up<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.680> full<00:01:20.860> quarter<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.370> room<00:01:21.550> gin<00:01:22.300> Rock

up a full quarter of the room gin Rock

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.730 
up a full quarter of the room gin Rock
will<00:01:22.630> move<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:22.960> middle<00:01:23.200> of<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.350> room<00:01:23.530> and

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
will move to the middle of the room and

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.950 
will move to the middle of the room and
cast<00:01:23.860> lightning<00:01:24.190> storm<00:01:24.670> this<00:01:25.390> will<00:01:25.570> cause<00:01:25.750> the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
cast lightning storm this will cause the

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.990 
cast lightning storm this will cause the
water<00:01:26.170> pool<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:27.040> look<00:01:27.310> like<00:01:27.460> lightning<00:01:27.880> and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
water pool to look like lightning and

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.090 
water pool to look like lightning and
become<00:01:28.300> harmful<00:01:28.600> it'll<00:01:29.290> become<00:01:29.380> electrified

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
become harmful it'll become electrified

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.970 
become harmful it'll become electrified
