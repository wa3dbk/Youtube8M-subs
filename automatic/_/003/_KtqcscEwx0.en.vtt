that song in this song I'm the same

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.099 
that song in this song I'm the same
tuning<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.270> that's<00:00:21.420> why<00:00:21.539> he<00:00:21.630> does<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.930> pretty

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
tuning so that's why he does it pretty

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.870 
tuning so that's why he does it pretty
much<00:00:22.199> right<00:00:22.380> after<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.340> tuning<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
much right after so the tuning is the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.279 
much right after so the tuning is the
trick<00:00:24.119> once<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.480> get<00:00:24.660> your<00:00:24.779> guitar<00:00:25.080> tuned

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
it's I guess a little bit difficult to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.540 
it's I guess a little bit difficult to
have<00:00:27.090> your<00:00:27.210> hand<00:00:27.420> stretched<00:00:27.810> out<00:00:28.019> but<00:00:28.740> uh<00:00:28.800> you

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
have your hand stretched out but uh you

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.310 
have your hand stretched out but uh you
get<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.730> hang<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.869> tuning<00:00:31.260> is

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
get the hang of it so the tuning is

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.180 
get the hang of it so the tuning is

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.690 

I<00:02:06.530> think<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.620> hard<00:02:07.830> part<00:02:08.070> for<00:02:08.130> me<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.490> wing

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
I think the hard part for me is wing

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.460 
I think the hard part for me is wing
when<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.509> hit<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.780> fourth<00:02:10.050> fret<00:02:10.290> of<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.380> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
when you hit the fourth fret of the a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.110 
when you hit the fourth fret of the a
it's<00:02:10.830> kind<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.100> hard<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.640> meted<00:02:12.030> out

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
it's kind of hard to get this meted out

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.850 
it's kind of hard to get this meted out
John<00:02:12.600> Mayer<00:02:12.810> actually<00:02:13.170> sticks<00:02:13.470> his<00:02:13.590> thumb<00:02:13.830> up

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
John Mayer actually sticks his thumb up

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.760 
John Mayer actually sticks his thumb up
over<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:14.940> can't<00:02:15.030> hold<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.260> position

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
over but I can't hold the this position

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.800 
over but I can't hold the this position
and<00:02:17.400> get<00:02:17.610> my<00:02:17.760> thumb<00:02:18.000> over<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.450> eat<00:02:18.570> them<00:02:18.690> all

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and get my thumb over and eat them all

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.600 
and get my thumb over and eat them all
out<00:02:18.990> so<00:02:19.230> what<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.590> do<00:02:19.710> is<00:02:20.010> when<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.250> hit<00:02:20.550> that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
out so what I do is when I hit that

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.020 
out so what I do is when I hit that
fourth<00:02:21.060> fret<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.600> kind<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.200> slide<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.710> up<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
fourth fret I kind of slide it up and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.110 
fourth fret I kind of slide it up and
rest<00:02:24.030> my<00:02:24.270> middle<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.930> thumbnail<00:02:26.030> but<00:02:27.030> it

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
rest my middle like thumbnail but it

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.550 
rest my middle like thumbnail but it
still<00:02:27.330> rattled<00:02:27.690> sometimes<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.230> that's<00:02:28.380> like

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
still rattled sometimes so that's like

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.670 
still rattled sometimes so that's like
the<00:02:28.620> only<00:02:28.800> real<00:02:29.190> problem<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:31.140> I'm<00:02:31.380> gonna<00:02:31.470> play

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the only real problem so I'm gonna play

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.500 
the only real problem so I'm gonna play
it<00:02:31.740> through<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.160> then<00:02:32.280> I'll<00:02:32.400> kind<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.700> talk

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
it through and then I'll kind of talk

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.850 
it through and then I'll kind of talk
about<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.870> strum<00:02:34.080> pattern<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:34.530> not<00:02:34.709> too

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
about the strum pattern it's not too

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.320 
about the strum pattern it's not too
difficult<00:02:35.070> it's<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.550> little<00:02:35.700> fast<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.209> other

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
difficult it's a little fast but other

00:02:36.330 --> 00:03:07.009 
difficult it's a little fast but other
than<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.450> it's<00:02:36.600> not<00:02:36.660> too<00:02:36.780> bad<00:03:05.390> okay<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
than that it's not too bad okay so the

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.590 
than that it's not too bad okay so the
strum<00:03:07.350> pattern<00:03:07.800> is<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:09.090> kind<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.390> do<00:03:09.510> it

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
strum pattern is you kind of do it

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
strum pattern is you kind of do it
however<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.870> want<00:03:10.080> as<00:03:10.320> long<00:03:10.410> as<00:03:10.470> you

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
however you want as long as you

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.900 
however you want as long as you
understand<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.130> four<00:03:11.310> beats<00:03:11.550> in<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.790> measure

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
understand the four beats in a measure

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:51.370 
understand the four beats in a measure
type<00:03:12.239> thing<00:03:12.480> but<00:03:12.720> from<00:03:13.410> what<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.620> gather<00:03:13.950> the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.870 

listening<00:03:52.380> song<00:03:52.620> over<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:52.920> over<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.820> should

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
listening song over and over you should

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.360 
listening song over and over you should
kind<00:03:54.330> of<00:03:54.510> be<00:03:55.440> able<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.680> just<00:03:55.860> pick<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.040> up<00:03:56.190> by

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
kind of be able to just pick it up by

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.699 
kind of be able to just pick it up by
ear<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.670> understand<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:58.070> I<00:03:59.070> think<00:03:59.820> that's

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
ear and understand it and I think that's

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.780 
ear and understand it and I think that's
that's<00:04:01.709> pretty<00:04:01.950> much<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.280> it's<00:04:02.459> pretty<00:04:02.640> easy

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
that's pretty much it it's pretty easy

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.130 
that's pretty much it it's pretty easy
song<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.360> think<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.660> once<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.930> got<00:04:04.049> the

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
song I think it's once you got the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.390 
song I think it's once you got the
tuning<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.560> understand<00:04:04.920> where<00:04:05.040> your<00:04:05.160> fingers

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
tuning I understand where your fingers

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.729 
tuning I understand where your fingers
need<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.670> be<00:04:05.820> it's<00:04:06.390> just<00:04:06.510> practice<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.200> hold

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
need to be it's just practice and hold

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.110 
need to be it's just practice and hold
in<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.920> position<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.430> kind<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:08.730> stretches

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
in the position it kind of stretches

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.099 
in the position it kind of stretches
your<00:04:09.209> hand<00:04:09.360> out<00:04:09.480> it's<00:04:09.600> got<00:04:09.750> like<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.930> Dave
