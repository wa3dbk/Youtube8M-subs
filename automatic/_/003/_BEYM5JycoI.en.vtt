not<00:02:18.689> saying<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.959> don't<00:02:19.049> have<00:02:19.230> faith<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.709> okay

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
not saying I don't have faith in okay

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.729 
not saying I don't have faith in okay
see<00:02:20.219> okay<00:02:20.400> see<00:02:20.579> wood<00:02:20.909> will<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.689> the<00:02:22.290> Clippers

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
see okay see wood will be the Clippers

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.130 
see okay see wood will be the Clippers
and<00:02:23.040> beat<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.819> Spurs<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.180> go<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.780> finals

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
and beat the Spurs to go to the finals

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.619 
and beat the Spurs to go to the finals
and<00:02:25.230> if<00:02:25.379> that<00:02:25.560> happens<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.700> OKC<00:02:27.299> will<00:02:27.450> go

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
and if that happens and the OKC will go

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.369 
and if that happens and the OKC will go
probably<00:02:28.620> game<00:02:28.799> six<00:02:29.129> against<00:02:30.170> him<00:02:31.170> since

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
probably game six against him since

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.379 
probably game six against him since
against<00:02:31.560> Brooklyn<00:02:31.920> but<00:02:32.129> if<00:02:32.310> not<00:02:32.489> then<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:33.269> will

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
against Brooklyn but if not then we will

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.949 
against Brooklyn but if not then we will
see<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.750> heat<00:02:34.200> vs<00:02:34.730> heat<00:02:35.730> vs<00:02:36.060> okc<00:02:36.299> again<00:02:36.719> and

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
see the heat vs heat vs okc again and

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.569 
see the heat vs heat vs okc again and
hopefully<00:02:37.409> Kevin<00:02:37.950> Durant<00:02:38.189> stepped<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.549> the

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579

hopefully Kevin Durant stepped up to the
plate<00:02:38.670> now<00:02:39.389> hopefully<00:02:39.750> but<00:02:39.900> he<00:02:39.959> stepped<00:02:40.049> up<00:02:40.170> to
