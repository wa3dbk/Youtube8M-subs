 [music] 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.270
 but how is he mr gray waiting for you 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.610
 extremely smart 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.470
 truly strong what you owe your 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:35.550
 I know people well with success 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.900
 instinctively feel how to manage them 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.900
 she stands and the peasants 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.760
 [music] 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.760
 but 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.560
 I noticed you panglos 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.560
 are you dating someone 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.760
 without you 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.860
 I prefer to see your face so that 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.460
 understand what you think good 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.420
 dictate and I keep everything under control 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.020
 sounds pretty boring 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.160
 [music] 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.260
 [applause] 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.260
 [music] 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.250
 you play a double game 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.420
 you'd better stay away from me 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.490
 and not the one you need 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.369
 you have too many secrets 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.470
 difficult past is all you have to do 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:37.100
 know my tastes quite unusual 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.100
 I'm afraid you will not understand 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.100
 open up 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.430
 [music] 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.960
 why are you trying to change me 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.900
 this is not true 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.049
 do you make me different 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.049
 [music] 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.010
 no longer 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.850
 I'm sure I can give him what he is 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:07.970
 wants 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:12.300
 [music] 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.610
 if I stay what happens next 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.020
 [music] 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.180
