 Explain how to register sentences that you use frequently as one word 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.490
 What is the benefit of registering that frequently used sentence as a single word ? 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.610
 Speaking of 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.700
 Just call that word 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.740
 E-mail the sentences that I always use frequently 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.030
 It means that you can type in words 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:49.210
 The merit is more than commentary in words 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:51.040
 Everyone's because the easy-to-understand better to show you in the video is in your hand of the personal computer as of this video

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.600
 First of all 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:13.250
 Although there is a screen desktop which started this personal computer 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.210
 The task is to start the child at the bottom of the desktop or where there are statistics 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.680
 Call it a bar 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.810
 Or it is in the taskbar and lies have been written back in the single-handle 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.650
 Then 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:29.909
 There is a place where 8 is written 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:32.909
 This is what is called a language bar, but in this language bar 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.190
 There is a button that says this tool 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.410
 Please click this button 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:46.590
 If you do not see this language bar, you can use a PC with windows xp 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:51.360
 If you are a user, right click on this taskbar to see the language bar 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.810
 Click on the toolbar and click this language bar to check 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.210
 Please give me 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.490
 When the check of the language bar is out language in the taskbar offices in this 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.420
 Right-click toolbar on the taskbar if you do not see the bar 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.460
 Click 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:11.360
 You will kick the language bar and you will come out with the dusk version 2 language bar. 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.720
 You will be able to manipulate this language bar 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.990
 Then 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:22.520
 Click the button that says this tool 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.520
 Then I'm there is that word of the registration, click the registration of the word 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:36.330
 You will then be presented with a window for word registration 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:39.750
 And I always input sentences that you often use in place of words in this 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:45.379
 For example, when you said in the previous example of business documents 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:52.310
 When it also indebted 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:52.310
 When it is a turn-Naka Co., Ltd., for example, abc 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:03.830
 Please do not enter here or always replace with sentences that you use frequently 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:08.480
 And reading writes the above sentence abbreviation 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:13.430
 For example, the sentence that it is Tanaka of the company abc that says after the turn is always taken care of 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.420
 If it is good for reading , then press enter and confirm your input 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.569
 I will 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.670
 And press the button of registration 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.670
 And if you can register, press Throw 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:34.660
 If you register words that are often used frequently 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:39.580
 Input speed of e-mail of speed text is faster to achieve it 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.810
 For example, gmail's google mail software is displayed now 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.470
 I will 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.380
 You are usually email software outlook express 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.950
 outlook or windows mail or windows live 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:55.060
 Though I think that using email Toka various e-mail software 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.840
 All are the same, for example, when sending e-mail to the other party 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.640
 In the body 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.269
 When I am Tanaka of abc Co., Ltd., who is always indebted, I used to input each time 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.910
 To do 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:12.440
 But it's bothersome to enter each time, but in such a case, please register the word just before 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:17.200
 If it is this book, it is good to read the word 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:21.700
 The and the input and conversion in space key not 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:25.630
 Then the word was registered as a candidate for conversion earlier 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.860
 The text that it is Tanaka of abc Co., Ltd. who is always indebted is already here 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.430
 It will come out 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:35.780
 So if you click on this sentence and press enter 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.600
 Every long sentence that it is Tanaka of abc Co., Ltd. who always cares for me purposely 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:43.710
 You don't have to hit it from before 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:48.030
 By registering words by doing this, you 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.320
 It is either sentence without 's because we write speed You quickened to overwhelming this e-mail 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.860
 I think it's good 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.189
 Often when making a document with a word 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.340
 Always use words If you use words frequently 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:03.620
 I only have to register words 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:06.010
 Let's do one more thing, for example, thank you at the end of the nail 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.010
 It is toka 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:13.190
 There is a fixed sentence 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:17.630
 If there is a sentence that has been decided, I will continue to input and thank you each time 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:21.880
 The thank you very much troublesome for in the Maruo 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:28.490
