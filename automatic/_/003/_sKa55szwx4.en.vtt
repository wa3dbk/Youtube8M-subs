00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello everyone is steven is 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.309
 today in this new video I 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.340
 will explain to you how to jailbreak 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.960
 ios 7.1 and 7 points 1 point 1 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.270
 it is a type jailbreak 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.630
 untethered so a complete jailbreak that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.060
 works with the iPhone aces 5 5 5 c 4 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.289
 s4 the fifth generation ipod touch 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.269
 the ipad 2 3 4 the ipad r and the ipad mini 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.560
 as well as the ipad mini with retina display 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.180
 so I'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.739
 for that you can use a device 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.390
 who has lots of things on it or so 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.320
 nothing at all I tested both 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.329
 works perfectly 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.530
 you remove your security clearance and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.450
 you make a small backups 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.739
 itunes it can always be useful and 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.180
 then in the settings of your 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.670
 device you will go in the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.899
 date and time section you turn off the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.850
 automatic adjustment and there you go 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.079
 change the date manually so that 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.489
 you can do the jailbreak without 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.860
 worry you are going to have to adjust your 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.780
 device on the date of June 2, 2014 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.039
 so like these and no panic a 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.079
 time the jailbreak ended the date 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.420
 back to normal to finish you 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.439
 connect your device to your computer 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.510
 to make this jailbreak we will use 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.770
 pangu a little program that you can 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.939
 download through the links that get 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.840
 just below it in the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.090
 description of the video 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.530
 so you download you install it 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.150
 then on your computer and then 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.720
 we're going to start this 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.820
 jailbreak 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.110
 you run penghu and then 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
 the application comes from this 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.409
 So you see how it's all 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.790
 in Chinese with some characters that 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.900
 are not supported by the computer 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.299
 that's why you have points 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.680
 of questioning here just to the right of my 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.900
 mouse is the model of your iphone 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.560
 with its version of ios so me he in 7.1 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.750
 points 1 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.220
 then just below the gray bar 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.990
 and it will be a progress bar is 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.970
 here the black button this will be the button of 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.170
 jailbreak to finish right here you you 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.270
 and you have a little button that is 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 checked by default and if you leave it 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.840
 like that it will allow you 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.759
 to install 25 pp I do not know if you 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.049
 know if a Chinese alternative to 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.210
 the apple app store that allows particular 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.619
 to have applications cracked so 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.210
 I'm unchecked for this jailbreak 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.500
 so that's all there is to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.119
 know about the interface of this little 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.770
 software we can start by clicking 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.149
 on the jailbreak button and there you see 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.950
 that the little progress bar is going to 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.479
 gradually fill in after 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.280
 a few seconds that's what appears 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.990
 on your springboard so the icon of 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.720
 the pangu app has been added around 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.040
 from your other apps you 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.480
 do not touch right now you wait 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.370
 although on the little software the bar 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.750
 progress is coming to this state by 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.460
 close in the middle of his total progress 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.690
 there when she is stopped it's good 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.640
 you can press the icon of 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.410
 the application pangu and there this message of 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.670
 confirmation appears so all that 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.530
 you have to do is press the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.390
 button continue the progress bar 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.950
 will get back in motion and on your 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.540
 iphone or your ipod touch or ipad 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.880
 you will have this white screen with the logo 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.350
 pangu on we know quite normal 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.250
 and after a while he will even 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.080
 put to restart 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.580
 no you do not touch anything you 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.080
 wait just wait 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.700
 the jailbreak procedure are continuing 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.780
 so I'll leave it at real speed 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.190
 you will see that it's a jailbreak 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.410
 relatively fast 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.930
 it takes a little less than five minutes 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.730
 there my iphone finishes restarting and 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.750
 then you have new screens 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.700
 whites that will succeed each other 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.780
 so here we have for example this one 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.060
 you see you have information 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.010
 so that once again you 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.790
 do not touch anything we show you enjoy 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.709
 jailbreak 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.850
 once it's over and there your 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.410
 device starts to restart a 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.610
 last time so you'll have the apple 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.920
 white apple on black background 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.060
 the jailbreak is over after 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.590
 few seconds you can 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.060
 unlock and then you noticed 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.620
 that you have now if there is 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.209
 so what you can do is 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.190
 open it and cons you will have to 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.780
 wait a few minutes you see 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.400
 that cydia shows you preparation of the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.230
 system so there it will load every 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.850
 data that contains the sources the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.620
 packets and then your device 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.269
 restart you can go back to 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.320
 again on cydia and this time he 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.890
 works it's AIDS that you 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.959
 know well 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.310
 you can quit the pangu app 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.380
 ended you now 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.950
 jailbreak your iphone ipod touch or 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.120
 ipad under ios 7.1 or 7.1 points and that's 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.410
 untethered way 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.150
 so that's how it needed to be 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.860
