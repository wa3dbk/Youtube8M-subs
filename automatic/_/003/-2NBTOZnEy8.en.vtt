game development and what I would like

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.930 
game development and what I would like
to<00:00:11.429> do<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:12.030> kind<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.509> push<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.990> aside<00:00:13.110> for<00:00:13.940> for

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
to do is kind of push that aside for for

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.840 
to do is kind of push that aside for for
this<00:00:15.269> episode<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.990> we'll<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:17.100> do<00:00:17.400> something

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
this episode and we'll just do something

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.790 
this episode and we'll just do something
completely<00:00:18.270> different<00:00:21.199> this<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.410> essentially

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
completely different this is essentially

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200 
completely different this is essentially
a<00:00:22.859> project<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.250> I've<00:00:23.369> been<00:00:23.400> working<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.910> on

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
a project that I've been working on on

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.870 
a project that I've been working on on
and<00:00:24.359> off<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.869> while<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.859> been<00:00:26.099> my<00:00:28.609> if<00:00:29.609> it

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
and off for a while it's been my if it

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.400 
and off for a while it's been my if it
existed<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> App<00:00:30.779> Store<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.050> wouldn't

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
existed in the App Store I wouldn't

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.060 
existed in the App Store I wouldn't
bother<00:00:31.700> but<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:33.000> doesn't<00:00:33.559> what<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.800> is

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
bother but it doesn't what it is is

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.790 
bother but it doesn't what it is is
essentially<00:00:35.430> its<00:00:35.750> Emacs<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.110> iPhone<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
essentially its Emacs for the iPhone and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.040 
essentially its Emacs for the iPhone and
there's<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> number<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.000> kind<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.300> hangups

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
there's a number of kind of hangups

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.500 
there's a number of kind of hangups
with<00:00:40.500> trying<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.950> get<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.370> work<00:00:41.510> mostly

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
with trying to get that to work mostly

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.709 
with trying to get that to work mostly
the<00:00:43.079> corded<00:00:43.829> keybinding<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.090> Emacs<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the corded keybinding so Emacs is a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.650 
the corded keybinding so Emacs is a
programmers<00:00:46.289> text<00:00:46.620> editor<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.879> iPhone<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.360> OK

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
programmers text editor the iPhone is OK

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360 
programmers text editor the iPhone is OK
at<00:00:48.809> generating<00:00:49.320> text<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:50.160> doing

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
at generating text like for doing

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.010 
at generating text like for doing
texting<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.030> email<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.539> sort<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.809> thing

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
texting and email and that sort of thing

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.240 
texting and email and that sort of thing
but<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> find<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.699> not<00:00:54.480> very<00:00:55.039> well<00:00:56.039> suited

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
but what I find it not very well suited

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.180 
but what I find it not very well suited
for<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:57.109> editing<00:00:58.109> text<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.649> that's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.010> lot<00:00:59.160> of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
for is editing text and that's a lot of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.729 
for is editing text and that's a lot of
time<00:00:59.399> since<00:00:59.640> stuff<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.059> feel<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.930> need

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
time since stuff that I feel like I need

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.090 
time since stuff that I feel like I need
to<00:01:02.359> where<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> feel<00:01:03.570> productive<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.260> editing

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to where I feel productive is editing

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.750 
to where I feel productive is editing
papers<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.790> code<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.630> sort<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.049> thing<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
papers or code or that sort of thing and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.010 
papers or code or that sort of thing and
Emacs<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> great<00:01:09.270> text<00:01:09.900> editor<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:12.450> app

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
Emacs is a great text editor so this app

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.170 
Emacs is a great text editor so this app
that<00:01:13.320> I've<00:01:13.439> developed<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.549> essentially<00:01:15.090> an

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that I've developed is essentially an

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450 
that I've developed is essentially an
experiment<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> get<00:01:16.619> an<00:01:16.799> e<00:01:17.009> max<00:01:17.250> like

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
experiment in can you get an e max like

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.289 
experiment in can you get an e max like
experience<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> iPhone<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:20.670> I'll<00:01:21.000> just

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
experience on the iPhone so I'll just

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.219 
experience on the iPhone so I'll just
show<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.750> guys<00:01:24.380> hello<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:27.229> QT

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
show it to you guys hello so this is QT

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.890 
show it to you guys hello so this is QT
Emacs<00:01:28.799> quick<00:01:29.610> touch<00:01:29.939> Emacs<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
Emacs quick touch Emacs it's a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.420 
Emacs quick touch Emacs it's a
derivative<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.560> Q<00:01:32.040> Emacs<00:01:32.400> not<00:01:33.360> GNU<00:01:34.049> Emacs

because<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.670> figured<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.420> would<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.659> easier

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
because I figured this would be easier

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.319 
because I figured this would be easier
to<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.259> going<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.250> here's<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.970> screen

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
to get going so here's the screen

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.830 
to get going so here's the screen
there's<00:01:40.110> your<00:01:40.350> mode<00:01:40.560> long<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:42.750> know

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
there's your mode long and you know

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.560 
there's your mode long and you know
let's<00:01:43.079> let's<00:01:43.409> try<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.710> out<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:45.390> big

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
let's let's try this out so the big

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.679 
let's let's try this out so the big
problem<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:46.020> corded<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.520> quarter<00:01:48.119> key<00:01:48.299> input

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
problem is corded in a quarter key input

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.090 
problem is corded in a quarter key input
like<00:01:48.930> control<00:01:49.380> meta<00:01:49.979> shift<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:52.799> tact<00:01:53.009> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
like control meta shift so the tact that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.370 
like control meta shift so the tact that
I've<00:01:53.280> taken<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.869> almost<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.350> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
I've taken is this it's almost like a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.410 
I've taken is this it's almost like a
kind<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.390> working<00:01:57.390> back<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.820> Palm

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
kind of working back to the the Palm

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.589 
kind of working back to the the Palm
Pilot<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.590> let's<00:02:02.579> say<00:02:02.899> hello<00:02:03.899> okay

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.229 

hello<00:02:09.599> okay<00:02:10.379> there<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:10.709> go

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
hello okay there we go

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.850 
hello okay there we go
so<00:02:12.239> down<00:02:12.720> here<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:13.260> essentially

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
so down here is essentially

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.730 
so down here is essentially
the<00:02:14.160> unbonded<00:02:15.560> no<00:02:16.560> modifier<00:02:17.010> keys<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:18.740> up

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
the unbonded no modifier keys and up

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.500 
the unbonded no modifier keys and up
above<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.400> shift<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.360> if<00:02:21.480> we<00:02:21.600> say<00:02:23.000> h4<00:02:24.000> hello

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
above it is shift so if we say h4 hello

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.540 
above it is shift so if we say h4 hello
and<00:02:24.960> then<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:26.990> that's<00:02:28.370> okay

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
and then I that's okay

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.250 
and then I that's okay
so<00:02:31.130> I've<00:02:32.130> kind<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.430> forgotten<00:02:32.780> what<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.810> drew

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
so I've kind of forgotten what I drew

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.720 
so I've kind of forgotten what I drew
for<00:02:34.470> these<00:02:34.620> things<00:02:34.860> but<00:02:35.100> then<00:02:35.280> here<00:02:35.580> we<00:02:35.700> have

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
for these things but then here we have

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.140 
for these things but then here we have
control<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:36.900> let's<00:02:37.050> do<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> control<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.150> then

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
control so let's do a control a and then

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.210 
control so let's do a control a and then
let's<00:02:39.330> do<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> control<00:02:39.900> E<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:40.980> see<00:02:41.100> it

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
let's do a control E and you can see it

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.710 
let's do a control E and you can see it
moves<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.550> cursor<00:02:41.730> around<00:02:42.000> as<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.600> would

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
moves the cursor around as you would

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.850 
moves the cursor around as you would
expect<00:02:43.080> for<00:02:43.200> Emacs<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:45.380> let<00:02:46.380> me<00:02:46.440> just<00:02:46.620> show

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
expect for Emacs and let me just show

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.160 
expect for Emacs and let me just show
you<00:02:46.890> kind<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.250> what<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.550> character<00:02:47.940> set<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.180> so

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
you kind of what the character set is so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.760 
you kind of what the character set is so
here's<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.740> character<00:02:50.160> set<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.590> nice

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
here's the character set and the nice

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.440 
here's the character set and the nice
thing<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:54.300> can

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
thing is that you can you can

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.180 
thing is that you can you can
essentially<00:02:54.810> change<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.770> whatever<00:02:55.950> it

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
essentially change this to whatever it

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
to work and actually a lot of this the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.060 
to work and actually a lot of this the
features<00:03:20.549> actually<00:03:20.850> are<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:22.410> know<00:03:22.500> working

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
features actually are you know working

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.750 
features actually are you know working
pretty<00:03:23.459> well

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
pretty well

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.220 
pretty well
for<00:03:24.600> instance<00:03:24.930> let<00:03:25.380> me<00:03:25.470> try<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:25.680> again<00:03:30.230> I'm

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
for instance let me try this again I'm

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.160 
for instance let me try this again I'm
trying<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.500> split<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.890> screen<00:03:31.920> X<00:03:32.700> ctrl<00:03:33.360> X<00:03:33.480> -<00:03:33.840> oh

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
trying to split the screen X ctrl X - oh

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.970 
trying to split the screen X ctrl X - oh
it's<00:03:34.769> doing<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.100> Z<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.489> as<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:36.390> can<00:03:36.480> see<00:03:36.540> the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
it's doing a Z so as you can see the

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.410 
it's doing a Z so as you can see the
trying<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.070> figure<00:03:38.190> out<00:03:38.340> what<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.880> character

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
trying to figure out what the character

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.180 
trying to figure out what the character
set<00:03:39.630> should<00:03:39.780> be<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:40.080> actually<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> big<00:03:40.769> problem

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
set should be is actually a big problem

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.340 
set should be is actually a big problem
and<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:41.820> is<00:03:41.880> one<00:03:42.150> of<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.299> reasons<00:03:42.570> why<00:03:42.750> I

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
and this is one of the reasons why I
