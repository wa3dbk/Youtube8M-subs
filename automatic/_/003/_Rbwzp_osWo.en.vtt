the<00:00:25.820> bike<00:00:26.739> this<00:00:27.739> is<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:28.070> float<00:00:28.339> that<00:00:28.579> was<00:00:28.730> in

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
the bike this is the float that was in

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.259 
the bike this is the float that was in
it<00:00:29.060> one<00:00:29.750> side<00:00:30.079> of<00:00:30.259> the<00:00:30.349> float<00:00:30.590> was<00:00:30.739> actually

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
it one side of the float was actually

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.970

now I thought maybe I should have took a
video<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.210> me<00:01:33.479> installing<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.440> nothing

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
