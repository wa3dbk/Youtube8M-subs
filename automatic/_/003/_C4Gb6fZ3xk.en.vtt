freaked<00:01:41.869> out<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:43.100> you're<00:01:43.220> serving<00:01:43.460> them

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140

gray<00:01:45.140> meat

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.050 

and<00:01:49.220> it's<00:01:49.460> really<00:01:49.700> windy<00:01:49.850> here

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.750 

all<00:01:55.630> right<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.380> back<00:01:57.340> on<00:01:57.549> we<00:01:57.700> go<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:59.760> you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
all right and back on we go and you

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.370 
all right and back on we go and you
don't<00:02:01.090> really<00:02:01.330> need<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.630> let<00:02:01.840> it<00:02:01.930> rest<00:02:02.140> too

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
don't really need to let it rest too

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.380 
don't really need to let it rest too
long<00:02:02.619> because<00:02:02.950> again<00:02:03.580> we've<00:02:03.940> been<00:02:04.090> cooking

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
this for nine hours

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.300 
this for nine hours
