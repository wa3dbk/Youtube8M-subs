I just straight-up don't have time for
gaming<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:36.149> i<00:01:36.479> get<00:01:36.719> home<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.439> nine

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
gaming if i get home and it's like nine

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.469 
gaming if i get home and it's like nine
o'clock<00:01:38.219> at<00:01:38.399> night<00:01:38.609> and<00:01:38.850> I've<00:01:38.969> had<00:01:39.179> fire

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
o'clock at night and I've had fire

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.300 
o'clock at night and I've had fire
training<00:01:39.810> or<00:01:40.140> whatever<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.679> it<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:40.920> think

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
training or whatever of it I just think

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.370 
training or whatever of it I just think
it<00:01:42.179> would<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.299> excellent<00:01:42.689> right<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:43.109> and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
it would be excellent right now and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.709 
it would be excellent right now and
sleep<00:01:44.039> sleep<00:01:44.880> would<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.119> excellent<00:01:45.829> and<00:01:46.829> oh<00:01:47.719> ok

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
sleep sleep would be excellent and oh ok

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.629 
sleep sleep would be excellent and oh ok
so<00:01:49.409> i<00:01:49.740> usually<00:01:50.189> don't<00:01:50.460> hop<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:52.490> hop<00:01:53.490> over

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
so i usually don't hop on and hop over

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.550 
so i usually don't hop on and hop over
that<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:54.060> rock<00:01:54.389> or<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.749> little<00:01:55.020> concrete

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
that little rock or that little concrete

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.039

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
block so whenever pone or somebody says
