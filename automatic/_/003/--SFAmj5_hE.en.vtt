the Craigslist o'clock our starting

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.910 
the Craigslist o'clock our starting
point<00:01:20.600> was<00:01:20.660> to<00:01:20.990> think<00:01:21.200> about<00:01:21.440> how<00:01:21.620> we<00:01:21.680> could

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
point was to think about how we could

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.310 
point was to think about how we could
move<00:01:22.190> in<00:01:22.610> some<00:01:22.850> of<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.060> social<00:01:23.480> spaces<00:01:23.750> the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
move in some of the social spaces the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.370 
move in some of the social spaces the
cafes<00:01:24.830> part<00:01:25.430> of<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.730> main<00:01:25.940> tend<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.840> give<00:01:27.020> much

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
cafes part of the main tend to give much

cafes part of the main tend to give much
more<00:01:27.650> space<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.430> art<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:29.300> guess<00:01:29.450> out<00:01:29.630> of

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
more space to art and I guess out of

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.870 
more space to art and I guess out of
that<00:01:29.870> concept<00:01:30.410> we<00:01:30.560> invented<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.130> new<00:01:31.340> part<00:01:31.670> of

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
that concept we invented a new part of

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.730 
that concept we invented a new part of
