00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.590
 3 I again Karina and today I will show how 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.189
 make mom kuklin hair firmware my 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.150
 case loose hair and thread floss 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:29.970
 Well as you can see I am a bit already pierced 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:37.350
 hair your pubic from crafts then 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:40.140
 Steru so you know what girls 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.320
 bad firmware so i will have 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.610
 extra work poke new ones 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:53.330
 hole in the head is not so much about popleva 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:57.150
 painstakingly then the firmware itself 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.600
 in general, that it is not hard way to not 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.080
 I know I thought it up myself somewhere 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:27.020
 I heard, I don't remember, but the way is good 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:29.939
 for beginners get down to start any 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.810
 to make sure we tie it up 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.700
 small knot 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.859
 me those she did not say that it came from 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.619
 arm out of your head 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:42.619
 1 we start to tie only a knot 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:08.759
 with 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:16.049
 so it turned out well we have turned out and now 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:25.680
 the most painstaking we stick into our 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:29.190
 the needle here is completely running away and if 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:35.489
 we saw a needle then without fear I wish 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:38.060
 pour see needle and draw out here 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.060
 so we do 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.370
 so here we have a pretty 3 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.210
 ok so we know the length of mine 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:03.890
 and will and then so we leave 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.890
 length with our protein and trim the excess 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.670
 it turned out ready 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.959
 so we see obliged to stake the knot 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.909
 reel on a finger 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.400
 twist and tighten like that profit 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.640
 better it up see it to us nothing 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.189
 happens so we have it there 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.379
 can safely pull and cut already in 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:37.639
 the end 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:41.060
 It turns out here very hard therefore 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:45.590
 long three more words face him again 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.790

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.419
