 Duisburg 44 a goat 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.619
 the clichÃ© of a connection persists 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.279
 the dry times its name 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.280
 Century from Einbeck 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.239
 and took its beginning 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.210
 at least 1600 the year ending and 4 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.190
 the book is playing 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.990
 So it does not have to do with the leading drink a lot the four-legged friends 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.030
 to have 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.000
 what now 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.090
 All of a sudden no one was mentioned at that time was split by language and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.510
 by 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.510

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.210
 and then if he does 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.010
 In the Middle Ages, my luck was not a Hanseatic city and Kurt already to 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.670
 fourteenth century as a beer metropolis 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.690
 every homeowner could earn the right in the end 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.230
 the bond market continued to fade into the background 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.190
 and thus you managed to get to Bergen in every house 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.570
 The same quality we have from the urban side 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.610
 Brew masters were employed and they had to keep one animal in all the houses 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.780
 Braun tries the same tactic 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.090
 they had the quality check and what the citizens are not themselves 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.840
 have drunk that has to be he has bought them and so they have the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.530
 Trade operated 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.970
 the offerers had already at that time exact regulations for the 4 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.310
 so it was only needed in the period from September to March 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.310
 also set the amounts of it 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.110
 the houses in which once the strong beer was brewed place behind the elaborate 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.110
 to recognize designed archways 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:16.419
 For 17 years, Marion has been working as a city guide, whether Pierre Keller or 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:20.839
 Stock soil for hops and malt she knows every angle against Einbeck 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.730
 we have received one to three Beaufort 8 of the 1 they received 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.840
 but a baker we dignify summer not heat the body in the winter 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.870
 Body does not cool down and fever the rain first a fever-reducing agent 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.610
 and that is sure to be pure health and so they were just there 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.629
 People in other cities are proud and happy when they buy a bakery 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.770
 without their guests could also offer Einbecker beer 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:56.209
 f had the reputation of being the best on pages happy and proud so hove stories 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.879
 In good condition the Prius can Bob Dylan so it is also great and the

 Pull brewery of the last crisis 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.669
 she is the largest 4 4 percent in Germany 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:14.629
 it is not the basic materials themselves but their concentration Petersburg 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.029

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:20.869

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.920
 the composition 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.470
 WS was yours at that time also in the position that we over larger 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.989
 To transport distances 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.849

 In 1615, became an antique brewing master of the Bavarian dukes 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.809
 From that time onwards one should be strong beer in Munich itself 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:54.669
 In 1969, the Einbecker with a beer trek to Munich remind of this early 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.759
 Form of industrial espionage even if the Bavarians do not like the hear

 Production of the paper has its origin in Einbeck 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.419
 Einstein Benchpark still works wonderfully well 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.859
