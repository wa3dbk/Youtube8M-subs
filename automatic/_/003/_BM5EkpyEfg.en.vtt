00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 hello today I will show you a classic of 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.760
 card games 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.540
 the ambitious card game like the 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.880
 I take the cards for a moment and then there's one 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.830
 random card from the medium for example this one 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.309
 jet of beautiful spades sure as long as I do 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.950
 like I recommend you never lose to 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:01:00.420
 given the jack of spades I put it more or 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:04.750
 less halfway between a fast team and now 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.400
 enough too and the spades 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.370
 salt 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.050
 fast stage look at it I do another 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.690
 time 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:18.640
 this time it puts jazz in half but let's do it 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:23.310
 given in such a way that as soon as salt 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.310
 He sees ok for force to be 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.330
 look at it again and again 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.659
 but more difficult because I put it 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:38.920
 the jack in the middle will beat the deck with the 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.920
 hand sum and here is our garden 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.540
 look I do it one last fiorot ok 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.869
 you are even more difficult to watch 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.470
 while the jet always on the ground the 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.470
 absolute deck 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.430
 and so 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.009
 a problem
