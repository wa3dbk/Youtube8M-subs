00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.410
 occupy when cutting and inserting 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.930

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.650
 friend that if you have children then they send 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.360
 those over there tell them I do not give you churros if 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.610
 you do not go there because you already see how 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.210
 that children put them in accidents 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.520
 little bit not so good as I told you 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.250

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.360
 well you see one who is on this diet 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.150
 Something small should not be exaggerated 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.760
 Well, there is a little gold left 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.680
 perfect on both sides which is the tone 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.650
 ideal of the churros I put them here to 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.870
 dry immediately 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.410
