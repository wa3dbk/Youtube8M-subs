00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.340
 the rum went out of style we have seen a 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.810
 incredible decay in the roll plants 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.850
 in the last two years 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.220
 and a term in terms of volume of 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.920
 about 40 percent in just from 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.520
 two years because it's so awesome 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.610
 this fall then in the rondos increases 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.119
 of its people almost every year during the 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.040
 last ten years it became fashionable was a 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.689
 I swallow that the Chileans and God gave themselves 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.770
 mind that they could take it as a 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.510
 substitute to pisco besides the people what 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.780
 he saw as a drink a little more refined 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.180
 a little more sophisticated or a little more 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.030
 high class that pisco pisco 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.070
 traditional the most direct explanation 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.590
 it would be the change of law 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.960
 and that people could no longer take and 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.820
 then handle however that has not 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.390
 explained why because in the past 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.790
 years 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.430
 the whiskey is still the mouth growing 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.480
 direct in pisco grew back 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.030
 then not everything has to do with the 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.729
 change of law has to do with the 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.610
 product image the Chileans are 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.680
 looking for a more refined product more 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.170
 special want to be unique want 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.260
 think that they are the only ones taking this 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.870
 my life 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.510
 who are doing something of high class 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.130
 then when they realize that everything 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.060
 the world that all chile was taking 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.120
 Ron not to get dealers 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.910
 and the rum producers worked almost 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.370
 10 years to build an image of this 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.910
 product 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.970
 in 2013 the average price per liter of 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.940
 Rum is at its lowest level since the year 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.720
 2000 then what came out eight thousand 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.540
 Chilean pesos in 2011 and only 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.540
 It costs five thousand 500 pesos or it is a 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.130
 down and they have no price then it remains 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.410
 basing there is no longer a chosen one or a reason 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.180
 of fighting for this market because I do not 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.700
 worth a lot 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.140
 then many marques many brands 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.870
 more first they have gone 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.240
 those who know what is left 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.540
 they are fighting for a space a tomato 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.370
 of market much smaller and not so 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.250
 profitable 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.379
 however, we can predict that 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.019
 while there is a fall so strong in the 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:24.110
 price consumers seem to 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.510
 again take the drink can not deny 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.650
 that there is an incredible discount in the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.650
 own concept price 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.300
 but nevertheless 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.600
 it is impressive 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.130
 the power that the consumer has 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.860
 to change a market 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.860
 they were only two years
