00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello everyone, you have an int and you know 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.160
 I got a little bit of my question 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.460
 about sites ks go type stand you 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.710
 very unsuccessful auras and somehow so edic 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.900
 open on such sites is much 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.600
 better many youtubera so do them 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.640
 good things come out and honestly tell me 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.310
 I got it right now and I want to 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.650
 talk about websites vks goal and so I 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.990
 decided to record this podcast let's start with 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.000
 the fact that I brought such a small theory 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.640
 which let's say it describes the percentage 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.680
 loss of weapons in cases and on sites 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.950
 Well, of course I gave approximate interest 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.840
 and the like kazhu honest in google and 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.450
 ok information about the percentage 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.180
 I did not find any fallouts of course there 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.239
 all sorts of pictures like percent drop 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.379
 Knife type 0 there is one from millions of guys 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.739
 at least you imagine that one 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.230
 millionth means falling out here just 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.090
 imagine no it means that just 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.609
 it will never happen 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.219
 and oh yeah not even me there but painting 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.710
 even write sometimes it is therefore nonsense on 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.369
 in fact now move on to the sites all 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.110
 no gun 8590 yes i know you often 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.140
 see on everyones scroll so hot 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.720
 fall good weapons but guys now i'm 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.360
 I will explain one important joke any such 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.310
 sites and being made and getting benefits then 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.240
 I mean money well, you know what by 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.890
 benefits in stores always 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.659
 means money and he is now 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.120
 look stupidly small fragment and 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.400
 now fold approximately 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.790
 bitch hangman put people money and 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.460
 how come you know that no matter how 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.620
 the authors of the stores were in the red a 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.480
 Such a stupid can not be otherwise 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.610
 firstly it would be impossible to keep 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.760
 the site and the meaning of it was not that is 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.750
 it turns out this is a real-time chain 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.240
 she's tight there date there are 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.030
 people who really lay but often 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.320
 there with the participation of whom nothing falls 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.060
 of course such a situation is possible that 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.850
 for example you put 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.010
 I do not know there 300 rubles you nothing 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.580
 falls out will be a contract mind of the price of weapons 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.250
 time to you then 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.740
 I donâ€™t know anyone there and there 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.149
 alloy for example but you understand what 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.940
 it does not pay off but you still 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.850
 float out such well, no luck and you 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.230
 peace of mind go away but the guys are not here 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.920
 your bad luck is to blame 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.020
 but the fact that you read the car by itself 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.730
 the usual scheme you put money to improve 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.800
 consolation prize and you basically everyone 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.620
 happy this happens even knows was 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.230
 was their fairs and let's say that I communicate with 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.390
 people who do a little bit of this 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.520
 activities and I basically have a female 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.120
 there may be approximate percentages I and 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.610
 asked 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.959
 dudes and in general it is possible that you 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.620
 will drink the same Conte 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.810
 well maybe the truth is there very, very 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.870
 small percentage and knowing that 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.330
 the kazga community is shorter 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.989
 in short for unity sounds, I think that the fall 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.600
 knife here is the percentage you want to reach 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.300
 smelly that percentage you're just lucky 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.630
 nafig go where you want you bomb but 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.550
 everywhere 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.290
 by the way there is such a thing in terms of advertising 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.550
 this is called visualization maybe i 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.150
 didn't call him correctly because i 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.040
 let's say so let's say flawed in 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.480
 marketing plan so if something and 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.430
 understand this please correct 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.200
 me in the comments I will be extremely you 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.519
 grateful yes and think and viewers who 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.540
 watching this video will be grateful 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.950
 to you that you have a little bit of me 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.260
 corrected and what I'm under this 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.510
 I mean for example take YouTube 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.730
 telling that dude good content 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.650
 On containers vks goal can be all 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.510
 did you make a video well here or 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.970
 Of course we will throw money now 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.540
 make a video about our website knife you what 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.000
 it falls out 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.700
 they sit skype discussing their what 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.849
 will fall out and 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.530
 get a video so all that falls out 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.810
 principle rollers that make the site 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.209
 if of course you see the link in the description 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.420
 to this site it means that 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.790
 it's all thought up here even talk not about 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.829
 what do we get 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.450
 yutuber who in this video just 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.260
 an actor without an oscar if you really 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.980
 they believed he was an actor without an oscar 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.359
 absolutely no kidding 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.359
 you can tell me you are nothing 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.340
 You know, but guys, and I'm sorry or 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.470
 Fortunately, I think the part where you because 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.250
 will enhance it in this information I am in 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.139
 this let's say a boiler and i know that 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.090
 happens well though believe me 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.340
 yes or no that's your business I'm 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.100
 Basically, I say that everyone already knew 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.250
 We were not sure of course yes cases 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.650
 there are cheaper but the guys just have nothing 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.360
 done you understand that just 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.190
 cheaper no one will do me that 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.900
 if you fell out there just outside then i 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.560
 I congratulate but longer and please 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.720
 don't risk 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.580
 honestly say no longer risk because 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.259
 that you are very lucky painting water 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.630
 in these percentages the possibility is more but 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.039
 you get the idea well, and that was it better 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.479
 open case in cs go straight 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.889
 if I appeal guys don't get fooled 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.889
 cheating and good luck for now
