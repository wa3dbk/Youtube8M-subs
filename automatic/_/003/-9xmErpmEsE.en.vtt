you if running around and spring from

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.860 
you if running around and spring from
the<00:04:34.430> hip<00:04:34.580> was<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:34.820> most<00:04:35.000> effective<00:04:35.270> tactic

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
the hip was the most effective tactic

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.110 
the hip was the most effective tactic
and<00:04:36.110> that's<00:04:37.010> what<00:04:37.190> it<00:04:37.310> took<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.460> win<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.940> would

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
and that's what it took to win I would

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.350 
and that's what it took to win I would
do<00:04:38.420> it<00:04:38.600> but<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:39.680> isn't<00:04:40.180> running<00:04:41.180> around

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
do it but it isn't running around

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.790 
do it but it isn't running around
shooting<00:04:41.750> from<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.110> hip<00:04:42.230> is<00:04:42.380> a<00:04:42.410> very<00:04:42.650> bad

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
shooting from the hip is a very bad

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.540 
shooting from the hip is a very bad
tactic<00:04:43.450> especially<00:04:44.450> on<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:45.410> map<00:04:45.770> specially<00:04:46.490> on

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
like a game that's designed like a big

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.250 
like a game that's designed like a big
old<00:04:48.440> chessboard<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:50.330> gun<00:04:50.510> play<00:04:50.780> on<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.110> game

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
is a major part of it but positioning

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
get a better feel of the game because

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.760 
get a better feel of the game because
it's<00:05:50.270> really<00:05:50.960> hit<00:05:51.110> and<00:05:51.260> miss<00:05:51.380> right<00:05:51.590> now<00:05:51.710> the

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
it's really hit and miss right now the

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.950 
it's really hit and miss right now the
server's<00:05:52.310> on<00:05:52.490> both<00:05:52.730> platforms<00:05:53.060> are<00:05:53.570> really

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
server's on both platforms are really

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.610 
server's on both platforms are really
really<00:05:54.200> shoddy<00:05:54.410> and<00:05:56.080> there's<00:05:57.080> not<00:05:57.260> too<00:05:57.320> much

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
really shoddy and there's not too much
