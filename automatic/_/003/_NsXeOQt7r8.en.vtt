again<00:03:28.700> stuffing<00:03:29.239> begin<00:03:29.540> with<00:03:29.720> fourteen

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
again stuffing begin with fourteen

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.170 
again stuffing begin with fourteen
pounds<00:03:30.410> of<00:03:30.680> charcoal<00:03:31.100> so<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.730> guess<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.060> would

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
pounds of charcoal so I guess that would

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.240 
pounds of charcoal so I guess that would
be<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.480> net<00:03:33.320> down<00:03:33.620> on<00:03:33.830> takes<00:03:34.070> a<00:03:34.130> lot<00:03:34.220> of

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
be the net down on takes a lot of

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.490 
be the net down on takes a lot of
truffle<00:03:34.610> yeah<00:03:35.300> fourteen<00:03:35.959> pounds<00:03:36.110> is<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.380> lot

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
truffle yeah fourteen pounds is a lot

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
truffle yeah fourteen pounds is a lot
