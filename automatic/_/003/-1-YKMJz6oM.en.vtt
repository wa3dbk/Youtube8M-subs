00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.330
 Company galley is easy here today 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.210
 installing a parking sensor 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:19.529
 A Nissan Sentra gives the hint here to 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.600
 You here is for you, to mark the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.199
 placements to make figuration in the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.930
 car is geison is always picking up like 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.949
 reference is the flashlight 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.350
 Okay, alpine okay from the trunk here is always 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.200
 a central reference for you to start 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.280
 here so you do not get crooked 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.559
 Ideally, it should be 40 centimeters 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.809
 against attack on another 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.110
 so you picking up the central point here 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.899
 with cno reference 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.289
 Luggage compartment there at the stop 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.710
 You're going to measure 20 centimeters, right? 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.609
 side and 20 cents on the other 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.460
 so soon to be 40 centimeters and a grandson 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.070
 from one point to another and then you will pick up 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.520
 plus 40 centimeters from one point to another 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.799
 think with reference to people caught is 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.290
 here in the flashlight 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.460
 It is because here the curve starts to get 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.920
 next to the side to catch it is 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.790
 obstacle on the side 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.979
 so I always think with reference is 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.030
 Good, you were a car that already has 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.549
 a dot 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.740
 a car already with the exit sensor 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.380
 original parking you look 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.460
 internet search for now to see the 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.490
 points where they go to have a reference 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.970
 so it is not correct and also something else 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.110
 observe behind behind the side of the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.479
 bumper 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.970
 if you do not have some iron obstacle db 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.270
 about some little that will prevent 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.439
 After you make a hole, you're right. 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:07.060
 sensor does not keep picking up from behind 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:09.280
 today they are very small and thick 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:15.850
 that you have to go free there by 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:19.870
 behind is to always use the next body saw 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:23.049
 already in the kit to not get loose or 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.880
 tight to always use the saw cup 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:30.970
 correct and another tip that is also the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:37.660
 The display always shows you pick up a car 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:39.970
 that has a built -in 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.340
 people always lay on up upon the 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.290
 rearview mirror that I'm going to show on the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.450
 car interior here for example 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.910
 in which case she is already putting in 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:54.250
 check the rear view mirror and 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.400
 wiring over the liner giving 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.470
 because some cases 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.829
 people have put him here on top of the 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.590
 panel when the car is exposed to the 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.859
 The sun usually melts, right? 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.620
 the display does not each support calorie 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:15.880
 then a car that has subways the plane 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.880
 you comment with the customer the owner of the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.819
 car is a suggestion that we give 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.819
 we 'll go now too 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.370
 and put them and I'll show you 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.670
 That's not a tip we give ourselves. 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.010
 for you it marked correct cap there that the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.080
 paulo that is not crooked that does not stay 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.720
 the distance difference from one to the other 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:46.170
 always be the right measure and now 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.170
 has expired 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.250
 always careful with the drill is not to 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.910
 scratch the paint and here as I said 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.860
 O always have looked behind nor 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.740
 thickness has nothing to do with 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.200
 obstacle of fernando fox 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.340
 here we also took the flashlight 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.260
 here behind the carpet you are 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:17.720
 identifying the wires will connect a 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:19.520
 negative and the can of rap rapper module 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.840
 feeding is just that it is not 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:26.690
 negative and you get the wire is positive 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.900
 that when you turn on the 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:35.270
 to power the mode for when 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:37.310
 select the module and activate the display 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.170
 Parking Sensor 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:50.090
 So that's it, the guys are already giving 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:53.990
 tip for you to get away neither 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.660
 Look at the obstacles behind the side 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.840
 to shock is a soul of iron some 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:04.270
 something to not be taking and any 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.270
 one of the questions for people and beauty 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.300
 You are there at four points in the 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.479
 ga ga 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.659
 the difference right one for 40cm 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.340
 other well positioned 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:23.289
 Now move the cars in there. 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.389
 vehicle and have link here galera 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.409
 Another tip I forgot to mention is you 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:33.430
 always observe that behind the sensors 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:35.379
 they do not even feel the word anp up is the 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.830
 point of reference that should be 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:41.169
 up and the ppe is running out for up or 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.259
 is with a white ball or until the 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:47.289
 itself written here in leaves them in a 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:52.289
 up position do not let the turn 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.289
 is for me not to get wrong painting 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.129
 here is finalized finalizing here already 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:03.940
 made the connection here on the wire is current 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:09.690
 aquino comes the reverse signal and the wire 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:18.340
 black negative here we put in solar 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:20.529
 is accusing from a distance is not it 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.750
 Galley gives a shit for you there PayPass 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:24.310

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.350
 parking 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.890
