00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.360
 only a few weeks after 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.310
 floods that we talked about a lot 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.960
 the state is mobilizing against 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.760
 natural disasters a council 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.950
 interdepartmental will endorse a plan 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.059
 intended to organize a little better the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.340
 prevention of the ten disasters 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.410
 natural side compensations that 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.630
 works relatively well but the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.640
 prevention the excessively it's counted by 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.470
 example 2000 common a risk in 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.359
 flood matter for the rest 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.090
 it is just as worrying the finding 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:32.040
 with jose white lapierre clamart 1961 la 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.230
 earth opens up and devours a neighborhood 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.690
 whole 21 dead here there was a garden 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.000
 and caravans then one day without warning 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.489
 the earth has swallowed the body of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.570
 stéphane 20 years old has never been found 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.809
 under the undulations that surround 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.579
 paris there is the empty kilometers of 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.309
 galleries dug to build the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.980
 capital a maze difficult to list 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.660
 difficult to fill and which threatens to 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.629
 collapse under our feet 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.880
 France is a true Gruyère 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.390
 cement tiles plaster bricks during 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.760
 centuries 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.030
 we dug empty the belly of the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.210
 earth but also caution on the side of the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.000
 sky with another major risk our 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.159
 mountains moves the most famous one of 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.799
 Dichilian in Isere and its scenario 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.810
 disaster 30 million cubic meters 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.430

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.740
 grenoble closely monitor also the

 hut in the valley of the tinée au 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.030
 nice top 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.070
 our solid mountain crumbles remember 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.880
 you the room in beaumont four dead 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.799
 early January 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.619
 yet in this unstable region 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.619
 known geologists the highway grenoble 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.200
 sisteron is planned here is the map of the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.750
 France moving north which passes the TGV 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.220
 the shoreline nibbled by the sea 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.850
 cliffs of the Loire the valley of the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.500
 dordogne and of course our mountains 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.280
 as for the earthquakes it remains 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.890
 unpredictable 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.920
 the last to date lambesc near 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.090
 d'Aix-en-Provence was in 1909 to 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.799
 to fight against these risks 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.220
 the government launches an extensive program 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.660
 of main prevention measure oblige 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.440
 municipalities to declare their areas to 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.330
 risk 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.670
 700 files were opened there in 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.900
 would require two thousand extensions of 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.900
 surveillance and warning networks 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.150
 finally more difficult to consider the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.390
 moving the most people 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.390
 exposed
