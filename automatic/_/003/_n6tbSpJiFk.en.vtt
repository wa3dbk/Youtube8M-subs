00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello i introduce yannick this is 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.599
 yesterday in the previous move we have 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.440
 seen the vanishing point 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:17.070
 non-leaking lines and lines 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.410
 evasive to draw a room or 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.560
 a piece today let's see some 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.650
 elements to draw in perspective 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.380
 this room a bed a window a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.330
 door etc 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.669
 I propose to start with a 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.520
 door 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:40.230
 we will draw to start the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:48.989
 lines not leaking from this not on the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:52.770
 wall right like this so these are so 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.660
 verticals so as to have this 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.680
 outlook aspect 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:06.710
 so we will use a line here 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:12.830
 elusive that will allow us to have 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.830
 this aspect of 3d doors 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.690
 ditto on the left wall with a 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.030
 window 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:31.840
 we used leaking lines 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:35.330
 feet leave this center like this 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.320
 your window will be made to 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:45.170
 from lines not running away here for 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.330
 realize the vertical the vertical the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.200
 closer and the vertical the more 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:55.760
 far away the middle of the window and 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:00.280
 finally the realization of the prospect to 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.280
 using these lines is paying 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:09.020
 add a third element binds him to 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:15.050
 using non- leaking lines we 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:20.870
 let's draw in the shape of 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:23.980
 liteon here the foot of the bed to give a 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.280
 outlook aspect 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:35.330
 so we're going to draw lines here 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:39.920
 leaking one above the bed and one to 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:44.750
 the base of the bed what will allow us 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.390
 here to realize the head of the nest that well 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:53.810
 sure from an optical point of view is more 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:56.870
 small as the foot of the bed we go 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.310
 can now draw the bed in 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:06.739
 perspective from the present here 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:10.150
 middle and middle and that's our bed 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.700
 to realize in perspective 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.230
 I just have high and some 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.230
 lines to make it better 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.650
 so how to draw a room 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.900
 in perspective 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.490
 I thank you for your attention 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.490
 see you again and see you soon
