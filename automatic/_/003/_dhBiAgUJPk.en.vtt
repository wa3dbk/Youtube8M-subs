 "Unlikely Scenes". 

00:00:03.153 --> 00:00:06.749
 Everyone plays, I'm going to take some scenes from the red box

 that the people of today's audience decided to invent. 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.788
 There are people who invent at home, bring it, write it down in the notebook. 

00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:15.267
 They have to do the first thing that comes in the head and I ring the bell 

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:20.918
 [bell] to finish each scene, and the first one today is:

00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:09.040
 [Bell] 

00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:20.007
 Oh, the queen of the ... 

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:23.625
 The ... The queen of ... 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.544
 A gift...

 How many doors does this bus have? 

00:04:34.247 --> 00:04:37.680

 College is important! 

00:06:30.966 --> 00:06:34.933

00:06:35.303 --> 00:06:37.830
 Now I wanted to talk. 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.455
 This guy who is here studied seven years of composition and regency is here.
