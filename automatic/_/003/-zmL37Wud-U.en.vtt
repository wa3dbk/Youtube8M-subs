check the base does not have the name on
the<00:03:38.980> base<00:03:40.890> this<00:03:41.890> here<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.220> they<00:03:42.310> require<00:03:42.490> legal

mumbo-jumbo<00:03:43.630> for<00:03:44.410> Europe<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.450> think<00:03:46.450> that's

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
mumbo-jumbo for Europe I think that's

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.940 
mumbo-jumbo for Europe I think that's
the<00:03:46.780> toy<00:03:46.959> number<00:03:47.430> made<00:03:48.430> in<00:03:48.610> Thailand<00:03:49.950> pretty

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
the toy number made in Thailand pretty

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:58.140 
the toy number made in Thailand pretty
cool<00:03:52.380> it's<00:03:53.380> got<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:56.160> speed<00:03:57.160> wheels<00:03:57.459> it's<00:03:58.000> got

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
cool it's got the speed wheels it's got

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.820 
cool it's got the speed wheels it's got
a<00:03:58.180> nickel-plated<00:03:58.480> axle<00:03:59.080> seal<00:03:59.230> on<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.470> spins

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
a nickel-plated axle seal on it spins

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.460 
a nickel-plated axle seal on it spins
just<00:04:00.490> goes<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:00.880> nickel<00:04:01.420> plated<00:04:01.750> axle<00:04:02.320> and

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
just goes to the nickel plated axle and

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.170 
just goes to the nickel plated axle and
I<00:04:03.100> think<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.610> wheels<00:04:04.150> themselves<00:04:04.360> are<00:04:04.870> acetal

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
I think the wheels themselves are acetal

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.830 
I think the wheels themselves are acetal
special<00:04:07.180> kind<00:04:07.360> of<00:04:07.450> plastic<00:04:07.990> but<00:04:08.940> anyways<00:04:09.940> you

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
special kind of plastic but anyways you

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.630 
special kind of plastic but anyways you
looking<00:04:11.110> for<00:04:11.260> this<00:04:11.350> Carly<00:04:11.860> coming<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.310> your

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
looking for this Carly coming to your

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.500 
looking for this Carly coming to your
stores<00:04:13.000> soon<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:14.550> think<00:04:15.550> I<00:04:15.790> figured<00:04:16.000> out<00:04:16.239> why

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
stores soon I think I figured out why

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.449 
stores soon I think I figured out why
they<00:04:16.720> changed<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.230> front<00:04:17.770> spoiler<00:04:18.070> there

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
they changed the front spoiler there

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.820 
they changed the front spoiler there
it's<00:04:19.239> so<00:04:19.419> that<00:04:19.660> this<00:04:19.930> way<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.290> car<00:04:20.500> would<00:04:20.680> go

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
it's so that this way the car would go

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.940 
it's so that this way the car would go
through<00:04:21.100> a<00:04:21.130> loop<00:04:22.050> because<00:04:23.050> if<00:04:23.200> that<00:04:23.440> front

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
through a loop because if that front

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.760 
through a loop because if that front
spoiler<00:04:24.220> was<00:04:24.550> pointed<00:04:25.270> down<00:04:25.510> like<00:04:25.720> that<00:04:25.960> it

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
spoiler was pointed down like that it

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.650 
spoiler was pointed down like that it
would<00:04:26.950> not<00:04:27.130> make<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.340> through<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.729> loop<00:04:27.910> would

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
would not make it through the loop would

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.840 
would not make it through the loop would
be<00:04:28.890> dodging<00:04:29.890> the<00:04:30.010> track<00:04:30.310> as<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.610> would<00:04:30.820> be

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
be dodging the track as it would be

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
be dodging the track as it would be
going<00:04:31.090> around

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
going around

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.570 
going around
all<00:04:32.110> right<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.680> would<00:04:32.919> now<00:04:33.070> put<00:04:33.130> it<00:04:33.370> through<00:04:33.460> a

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
all right I would now put it through a

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.860 
all right I would now put it through a
booster<00:04:34.000> because<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.330> got<00:04:34.450> those<00:04:34.630> wheels

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
booster because you got those wheels

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.440 
booster because you got those wheels
sticking<00:04:35.350> out<00:04:35.500> not<00:04:36.220> unless<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:36.669> want<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:37.030> buy

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
sticking out not unless you want to buy

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.920 
sticking out not unless you want to buy
another<00:04:37.480> car<00:04:38.080> over<00:04:38.380> and<00:04:39.250> over<00:04:39.520> but<00:04:42.690> I'm<00:04:43.690> sure

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
another car over and over but I'm sure
