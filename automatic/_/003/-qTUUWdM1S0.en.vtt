two<00:01:09.200> of<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.890> previous<00:01:10.490> collection<00:01:11.119> of<00:01:11.329> Katy

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719

Perry's prison collection in the

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:15.760 
Perry's prison collection in the
clearance<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.049> I<00:01:15.109> believe<00:01:15.350> it<00:01:15.469> was<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.590> couple

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
clearance and I believe it was a couple

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.190 
clearance and I believe it was a couple
of<00:01:16.009> jewelry<00:01:16.340> pieces<00:01:16.579> too<00:01:16.999> but<00:01:17.299> these<00:01:17.899> are<00:01:18.049> the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
of jewelry pieces too but these are the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.590 
of jewelry pieces too but these are the
two<00:01:18.350> items<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.859> caught<00:01:19.070> my<00:01:19.219> eye<00:01:19.429> I<00:01:19.789> decided

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
two items that caught my eye I decided

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.279 
two items that caught my eye I decided
to<00:01:20.749> pick<00:01:20.990> up<00:01:21.170> these<00:01:21.770> two<00:01:22.189> little<00:01:22.789> tiny<00:01:23.259> well<00:01:24.259> I

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
to pick up these two little tiny well I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.889 
to pick up these two little tiny well I
would<00:01:24.770> say<00:01:24.950> they're<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.159> little<00:01:25.369> bigger<00:01:25.869> then<00:01:26.869> a

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
would say they're a little bigger then a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.130 
would say they're a little bigger then a
coin<00:01:27.499> sized<00:01:27.920> bag<00:01:28.460> but<00:01:29.270> they're<00:01:29.509> not<00:01:29.719> big

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
coin sized bag but they're not big

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.169 
coin sized bag but they're not big
enough<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.409> be<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.649> clutch<00:01:31.009> so<00:01:31.310> they're<00:01:31.939> kind<00:01:32.149> of

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
enough to be a clutch so they're kind of

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.300 
enough to be a clutch so they're kind of
like<00:01:32.329> medium<00:01:32.689> sized<00:01:32.929> so<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.740> first<00:01:33.979> one<00:01:34.159> is<00:01:34.280> a

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
like medium sized so the first one is a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.899 
like medium sized so the first one is a
holographic<00:01:35.119> silver<00:01:35.899> and<00:01:36.369> it<00:01:37.369> has<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.549> zipper

I<00:02:29.890> thought<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.880> these<00:02:31.030> purses<00:02:31.510> would<00:02:31.660> be

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
I thought that these purses would be

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.520 
I thought that these purses would be
perfect<00:02:32.470> for<00:02:32.890> like<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.100> concert<00:02:33.430> bag<00:02:34.140> when<00:02:35.140> I

perfect for like a concert bag when I

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.160 
perfect for like a concert bag when I
don't<00:02:36.160> want<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.370> take<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.550> huge<00:02:36.940> bulky<00:02:37.510> handbag

don't want to take a huge bulky handbag

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.260 
don't want to take a huge bulky handbag

merch money and maybe some food money

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.770 
merch money and maybe some food money
depending<00:02:51.070> on<00:02:51.190> how<00:02:51.370> long<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.850> event<00:02:52.150> actually

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
depending on how long the event actually

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.110 
depending on how long the event actually
is<00:02:53.020> I<00:02:53.320> actually<00:02:53.860> think<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.550> these<00:02:54.670> purses

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
is I actually think that these purses

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.120 
is I actually think that these purses
are<00:02:55.300> like<00:02:55.510> perfect<00:02:56.080> for<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.800> think

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
are like perfect for that and I think

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
are like perfect for that and I think
that<00:02:57.340> might<00:02:57.519> have<00:02:57.640> been<00:02:57.790> what<00:02:58.000> they<00:02:58.120> were

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
that might have been what they were

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.940 
that might have been what they were
intended<00:02:58.810> for<00:02:59.190> because<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.430> this<00:03:00.820> little

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
intended for because of this little

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.500 
intended for because of this little
bracelet<00:03:02.950> thing<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:04.060> don't<00:03:04.269> actually

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
bracelet thing so you don't actually

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.660 
bracelet thing so you don't actually
have<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.959> hold<00:03:05.410> on<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.160> just<00:03:06.190> put<00:03:06.550> on

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
have to hold on to it you just put on

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.670 
have to hold on to it you just put on
the<00:03:06.760> bracelet<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:07.390> just<00:03:08.200> have<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.410> good<00:03:08.620> time

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
the bracelet and just have a good time

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.360 
the bracelet and just have a good time
so<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.310> thought<00:03:09.670> these<00:03:09.820> were<00:03:10.030> perfect<00:03:10.480> for<00:03:10.540> that

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
so I thought these were perfect for that

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.070 
so I thought these were perfect for that
so<00:03:12.370> these<00:03:12.730> are<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.060> actual<00:03:13.450> items<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.050> I

but I was trying to be a little bit
careful<00:04:15.129> with<00:04:15.609> how<00:04:16.150> many<00:04:16.209> of<00:04:16.419> them<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:16.780> picked

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
careful with how many of them I picked

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.779 
careful with how many of them I picked
up<00:04:17.259> because<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:17.829> do<00:04:17.889> have<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.130> tendency<00:04:18.400> of

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
up because I do have a tendency of

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.990 
up because I do have a tendency of
getting<00:04:19.380> carried<00:04:20.380> away<00:04:20.739> by<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.130> cuteness<00:04:21.729> and

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
getting carried away by the cuteness and

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.860 
getting carried away by the cuteness and
then<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.389> never<00:04:22.780> actually<00:04:23.139> use<00:04:24.100> it<00:04:24.340> so<00:04:24.669> I<00:04:25.000> said

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
then I never actually use it so I said

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.430 
then I never actually use it so I said
which<00:04:26.789> cases<00:04:27.789> what<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.150> get<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.690> most<00:04:28.810> use<00:04:29.229> out

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
which cases what I get the most use out

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.529 
which cases what I get the most use out
of<00:04:29.500> that<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.340> know<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:30.970> will<00:04:31.060> purposely

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
of that I know that I will purposely

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.860 
of that I know that I will purposely
pull<00:04:31.930> my<00:04:32.080> phone<00:04:32.320> so<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:33.130> narrowed<00:04:34.030> it<00:04:34.120> down<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.840> I

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
pull my phone so I narrowed it down to I

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.710 
pull my phone so I narrowed it down to I
believe<00:04:35.729> there<00:04:36.729> might<00:04:36.940> be<00:04:37.259> six<00:04:38.310> cases<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.720> one

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
believe there might be six cases and one

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.420 
believe there might be six cases and one
of<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.870> cases<00:04:41.229> I<00:04:41.349> did<00:04:41.530> not<00:04:41.680> get<00:04:41.860> in<00:04:42.039> stores

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
of the cases I did not get in stores

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.129 
of the cases I did not get in stores
because<00:04:42.820> it<00:04:42.940> was<00:04:43.090> sold<00:04:43.419> out<00:04:43.599> and<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:44.020> was<00:04:44.080> the

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
because it was sold out and that was the

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.560 
because it was sold out and that was the
macaron<00:04:44.800> case<00:04:45.160> which<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:45.699> am<00:04:45.970> planning<00:04:46.449> on

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
macaron case which I am planning on

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.680 
macaron case which I am planning on
going<00:04:46.750> back<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.349> grabbing<00:04:48.300> but<00:04:49.300> I<00:04:49.360> just

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
going back and grabbing but I just

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.270 
going back and grabbing but I just
narrowed<00:04:50.110> it<00:04:50.229> down<00:04:50.259> to<00:04:50.440> these<00:04:50.830> three<00:04:50.860> cases

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
narrowed it down to these three cases

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.879 
narrowed it down to these three cases
for<00:04:51.520> now<00:04:51.880> so<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:52.900> first<00:04:53.110> one<00:04:53.289> I<00:04:53.320> got<00:04:53.410> was<00:04:53.620> the
