attachment for this weapon I've gone for

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.469 
attachment for this weapon I've gone for
the<00:01:10.470> foregrip<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> extended<00:01:11.939> magazine

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the foregrip and the extended magazine

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.929 
the foregrip and the extended magazine
the<00:01:12.810> honey<00:01:12.990> badger<00:01:13.170> has<00:01:13.710> very<00:01:13.920> unique<00:01:13.979> recoil

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the honey badger has very unique recoil

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.730 
the honey badger has very unique recoil
it<00:01:15.119> has<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> lot<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.720> recoil<00:01:16.259> bits<00:01:16.560> not

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it has a lot of recoil bits not

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.950 
it has a lot of recoil bits not
necessarily<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.700> upwards<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
necessarily just upwards or just to the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.080 
necessarily just upwards or just to the
side<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.710> actually<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.130> all<00:01:20.369> direction<00:01:20.939> so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
side it's actually in all direction so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.060 
side it's actually in all direction so
it's<00:01:21.210> actually<00:01:21.330> downwards<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.229> well<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.740> mean

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
it's actually downwards as well I mean

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.649 
it's actually downwards as well I mean
you<00:01:23.159> sometimes<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:23.790> kick<00:01:24.060> up<00:01:24.240> quite<00:01:24.299> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
you sometimes it will kick up quite a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.780 
you sometimes it will kick up quite a
bit<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.470> its<00:01:25.590> own<00:01:25.770> Rico<00:01:26.250> will<00:01:26.430> bring<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.759> back

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
bit then its own Rico will bring it back

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.910 
bit then its own Rico will bring it back
down<00:01:27.299> again<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.840> sometimes<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.470> really

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
down again so sometimes it can be really

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.440 
down again so sometimes it can be really
really<00:01:29.009> accurate<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.670> sometimes<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.329> can

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
really accurate and sometimes it can

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330 
really accurate and sometimes it can
just<00:01:30.630> go<00:01:30.840> crazy<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.470> shoot<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:31.950> over<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
just go crazy and shoot all over the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.429 
just go crazy and shoot all over the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.020 
place so foregrip helps to control that
a<00:01:34.470> little<00:01:34.680> bit<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.009> make<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.579> little<00:01:35.820> bit

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
a little bit and make it a little bit

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.780 
a little bit and make it a little bit
easier<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.689> stay<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.259> target<00:01:37.790> extended

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.590 
then essentially free up a perk slot
meaning<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.579> don't<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.240> use<00:01:45.360> anything

builds<00:02:47.570> around<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:47.930> sort<00:02:48.050> of<00:02:48.170> stealthy

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
builds around this sort of stealthy

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.710 
builds around this sort of stealthy
weapon<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.550> we've<00:02:49.670> got<00:02:49.910> here<00:02:50.150> means<00:02:50.600> that

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
weapon that we've got here means that

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.180 
weapon that we've got here means that
the<00:02:50.780> enemies<00:02:51.020> won't<00:02:51.290> know<00:02:51.590> when<00:02:51.890> one<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.100> their

so<00:02:53.840> again<00:02:54.140> just<00:02:54.350> makes<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.680> little<00:02:54.890> bit
