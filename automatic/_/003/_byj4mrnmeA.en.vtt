00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.770
 how are you welcome to stories 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.770
 of mystery dot 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.250
 well here in what is the blog the 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.800
 videoblog of the green path of the page 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.250
 of stories of puntocom mystery we have already 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.599
 talked about these craters in Siberia and 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.169
 good that they have also appeared in 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.500
 multiple places in the world and has 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:40.480
 appeared there is a possible explanation 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.219
 scientific from the point of view of 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.070
 several studies and several universities 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:48.780
 who have been working on this and 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.180
 compare or relate this topic to the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.180
 Bermuda triangle or some 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.000
 events obviously does not explain all 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.950
 they themselves recognize that a lot is missing 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.850
 for studying but the data is interesting 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.850
 that they have given one of these points 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.530
 is that these craters of the crater of 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.040
 jamal and what is in the peninsula of 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.850
 taimir were studied and this 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.630
 summer since they arise to 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.000
 starting from all the control bailing gender 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.600
 and testimonies that they heard a great 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.479
 explosion but at the same time then 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.189
 the perfection of the circle the depth 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.380
 of it left many doubts in a 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.780
 principle it was said that in the tests there 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.530
 you see now I had not noticed anything strange 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.789
 then there were theories since 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.549
 would present stress had the 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.970
 hole or that had been some kind of 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.149
 proof of some kind of missile and good 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.849
 Well, the furrowing a lot of theories 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.490
 It seems to me that the case of Siberia is very 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.619
 particular is not the same as what happens 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.270
 example in Florida what happens in 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.789
 Guatemala 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.039
 they talk about that yes they would have a 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.920
 compared to what happens between 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:13.799
 two modes so the following is assured 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:17.150
 that the accumulation of gases deep inside 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:21.950
 of gas land especially methane 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.690
 catches carbohydrates that under the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.170
 permafrost or the permanent ice of 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.130
 permafrost known in some way 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.780
 expels and generates as a kind of 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.840
 small atomic bomb so mention it 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.180
 them not without getting there let's say make a 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.150
 atomic but if it is the function of 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.790
 enclose and compress to such a degree the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.280
 atoms that the explosion is incredible and 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.739
 is apparently that perfect according to 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.470
 them but not only that but they go more 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:56.360
 there they talk about the atmosphere 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.579
 upwards it generates an instability a 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.140
 change so drastic at that time in the 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.450
 moment of the explosion 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.400
 it's easy if someone goes around 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.760
 Sailing on a plane if you are going to an airplane 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.940
 small or large stabilize such 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.690
 degree that can fall that can almost almost 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.520
 disappear at the same time there is a 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.310
 study related to what 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.040
 possibly happen and in some cases 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.860
 of 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.219
 and disappearances of ships and aircraft in 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.159
 the triangle of Bermuda speak to them 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:33.140
 that within your study if not 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.500
 they detected changes of magnetism not 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.290
 they detected no other rarity outside of 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.409
 that the atmosphere without the atmosphere let's say 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.599
 changed for instants at the same time 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:48.920
 in the explosion the shock wave is 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:51.590
 quite strong and although it may sound 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.969
 strange to themselves analyze that no 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.889
 there is magnetic change a change of 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:57.319
 radiation not find any other type 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.389
 Animal anomaly does not have stern fashions 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.859
 it has been reported again and again that there 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:06.260
 change so much magnetic there is some 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:09.290
 type of reactivity and have studied 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.389
 many with those who do not agree 100% 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.490
 with what he or these scientists are 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:19.070
 talking about what if 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:23.030
 well out there collect ekaitz a canticle 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:27.390
 engineer chief of the mission they had 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.270
 within this project spoke of the 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.480
 need to continue studying because no 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.540
 they have closed they have not finished understanding 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.510
 very well it is only for now a theory 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.330
 a theory that explains not only 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.810
 the holes in Siberia there is no 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.870
 probably some others but possible 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.300
 explanation for some phenomena the 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.480
 triangle of 9 but good you what 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.750
 they seem to him it sounds logical for a 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.910
 side it seems to me that environmental change 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.880
 sudden of not in some kind of bubble 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.460
 as they already mentioned bubble created 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.920
 by these gases the mind can change 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.190
 until happy that a boat disappears 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.840
 that disappears without signals an airplane what 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.550
 I do as an open question and 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.110
 we hope that later we have more 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.180
 answers as they want to have some 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.040
 Bermuda remains a mystery because 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.910
 the anomalies that they have found and are 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.430
 extraordinary 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.560
 so much so that today continues 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.860
 disappearing year to year small 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.780
 small craft small planes and is 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.380
 one of the most interesting places 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.300
 and mysterious that there are on the planet yet 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.740
 and that they have searched for different 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.170
 explanations plan disappearances 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.990
 continue so well see you in the 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.120
 next video and I invite you to visit 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.460
 the site stories of puntocom mystery 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.180
 which is optimized for videos like this 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.400
 that out there if they turn around they can 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.350
 watch the videos live watch the videos 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.740
 like this one that is deferred that is 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.840
 recorded not so good very good day and 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.050
 see you in the next video up 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.050
 soon
