00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
Open I played was 86 my highest

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.910 
Open I played was 86 my highest
Australian<00:01:44.520> ladies<00:01:44.820> ranking<00:01:45.179> was<00:01:45.299> ten<00:01:45.799> in<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920

juniors<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.429> the<00:01:47.520> 90s<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.509> was<00:01:48.630> about

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
juniors in the 90s I think it was about

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.940 
juniors in the 90s I think it was about
three<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.610> in<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> world<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.179> was<00:01:51.679> 115<00:01:52.679> I

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
three and in the world it was 115 I

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.279
