to flush like a hundred new abilities
over<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> few<00:01:14.700> videos<00:01:14.939> until<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> next<00:01:15.720> dlc

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
over a few videos until the next dlc

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.260 
over a few videos until the next dlc
comes<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.520> my<00:01:17.640> reasoning<00:01:18.090> guys

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
comes out so then it's my reasoning guys

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.570 
comes out so then it's my reasoning guys
I'm<00:01:19.110> gonna<00:01:19.259> be<00:01:19.409> doing<00:01:19.619> these<00:01:19.710> hopefully<00:01:20.220> every

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
I'm gonna be doing these hopefully every

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.039 
I'm gonna be doing these hopefully every
day<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:21.030> that's<00:01:21.210> kind<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.600> push<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:21.960> it's

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
day now that's kind of a push so it's

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
day now that's kind of a push so it's
going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.259> probably<00:01:22.590> every<00:01:22.830> other<00:01:22.860> day<00:01:23.280> but

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
going to be probably every other day but

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.760 
going to be probably every other day but
sometimes<00:01:24.509> every<00:01:24.810> day<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.229> I'm<00:01:25.500> gonna<00:01:25.619> be

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
sometimes every day and I'm gonna be

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.010 
sometimes every day and I'm gonna be
focusing<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:26.670> type<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:26.970> pack<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.450> today<00:01:27.780> it

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
focusing on one type of pack so today it

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.569 
focusing on one type of pack so today it
is<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.200> supreme<00:01:28.710> IAM<00:01:28.950> pack<00:01:29.159> or<00:01:29.280> whatever<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
