00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.350 
velcro down in the recess here for the
ears<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.560> helmet<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.130> it's<00:02:56.820> just<00:02:56.940> simply<00:02:57.150> a

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
ears in the helmet so it's just simply a

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.980 
ears in the helmet so it's just simply a
matter<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.750> running<00:02:59.480> the<00:03:02.330> earpiece<00:03:03.330> down<00:03:03.600> into

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
matter of running the earpiece down into

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.020 
matter of running the earpiece down into
the<00:03:04.110> ear<00:03:04.320> recess<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.130> helmet<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.640> the

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
the ear recess of the helmet and the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.700 
the ear recess of the helmet and the
velcro<00:03:06.240> keeps<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.840> there<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:10.200> wires<00:03:10.440> are

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
velcro keeps it there and the wires are

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.890 
velcro keeps it there and the wires are
run<00:03:10.770> simply<00:03:11.340> run<00:03:11.520> underneath<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.180> lining<00:03:12.660> of

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
run simply run underneath the lining of

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.810 
run simply run underneath the lining of
the<00:03:12.960> helmet<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.500> think<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.920> sound<00:03:14.130> quality<00:03:14.670> is

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
the helmet I think the sound quality is

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.870 
the helmet I think the sound quality is
very<00:03:14.910> good<00:03:15.360> considering<00:03:15.960> it's<00:03:16.640> inside<00:03:17.640> of<00:03:17.790> a

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
very good considering it's inside of a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.340 
very good considering it's inside of a
helmet<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:19.820> with<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.940> road<00:03:21.120> noise<00:03:21.350> can't

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
helmet and with the road noise can't

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.199 
helmet and with the road noise can't
expect<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.800> best<00:03:22.950> quality<00:03:23.430> sound<00:03:23.610> anyway<00:03:24.000> but

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
expect the best quality sound anyway but

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.300 
expect the best quality sound anyway but
I<00:03:24.240> find<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.020> to<00:03:25.050> be<00:03:25.140> very<00:03:25.230> very<00:03:25.530> good<00:03:26.070> and

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
I find it to be very very good and

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.830 
I find it to be very very good and
there's<00:03:27.090> plenty<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.390> volume<00:03:27.740> so<00:03:29.660> road<00:03:30.660> noise

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
there's plenty of volume so road noise

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.560 
there's plenty of volume so road noise
really<00:03:31.170> isn't<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.590> much<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:32.100> factor<00:03:32.580> and

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
really isn't that much of a factor and

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.900 
really isn't that much of a factor and
because<00:03:34.350> these<00:03:34.680> earpieces<00:03:35.130> are<00:03:35.520> nice<00:03:35.670> and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
because these earpieces are nice and

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.170 
because these earpieces are nice and
cushiony<00:03:36.709> there's<00:03:37.709> no<00:03:37.920> problem<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:39.000> don't

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
cushiony there's no problem you don't

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.360 
cushiony there's no problem you don't
even<00:03:39.600> know<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:39.870> they're<00:03:40.230> there<00:03:40.530> except<00:03:41.160> when

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
even know that they're there except when

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.490 
even know that they're there except when
you<00:03:41.490> hear<00:03:41.700> them<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:41.970> course

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
you hear them of course

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.090 
you hear them of course
so<00:03:43.500> anyway<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.810> again<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.990> nearly<00:03:46.530> 4<00:03:46.860> feet<00:03:46.890> of

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
so anyway and again the nearly 4 feet of

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.130 
so anyway and again the nearly 4 feet of
cord<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.670> plenty<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.500> go<00:03:49.500> out<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.920> my<00:03:50.930> plug<00:03:51.930> into

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
cord is plenty to go out to my plug into

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.940 
cord is plenty to go out to my plug into
my<00:03:52.380> iPhone<00:03:52.920> or<00:03:53.190> iPod<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:55.080> as<00:03:55.350> far<00:03:55.530> as<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.800> rest

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
my iPhone or iPod and as far as the rest

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.590 
my iPhone or iPod and as far as the rest
of<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.190> court<00:03:56.459> I<00:03:56.610> just<00:03:56.820> simply<00:03:57.180> if<00:03:57.300> I'm<00:03:57.480> not

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
of the court I just simply if I'm not

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.720 
of the court I just simply if I'm not
using<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.290> just<00:03:58.350> kind<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.130> wrap<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.490> up<00:03:59.580> like

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
using it I just kind of wrap it up like

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.090 
using it I just kind of wrap it up like
this<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.240> can<00:04:00.420> stick<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.780> down<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.230> put<00:04:01.980> it

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
this and I can stick it down and put it

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.360 
this and I can stick it down and put it
underneath<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.520> lining<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.950> might<00:04:05.130> be<00:04:05.280> able

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
underneath the lining you might be able

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.850 
underneath the lining you might be able
to<00:04:05.430> see<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.700> here<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:06.150> just<00:04:07.110> put<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.350> back<00:04:07.500> under

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
to see it here I just put it back under

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.720 
to see it here I just put it back under
here<00:04:08.480> which<00:04:09.480> keeps<00:04:09.990> it<00:04:10.170> out<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.500> way<00:04:10.730> so

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
here which keeps it out of the way so

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.340 
here which keeps it out of the way so
anyway<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.260> worked<00:04:13.260> really<00:04:14.010> really<00:04:14.100> well
