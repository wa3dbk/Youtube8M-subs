off of your limb while you walk now
there<00:01:06.120> are<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.330> few<00:01:06.570> different<00:01:06.870> methods<00:01:06.990> for

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
there are a few different methods for

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.920 
there are a few different methods for
accomplishing<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.270> but<00:01:09.270> most<00:01:09.570> modern

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
accomplishing this but most modern

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.360 
accomplishing this but most modern
methods<00:01:10.440> use<00:01:10.890> what's<00:01:11.400> called<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.909> gel<00:01:12.360> liner<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
methods use what's called a gel liner a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.219 
methods use what's called a gel liner a
gel<00:01:14.370> liner<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> device<00:01:15.210> that's<00:01:15.479> rolled<00:01:15.870> onto

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
prosthesis now there are a couple of

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.320 
prosthesis now there are a couple of
other<00:01:49.080> methods<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.710> suspension<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.150> don't

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
other methods of suspension but I don't

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.359 
other methods of suspension but I don't
want<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.540> make<00:01:51.630> things<00:01:51.869> too<00:01:52.049> complicated<00:01:52.369> so

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
want to make things too complicated so

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.010 
want to make things too complicated so
what<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.549> want<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.450> that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
what I want you to know is that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.780 
what I want you to know is that
suspension<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.740> part<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.189> keeps<00:01:56.610> it

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
suspension is the part that keeps it

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.780 
suspension is the part that keeps it
from<00:01:56.820> falling<00:01:57.180> off

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.540 

next<00:02:00.390> let's<00:02:00.630> cover<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.020> socket<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:02.520> socket

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
next let's cover the socket the socket

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.460 
next let's cover the socket the socket
is<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> part<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.390> your<00:02:03.510> prosthesis<00:02:03.960> that's

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
is the part of your prosthesis that's

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.530 
is the part of your prosthesis that's
very<00:02:04.740> very<00:02:05.010> important<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
very very important because it's the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.370 
very very important because it's the
part<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.870> your<00:02:07.110> residual<00:02:07.650> limb<00:02:07.680> slides<00:02:08.399> into

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
part that your residual limb slides into

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.840 
part that your residual limb slides into
you've<00:02:10.380> got<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.740> remember<00:02:10.979> your<00:02:11.340> residual

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
you've got to remember your residual

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.440 
you've got to remember your residual
limb<00:02:11.910> wasn't<00:02:12.870> built<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.410> bear<00:02:13.830> weight<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
limb wasn't built to bear weight so a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.330 
limb wasn't built to bear weight so a
lot<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.780> your<00:02:15.960> practitioners<00:02:16.680> skill<00:02:17.160> and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
lot of your practitioners skill and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.430 
lot of your practitioners skill and

that applies pressure to your limb in a
way<00:02:22.770> that's<00:02:22.980> both<00:02:23.160> comfortable<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:24.150> highly

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
way that's both comfortable and highly

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.220 
way that's both comfortable and highly
functional<00:02:26.420> now<00:02:27.420> there<00:02:27.600> are<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.840> couple<00:02:28.050> of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
functional now there are a couple of

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.860 
functional now there are a couple of
different<00:02:28.560> types<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.980> sockets<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.870> they

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
different types of sockets and they

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.500 
different types of sockets and they
apply<00:02:31.230> pressure<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.830> different<00:02:31.860> ways<00:02:32.420> but<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
apply pressure in different ways but the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.820 
apply pressure in different ways but the
ultimate<00:02:33.960> thing<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.410> want<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.590> remember

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
ultimate thing that you want to remember

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.860 
ultimate thing that you want to remember
is<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.550> both<00:02:35.760> types<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.270> sockets<00:02:36.720> are

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
is that both types of sockets are

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.780 
is that both types of sockets are
designed<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:38.010> make<00:02:38.220> sure<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.580> you're

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
designed to make sure that you're

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.760

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
with a lot of control next let's talk

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.550 
with a lot of control next let's talk
about<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.430> shank<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.900> want<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.200> think<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
about the shank you want to think of the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.130 
about the shank you want to think of the
shank<00:02:46.830> like<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.280> do<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> shin<00:02:47.820> bone<00:02:48.140> basically

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
shank like you do a shin bone basically

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.540 
shank like you do a shin bone basically
it's<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.470> part<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.800> prosthesis<00:02:50.010> that

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
it's the part of the prosthesis that

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.140 
it's the part of the prosthesis that
connects<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.030> socket<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:52.170> foot<00:02:52.730> now<00:02:53.730> from

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
connects the socket to the foot now from

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.090 
connects the socket to the foot now from
a<00:02:54.240> prosthetic<00:02:54.690> point<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.140> view<00:02:55.350> if<00:02:55.620> we<00:02:55.950> have

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
a prosthetic point of view if we have

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.830 
a prosthetic point of view if we have
enough<00:02:56.310> room<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.640> work<00:02:56.970> with<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.450> area

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
enough room to work with in this area

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.620 
enough room to work with in this area
it's<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.740> very<00:02:58.950> clever<00:02:59.280> place<00:02:59.790> to<00:03:00.300> put<00:03:00.510> in

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
it's a very clever place to put in

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.130 
it's a very clever place to put in
what's<00:03:00.870> called<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.380> special<00:03:02.340> adapter<00:03:03.140> now

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
common type of special adapter is what's

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.759 
common type of special adapter is what's
called<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.430> rotational<00:03:15.090> absorber<00:03:15.810> basically

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
called a rotational absorber basically

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.790 
called a rotational absorber basically
it's<00:03:17.010> an<00:03:17.220> added<00:03:17.580> cushion<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:19.110> absorbs<00:03:19.620> any

are<00:04:16.980> also<00:04:17.160> feet<00:04:17.579> out<00:04:17.700> there<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.060> lot<00:04:18.299> like<00:04:18.480> a

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
are also feet out there a lot like a

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.470 
are also feet out there a lot like a
Cadillac<00:04:19.340> meaning<00:04:20.340> they<00:04:20.880> contain<00:04:21.150> what's

automatically to your changing

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.900 
automatically to your changing
environment<00:04:36.950> and<00:04:37.950> now<00:04:38.160> there's<00:04:38.400> a<00:04:38.490> ton<00:04:38.850> of

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
environment and now there's a ton of

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.580 
environment and now there's a ton of
different<00:04:39.060> types<00:04:39.480> of<00:04:39.630> feet<00:04:39.780> in<00:04:39.960> between<00:04:40.350> those

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
different types of feet in between those

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.430 
different types of feet in between those
as<00:04:40.770> well<00:04:41.330> different<00:04:42.330> feet<00:04:42.600> perform<00:04:43.080> different

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
as well different feet perform different

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.090 
as well different feet perform different
functions<00:04:43.470> just<00:04:44.400> like<00:04:44.580> cars<00:04:44.850> do<00:04:45.169> so<00:04:46.169> using

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
functions just like cars do so using

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.180 
functions just like cars do so using
that<00:04:47.340> same<00:04:47.580> analogy<00:04:48.290> it's<00:04:49.290> very<00:04:49.620> important

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
that same analogy it's very important

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.100 
that same analogy it's very important
that<00:04:50.370> before<00:04:50.790> you<00:04:51.060> begin<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.600> prosthetic

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
that before you begin the prosthetic

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.379 
that before you begin the prosthetic
process<00:04:52.590> while<00:04:53.370> you're<00:04:53.550> shopping<00:04:53.850> around<00:04:54.120> for

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
process while you're shopping around for

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.530 
process while you're shopping around for
your<00:04:54.630> practitioner<00:04:55.020> it's<00:04:55.950> a<00:04:56.100> great<00:04:56.340> idea<00:04:56.550> to

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
your practitioner it's a great idea to

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.270 
your practitioner it's a great idea to
ask<00:04:57.720> your<00:04:58.050> practitioner<00:04:58.440> if<00:04:58.830> they're<00:04:59.100> willing

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
ask your practitioner if they're willing

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.400 
ask your practitioner if they're willing
to<00:04:59.460> let<00:04:59.729> you<00:04:59.880> test-drive<00:05:00.450> different<00:05:01.169> feet

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
to let you test-drive different feet

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.770 
to let you test-drive different feet
just<00:05:02.040> like<00:05:02.220> you<00:05:02.370> would<00:05:02.520> a<00:05:02.550> car<00:05:02.850> you<00:05:03.510> wouldn't

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
just like you would a car you wouldn't

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.969 
just like you would a car you wouldn't
want<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:03.930> purchase<00:05:04.110> a<00:05:04.350> car<00:05:04.530> without<00:05:04.650> test

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
want to purchase a car without test

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.129 
want to purchase a car without test
driving<00:05:05.070> at<00:05:05.400> first<00:05:05.639> I<00:05:05.970> think<00:05:06.510> it's<00:05:06.870> even<00:05:07.110> more

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
driving at first I think it's even more

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.900 
driving at first I think it's even more
important<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:07.950> test<00:05:08.220> drive<00:05:08.400> your<00:05:08.610> foot

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
important that you test drive your foot

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.760 
important that you test drive your foot
first<00:05:09.180> and<00:05:09.450> so<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:09.930> way<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:10.110> make<00:05:10.410> sure<00:05:10.440> that

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
first and so that way you make sure that

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.920 
first and so that way you make sure that
you're<00:05:10.889> getting<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.280> right<00:05:11.460> foot<00:05:11.820> for<00:05:12.720> your

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
you're getting the right foot for your

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.320 
you're getting the right foot for your
needs<00:05:13.229> so<00:05:13.530> make<00:05:14.430> sure<00:05:14.460> that<00:05:14.729> you<00:05:14.850> look<00:05:15.000> around

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
needs so make sure that you look around

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.210 
needs so make sure that you look around
and<00:05:15.540> find<00:05:15.960> a<00:05:16.110> practitioner<00:05:16.620> that's<00:05:16.979> willing

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
and find a practitioner that's willing

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.820 
and find a practitioner that's willing
to<00:05:17.340> allow<00:05:17.669> you<00:05:17.729> to<00:05:17.820> do<00:05:18.030> that<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.830> finally

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
to allow you to do that and finally

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.560 
to allow you to do that and finally
moving<00:05:20.039> on<00:05:20.280> to<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.610> alignment<00:05:21.330> of<00:05:21.450> your

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
moving on to the alignment of your

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.290 
moving on to the alignment of your
prosthesis<00:05:22.140> the<00:05:22.970> alignment<00:05:23.970> isn't

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
prosthesis the alignment isn't

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.840 
prosthesis the alignment isn't
necessarily<00:05:24.810> a<00:05:24.960> physical<00:05:25.410> part<00:05:26.100> of<00:05:26.280> your

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
necessarily a physical part of your

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.630 
necessarily a physical part of your
prosthesis<00:05:27.530> rather<00:05:28.530> it's<00:05:28.830> something<00:05:29.039> that

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
prosthesis rather it's something that

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.630 
prosthesis rather it's something that
you<00:05:29.789> can<00:05:30.030> feel<00:05:30.530> what<00:05:31.530> I<00:05:31.560> mean<00:05:31.830> by<00:05:31.979> that<00:05:32.130> is<00:05:32.400> the

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
you can feel what I mean by that is the

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.790 
you can feel what I mean by that is the
alignment<00:05:33.090> is<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.390> spatial<00:05:33.800> relationship

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
alignment is the spatial relationship

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.600 
alignment is the spatial relationship
between<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.669> socket<00:05:36.210> and<00:05:36.390> the<00:05:36.780> foot<00:05:37.340> now<00:05:38.340> in

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
between the socket and the foot now in

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.400 
between the socket and the foot now in
prosthetics<00:05:38.970> we<00:05:39.600> have<00:05:39.780> different<00:05:40.169> components

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
prosthetics we have different components

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.070 
prosthetics we have different components
that<00:05:41.010> are<00:05:41.460> built<00:05:41.490> into<00:05:42.030> the<00:05:42.300> prosthesis<00:05:42.690> that

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
that are built into the prosthesis that

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.620 
that are built into the prosthesis that
allow<00:05:43.380> us<00:05:43.410> to<00:05:43.680> make<00:05:44.400> certain<00:05:44.669> changes<00:05:45.090> to<00:05:45.539> the

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
allow us to make certain changes to the

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.379 
allow us to make certain changes to the
alignment<00:05:46.010> these<00:05:47.010> Tiny's<00:05:47.610> changes<00:05:48.210> to<00:05:48.300> the

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
alignment these Tiny's changes to the

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.360 
alignment these Tiny's changes to the
alignment<00:05:48.810> translate<00:05:49.350> to<00:05:49.500> huge<00:05:49.770> differences

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
alignment translate to huge differences

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.420 
alignment translate to huge differences
in<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.700> way<00:05:50.850> it<00:05:50.970> feels<00:05:51.270> while<00:05:51.810> you<00:05:51.960> walk<00:05:52.430> for

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
in the way it feels while you walk for

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.810 
in the way it feels while you walk for
example<00:05:53.910> a<00:05:54.000> couple<00:05:54.300> of<00:05:54.389> different<00:05:54.690> ways<00:05:55.820> is

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
example a couple of different ways is

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.760 
example a couple of different ways is
that<00:05:57.060> number<00:05:57.300> one<00:05:57.510> we<00:05:57.750> can<00:05:58.260> change<00:05:58.289> what's

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
that number one we can change what's

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.950 
that number one we can change what's
called<00:05:58.979> the<00:05:59.070> toe-in<00:05:59.340> and<00:05:59.729> toe-out<00:05:59.840> now<00:06:00.840> I've

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
called the toe-in and toe-out now I've

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.659 
called the toe-in and toe-out now I've
loosened<00:06:01.200> up<00:06:01.440> the<00:06:01.500> set<00:06:01.770> screws<00:06:02.039> already<00:06:02.340> but

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
loosened up the set screws already but

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.820 
loosened up the set screws already but
on<00:06:02.760> this<00:06:02.880> prosthesis<00:06:03.270> you<00:06:03.570> can<00:06:03.720> see<00:06:03.930> that<00:06:04.110> you

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
on this prosthesis you can see that you

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.350 
on this prosthesis you can see that you
know<00:06:04.919> the<00:06:05.070> toe-in<00:06:05.280> and<00:06:05.490> toe-out<00:06:05.580> angle<00:06:06.180> can<00:06:06.330> be

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
know the toe-in and toe-out angle can be
