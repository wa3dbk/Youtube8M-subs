 corrugated a container of potatoes I 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.830

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.769
 any one card can be 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.930
 purchased or made by ourselves 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.559
 silicone and rule the first thing we're going to 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.559
 to do is to mark 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.430
 not always in the most expensive gifts 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.440
 are the best things sometimes 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.329
 simple and made with our own 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.370
 hands are more special 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.809
 now the piece of corrugated cardboard the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.809
 we are going to stick to the container 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.020
 let's mark the outline of the lid 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.110
 here I already have on top of the 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.190
 cap cut now let's mark the 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.190
 contour of the lid 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.190
 and we give him two and a half centimeters of 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.190
 long 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.439
 now with a scalpel we are going to open two 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.509
 slots the width of the tape after 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.259
 open the slots we passed a science 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.259
 in this way 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.990
 after passing the tape through the lid 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.990
 proceed to paste the pieces 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.680
 then we took the tape we had 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.510
 around and let's make a bow 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.200
 and you can do the amount that 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.200
 you want 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.440
 now let's glue the tips of the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.300
 Tape of the lid behind the card 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.300
 with a little dot of silicone 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.150

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.580
