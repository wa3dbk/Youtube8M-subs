00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
and what we could expect of them coming

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.400 
and what we could expect of them coming

what the Germans saw gonna have a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.880

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.049 
different look against the US yeah well
we<00:00:32.009> know<00:00:32.160> there's<00:00:32.399> definitely<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> be

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
we know there's definitely going to be

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.729 
we know there's definitely going to be
some<00:00:33.300> changes<00:00:33.329> due<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.930> suspension<00:00:34.410> and

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
some changes due to suspension and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.470 
some changes due to suspension and
injuries<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.550> first<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.180> we<00:00:36.329> know

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
injuries and the first one that we know

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.410 
injuries and the first one that we know
for<00:00:36.719> sure<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.219> Pepe<00:00:38.219> will<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.030> we

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
for sure is that Pepe will be out and we

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.790 
for sure is that Pepe will be out and we
think<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.780> his<00:00:40.079> replacement<00:00:40.559> will<00:00:40.649> most

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
think that his replacement will most

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.830 
think that his replacement will most
likely<00:00:41.010> be<00:00:41.160> Costa<00:00:41.700> that's<00:00:41.940> who<00:00:42.059> came<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.480> form

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
likely be Costa that's who came in form

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.410 
likely be Costa that's who came in form
during<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> match<00:00:43.379> veteran<00:00:43.950> player<00:00:44.190> yes<00:00:44.579> next

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
during the match veteran player yes next

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.319 
during the match veteran player yes next
is<00:00:45.600> al<00:00:45.899> menos<00:00:46.440> seems<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.100> he's<00:00:47.340> injured<00:00:47.730> they

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
is al menos seems like he's injured they

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.510 
is al menos seems like he's injured they
chose<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.840> put<00:00:49.379> an<00:00:49.530> editor<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.250> match

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
chose to put an editor in that match

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.520 
chose to put an editor in that match
we're<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.329> sure<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.719> he<00:00:51.750> had<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> good<00:00:52.289> enough

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
we're not sure that he had a good enough

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.470 
we're not sure that he had a good enough
performance<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.280> keep<00:00:53.489> himself<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> field

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
performance to keep himself on the field

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.689 
performance to keep himself on the field
so<00:00:55.140> there's<00:00:55.320> two<00:00:55.559> different<00:00:55.800> options<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.460> we

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so there's two different options that we

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.610 
so there's two different options that we
think<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.030> possible<00:00:57.270> yeah<00:00:57.840> well<00:00:58.050> EDD<00:00:58.289> air<00:00:58.440> is

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
think are possible yeah well EDD air is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
think are possible yeah well EDD air is
a<00:00:58.649> little<00:00:58.920> more<00:00:59.100> athletic<00:00:59.219> likes<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.059> into

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
a little more athletic likes to get into

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.279 
a little more athletic likes to get into
the<00:01:00.300> channels<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:00.989> there's<00:01:01.140> old

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the channels and then there's old

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.439 
the channels and then there's old
reliable<00:01:01.800> helder<00:01:02.100> postiga<00:01:02.160> he's<00:01:02.969> 32<00:01:03.420> years

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
reliable helder postiga he's 32 years

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.420 
reliable helder postiga he's 32 years
old<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:03.960> he's<00:01:04.080> still<00:01:04.110> performing<00:01:04.830> well<00:01:05.070> for

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
old but he's still performing well for

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.910 
old but he's still performing well for
lazio<00:01:05.820> little<00:01:06.420> more<00:01:06.600> traditional<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.470> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
lazio little more traditional of a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.280 
lazio little more traditional of a
target<00:01:08.220> man<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.729> number<00:01:09.000> 9<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.630> big<00:01:09.990> not

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
target man and number 9 not big not

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.929 
target man and number 9 not big not
going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> overwhelm<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.159> he<00:01:11.430> has<00:01:11.580> gotten

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
going to overwhelm you but he has gotten

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.060 
going to overwhelm you but he has gotten
the<00:01:12.030> job<00:01:12.060> done<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> long<00:01:13.200> time<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.650> think<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the job done for a long time I think the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.950 
the job done for a long time I think the
smart<00:01:14.310> money<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.670> Eddie<00:01:15.030> low<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.570> then<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
smart money is on Eddie low and then the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.690 
smart money is on Eddie low and then the
other<00:01:15.990> outside<00:01:16.530> possibility<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.310> they<00:01:17.490> have

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
other outside possibility is they have

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.580 
other outside possibility is they have
used<00:01:17.970> Ronaldo<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.840> lone<00:01:19.020> forward<00:01:19.470> at

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
used Ronaldo as the lone forward at

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.499 
used Ronaldo as the lone forward at
times<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.640> don't<00:01:20.820> think<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.180> they'll<00:01:21.360> do

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
times but we don't think that they'll do

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.760 
times but we don't think that they'll do
that<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:22.080> something<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.439> keep<00:01:22.650> your

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that but that's something to keep your

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.410 
that but that's something to keep your
Cristiano<00:01:23.460> doesn't<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.330> they

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
Cristiano doesn't like that so they

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.450 
Cristiano doesn't like that so they
probably<00:01:24.689> won't<00:01:25.080> another<00:01:25.770> change<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.369> we

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
probably won't another change that we

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.249 
probably won't another change that we
know<00:01:26.610> will<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.090> take<00:01:27.270> place<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.720> coentrao

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
know will have to take place as coentrao

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.510 
know will have to take place as coentrao
I'll<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> come<00:01:28.860> out<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:29.159> he's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
I'll have to come out because he's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.260 
I'll have to come out because he's
injured<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:30.930> him<00:01:31.110> will<00:01:31.290> come<00:01:31.530> Almeida

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
injured so in for him will come Almeida

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.850 
injured so in for him will come Almeida
right<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:33.810> we're<00:01:34.020> also<00:01:34.229> hearing<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
right and then we're also hearing the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.039 
right and then we're also hearing the
possibility<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.640> rui<00:01:36.060> patricio<00:01:36.299> might<00:01:36.930> be

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
possibility that rui patricio might be

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
the field now what we can see here is

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.460 
the field now what we can see here is
Portugal's<00:02:10.440> 4231<00:02:11.280> or<00:02:11.670> 433<00:02:12.629> depending

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
Portugal's 4231 or 433 depending

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.050 
Portugal's 4231 or 433 depending
on<00:02:13.560> what<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.980> think<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.370> their<00:02:14.490> wingers<00:02:14.820> and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
on what you think of their wingers and

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.520 
on what you think of their wingers and
that's<00:02:15.480> as<00:02:15.540> good<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.720> place<00:02:15.930> as<00:02:15.960> any<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.320> start

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
that's as good a place as any to start

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.070 
that's as good a place as any to start
so<00:02:16.950> let's<00:02:17.070> take<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> look<00:02:17.700> at<00:02:17.970> how<00:02:18.630> we<00:02:18.690> think<00:02:19.020> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
so let's take a look at how we think the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.780 
so let's take a look at how we think the
u.s.<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.350> going<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.650> attack<00:02:19.890> yeah<00:02:20.370> when<00:02:20.700> you

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
u.s. is going to attack yeah when you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.760 
u.s. is going to attack yeah when you
look<00:02:21.030> at<00:02:21.150> their<00:02:21.300> formation<00:02:21.930> lineup<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.590> can

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
look at their formation lineup you can

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.090 
look at their formation lineup you can
see<00:02:23.040> big<00:02:23.400> pockets<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.270> this<00:02:24.630> area<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.920> this

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
see big pockets in this area and in this

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.480 
see big pockets in this area and in this
area<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.870> will<00:02:28.290> be<00:02:28.440> important<00:02:29.130> for<00:02:29.220> our

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
area so it will be important for our

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.840 
area so it will be important for our
midfielders<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.510> our<00:02:31.200> frontrunners<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:32.460> find

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
midfielders and our frontrunners to find

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.510 
midfielders and our frontrunners to find
those<00:02:33.120> little<00:02:33.390> gaps<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:34.410> receive<00:02:35.160> balls

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
those little gaps to now receive balls

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.060 
those little gaps to now receive balls
into<00:02:35.940> those<00:02:36.120> spaces<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:37.320> other<00:02:37.530> part<00:02:37.830> about

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
into those spaces the other part about

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.760 
into those spaces the other part about
those<00:02:38.340> gaps<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.450> neither<00:02:39.720> Ronaldo<00:02:40.560> or

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
those gaps is that neither Ronaldo or

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.970 
those gaps is that neither Ronaldo or
Nani<00:02:41.370> like<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.330> track<00:02:42.720> back<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.410> often<00:02:43.950> so

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
Nani like to track back that often so

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.770 
Nani like to track back that often so
you<00:02:44.640> would<00:02:44.820> think<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.150> we'll<00:02:45.420> be<00:02:45.450> able<00:02:45.630> to

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
you would think that we'll be able to

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.770 
you would think that we'll be able to
find<00:02:46.170> guys<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.280> those<00:02:47.520> space<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:48.510> have

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
find guys in those space and then have

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.710 
find guys in those space and then have
our<00:02:48.810> outside<00:02:49.380> backs<00:02:49.709> join<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.850> create<00:02:51.120> 2v1

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
our outside backs join in to create 2v1

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.750 
our outside backs join in to create 2v1
options<00:02:52.440> against<00:02:52.800> their<00:02:52.890> outside<00:02:53.280> backs<00:02:53.520> and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
options against their outside backs and

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.120 
options against their outside backs and
they're<00:02:54.450> outside<00:02:54.870> backs<00:02:55.110> aren't<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.800> great

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
they're outside backs aren't that great

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.220 
they're outside backs aren't that great
on<00:02:56.370> 101<00:02:56.850> defending<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:57.450> that's<00:02:57.660> an<00:02:57.900> area<00:02:58.110> that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
on 101 defending so that's an area that

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.900 
on 101 defending so that's an area that
we<00:02:58.470> can<00:02:58.680> get<00:02:58.860> at<00:02:59.010> them<00:02:59.220> that's<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.580> way<00:02:59.700> that's

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
we can get at them that's the way that's

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.910 
we can get at them that's the way that's
where<00:03:00.150> Germany<00:03:00.810> got<00:03:00.990> at<00:03:01.200> them<00:03:01.380> as<00:03:01.560> well<00:03:01.740> they

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
where Germany got at them as well they

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.190 
where Germany got at them as well they
constantly<00:03:02.370> overloaded<00:03:03.120> towards<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.840> flanks

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
constantly overloaded towards the flanks

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.110 
constantly overloaded towards the flanks
a<00:03:04.290> lot<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.590> times<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.950> saw<00:03:05.100> more<00:03:05.760> than<00:03:05.790> half

a lot of times you saw more than half

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.510 
a lot of times you saw more than half
the<00:03:06.300> German<00:03:06.630> team<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:07.020> one<00:03:07.290> side<00:03:07.530> long<00:03:08.130> switch

the<00:03:16.290> u.s.<00:03:16.560> i<00:03:16.740> think<00:03:16.920> there's<00:03:17.040> another<00:03:17.280> spot

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
the u.s. i think there's another spot

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.259 
the u.s. i think there's another spot
where<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.300> can<00:03:18.450> be<00:03:18.480> one<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.050> it's<00:03:19.500> right<00:03:19.709> here

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
where it can be one and it's right here

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.810 
where it can be one and it's right here
we<00:03:21.269> saw<00:03:21.450> germany<00:03:22.019> play<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> 460<00:03:23.130> basically<00:03:23.700> they

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
we saw germany play a 460 basically they

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.759 
we saw germany play a 460 basically they
didn't<00:03:24.150> have<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.360> traditional<00:03:25.050> center<00:03:25.350> forward

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
didn't have a traditional center forward

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.890 
didn't have a traditional center forward
Thomas<00:03:26.340> Mueller<00:03:26.519> drifted<00:03:27.150> off<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.660> back

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
Thomas Mueller drifted off that back

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.600 
Thomas Mueller drifted off that back
line<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.410> made<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.739> Portuguese<00:03:29.160> defenders

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
line and made the Portuguese defenders

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.340 
line and made the Portuguese defenders
step<00:03:30.150> out<00:03:30.360> here<00:03:30.420> where<00:03:31.230> they're

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
step out here where they're

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.410 
step out here where they're
uncomfortable<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:32.430> try<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.670> defend<00:03:33.060> him<00:03:33.239> and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
uncomfortable to try to defend him and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.210 
uncomfortable to try to defend him and
the<00:03:33.660> dislocation<00:03:34.470> between<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.950> central

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
the dislocation between the central

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.280 
the dislocation between the central
midfield<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:35.790> central<00:03:36.330> defence<00:03:36.360> provided

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
midfield in central defence provided

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.590 
midfield in central defence provided
plenty<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.860> space<00:03:38.100> for<00:03:38.130> him<00:03:38.459> Aron<00:03:39.030> Johannsson

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
plenty of space for him Aron Johannsson

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.720 
plenty of space for him Aron Johannsson
Clint<00:03:39.930> Dempsey<00:03:40.410> probably<00:03:41.010> Chris<00:03:41.550> Wondolowski

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
Clint Dempsey probably Chris Wondolowski

Clint Dempsey probably Chris Wondolowski
as<00:03:42.239> well<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.570> think<00:03:42.930> anyway<00:03:43.320> are<00:03:43.620> going<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.860> have

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
as well I think anyway are going to have

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.979 
as well I think anyway are going to have
to<00:03:44.250> start<00:03:44.430> their<00:03:44.670> runs<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:44.970> little<00:03:45.180> deeper<00:03:45.510> not

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
to start their runs a little deeper not

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.710 
to start their runs a little deeper not
let<00:03:46.230> these<00:03:46.380> guys<00:03:46.620> get<00:03:46.860> tight<00:03:47.190> tight<00:03:48.060> make<00:03:48.510> them

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
let these guys get tight tight make them

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.229 
let these guys get tight tight make them
back<00:03:48.989> pedal<00:03:49.380> make<00:03:49.739> them<00:03:49.920> defend<00:03:50.220> space<00:03:50.489> yeah

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
back pedal make them defend space yeah

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.330 
back pedal make them defend space yeah
and<00:03:51.450> along<00:03:51.840> with<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:52.140> if<00:03:52.590> we<00:03:52.950> could<00:03:53.130> find

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
and along with that if we could find

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.970 
and along with that if we could find
players<00:03:53.730> in<00:03:53.940> those<00:03:54.150> pockets<00:03:54.480> off<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.739> you

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
players in those pockets off of that you

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.460 
players in those pockets off of that you
want<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.280> see<00:03:56.489> penetrating<00:03:57.330> runs<00:03:57.600> because

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
want to see penetrating runs because

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.250 
want to see penetrating runs because
none<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.610> four<00:03:59.880> like<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:00.480> now<00:04:00.630> face<00:04:00.989> their

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
none of the four like to now face their

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.770 
none of the four like to now face their
own<00:04:01.290> goal<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.100> get<00:04:02.610> into<00:04:02.820> foot<00:04:03.150> races<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.720> I

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
own goal and get into foot races and I

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.449 
own goal and get into foot races and I
think<00:04:04.110> that<00:04:04.290> if<00:04:04.470> we<00:04:04.650> can<00:04:04.830> catch<00:04:05.070> them<00:04:05.280> in

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
think that if we can catch them in

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.699 
think that if we can catch them in
transition<00:04:06.060> where<00:04:06.480> we<00:04:06.600> can<00:04:06.780> play<00:04:06.989> balls<00:04:07.260> early

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
transition where we can play balls early

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.590 
transition where we can play balls early
find<00:04:08.280> little<00:04:08.580> space<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:09.000> front<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.299> their<00:04:09.420> back

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
find little space in front of their back

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.620 
find little space in front of their back
line<00:04:09.870> then<00:04:10.560> have<00:04:10.860> penetrating<00:04:11.640> runs<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:12.180> can

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
line then have penetrating runs it can

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.210 
line then have penetrating runs it can
be<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.780> way<00:04:13.049> that<00:04:13.080> we<00:04:13.320> can<00:04:13.560> get<00:04:13.709> at<00:04:13.860> their<00:04:14.040> back

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
be a way that we can get at their back

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.130 
be a way that we can get at their back
line<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.730> challenge<00:04:15.239> their<00:04:15.390> defenders<00:04:15.900> yeah

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
line and challenge their defenders yeah

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.990 
line and challenge their defenders yeah
especially<00:04:16.380> with<00:04:16.769> Fabian<00:04:17.280> Johnson<00:04:17.310> on<00:04:17.850> the

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
especially with Fabian Johnson on the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.120 
especially with Fabian Johnson on the
overlap<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:19.049> goal<00:04:19.229> he<00:04:19.380> scored<00:04:19.410> against

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
overlap the goal he scored against

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.159 
overlap the goal he scored against
turkey<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.640> a<00:04:20.669> perfect<00:04:21.239> example<00:04:21.359> I<00:04:21.870> think<00:04:21.900> of

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
turkey is a perfect example I think of

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.200 
turkey is a perfect example I think of
what<00:04:22.349> we're<00:04:22.500> both<00:04:22.650> talking<00:04:22.979> about<00:04:23.340> number

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
what we're both talking about number

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.330 
what we're both talking about number
three<00:04:24.390> though<00:04:24.660> set-pieces<00:04:25.500> classic

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
three though set-pieces classic

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.020 
three though set-pieces classic
Americans

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
Americans

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.970 
Americans
soccer<00:04:27.150> yeah<00:04:27.660> for<00:04:27.960> sure<00:04:27.990> when<00:04:28.440> you<00:04:28.530> look<00:04:28.770> at

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
soccer yeah for sure when you look at

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.610 
soccer yeah for sure when you look at
their<00:04:29.160> overall<00:04:29.730> lineup<00:04:30.000> there's<00:04:30.690> not<00:04:30.930> a<00:04:31.200> big

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
their overall lineup there's not a big

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.760 
their overall lineup there's not a big
amount<00:04:31.920> of<00:04:32.360> athleticism<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.960> big<00:04:34.380> strong

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
amount of athleticism and big strong

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.400 
amount of athleticism and big strong
guys<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:35.910> they<00:04:36.330> gave<00:04:36.570> up<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.900> goal<00:04:37.050> against

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
guys so they gave up a goal against

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.650 
guys so they gave up a goal against
Germany<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.550> think<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.030> knowing<00:04:39.389> that

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
Germany and I think that knowing that

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.570 
Germany and I think that knowing that
the<00:04:39.810> US<00:04:40.080> team<00:04:40.290> is<00:04:40.500> very<00:04:40.710> aggressive<00:04:40.860> on<00:04:41.340> set

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
the US team is very aggressive on set

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.790 
the US team is very aggressive on set
pieces<00:04:41.760> that's<00:04:42.480> an<00:04:42.660> area<00:04:42.840> where<00:04:43.139> if<00:04:43.380> we<00:04:43.560> get

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
pieces that's an area where if we get

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.520 
pieces that's an area where if we get
good<00:04:43.980> service<00:04:44.250> and<00:04:44.639> good<00:04:44.850> get<00:04:45.360> good<00:04:45.600> runs<00:04:45.930> we

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
good service and good get good runs we

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.930 
good service and good get good runs we
should<00:04:46.770> be<00:04:46.919> able<00:04:47.010> to<00:04:47.160> find<00:04:47.340> chances<00:04:47.760> yeah

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
should be able to find chances yeah

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.980 
should be able to find chances yeah
there<00:04:48.120> are<00:04:48.180> plenty<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:48.480> targets<00:04:48.690> now

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
there are plenty of targets now

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.629 
there are plenty of targets now
especially<00:04:49.290> because<00:04:49.530> I<00:04:49.950> think<00:04:50.010> John<00:04:50.340> Brooks

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
especially because I think John Brooks

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.580 
especially because I think John Brooks
is<00:04:50.760> going<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:50.970> start<00:04:51.300> in<00:04:51.450> this<00:04:51.750> one<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.169> expect

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
is going to start in this one I expect

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.200 
is going to start in this one I expect
him<00:04:52.710> to<00:04:52.830> go<00:04:53.040> from<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.639> beginning<00:04:53.790> but

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
him to go from the beginning but

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.270 
him to go from the beginning but
set-pieces<00:04:54.600> our<00:04:54.840> opportunity<00:04:55.590> in<00:04:55.800> danger

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
set-pieces our opportunity in danger
