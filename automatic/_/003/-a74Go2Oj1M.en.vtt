this<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.920> traction<00:00:17.160> pattern<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:17.789> they

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
this is the traction pattern here they

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.730 
this is the traction pattern here they
went<00:00:18.300> with<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> typical<00:00:18.960> wave<00:00:19.109> bone<00:00:19.320> pattern

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
went with a typical wave bone pattern

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.470 
went with a typical wave bone pattern
for<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:19.980> forefoot<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.430> everywhere<00:00:21.300> else

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
for the forefoot and everywhere else

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.730 
for the forefoot and everywhere else
they<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:22.050> these<00:00:22.170> little<00:00:22.350> kind<00:00:22.619> of

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
they just have these little kind of

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740 
they just have these little kind of
rubber<00:00:23.010> nubs<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.580> surprisingly<00:00:24.240> enough<00:00:24.359> this

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
rubber nubs and surprisingly enough this

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.960 
rubber nubs and surprisingly enough this
setup<00:00:24.990> was<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.470> totally<00:00:25.890> awesome<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.400> was

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
setup was just totally awesome I was

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.820 
setup was just totally awesome I was
very<00:00:27.240> skeptical<00:00:27.840> about<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.260> section<00:00:28.680> here

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
very skeptical about this section here

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.830 
very skeptical about this section here
especially<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.699> being<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.150> forefoot<00:00:30.660> it's

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
especially it being on the forefoot it's

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.990 
especially it being on the forefoot it's
pretty<00:00:31.140> much<00:00:31.349> right<00:00:31.590> where<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.980> use<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.550> lot<00:00:32.969> of

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
pretty much right where you use a lot of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.910 
pretty much right where you use a lot of
pressure<00:00:33.300> points<00:00:33.750> when<00:00:34.290> you're<00:00:34.410> making<00:00:34.559> cuts

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
pressure points when you're making cuts

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.350 
pressure points when you're making cuts
and<00:00:35.130> movements<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.940> didn't<00:00:36.120> affect

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
and movements but it didn't affect

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.780 
and movements but it didn't affect
anything<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.870> negative<00:00:37.230> way<00:00:37.380> whatsoever

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
anything in a negative way whatsoever

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.220 
anything in a negative way whatsoever
that<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.120> court<00:00:39.390> really<00:00:39.570> had<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.960> pretty

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
that the court really had to be pretty

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.110 
that the court really had to be pretty
dirty<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:41.340> dusts<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.730> things<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.059> that

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
dirty with dusts and things like that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.459 
dirty with dusts and things like that
for<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.629> need<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.870> white<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.290> if<00:00:43.350> you're

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
for you to need to white so if you're

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.869 
for you to need to white so if you're
playing<00:00:43.649> indoors<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
playing indoors it's going to be a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.850 
playing indoors it's going to be a
really<00:00:45.270> great<00:00:45.420> solid<00:00:45.870> option<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.620> even

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
really great solid option and then even

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.369 
really great solid option and then even
outdoors<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.789> particular<00:00:48.300> court<00:00:48.690> these

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
outdoors on this particular court these

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.080 
outdoors on this particular court these
things<00:00:49.590> actually<00:00:49.770> stuck<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> floor<00:00:50.399> just

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
things actually stuck to the floor just

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.330 
things actually stuck to the floor just
as<00:00:51.270> good<00:00:51.420> which<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.780> thought<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.170> great<00:00:52.350> again

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
as good which I thought was great again

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.860 
as good which I thought was great again
not<00:00:53.640> something<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.090> was<00:00:54.210> expecting<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.750> was

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
not something that I was expecting I was

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.540 
not something that I was expecting I was
expecting<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> pretty<00:00:55.559> lackluster<00:00:55.860> attraction

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
expecting a pretty lackluster attraction

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.099 
expecting a pretty lackluster attraction
with<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.820> section<00:00:57.120> here<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.719> everything

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
with this section here but everything

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.360 
with this section here but everything
just<00:00:58.140> worked<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.559> well<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.920> don't<00:00:59.190> know<00:00:59.280> if

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
just worked really well I don't know if

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.459 
just worked really well I don't know if
it<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.579> mostly<00:00:59.940> because<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.629> or<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.350> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
it was mostly because of this or if it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.260 
it was mostly because of this or if it
was<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.620> combination<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.430> didn't<00:01:02.969> really<00:01:03.120> want

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
was a combination I didn't really want

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.670 
was a combination I didn't really want
to<00:01:03.329> question<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.930> was<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.260> happy<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.530> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
to question it I was just happy that I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
to question it I was just happy that I
got<00:01:04.860> really<00:01:05.100> great<00:01:05.250> traction<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:06.090> thing<00:01:06.270> I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
got really great traction one thing I

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.060 
got really great traction one thing I
will<00:01:06.570> say<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.619> plan<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.920> wear

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
will say is that if you do plan to wear

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.969 
will say is that if you do plan to wear
these<00:01:08.220> outdoors<00:01:08.700> primarily<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:10.530> rubber<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
these outdoors primarily the rubber is a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.890 
these outdoors primarily the rubber is a
little<00:01:11.250> bit<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> soft<00:01:11.850> side<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.390> you

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
little bit on the soft side so you

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.270 
little bit on the soft side so you
probably<00:01:13.110> will<00:01:13.439> burn<00:01:13.650> through<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.070> pretty

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
probably will burn through that pretty

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.190 
probably will burn through that pretty
quickly<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.000> you're<00:01:15.180> an<00:01:15.450> outdoor<00:01:15.689> hooper

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
quickly but if you're an outdoor hooper

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.600 
quickly but if you're an outdoor hooper
no<00:01:16.320> matter<00:01:16.500> what<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.070> don't<00:01:17.400> have

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
no matter what like you just don't have

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.090 
no matter what like you just don't have
you<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.060> indoor<00:01:18.479> access<00:01:18.830> it's<00:01:19.830> just

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
you know indoor access it's just

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.350 
you know indoor access it's just
something<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.369> you're<00:01:20.610> probably<00:01:21.000> already

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
something that you're probably already

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.210 
something that you're probably already
used<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.780> dealing<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
used to dealing with so if this is a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.980 
used to dealing with so if this is a
shoe<00:01:23.430> for<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.270> you're<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.659> least<00:01:24.780> going

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
shoe for you then you're at least going

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.600 
shoe for you then you're at least going
to<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:25.170> solid<00:01:25.500> traction<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.189> time<00:01:26.369> being

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
to get solid traction for the time being

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.890 
to get solid traction for the time being
all<00:01:26.729> right<00:01:26.909> guys<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.479> full<00:01:27.720> length

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
all right guys so we have full length

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
you can still feel it it's still great

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.160 
you can still feel it it's still great
it's<00:01:53.159> not<00:01:53.460> quite<00:01:53.759> as<00:01:53.909> awesome<00:01:54.149> as<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.840> runners

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
it's not quite as awesome as the runners

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.109 
it's not quite as awesome as the runners
if<00:01:55.320> you've<00:01:55.439> ever<00:01:55.619> experienced<00:01:56.189> boost<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.759> one

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
if you've ever experienced boost in one

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.940 
if you've ever experienced boost in one
of<00:01:57.210> their<00:01:57.299> running<00:01:57.600> shoes<00:01:57.649> but<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
of their running shoes but for a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.709 
of their running shoes but for a
basketball<00:01:59.460> shoe<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> think<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.509> good

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
basketball shoe I think that it's a good

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.810 
basketball shoe I think that it's a good
start<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.920> my<00:02:02.070> opinion<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.460> thought<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> was

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
start and in my opinion I thought it was

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.069 
start and in my opinion I thought it was
pretty<00:02:02.969> comfortable<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.719> keep<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.049> mind

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
pretty comfortable just keep in mind

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.810 
pretty comfortable just keep in mind
that<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.500> boost<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> little<00:02:05.159> bit<00:02:05.280> firm<00:02:05.549> when

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
that the boost is a little bit firm when

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.069 
that the boost is a little bit firm when
you<00:02:05.909> first<00:02:06.090> put<00:02:06.299> them<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.600> you're<00:02:06.930> going<00:02:07.020> to

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
you first put them on you're going to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.300 
you first put them on you're going to
need<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.409> just<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.649> little<00:02:07.740> bit<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.009> break-in

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
need it just a little bit of break-in

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.040 
need it just a little bit of break-in
time<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.729> kind<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.300> know<00:02:09.390> activate<00:02:09.929> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
time just kind of you know activate it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.080 
time just kind of you know activate it
the<00:02:10.080> more<00:02:10.319> pressure<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.370> push<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.879> this

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the more pressure that you push on this

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.160 
the more pressure that you push on this
stuff<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.480> more<00:02:12.629> it's<00:02:12.720> going<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.930> kind<00:02:13.020> of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
stuff the more it's going to kind of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.490

it in future models now their materials

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.120 
it in future models now their materials
are<00:02:21.660> going<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> vary<00:02:22.140> depending<00:02:22.410> on<00:02:22.920> the

look just like this it's durable in a
sense<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.350> not<00:02:37.620> going<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.070> rip<00:02:38.400> or<00:02:38.580> tear

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
sense that it's not going to rip or tear

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.330 
sense that it's not going to rip or tear
but<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.930> color<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.740> see<00:02:40.770> on<00:02:41.100> there

but this color that you see on there

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.640 
but this color that you see on there
will<00:02:41.880> scrape<00:02:42.210> off<00:02:42.420> very<00:02:42.870> easily<00:02:43.110> I've<00:02:43.440> seen

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
will scrape off very easily I've seen

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.930 
will scrape off very easily I've seen
plenty<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.010> pairs<00:02:44.280> where<00:02:44.490> they<00:02:44.610> have<00:02:44.730> just

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
plenty of pairs where they have just

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.060 
plenty of pairs where they have just
