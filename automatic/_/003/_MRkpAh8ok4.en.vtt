00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
stadium but honestly I was going to be a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.130 
stadium but honestly I was going to be a
very<00:00:29.310> very<00:00:29.460> difficult<00:00:29.670> task<00:00:30.210> few<00:00:30.539> teams<00:00:30.810> have

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
very very difficult task few teams have

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.560 
very very difficult task few teams have
had<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.590> lot<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:31.980> success<00:00:32.399> against<00:00:33.000> Marcus<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
had a lot of success against Marcus and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.959 
had a lot of success against Marcus and
I<00:00:33.630> think<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:33.930> Florida<00:00:34.260> State<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.969> their

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
I think for Florida State I their

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.280 
I think for Florida State I their
biggest<00:00:36.300> issue<00:00:36.510> throughout<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> course<00:00:37.200> of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
biggest issue throughout the course of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.389 
biggest issue throughout the course of
the<00:00:37.440> season<00:00:37.649> when<00:00:37.920> they're<00:00:38.010> playing<00:00:38.100> against

time in Pittsburgh lose contain you lose
the<00:00:48.989> game<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.160> honest<00:00:50.550> true

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the game and that is a honest true

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
the game and that is a honest true
statement<00:00:51.270> especially<00:00:51.329> when<00:00:51.660> you're<00:00:51.750> playing

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
statement especially when you're playing

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.450 
statement especially when you're playing
against<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.170> mobile<00:00:52.469> quarterback<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.039> Marcus

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
against a mobile quarterback like Marcus

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.459 
against a mobile quarterback like Marcus
he's<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:53.820> athletic<00:00:54.000> he's<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.629> fast<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
he's so athletic he's so fast but if you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.200 
he's so athletic he's so fast but if you
can<00:00:55.620> force<00:00:55.920> him<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.250> make<00:00:56.430> intermediate

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
can force him to make intermediate

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.540 
can force him to make intermediate
throws<00:00:57.449> inside<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.260> pocket<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.770> think<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.430> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
throws inside the pocket I think that is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.799 
throws inside the pocket I think that is
something<00:00:59.699> he's<00:00:59.969> not<00:01:00.120> comfortable<00:01:00.420> doing

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
something he's not comfortable doing

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.260 
something he's not comfortable doing
that's<00:01:01.379> where<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.949> success

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
that's where you can have success

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.969 
that's where you can have success
against<00:01:03.270> Marcus<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.780> totally<00:01:04.500> agree<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.799> mean

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
against Marcus I totally agree I mean

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.140 
against Marcus I totally agree I mean
this<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.369> big<00:01:05.519> problem<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> notes

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
this is the big problem for the notes

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.910 
this is the big problem for the notes
right<00:01:06.299> they<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> game<00:01:07.049> plan<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.770> he's

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
right they can have a game plan but he's

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.039
