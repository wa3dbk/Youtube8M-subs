00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.030 
controls in mind and the PSP's d-pad and
buttons<00:02:59.880> aren't<00:03:00.510> quite<00:03:01.170> perfect<00:03:01.200> for<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.860> game

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040

like<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:03.090> controls<00:03:03.510> certainly<00:03:03.959> aren't

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
like this the controls certainly aren't

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.900 
like this the controls certainly aren't
so<00:03:04.440> bad<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.950> won't<00:03:05.430> be<00:03:05.520> able<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.730> get

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
so bad that you won't be able to get

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.160
