00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 how about then then here is the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.940
 scale of my major for the saxophone 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.360
 remember that for the accordion and that 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.750
 digita here 123 here up 1 and 2 here 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.869
 down below is what the accordion is for 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.230
 greater sun then you have to remember that 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.420
 difference by transposition and I the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.980
 notes are has sustained me sustained sun 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.470
 the yes do sharp king held 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.040
 We follow me here and that's a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.040
 full turn 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.340
 We started my work without the key 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.340
 eighth 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.630
 two 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.390
 such 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.950
 Oh 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.950
 was 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.270
 there is 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.879
 that's a turn then if it 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:10.000
 they manage to do two because if we start 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.000
 there in that me on my flight from below 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.710
 and we will continue the same sustained sun 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:21.760
 sustained the if held that is nothing 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.310
 plus the octave key 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.710
 re sustained to take it eighth and 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.630
 these two decades 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.240
 and in the end we will add is already here 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.250
 side with this finger and that's going to be my 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.050
 again then effectively it 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.260
 can play two laps here goes the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.260
 first 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.100
 Let's see 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.500
 the second 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.100
 but 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.000
 for 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 it is the first doubt that had the second 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.170
 is the largest natural funk scale that 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.959
 you can also touch the laps if 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.990
 we remember alpha for the accordion comes 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.090
 being the flat 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.640
 and on the saxophone, you can type here 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.470
 these three above this first and in 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.190
 the scale that has only one flat 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.280
 which is better if flat that is typed 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.140
 also like the sustained then this 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.970
 is the scale the first round the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.709
 our are fa are all natural 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:46.030
 then yes b flat fa the b flat 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.030
 re my fa 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.569
 t 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.430
 there we have the first round 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.030
 again the first one we stop when 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.030
 we arrived here 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.840
 and the second round is equal to G A 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.780
 Flat red is nothing more than the key to 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.570
 eighth is already here I already have 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.160
 seen in the previous scale are these 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.950
 two and 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.660
 from above and to get to the natural nothing 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.660
 more we add this then 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.819
 and 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.460
 3 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.000
 ah 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.000
 ifa 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.950
 then there was also in two 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.769
 turns and effectively fingering in 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.840
 the alto saxophone is only thirty 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.170
 and thirty-three notes in most of 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.720
 the jumps there saxophone is that model 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.150
 professional like this that after 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.070
 funk good in most of the 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.220
 saxophones you're going to have from B flat here 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.220
 down 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.940
 on saxophone that's how we have a 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.940
 F sharp that is this 2nd key 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.750
 and those are would be in this case 33 but 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.870
 for most saxophones since 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:55.930
 the beginner level and intermediate level 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.930
 would be these 32 so that the sources 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:32.620
 ah 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.210
 32 in total and that's how the 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.160
 alto saxophone other than those you can play 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.230
 notes that are not 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:44.230
 within normal fingering the notes 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.230
 which are very high and after the fa 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.740
 two 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:53.280
 with sharp 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.280
 Sun 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:13.150
 but if the standard fingering is 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.150
 those 32 notes in total luck with that
