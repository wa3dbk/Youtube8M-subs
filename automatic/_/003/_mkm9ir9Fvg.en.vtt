finding to be the defining factor for
things<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.260> people<00:00:43.590> should<00:00:43.770> actually<00:00:43.890> be

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
things that people should actually be

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.920 
things that people should actually be
looking<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.730> camera<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.809> think

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
looking for in a camera I really think

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
looking for in a camera I really think
it<00:00:46.079> comes<00:00:46.260> down<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> needs<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
it comes down to the needs of the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.430 
it comes down to the needs of the
production<00:00:47.480> you<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.989> said<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.230> work

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
production you know like I said I work

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.619 
production you know like I said I work
on<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:50.129> kinds<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.550> different<00:00:50.850> cameras<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.510> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
on all kinds of different cameras and it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.209 
on all kinds of different cameras and it
really<00:00:51.840> comes<00:00:52.079> down<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.800> kind<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.010> needs

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
really comes down to what kind of needs

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.770 
really comes down to what kind of needs
do<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.610> then<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.270> need<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.449> smaller

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
do we have then do we need a smaller

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.860 
do we have then do we need a smaller
crew<00:00:55.050> do<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.350> need<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.530> smaller<00:00:56.090> footprint<00:00:57.090> it's

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
crew do we need a smaller footprint it's

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.619 
crew do we need a smaller footprint it's
all<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.350> about<00:00:58.500> finding<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> right<00:00:58.949> tool<00:00:59.280> I

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
all just about finding the right tool I

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.270 
all just about finding the right tool I
found<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:01.800> really

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
found that you know to get really

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.359 
found that you know to get really
entrenched<00:01:02.699> into<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.210> camera<00:01:03.539> system<00:01:04.369> really

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
entrenched into one camera system really

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.859 
entrenched into one camera system really
isn't<00:01:05.580> really<00:01:05.970> isn't<00:01:06.119> helpful<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
isn't really isn't helpful as a

high power output one of the things I'm
a<00:02:42.890> big<00:02:43.100> fan<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.820> is<00:02:44.060> soft<00:02:44.810> lighting<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:46.340> a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
a big fan of is is soft lighting so a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.820 
a big fan of is is soft lighting so a
lot<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:46.910> times<00:02:47.150> I'll<00:02:47.360> be<00:02:47.450> using<00:02:47.630> either<00:02:48.440> like<00:02:48.800> a

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
lot of times I'll be using either like a

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.640 
lot of times I'll be using either like a
book<00:02:49.550> light<00:02:49.790> or<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.690> Kino<00:02:51.050> flow<00:02:51.320> through<00:02:51.620> a

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
book light or like a Kino flow through a

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.430 
book light or like a Kino flow through a
four<00:02:51.950> by<00:02:52.070> four<00:02:52.100> grid<00:02:53.080> which<00:02:54.080> can<00:02:54.230> get<00:02:54.350> me

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
four by four grid which can get me

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.590 
four by four grid which can get me
really<00:02:54.860> nice<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.280> soft<00:02:55.489> light<00:02:55.730> but<00:02:56.269> it

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
really nice and soft light but it

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.870 
really nice and soft light but it
requires<00:02:57.350> a<00:02:57.470> large<00:02:57.709> footprint<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.670> also

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
requires a large footprint and also

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.180 
requires a large footprint and also
takes<00:02:59.060> additional<00:02:59.269> time<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.930> set<00:03:00.110> up<00:03:00.190> where

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
takes additional time to set up where

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.190 
takes additional time to set up where
the<00:03:01.340> where<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.670> fill<00:03:01.880> light<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.300> just<00:03:02.540> one<00:03:02.840> two

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
the where the fill light is just one two

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.430 
the where the fill light is just one two
by<00:03:03.320> two<00:03:03.380> panel<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.550> they<00:03:05.030> can<00:03:05.209> be<00:03:05.480> stacked

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
by two panel and they can be stacked

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.920 
by two panel and they can be stacked
into<00:03:06.739> a<00:03:06.860> four<00:03:07.220> by<00:03:07.340> four<00:03:07.370> grid<00:03:08.030> if<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.269> want<00:03:08.480> you

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
into a four by four grid if you want you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.259 
into a four by four grid if you want you
use<00:03:09.140> just<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.530> light<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:10.489> it's<00:03:10.910> only<00:03:11.120> an

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
use just that light and it's only an

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.210 
use just that light and it's only an
inch<00:03:11.420> thick<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:12.530> I'm<00:03:12.560> really<00:03:12.800> excited<00:03:12.920> to

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
inch thick so I'm really excited to

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.530 
inch thick so I'm really excited to
start<00:03:13.340> playing<00:03:13.670> with<00:03:13.760> that<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.150> seeing<00:03:14.420> how

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
start playing with that and seeing how

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.930 
start playing with that and seeing how
that<00:03:14.620> compares<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.130> other<00:03:16.250> soft<00:03:16.700> lighting

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
that compares to the other soft lighting

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.300 
that compares to the other soft lighting
setups<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:17.900> Hughes<00:03:18.230> because<00:03:18.860> if<00:03:18.950> i<00:03:19.040> can<00:03:19.190> use

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
setups I Hughes because if i can use

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.759 
setups I Hughes because if i can use
something<00:03:19.850> that's<00:03:19.880> small<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.300> easy<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.769> light

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
something that's small and easy to light

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.440 
something that's small and easy to light
something<00:03:22.010> with<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.489> will<00:03:22.880> decrease<00:03:23.269> the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
something with that will decrease the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.759 
something with that will decrease the
time<00:03:23.570> it<00:03:23.750> takes<00:03:23.840> me<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.080> light<00:03:24.350> something<00:03:24.590> on

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
time it takes me to light something on

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:25.270 
time it takes me to light something on
set

obviously lighting changes and you have
more<00:03:31.079> sensitivity<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.950> can<00:03:32.129> do<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.280> lot<00:03:32.519> more

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549

know when I'm lighting especially
exteriors<00:03:57.470> you<00:03:58.470> know<00:03:58.530> you're<00:03:58.709> you're<00:03:58.920> out

you're out at night it's more about

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.660 
you're out at night it's more about
finding<00:04:01.140> where<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.500> extra<00:04:02.099> light<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.459> coming

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
finding where that extra light is coming

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.280 
finding where that extra light is coming
from<00:04:02.790> because<00:04:03.120> now<00:04:03.299> all<00:04:03.329> of<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.510> sudden<00:04:03.810> you

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
from because now all of a sudden you

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.960 
from because now all of a sudden you
know<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:04.799> lamp<00:04:05.010> like<00:04:05.340> two<00:04:05.579> blocks<00:04:05.760> away

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
know that that lamp like two blocks away

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.000 
know that that lamp like two blocks away
is<00:04:06.329> actually<00:04:07.079> you<00:04:07.349> know<00:04:07.440> giving<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:07.799> some

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
is actually you know giving you some

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.759 
is actually you know giving you some
sort<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:09.000> know<00:04:09.060> return<00:04:09.900> on<00:04:10.049> your<00:04:10.560> subject

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
sort of you know return on your subject

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.440 
sort of you know return on your subject
so<00:04:11.040> it's<00:04:11.129> more<00:04:11.280> about<00:04:11.370> flagging<00:04:11.879> off<00:04:12.150> lights

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
so it's more about flagging off lights

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.930 
so it's more about flagging off lights
and<00:04:12.720> shaping<00:04:13.680> light<00:04:13.950> through<00:04:14.250> removing<00:04:14.670> it

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
and shaping light through removing it

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.319 
and shaping light through removing it
rather<00:04:15.180> than<00:04:15.269> adding<00:04:15.629> it<00:04:16.310> with<00:04:17.310> with<00:04:18.000> large

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
rather than adding it with with large

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.810 
rather than adding it with with large
interiors<00:04:18.989> there<00:04:19.680> there<00:04:20.280> used<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.519> be<00:04:20.609> like<00:04:20.789> a

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
interiors there there used to be like a

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.810 
interiors there there used to be like a
whole<00:04:21.380> redesigning<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.800> lighting<00:04:23.190> are

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
whole redesigning of the lighting are

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.010 
whole redesigning of the lighting are
you<00:04:23.940> finding<00:04:24.210> yourself<00:04:24.300> being<00:04:24.660> able<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:24.900> work

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
you finding yourself being able to work

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.990 
you finding yourself being able to work
with<00:04:25.229> existing<00:04:25.410> lighting<00:04:25.979> setups<00:04:26.400> more<00:04:26.699> with

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
with existing lighting setups more with

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.490 
with existing lighting setups more with
these<00:04:27.180> new<00:04:27.330> cameras<00:04:27.690> are<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:27.900> still<00:04:28.139> having

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
these new cameras are you still having

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.260 
these new cameras are you still having
to<00:04:28.680> go<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.130> do<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:29.250> lot<00:04:29.430> of<00:04:29.460> sculpting<00:04:29.910> yourself

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
to go and do a lot of sculpting yourself

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.080 
to go and do a lot of sculpting yourself
and<00:04:30.840> for<00:04:31.800> me<00:04:31.919> I<00:04:31.949> still<00:04:32.550> do<00:04:32.669> a<00:04:32.729> lot<00:04:32.940> of<00:04:33.120> sculpting

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
and for me I still do a lot of sculpting

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.460 
and for me I still do a lot of sculpting
there<00:04:36.090> seems<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.389> be<00:04:36.449> a<00:04:36.479> big<00:04:36.690> trend<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.320> just

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
there seems to be a big trend and just

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.560 
there seems to be a big trend and just
going<00:04:37.650> with<00:04:37.770> whatever's<00:04:38.250> available

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
going with whatever's available

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.029 
going with whatever's available
sometimes<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.720> works<00:04:39.810> for<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.110> story<00:04:40.349> you

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
sometimes that works for the story you

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.640 
sometimes that works for the story you
know<00:04:41.099> shooting<00:04:41.669> a<00:04:41.729> documentary<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.690> you<00:04:43.590> know

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
know shooting a documentary and you know

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.680 
know shooting a documentary and you know
you<00:04:43.710> don't<00:04:44.250> want<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:44.430> interrupt<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:45.270> subject

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
you don't want to interrupt the subject

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.060 
you don't want to interrupt the subject
because<00:04:45.870> it's<00:04:46.020> more<00:04:46.169> important<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.530> get<00:04:46.949> the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
because it's more important to get the

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.159 
because it's more important to get the
emotion<00:04:47.460> out<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.669> it<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.090> out<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.930> story

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
emotion out of it and out of the story

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.300 
emotion out of it and out of the story
than<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.500> is<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.770> make<00:04:49.889> sure<00:04:49.919> you<00:04:50.160> have<00:04:50.250> a

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
excited about because LEDs draw a lot

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.630
