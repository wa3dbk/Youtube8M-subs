still have the carbon fiber shell but

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.380 
still have the carbon fiber shell but
you<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.410> an<00:00:40.530> outrigger<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> lot

oars to the boat which is a big

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.260 
oars to the boat which is a big
difference<00:00:47.070> from<00:00:47.190> kayaking<00:00:47.700> where<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
difference from kayaking where the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.840 
difference from kayaking where the
paddle<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.660> held<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.960> your<00:00:49.050> hand<00:00:49.460> rowers<00:00:50.460> move

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.119 
paddle is held in your hand rowers move
faster<00:00:51.360> than<00:00:51.390> kayakers<00:00:51.960> because<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.010> have

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
faster than kayakers because we have

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.889 
faster than kayakers because we have
more<00:00:53.340> leverage<00:00:53.579> our<00:00:54.090> oars<00:00:54.360> are<00:00:54.629> quite<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> bit

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
more leverage our oars are quite a bit

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.420 
more leverage our oars are quite a bit
bigger<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.530> further<00:00:55.920> from<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> boat

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
bigger and further from the boat

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.569 
bigger and further from the boat
everyone<00:00:57.210> thinks<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.230> rowing<00:00:58.649> rowing<00:00:59.370> is
