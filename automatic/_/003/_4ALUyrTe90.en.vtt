use amongst other riders Phil you've got
a<00:00:12.719> lot<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:12.960> knowledge<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.440> terms<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.889> frame

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
a lot of knowledge in terms of frame

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.620 
a lot of knowledge in terms of frame
design<00:00:14.429> for<00:00:14.610> people<00:00:14.759> getting<00:00:15.030> into<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.360> sport

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
design for people getting into the sport

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.330 
design for people getting into the sport
you<00:00:15.809> can't<00:00:16.080> see<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.470> difference<00:00:16.590> between<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
you can't see the difference between a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.150 
you can't see the difference between a
500<00:00:17.970> pound<00:00:18.210> or<00:00:18.390> $500<00:00:18.990> carbon<00:00:19.410> frame<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.039> one

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
500 pound or $500 carbon frame and one

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.250 
500 pound or $500 carbon frame and one
of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.310> top-end<00:00:20.670> models<00:00:21.150> what<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.900> design

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
of the top-end models what is the design

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.750 
of the top-end models what is the design
that<00:00:22.289> goes<00:00:22.590> into<00:00:22.890> them<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
that goes into them and what is the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.609 
that goes into them and what is the
difference<00:00:24.150> between<00:00:24.300> those<00:00:24.660> price<00:00:24.960> ranges

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
difference between those price ranges

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.009 
difference between those price ranges
yeah<00:00:26.310> well<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.939> neat<00:00:27.090> thing<00:00:27.269> about<00:00:27.300> carbon<00:00:27.869> is

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
yeah well the neat thing about carbon is

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.019 
yeah well the neat thing about carbon is
it<00:00:28.199> allows<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.800> tailor<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.910> can

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
it allows you to tailor it and you can

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.400 
it allows you to tailor it and you can
use<00:00:30.060> different<00:00:30.210> types<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.990> carbon<00:00:31.320> in

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
use different types of carbon in

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.380 
use different types of carbon in
different<00:00:31.769> areas<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.250> frame<00:00:32.390> so

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
different areas of the frame so

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.690 
different areas of the frame so
materials<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.410> aluminum<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.190> steel<00:00:35.460> are

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
materials like aluminum and steel are

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.520 
materials like aluminum and steel are
much<00:00:35.969> easier<00:00:36.180> actually<00:00:36.899> design<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.350> because

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
much easier actually design with because

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.170 
much easier actually design with because
they're<00:00:37.710> basically<00:00:38.250> continuous<00:00:38.879> there

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
they're basically continuous there

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.790 
they're basically continuous there
they've<00:00:39.780> got<00:00:39.840> continuous<00:00:40.379> properties

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
they've got continuous properties

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.290 
they've got continuous properties
throughout<00:00:41.100> they're<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> same<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.879> twisting

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
throughout they're the same and twisting

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.850 
throughout they're the same and twisting
are<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> same<00:00:42.780> when<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.020> pull<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.230> them<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
are the same when you pull on them the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.100 
are the same when you pull on them the
same<00:00:44.100> when<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.399> push<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.850> them<00:00:44.989> carbon<00:00:45.989> is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
same when you push on them carbon is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.020 
same when you push on them carbon is
different<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.620> each<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.860> those<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.000> have

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
different in each of those and you have

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.790 
different in each of those and you have
different<00:00:48.510> levels<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.809> carbon<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.649> can

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
different levels of carbon so we can

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.590 
different levels of carbon so we can
have<00:00:49.890> stiffer<00:00:50.219> carbon<00:00:50.579> or<00:00:50.730> stronger<00:00:51.239> carbon

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
have stiffer carbon or stronger carbon

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.689 
have stiffer carbon or stronger carbon
the<00:00:52.050> problem<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.980> stiff<00:00:53.309> carbon

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the problem is you can have stiff carbon

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.959 
the problem is you can have stiff carbon
and<00:00:53.879> strong<00:00:54.629> carbon<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.489> allows<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and strong carbon so it allows you to

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.150 
and strong carbon so it allows you to
are<00:00:57.270> forces<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> tailor<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.800> what<00:00:58.949> is

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
are forces you to tailor it for what is

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.549 
are forces you to tailor it for what is
the<00:00:59.489> each<00:00:59.820> area<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.180> frame<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:01.289> instance

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
the each area of the frame for instance

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.619 
the each area of the frame for instance
if<00:01:02.070> you're<00:01:02.219> get<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.579> you're<00:01:02.760> looking<00:01:03.359> at<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
if you're get if you're looking at the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.600 
if you're get if you're looking at the
frame<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.439> area<00:01:04.589> behind<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.949> head<00:01:05.159> tube<00:01:05.400> you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
frame the area behind the head tube you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.070 
frame the area behind the head tube you
want<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.450> strong<00:01:06.750> and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
want that to be really strong and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.750 
want that to be really strong and
actually<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> little<00:01:07.770> bit<00:01:07.890> flexible<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.549> if<00:01:08.670> you

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
actually a little bit flexible so if you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.550 
actually a little bit flexible so if you
hit<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.119> bollard<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> curb<00:01:10.140> or<00:01:10.290> something

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
hit a bollard or a curb or something

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.410 
hit a bollard or a curb or something
like<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:11.520> actually<00:01:11.790> absorbs<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> impact

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
like that it actually absorbs the impact

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
like that it actually absorbs the impact
and<00:01:12.810> doesn't<00:01:13.020> crack<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> frame<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.640> same

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and doesn't crack the frame at the same

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.130 
and doesn't crack the frame at the same
time<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> want<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.420> bottom<00:01:15.720> bracket<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.080> be

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
time you want your bottom bracket to be

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.780 
time you want your bottom bracket to be
really<00:01:16.350> stiff<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.920> doesn't<00:01:17.159> flex<00:01:17.340> back<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
really stiff so it doesn't flex back and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.609 
really stiff so it doesn't flex back and
forth<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.689> anything<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.380> push

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
forth so anything that you and you push

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.469 
forth so anything that you and you push
on<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> pedal<00:01:20.220> all<00:01:20.700> your<00:01:21.000> effort<00:01:21.299> goes<00:01:21.450> into

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
on the pedal all your effort goes into

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.510 
on the pedal all your effort goes into
propelling<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> bike<00:01:22.350> ahead<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.920> nothing

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
propelling the bike ahead and nothing

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.760 
propelling the bike ahead and nothing
that's<00:01:23.670> wasted<00:01:24.090> flexing<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.560> want

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
that's wasted flexing it so you want

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.260 
that's wasted flexing it so you want
different<00:01:26.040> things<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.520> different<00:01:26.700> areas<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
different things in different areas and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.700 
different things in different areas and
some<00:01:27.420> areas<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.750> need<00:01:27.869> high-strength<00:01:28.380> like

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
some areas you need high-strength like

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.020 
some areas you need high-strength like
behind<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> bottom<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> down

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
behind that on the bottom of the down

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.700 
behind that on the bottom of the down
tube<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.509> sometimes<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.439> want<00:01:31.530> high

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
tube and sometimes you want high

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.859 
tube and sometimes you want high
stiffness<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.880> descending<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> bike

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
stiffness for descending so the bike

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.109 
stiffness for descending so the bike
tracks<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.380> nicely<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.979> also<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.939> get

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
tracks really nicely and also so you get

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.840 
tracks really nicely and also so you get
lots<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.390> power<00:01:36.570> transmission<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.759> have

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
lots of power transmission so you have

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.490 
lots of power transmission so you have
your<00:01:38.970> choice<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.299> different<00:01:39.479> carbons<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
your choice of different carbons and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.170 
your choice of different carbons and
show<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:40.979> what<00:01:41.189> kind<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.579> carbon<00:01:41.820> looks<00:01:42.000> like

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
show you what kind of carbon looks like

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.569 
show you what kind of carbon looks like
I<00:01:42.390> brought<00:01:42.630> along<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.990> school<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:44.460> how

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
I brought along this school that's how

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.880 
I brought along this school that's how
you<00:01:44.640> actually<00:01:44.880> buy<00:01:45.180> carbon<00:01:45.619> it's<00:01:46.619> actually<00:01:46.860> a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
you actually buy carbon it's actually a

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.090 
you actually buy carbon it's actually a
big<00:01:47.040> spool<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:47.970> you'd<00:01:48.180> actually<00:01:48.390> buy

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
big spool just like you'd actually buy

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.020 
big spool just like you'd actually buy
for<00:01:50.100> fabric<00:01:50.460> making<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.470> then<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.649> lay<00:01:52.829> this

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
for fabric making and then they lay this

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.190 
for fabric making and then they lay this
onto<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> machine<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.600> actually<00:01:54.630> puts<00:01:55.079> all

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
onto a machine that actually puts all

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.690 
onto a machine that actually puts all
the<00:01:55.320> pieces<00:01:55.500> next<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.100> each<00:01:56.189> other<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.579> you

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the pieces next to each other and you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.580 
the pieces next to each other and you
end<00:01:56.850> up<00:01:56.880> with<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.030> sheet<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:58.049> basically<00:01:58.320> that's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
end up with a sheet but basically that's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.069 
end up with a sheet but basically that's
what<00:01:58.710> carbon<00:01:59.040> looks<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.340> that's<00:02:00.210> what<00:02:00.390> 3000

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
what carbon looks like that's what 3000

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.530 
what carbon looks like that's what 3000
strands<00:02:01.560> right<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.579> carbon<00:02:02.939> fiber<00:02:03.180> each

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
strands right there of carbon fiber each

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.090 
strands right there of carbon fiber each
are<00:02:03.750> quite<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.170> smudge<00:02:04.409> smaller<00:02:04.710> than<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
are quite a bit smudge smaller than the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.100 
are quite a bit smudge smaller than the
diameter<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.579> your<00:02:05.640> hair<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.079> a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
diameter of your hair so this is a

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.139 
diameter of your hair so this is a
higher<00:02:07.320> strength<00:02:07.619> carbon<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:08.879> pull<00:02:09.119> on

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
higher strength carbon so really pull on

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.999 
higher strength carbon so really pull on
it<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.750> got<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.959> really<00:02:10.110> pull<00:02:10.410> hard<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.830> break

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
it you got to really pull hard to break

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.820 
it you got to really pull hard to break
it<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.810> look<00:02:12.959> at<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.319> it's

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
it and you look at it and it's

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
it and you look at it and it's
actually<00:02:14.070> not<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.220> stiff<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.900> same<00:02:16.110> time

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
actually not that stiff the same time

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.890 
actually not that stiff the same time
you<00:02:17.850> can<00:02:17.970> have<00:02:18.090> high<00:02:18.240> stiffness<00:02:18.750> carbon<00:02:20.900> or

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
you can have high stiffness carbon or

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.260 
you can have high stiffness carbon or
high<00:02:22.260> modulus<00:02:22.530> carbon<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.820> actually<00:02:24.120> quite

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
high modulus carbon it's actually quite

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.140 
high modulus carbon it's actually quite
a<00:02:24.300> bit<00:02:24.510> stiffer<00:02:24.990> but<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.710> also<00:02:26.000> not<00:02:27.000> as

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
a bit stiffer but it's also not as

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.990 
a bit stiffer but it's also not as
strong<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:29.010> have<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> choice<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.550> can<00:02:29.730> have

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
strong so you have a choice you can have

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.330 
strong so you have a choice you can have
stiffness<00:02:30.630> or<00:02:30.930> strength<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:31.950> can't<00:02:32.190> have

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
stiffness or strength but you can't have

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.730 
stiffness or strength but you can't have
both<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.660> that's<00:02:33.780> going<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> selection

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
both so that's going to be a selection

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.470 
both so that's going to be a selection
of<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.920> engineer<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.490> optimize<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.180> for

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
of the engineer to optimize it for

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.970 
of the engineer to optimize it for
what's<00:02:37.050> needed<00:02:37.320> we're<00:02:37.740> in<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> frame<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:40.710> you

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
what's needed we're in the frame and you

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.800 
what's needed we're in the frame and you
complicate<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.790> because<00:02:42.450> now<00:02:42.570> you've<00:02:42.720> got

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
complicate that because now you've got

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.750 
complicate that because now you've got
your<00:02:42.930> choice<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.320> materials<00:02:43.800> but<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.640> also

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
your choice of materials but you also

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.360 
your choice of materials but you also
want<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.270> have<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:46.080> layup<00:02:46.380> what<00:02:46.890> angle<00:02:47.250> do<00:02:47.310> you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
want to have the layup what angle do you

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.910 
want to have the layup what angle do you
put<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.670> on<00:02:47.790> because<00:02:48.480> different<00:02:48.960> angles<00:02:49.500> are

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
put it on because different angles are

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.380 
put it on because different angles are
really<00:02:50.160> optimized<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.910> different<00:02:51.240> types

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
really optimized for the different types

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.710 
really optimized for the different types
of<00:02:51.510> loading<00:02:52.790> I've<00:02:53.790> got<00:02:53.940> two<00:02:54.090> pieces<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.510> carbon

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
of loading I've got two pieces of carbon

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.250 
of loading I've got two pieces of carbon
here<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:56.730> look<00:02:56.850> exactly<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.240> same<00:02:57.300> same

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
here it look exactly the same same

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.680 
here it look exactly the same same
thickness<00:02:58.530> same<00:02:59.280> material<00:02:59.760> same<00:03:00.150> width<00:03:00.390> and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
thickness same material same width and

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.720 
thickness same material same width and
same<00:03:00.900> everything<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.980> only<00:03:02.190> difference<00:03:02.520> is

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
same everything the only difference is

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.540 
same everything the only difference is
one's<00:03:03.450> got<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.840> material<00:03:04.380> at<00:03:04.890> plus<00:03:05.160> or<00:03:05.280> minus

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
one's got the material at plus or minus

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.540 
one's got the material at plus or minus
45<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.330> it's<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.600> this<00:03:06.750> go<00:03:07.440> up<00:03:07.560> here<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:07.950> ones

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
45 so it's like this go up here and ones

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.930 
45 so it's like this go up here and ones
running<00:03:08.880> all<00:03:09.000> at<00:03:09.030> 0<00:03:09.510> degrees<00:03:10.200> like<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:11.790> on

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
running all at 0 degrees like this so on

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.380 
running all at 0 degrees like this so on
this<00:03:12.030> one<00:03:12.240> you'll<00:03:13.140> see<00:03:13.459> it's<00:03:14.459> really<00:03:14.700> stiff<00:03:15.209> in

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
this one you'll see it's really stiff in

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.300 
this one you'll see it's really stiff in
this<00:03:15.510> direction<00:03:15.830> but<00:03:16.830> it's<00:03:16.950> actually<00:03:17.160> pretty

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
this direction but it's actually pretty

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.750 
this direction but it's actually pretty
flexible<00:03:17.610> when<00:03:18.450> you're<00:03:18.570> twisting<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.760> this

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
flexible when you're twisting it this

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.940 
flexible when you're twisting it this
one<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.030> other<00:03:21.060> hand<00:03:21.350> is<00:03:22.350> actually<00:03:22.680> really

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
one the other hand is actually really

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.850 
one the other hand is actually really
flexible<00:03:23.580> when<00:03:24.180> you're<00:03:24.300> bending<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.860> but

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
flexible when you're bending it but

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.370 
flexible when you're bending it but
really<00:03:26.130> stiff<00:03:26.519> when<00:03:26.730> you're<00:03:26.850> twisting<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.380> so

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
really stiff when you're twisting it so

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.140 
really stiff when you're twisting it so
this<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> one<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.610> one<00:03:29.880> that's<00:03:30.030> really

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
this is the one this one that's really

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.300 
this is the one this one that's really
stiff<00:03:30.570> when<00:03:30.989> you're<00:03:31.110> twisting<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.560> that's<00:03:32.070> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
stiff when you're twisting it that's the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.340 
stiff when you're twisting it that's the
plus<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.700> minus<00:03:32.940> 45<00:03:33.390> that's<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> fibres<00:03:34.260> are

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
plus and minus 45 that's the fibres are

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.979 
plus and minus 45 that's the fibres are
all<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.650> angle<00:03:35.450> this<00:03:36.450> one<00:03:36.720> that's<00:03:36.840> really

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
all in this angle this one that's really

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.380 
all in this angle this one that's really
stiff<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.470> bending<00:03:37.890> all<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.790> fibres<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.300> in

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
stiff and bending all the fibres are in

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.970 
stiff and bending all the fibres are in
this<00:03:39.480> direction<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.080> zero<00:03:40.380> direction<00:03:40.800> as<00:03:40.890> we

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
this direction the zero direction as we

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.310 
this direction the zero direction as we
call<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:42.150> as<00:03:42.239> an<00:03:42.360> engineer<00:03:42.510> you've<00:03:43.050> really

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
call it so as an engineer you've really

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.780 
call it so as an engineer you've really
got<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.560> know<00:03:43.709> what's<00:03:43.980> happening<00:03:44.459> in<00:03:44.610> which

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
got to know what's happening in which

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.479 
got to know what's happening in which
area<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.180> bike<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:46.040> select<00:03:47.040> your<00:03:47.130> carbon

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
area of the bike to select your carbon

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.030 
area of the bike to select your carbon
fiber<00:03:47.700> angles<00:03:48.269> or<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.510> layup<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.140> optimize<00:03:49.860> it

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
fiber angles or the layup to optimize it

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.530 
fiber angles or the layup to optimize it
for<00:03:50.400> what's<00:03:50.550> happening<00:03:50.970> in<00:03:51.060> each<00:03:51.150> different

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
for what's happening in each different

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.830 
for what's happening in each different
area<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.900> bike<00:03:52.550> so<00:03:53.550> carbon<00:03:53.880> fibre<00:03:54.120> has

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
area of the bike so carbon fibre has

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.479 
area of the bike so carbon fibre has
opened<00:03:55.140> up<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.320> huge<00:03:55.470> opportunity<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:56.400> the

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
opened up a huge opportunity to the

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.400 
opened up a huge opportunity to the
engineer<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.030> designer<00:03:57.420> but<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.290> have

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
engineer and the designer but you have

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.500 
engineer and the designer but you have
to<00:03:58.590> know<00:03:58.769> what<00:03:59.489> material<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.090> need<00:04:00.209> in<00:04:00.360> what

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
to know what material you need in what

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.120 
to know what material you need in what
area<00:04:00.810> which<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.470> depending<00:04:01.830> on<00:04:01.920> what's

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
area which is depending on what's

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.190 
area which is depending on what's
happening<00:04:02.519> in<00:04:02.640> what<00:04:02.730> area<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.209> then<00:04:03.840> how<00:04:04.140> to
