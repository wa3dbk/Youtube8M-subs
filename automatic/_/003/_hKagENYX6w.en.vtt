00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello to you panda and and actively 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.400
 china count like that and all 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.110
 today we will show you how 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.330
 build about a tank like that 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.700
 no well here is about the same but 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.190
 survival dear friends let's go begin 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.420
 open immediately well for him built 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.340
 we need empty money and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.650
 skywalker sadness cobblestones addiction 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.610
 from what you want to do yourself 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.940
 mean these like there 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.670
 what is it called a caterpillar that means 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.440
 green wool well, or 6 colors of which 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.170
 would you like to trim yourself 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.700
 very tank let's start and before the start 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.370
 we will go up three blocks 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.270
 further we will make such a basis from 12 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.920
 blocks so 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 of 12 here and 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.500
 after three blocks does it come to us like that 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.430
 terrible 12 block times two three 4 5 six 7 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.470
 8 10 times this trick turns on 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.829
 do here so here here hood 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.230
 drinks from three block here mean 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.030
 trunk of two blocks and here 's not 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.530
 more entry into the role of counterweight 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.690
 how here here so many blocks to all 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.259
 it turns out two times three 4 5 six 7 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.899
 blocks 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.960
 here we will have a window here 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:17.470
 five blocks, and here we will have very 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.580
 not through the tower 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.260
 here and so then here we close it 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.150
 here we can remove these blocks 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.450
 well so be a little aesthetic and 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.910
 beautiful but in my opinion so here 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.280
 so here so here here is not worth it 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.770
 clean well it will be so beautiful because 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.570
 what we do next will delete u will 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.360
 build a caterpillar they are for starters here we are 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.640
 do this thing and there too 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.980
 Thing is like protection Well, as if 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.720
 conditionally of course but you are a caterpillar case 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.720
 we will have business here 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.760
 here and here here too here further 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.470
 such for the season in general caterpillars as well 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.140
 as before here if someone watched mine 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.970
 video from how to build a tank that is there 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.710
 at first they were it not there in the Cape 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.880
 which is generally the one I stand there 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.460
 then also on to batman 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.990
 that's the one he knows we all invested something 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.240
 Ideally, it does not mean there somewhere there 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.070
 courage building there will help the same 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.290
 tank or it looks like the game 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.960
 here we will have an entry under 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.200
 it is desirable here so build him a hatch 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.450
 so that no one just climbs anywhere but 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.930
 from this side on 4 let's take the idol wool 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.190
 and so here we put everything so on 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.280
 what else will we need? 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.190
 half blocks of any block 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.390
 Well, it's not stone, as always 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.670
 traditionally i like them i 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.250
 I use most often she almost forgot 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.230
 here we will have headlights format all 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.640
 ok actually know now by 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.200
 this video I donâ€™t know what is certain 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.820
 will build almost on the go 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.260
 improvise year almost 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.500
 improvise well what parts sign as 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.280
 worth the part I'll invent on the go 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.820
 so here is a ladder to climb 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.160
 then it counts the provider and 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.470
 green and rug 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.510
 next we take the mind inexpensive not cheap 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.910
 coal block what I looked god on 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.430
 the look itself is beautiful gun and made exactly 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.210
 say here is such a one is not present 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.520
 it's better not to be here 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.600
 although not all the same it will be so beautiful 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.370
 beautiful yes light little coal that's not 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.770
 less ghali is that essentially smile yo 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.840
 so here and so this was normal 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.360
 In general, you can now climb and there already 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.570
 from the inside to equip everything namely 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.730
 first of all put there lights and 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.360
 I will live on the boxes so here are two pieces 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.760
 roadstone 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.250
 here we will have glass the same way you 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.930
 will need gum here we put 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.360
 ladder here so here so here 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.650
 there will be glass again 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.500
 further that we have here then we will be so 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.880
 there will already be leverage here 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.940
 leverage for machine guns that will be us 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.770
 stand here here perhaps here we are 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.390
 remove put here here distributors 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.240
 hands we will have two machine guns there we 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.010
 we will load them it means we should go there 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.690
 load arrows and here we will have too 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.640
 Distributors are here 1 and here is one 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.359
 only here this one will be sent down 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.580
 here we would get the liner 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.120
 so here we leave the model such 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.220
 things 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.490
 called this roadstone if someone i 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.930
 still not aware of mean so here and 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.300
 here and here at night and cuts through 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.610
 do here the lever set well 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.200
 certainly upside down so we 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.730
 do here next well yes here here 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:44.960
 perhaps we will put the block back just like that 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:49.220
 That means it is a sin as the cause of so much so 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.440
 and that's who you damn is not such and such and here 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.510
 here so after all and still glass is not 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.740
 the second source of help here poured schA 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.720
 PU glass means it will stand to 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.190
 look at that girl's house on the way 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.370
 girl house here because still for some reason 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.680
 glass tower years of us or is it clear 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.810
 very important than the reason but because 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.900
 does then we take any cheap 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.100
 luzhniki results will just be 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.950
 acting as the meaning of it 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.740
 front gun sleeves we will thrust 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.200
 inexpensive expensive already full second time 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.220
 talking about ganin and balloon and because it 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.660
 seniors not knowing alternative kaha here 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.300
 only alternative to normal 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.720
 projectile then let's check the work 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.210
 of our 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.430
 Here we see that our bug and there were 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:41.419
 fuse so arch x is ringing let's get it 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.970
 add conversational thing here is the lesson 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.940
 I can add an example 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.670
 Boyar in the new comfo I will create 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:57.440
 although not long after the shooting, although no 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:06:00.560
 now probably it is not difficult as well 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.500
 because even then we studied here 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.490
 take can we always take means set 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:10.630
 arrows that is lay down arrows here and there 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.350
 will be this way machine guns 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.610
 and something else I forgot how it will be here 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.500
 recharged whom so here and here 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.530
 we will be lights 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:25.040
 I hope is now introducing Come check 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:30.640
 and in general here to count still not 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.640
 put the disabled headlights 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.250
 perhaps this is not pretty 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.320
 bad tank in my opinion you can easily 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.490
 build survival as seen need 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.110
 it is known that it is wool 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.330
 rather difficult material 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.480
 all principle distributors can be yourself from 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:50.810
 empty why not why took what 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.880
 undoubtedly fill well 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.100
 gash u cobble from there it 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.630
 bead and other currency arrow here 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.140
 do not put the general thing here already 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.400
 your imagination your skills so 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.230
 say learn 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.820
