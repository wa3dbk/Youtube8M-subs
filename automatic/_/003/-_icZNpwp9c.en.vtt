00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.560 
I stopped it because if you put water
over<00:02:01.440> this<00:02:01.590> last<00:02:01.920> segment<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.670> then<00:02:02.970> not<00:02:03.330> let

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
over this last segment and then not let

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.120 
over this last segment and then not let
them<00:02:03.720> drop<00:02:03.930> down<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.490> then<00:02:06.680> then<00:02:07.680> they<00:02:07.890> just

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
them drop down there then then they just

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.310 
them drop down there then then they just
stay<00:02:08.580> afloat<00:02:08.910> on<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.300> water<00:02:09.510> when<00:02:09.990> it<00:02:10.080> goes<00:02:10.260> to

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
stay afloat on the water when it goes to

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.980 
stay afloat on the water when it goes to
this<00:02:10.940> second<00:02:11.940> layer<00:02:12.060> science<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.690> only<00:02:12.870> have

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
this second layer science I only have

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.280 
this second layer science I only have
two<00:02:13.170> layers<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.530> signs<00:02:13.740> because<00:02:13.950> uh<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.940> water

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
two layers of signs because uh the water

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.020 
two layers of signs because uh the water
that<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.350> want<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.740> have<00:02:16.830> their<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.940> you

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
that I want to have their and if you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.940 
that I want to have their and if you
seal<00:02:18.330> off<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.690> mob<00:02:18.870> spawner<00:02:19.230> they<00:02:19.560> will<00:02:19.709> still

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
seal off the mob spawner they will still

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.180 
seal off the mob spawner they will still
spawn<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.459> here<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:22.080> mob<00:02:22.230> spawner<00:02:22.530> throws

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
spawn in here but the mob spawner throws

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.830 
spawn in here but the mob spawner throws
off<00:02:23.370> light<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.790> they<00:02:23.880> don't<00:02:24.060> spawn<00:02:24.300> it's<00:02:24.450> often

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
off light so they don't spawn it's often

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.040 
off light so they don't spawn it's often
now<00:02:25.260> we<00:02:25.320> can<00:02:25.680> just<00:02:25.830> break<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.190> torches<00:02:27.050> and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
now we can just break the torches and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.550 
now we can just break the torches and
we'll<00:02:28.230> just<00:02:28.470> watch<00:02:29.340> as<00:02:29.670> leakage<00:02:30.570> some<00:02:30.840> uh<00:02:30.870> you

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
we'll just watch as leakage some uh you

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.750 
we'll just watch as leakage some uh you
want<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.770> see<00:02:31.890> on<00:02:31.980> me<00:02:32.070> off<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:32.340> here<00:02:32.459> I'll<00:02:32.730> just

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
want to see on me off in here I'll just

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
and torture thing all right there's one

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.350 
and torture thing all right there's one
skeleton<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:48.180> just<00:02:48.420> spawned<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:50.430> then

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
skeleton that just spawned and then

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.440 
skeleton that just spawned and then
dropped<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.290> then<00:02:53.070> in<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.790> second<00:02:54.209> there<00:02:54.360> will

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
dropped and then in a second there will

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.680 
dropped and then in a second there will
be<00:02:54.540> another<00:02:56.150> hopefully<00:02:57.150> that'll<00:02:57.300> be<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.510> good

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
be another hopefully that'll be a good

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.229 
be another hopefully that'll be a good
example<00:02:58.550> 3<00:02:59.550> minute<00:02:59.820> video<00:02:59.910> not<00:03:00.900> too<00:03:01.170> long

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
example 3 minute video not too long

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.820 
example 3 minute video not too long
probably<00:03:03.239> three<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.660> half<00:03:03.690> just<00:03:04.650> gotta

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
probably three and a half just gotta

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.030 
probably three and a half just gotta
wait<00:03:04.950> till<00:03:05.160> another<00:03:05.250> spot<00:03:05.670> skeleton<00:03:06.510> spawns

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.009 

like<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.160> said<00:03:11.220> if<00:03:11.549> you<00:03:11.670> uh<00:03:11.730> that's<00:03:12.720> weird
