00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
I've made a bunch of these squares

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.250 
I've made a bunch of these squares
they're<00:00:17.250> all<00:00:17.369> exactly<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.850> same<00:00:18.109> they<00:00:19.109> all

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
they're all exactly the same they all

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.759 
they're all exactly the same they all
have<00:00:19.500> these<00:00:20.189> nails<00:00:20.520> protruding<00:00:20.850> at<00:00:21.390> each<00:00:22.289> end

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.250 
have these nails protruding at each end
and<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> other<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.449> sides<00:00:24.689> they<00:00:25.050> have

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
and on the other on the sides they have

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.240 
and on the other on the sides they have
holes<00:00:26.000> dear<00:00:27.050> n.n<00:00:28.050> also<00:00:28.439> holds<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:29.039> through

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
holes dear n.n also holds going through

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.179 
holes dear n.n also holds going through
that<00:00:29.369> way<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:30.779> can<00:00:30.929> join<00:00:31.320> this

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
that way so so that they can join this

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.110 
that way so so that they can join this
way<00:00:32.430> or<00:00:32.669> four<00:00:33.450> long<00:00:33.840> ways<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.260> well<00:00:35.120> works

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
way or four long ways as well works

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
way or four long ways as well works
pretty<00:00:36.239> well<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.780> make<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.440> make<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.739> all

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
pretty well you can make you make a all

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.010 
pretty well you can make you make a all
shapes<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.520> I'm<00:00:39.090> working<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.780> make

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
shapes and I'm working on a way to make

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.010 
shapes and I'm working on a way to make
a<00:00:40.050> four<00:00:40.620> square<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> moment<00:00:42.020> hibbett

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
a four square one at the moment hibbett

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.180 
a four square one at the moment hibbett
haven't<00:00:43.230> quite<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.559> worked<00:00:43.860> out<00:00:44.010> yet

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
haven't quite got that worked out yet

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.889 
haven't quite got that worked out yet
but<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.460> will<00:00:45.469> so<00:00:46.469> basically<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:48.270> reason<00:00:48.600> was

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
but I will so basically the reason was

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.540 
but I will so basically the reason was
so<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.829> pick<00:00:49.980> them<00:00:50.129> all<00:00:50.250> down<00:00:50.399> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
so that you can pick them all down and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.279 
so that you can pick them all down and
just<00:00:50.670> make<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> big<00:00:51.030> stack<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> these<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.140> need

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
just make a big stack of these if I need

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.389 
just make a big stack of these if I need
to<00:00:52.320> take<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.680> anywhere<00:00:52.980> because<00:00:53.160> we're

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
to take it anywhere because we're

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.260 
to take it anywhere because we're
renting<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.050> wanted<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.620> make<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.860> movable

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
renting so I wanted to make it movable

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.549 
renting so I wanted to make it movable
but<00:00:57.270> reasonably<00:00:57.660> solid<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.170> he<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.410> keep

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
but reasonably solid so he can keep

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.670 
but reasonably solid so he can keep
predators<00:00:58.859> here<00:01:00.199> some<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.289> them<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.500> got

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
predators here some of them have got

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.619 
predators here some of them have got
plastic<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.250> them<00:01:02.460> some<00:01:02.789> heaven<00:01:03.059> that's

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
plastic on them some heaven that's

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.070 
plastic on them some heaven that's
because<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:05.250> were<00:01:05.450> working<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.630> hell<00:01:06.930> we're

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
water thing on the side at the moment

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
water thing on the side at the moment
they<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.110> eat<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.680> drink<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.070> air<00:01:35.159> well<00:01:35.970> I've

cover it with a tarpaulin and the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.190 
cover it with a tarpaulin and the
summers<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.250> keep<00:01:41.400> them<00:01:41.549> shaded<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:43.020> this

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
summers to keep them shaded and this

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.899 
summers to keep them shaded and this
means<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.619> top<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:43.890> with<00:01:44.220> no<00:01:44.399> plastic<00:01:44.790> on
