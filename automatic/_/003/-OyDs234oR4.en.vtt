00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.530 

a<00:00:05.840> transition<00:00:06.840> is<00:00:07.110> about<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.770> occur<00:00:08.130> a

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
a transition is about to occur a

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.420 
a transition is about to occur a
dimensional<00:00:09.540> shift<00:00:09.900> that<00:00:10.710> will<00:00:10.889> lessen<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
dimensional shift that will lessen the

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.030 
dimensional shift that will lessen the
density<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.180> the<00:00:12.450> third<00:00:12.660> dimension<00:00:12.890> so<00:00:13.890> that

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
density of the third dimension so that

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.280 
density of the third dimension so that
you<00:00:14.190> will<00:00:14.310> move<00:00:14.550> into<00:00:15.000> higher<00:00:15.330> dimensions<00:00:15.360> in

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
you will move into higher dimensions in

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.050 
you will move into higher dimensions in
which<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.740> body<00:00:16.950> does<00:00:17.250> not<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.700> such<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
which the body does not have such a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.769 
which the body does not have such a
solid<00:00:18.390> state<00:00:19.250> you<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.430> come<00:00:20.700> here<00:00:21.180> because

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
solid state you have come here because

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.019 
solid state you have come here because
you<00:00:22.140> wish<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.590> master<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:23.279> evolutionary

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
you wish to master the evolutionary

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.920 
you wish to master the evolutionary
process<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.930> be<00:00:25.439> able<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.950> live<00:00:26.160> with<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.930> it

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
process and be able to live with it it

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.409 
process and be able to live with it it
is<00:00:28.140> not<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.860> we<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.520> Pleiadians<00:00:30.180> have

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
is not just that we the Pleiadians have

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.560 
is not just that we the Pleiadians have
come<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.840> assist<00:00:31.310> we<00:00:32.310> are<00:00:32.430> only<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:33.060> grouping

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
come to assist we are only one grouping

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.979 
come to assist we are only one grouping
from<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.470> star<00:00:34.800> system<00:00:35.370> there<00:00:35.610> are<00:00:36.510> many<00:00:36.750> who

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
from one star system there are many who

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.610 
from one star system there are many who
have<00:00:37.170> journeyed<00:00:37.410> here<00:00:37.649> for<00:00:38.250> many<00:00:38.460> reasons

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
have journeyed here for many reasons

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.290 
have journeyed here for many reasons
majority<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.000> extraterrestrials<00:00:42.000> are

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
majority of the extraterrestrials are

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.750 
majority of the extraterrestrials are
here<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:42.899> your<00:00:43.050> upliftment<00:00:43.620> though<00:00:44.519> there

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
here for your upliftment though there

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.389 
here for your upliftment though there
are<00:00:44.940> also<00:00:45.210> those<00:00:45.780> who<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.250> other

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
are also those who are here for other

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.000 
are also those who are here for other
reasons

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.920 

and<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:51.220> shed<00:00:51.610> any<00:00:51.850> light<00:00:51.970> on<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.630> recent

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
and you shed any light on the recent

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:01.010 
and you shed any light on the recent
so-called<00:00:53.500> alien<00:00:53.830> activity<00:00:54.340> ah<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.739> think<00:01:00.280> that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
so-called alien activity ah I think that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.670 
so-called alien activity ah I think that
if<00:01:02.020> there<00:01:02.410> was<00:01:02.620> some<00:01:02.860> sort<00:01:03.070> of<00:01:03.220> an<00:01:03.370> alien

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
if there was some sort of an alien

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.040 
if there was some sort of an alien
infestation<00:01:05.910> to<00:01:06.910> save<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.479> government<00:01:07.660> be

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
infestation to save the government be

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.050 
infestation to save the government be
the<00:01:08.170> first<00:01:08.410> 11<00:01:08.650> no<00:01:08.950> raise<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.520> government

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
the first 11 no raise the government

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.719 
the first 11 no raise the government
would<00:01:10.300> let<00:01:10.450> us<00:01:10.600> know<00:01:10.840> this<00:01:11.710> is<00:01:11.860> America<00:01:12.460> yeah

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
would let us know this is America yeah

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.000 
would let us know this is America yeah
you<00:01:13.150> know<00:01:13.240> that's<00:01:13.479> how<00:01:13.720> we<00:01:13.780> know<00:01:14.229> we<00:01:14.500> live<00:01:14.710> in<00:01:14.770> a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
you know that's how we know we live in a

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.340 
you know that's how we know we live in a
free<00:01:15.280> land<00:01:15.310> because<00:01:16.060> there's<00:01:16.360> no<00:01:16.510> secret<00:01:17.050> that

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
free land because there's no secret that

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:54.609 
free land because there's no secret that
say<00:01:17.920> hey<00:01:18.160> duck<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:18.910> cover

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.969 

as<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.799> explore<00:01:56.369> your<00:01:56.759> current<00:01:57.390> body

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
as you explore your current body

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.120 
as you explore your current body
identity<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.310> lifetime<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.869> quickly<00:02:01.140> you

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
identity and lifetime do it quickly you

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.389 
identity and lifetime do it quickly you
do<00:02:02.280> not<00:02:02.429> have<00:02:02.700> years<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.450> study<00:02:03.840> them<00:02:04.189> it<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.369> a

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
do not have years to study them it is a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
vast plan you are participating in all

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.210 
vast plan you are participating in all
of<00:02:09.299> you<00:02:09.420> jumped<00:02:09.899> at<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.049> chance<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.860> here

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
of you jumped at the chance to be here

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.580 
of you jumped at the chance to be here
in<00:02:11.430> such<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.880> challenging<00:02:12.540> place<00:02:12.750> at<00:02:13.230> such<00:02:13.560> a

challenging time you were certain you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:52.170 
challenging time you were certain you
could<00:02:16.290> do<00:02:16.470> it
