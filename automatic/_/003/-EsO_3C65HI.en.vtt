like<00:01:44.450> a<00:01:44.480> batter<00:01:44.810> it's<00:01:45.680> not<00:01:45.890> what<00:01:46.010> I<00:01:46.040> had<00:01:46.280> in

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
like a batter it's not what I had in

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.640 
like a batter it's not what I had in
mind<00:01:46.760> when<00:01:47.120> it<00:01:47.270> came<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.810> French<00:01:48.140> classic

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
mind when it came to French classic

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.350 
mind when it came to French classic
cuisine<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.280> what<00:01:49.460> I'm<00:01:49.610> used<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:49.970> do<00:01:50.090> in<00:01:50.240> the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
cuisine and what I'm used to do in the

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.320 
cuisine and what I'm used to do in the
UK<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:51.710> I'm<00:01:51.860> gonna<00:01:51.979> try<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.370> and<00:01:52.580> see<00:01:52.670> what

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
UK but I'm gonna try it and see what

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.100 
UK but I'm gonna try it and see what
flavors<00:01:54.170> come<00:01:54.470> out<00:01:54.590> of<00:01:54.800> it

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.970 

now<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.650> chickens<00:02:00.130> nice<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.820> tender

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.890 

I'm<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.670> gonna<00:02:05.760> try<00:02:06.240> bit<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.570> sauce

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
I'm just gonna try bit of the sauce

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.550 
I'm just gonna try bit of the sauce
along<00:02:07.440> with<00:02:07.650> it

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.940 

it's<00:02:14.130> very<00:02:14.400> simple<00:02:14.940> but<00:02:15.300> flavorsome<00:02:16.110> and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
it's very simple but flavorsome and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.030 
it's very simple but flavorsome and
that's<00:02:17.100> what<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:19.410> sauce<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.890> slightly

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
that's what I like the sauce is slightly

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.809 
that's what I like the sauce is slightly
tart<00:02:20.810> it's<00:02:21.810> slightly<00:02:22.260> sour<00:02:22.800> but<00:02:23.459> it's<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.640> good

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
tart it's slightly sour but it's a good

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.720 
tart it's slightly sour but it's a good
thing<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.330> think<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.290> got<00:02:26.010> an<00:02:26.130> Indian<00:02:26.430> twist

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
thing I think it's got an Indian twist

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.260 
thing I think it's got an Indian twist
for<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:28.319> it's<00:02:28.470> not<00:02:28.530> pure<00:02:28.980> French<00:02:29.520> classic

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
for this so it's not pure French classic

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.000 
for this so it's not pure French classic
cuisine<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:31.230> there's<00:02:31.380> nothing<00:02:31.800> wrong<00:02:31.950> with

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
cuisine but there's nothing wrong with

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.059 
cuisine but there's nothing wrong with
that<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.819> could<00:02:33.000> be<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> fusion

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.059 

now<00:02:37.640> if<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.879> ever<00:02:38.060> go<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.239> France<00:02:38.859> try<00:02:39.859> and

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
now if you ever go to France try and

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.369 
now if you ever go to France try and
learn<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.370> few<00:02:40.849> lines<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.450> French<00:02:41.780> it's<00:02:42.139> worth

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
learn a few lines of French it's worth

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.649 
learn a few lines of French it's worth
it<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.799> really<00:02:43.069> is<00:02:43.370> if<00:02:43.909> you<00:02:44.090> walk<00:02:44.269> into<00:02:44.510> a

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
it it really is if you walk into a

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.809 
it it really is if you walk into a
restaurant<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.260> order<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.799> meal<00:02:46.099> in<00:02:46.400> French
