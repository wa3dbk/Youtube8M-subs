else you know your warranties

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.150 
else you know your warranties
this<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.900> pretty<00:03:19.110> cool<00:03:19.350> actually<00:03:19.590> how<00:03:19.980> this

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
this is pretty cool actually how this

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:28.310 
this is pretty cool actually how this
works<00:03:23.960> spend<00:03:24.960> around<00:03:25.580> seconds<00:03:27.110> takes<00:03:28.110> each

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
works spend around seconds takes each

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.680 
works spend around seconds takes each
second<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:29.490> you<00:03:29.550> know<00:03:29.700> how<00:03:29.880> long<00:03:30.090> has<00:03:30.330> passed

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
second so you know how long has passed

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.720 
second so you know how long has passed
and<00:03:31.730> if<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:32.940> one<00:03:33.210> down<00:03:33.420> here<00:03:33.480> tells<00:03:34.200> you

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
and if this one down here tells you

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.670 
and if this one down here tells you
basically<00:03:35.730> if<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.360> break<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.500> down<00:03:37.530> I

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
basically if you can break it down I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.560 
basically if you can break it down I
guess<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.130> can<00:03:38.250> get<00:03:38.400> minutes<00:03:38.730> out<00:03:38.910> of<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.210> but

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
guess you can get minutes out of it but

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
guess you can get minutes out of it but
it's<00:03:39.750> mostly<00:03:40.110> for<00:03:40.530> hours<00:03:41.010> up<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.400> 12<00:03:41.850> hours

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.260 

yeah<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.620> mean<00:03:47.100> that's<00:03:47.220> basically<00:03:47.520> all<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.090> got

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
yeah I mean that's basically all you got

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.930 
yeah I mean that's basically all you got
with<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.570> watch<00:03:49.280> analog<00:03:50.280> function<00:03:50.760> will

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
with this watch analog function will

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.720 
with this watch analog function will
stop<00:03:51.180> watch<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:52.770> looks<00:03:52.980> beautiful<00:03:53.160> I'd

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
stop watch and it looks beautiful I'd

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.150 
stop watch and it looks beautiful I'd
say<00:03:53.990> but<00:03:54.990> it's<00:03:55.140> pretty<00:03:55.290> cool<00:03:55.560> once<00:03:55.800> you<00:03:55.890> stop

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
say but it's pretty cool once you stop

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.040 
say but it's pretty cool once you stop
it<00:03:56.400> what<00:03:56.520> it<00:03:56.640> does

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.200 

there<00:04:02.050> we<00:04:02.200> go<00:04:02.380> spin<00:04:02.920> drag<00:04:03.160> back<00:04:03.340> pretty

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
there we go spin drag back pretty

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.990 
there we go spin drag back pretty
awesome

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
awesome

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.250 
awesome
there's<00:04:07.000> not<00:04:07.090> much<00:04:07.330> else<00:04:07.540> to<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:07.930> really<00:04:08.110> I

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
there's not much else to it really I

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.110 
there's not much else to it really I
mean<00:04:08.530> you<00:04:09.040> can<00:04:09.160> see<00:04:09.310> on<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.550> backs<00:04:09.760> at<00:04:10.030> the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
mean you can see on the backs at the

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.590 
mean you can see on the backs at the
model<00:04:10.420> number<00:04:11.340> anti-magnetic

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
model number anti-magnetic

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.000 
model number anti-magnetic
shock-absorbing<00:04:13.600> of<00:04:13.780> course<00:04:14.080> that's<00:04:14.380> g-shock

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
shock-absorbing of course that's g-shock

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.150 
shock-absorbing of course that's g-shock
but<00:04:15.940> yes<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:16.299> is<00:04:16.420> ants<00:04:16.750> have<00:04:16.870> magnetics<00:04:17.530> 20<00:04:17.980> bar

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
but yes it is ants have magnetics 20 bar

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
but yes it is ants have magnetics 20 bar
200<00:04:19.000> meters<00:04:19.299> water<00:04:19.480> resist<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.970> know<00:04:22.090> you

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
200 meters water resist you know you

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.540 
200 meters water resist you know you
can't<00:04:22.510> obviously<00:04:22.870> go<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.710> far<00:04:23.950> under<00:04:24.340> water

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
can't obviously go that far under water

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.290 
can't obviously go that far under water
with<00:04:24.790> one<00:04:24.940> of<00:04:25.060> these<00:04:25.180> or<00:04:25.540> any<00:04:25.870> of<00:04:27.300> your

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
with one of these or any of your

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.020 
with one of these or any of your
standard<00:04:28.810> G<00:04:29.080> shocks<00:04:29.440> like<00:04:29.620> this<00:04:30.040> unless<00:04:30.730> it's

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
standard G shocks like this unless it's

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.030 
standard G shocks like this unless it's
got<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.270> helium<00:04:31.810> release<00:04:32.169> valve<00:04:32.440> hopefully<00:04:32.919> you

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
got a helium release valve hopefully you

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.190 
got a helium release valve hopefully you
know<00:04:33.190> that<00:04:33.220> so<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.270> really<00:04:34.300> wouldn't<00:04:34.690> test<00:04:35.020> the

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
know that so I really wouldn't test the

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.780 
know that so I really wouldn't test the
depth<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.620> water<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:36.100> can<00:04:36.130> go<00:04:36.430> swimming

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
depth of water you can go swimming

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.030 
depth of water you can go swimming
tubing<00:04:37.480> shower<00:04:38.470> obviously<00:04:39.310> rain<00:04:39.610> obviously

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
tubing shower obviously rain obviously

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.340 
tubing shower obviously rain obviously
recreational<00:04:42.040> scuba<00:04:42.280> diving<00:04:42.850> but<00:04:43.140> if<00:04:44.140> it

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
recreational scuba diving but if it

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.560 
recreational scuba diving but if it
involves<00:04:45.100> helium<00:04:45.490> just<00:04:45.520> like<00:04:45.910> if<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.240> read

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
involves helium just like if you read

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.590 
involves helium just like if you read
the<00:04:46.750> module<00:04:47.169> it<00:04:48.010> tell<00:04:48.340> you<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:48.610> balls<00:04:49.060> helium

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
the module it tell you that balls helium

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.240 
the module it tell you that balls helium
you<00:04:49.780> can't<00:04:49.990> use<00:04:50.230> it<00:04:50.440> I<00:04:50.560> gotta<00:04:50.710> have<00:04:50.890> a<00:04:50.919> helium

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
you can't use it I gotta have a helium

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.170
