so here we got freestyle kick on side we
want<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.710> have<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.069> body<00:00:05.339> nice<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.299> high<00:00:06.509> in

want to have that body nice and high in

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.160 
want to have that body nice and high in
the<00:00:06.779> water<00:00:06.960> from<00:00:07.410> our<00:00:07.529> head<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.130> our<00:00:08.160> feet<00:00:09.170> and

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
the water from our head to our feet and

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.660 
the water from our head to our feet and
we<00:00:10.260> want<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.559> imagine<00:00:10.740> there's<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.280> pole

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
we want to imagine there's that pole

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.730 
we want to imagine there's that pole
going<00:00:12.150> down<00:00:12.420> from<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.900> middle<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.320> our<00:00:13.469> head

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
going down from the middle of our head

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.829 
going down from the middle of our head
down<00:00:14.040> through<00:00:14.250> our<00:00:14.309> spine<00:00:14.670> through<00:00:15.420> our<00:00:15.570> legs

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
down through our spine through our legs

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.260 
down through our spine through our legs
and<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.680> we're<00:00:16.830> rotating<00:00:17.039> our<00:00:17.460> face<00:00:17.730> looking

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
and so we're rotating our face looking

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.000 
and so we're rotating our face looking
down<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> should<00:00:19.500> be<00:00:19.529> looking<00:00:19.710> directly

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
down so I should be looking directly

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.470 
down so I should be looking directly
down<00:00:20.189> at<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> bottom<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:20.970> pool<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.180> then

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
down at the bottom of the pool and then

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.090 
down at the bottom of the pool and then
they<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.810> rotate<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.500> now<00:00:22.619> your<00:00:22.800> eyes<00:00:22.920> are

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
they just rotate so now your eyes are

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.240 
they just rotate so now your eyes are
looking<00:00:23.250> directly<00:00:23.820> up<00:00:24.470> so<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> only<00:00:25.800> thing

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
looking directly up so the only thing

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.970 
looking directly up so the only thing
that's<00:00:26.369> rotating<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.510> head<00:00:27.779> going<00:00:28.740> from

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
that's rotating is the head going from

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.299 
that's rotating is the head going from
straight<00:00:29.429> down<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.269> straight<00:00:30.689> up<00:00:37.100> very<00:00:38.100> good

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
straight down to straight up very good

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.490 
straight down to straight up very good
now<00:00:38.460> we're<00:00:38.640> gonna<00:00:38.730> do<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.210> we're<00:00:40.050> gonna<00:00:40.110> start

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
now we're gonna do is we're gonna start

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.260 
now we're gonna do is we're gonna start
kicking<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.100> side<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.640> then<00:00:41.910> after<00:00:42.180> you

kicking on one side and then after you
take<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> breath<00:00:42.750> when<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.530> put<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.829> head

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
take a breath when you put your head

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.670 
take a breath when you put your head
down<00:00:44.010> we're<00:00:44.520> gonna<00:00:44.610> switch<00:00:44.940> sides<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.719> then

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
down we're gonna switch sides and then

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.900 
down we're gonna switch sides and then
you're<00:00:46.770> gonna<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> other<00:00:47.550> side

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you're gonna do it to the other side

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.790 
you're gonna do it to the other side
okay<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.660> left<00:00:48.960> shoulder<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
okay so left shoulder will be out of the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.850 
okay so left shoulder will be out of the
water<00:00:50.690> turn<00:00:51.690> your<00:00:51.870> head<00:00:52.050> take<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> breath<00:00:52.680> in

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
water turn your head take a breath in

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.369 
water turn your head take a breath in
put<00:00:53.309> your<00:00:53.340> head<00:00:53.579> back<00:00:53.760> down<00:00:54.079> once<00:00:55.079> your<00:00:55.260> head

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
put your head back down once your head

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.889 
put your head back down once your head
is<00:00:55.469> back<00:00:55.649> down<00:00:55.860> rotate<00:00:56.610> sides<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.360> repeat<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
is back down rotate sides and repeat the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.569 
is back down rotate sides and repeat the
same<00:00:58.109> thing<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> other<00:00:58.590> side<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> what

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
same thing on the other side so what

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.549 
same thing on the other side so what
this<00:01:02.699> helps<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.210> body<00:01:03.420> rotation<00:01:03.960> how<00:01:04.409> we're

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
this helps is body rotation how we're

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.859 
this helps is body rotation how we're
supposed<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.920> rotate<00:01:05.430> okay<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.510> rotating

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
supposed to rotate okay so the rotating

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.200 
supposed to rotate okay so the rotating
our<00:01:07.080> head<00:01:07.320> helps<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:07.830> breathing<00:01:08.310> now<00:01:09.000> we're

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
our head helps with breathing now we're

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:21.490 
our head helps with breathing now we're
adding<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.540> body<00:01:09.810> roll<00:01:10.170> into<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.410 

so<00:01:22.010> then<00:01:22.190> there's<00:01:22.460> that<00:01:22.580> rotation<00:01:23.210> very<00:01:23.510> nice

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
so then there's that rotation very nice

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.300 
so then there's that rotation very nice
and<00:01:26.420> if<00:01:27.020> we<00:01:27.140> feel<00:01:27.350> as<00:01:27.560> if<00:01:27.710> our<00:01:27.890> hips<00:01:28.130> are

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
and if we feel as if our hips are

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.570 
and if we feel as if our hips are
sinking<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.820> little<00:01:28.850> bit<00:01:29.210> what<00:01:29.420> we<00:01:29.540> can<00:01:29.690> do<00:01:29.930> is

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
sinking a little bit what we can do is

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.520 
sinking a little bit what we can do is
one<00:01:31.580> thing<00:01:31.850> is<00:01:32.030> get<00:01:32.840> your<00:01:32.930> head<00:01:33.140> down<00:01:33.350> a<00:01:33.380> little

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
one thing is get your head down a little

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.320 
one thing is get your head down a little
bit<00:01:33.800> more<00:01:34.010> so<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:34.520> can<00:01:34.640> see<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:35.000> just<00:01:35.060> got

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
bit more so you can see that just got

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.210 
bit more so you can see that just got
her<00:01:35.510> hips<00:01:35.720> up<00:01:35.870> a<00:01:35.960> little<00:01:36.110> higher<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.620> if<00:01:37.100> that

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
her hips up a little higher and if that

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.190 
her hips up a little higher and if that
doesn't<00:01:37.610> seem<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.880> do<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.030> trick<00:01:38.150> we<00:01:39.020> can

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
doesn't seem to do the trick we can

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.710 
doesn't seem to do the trick we can
press<00:01:39.530> down<00:01:39.800> with<00:01:40.040> our<00:01:40.160> shoulders<00:01:40.640> okay<00:01:41.300> so<00:01:41.360> if

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
press down with our shoulders okay so if

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.780 
press down with our shoulders okay so if
you<00:01:41.810> imagine<00:01:41.930> there's<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.590> line<00:01:42.950> going<00:01:43.670> from

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
you imagine there's a line going from

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.300 
you imagine there's a line going from
the<00:01:44.210> tip<00:01:44.390> of<00:01:44.510> one<00:01:44.660> shoulder<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.229> other<00:01:45.320> if

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
the tip of one shoulder to the other if

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.330 
the tip of one shoulder to the other if
you<00:01:46.490> press<00:01:46.790> that<00:01:46.820> line<00:01:47.270> down<00:01:48.040> that<00:01:49.040> will<00:01:49.220> lift

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
you press that line down that will lift

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.490 
you press that line down that will lift
your<00:01:49.490> hips<00:01:49.700> up<00:01:49.940> okay<00:01:50.869> because<00:01:50.990> your<00:01:51.200> center<00:01:51.470> of

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
your hips up okay because your center of

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.800 
your hips up okay because your center of
buoyancy<00:01:51.770> is<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.220> top<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.460> your<00:01:52.700> chest<00:01:52.970> right

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
buoyancy is the top of your chest right

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.480 
buoyancy is the top of your chest right
below<00:01:54.140> or<00:01:54.350> right<00:01:54.530> where<00:01:54.710> your<00:01:54.830> neck<00:01:55.040> meets<00:01:55.340> the

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
below or right where your neck meets the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.190 
below or right where your neck meets the
top<00:01:55.670> of<00:01:55.850> your<00:01:55.940> chest<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:56.780> that's<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.080> area

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
top of your chest so that's the area

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.480 
top of your chest so that's the area
that<00:01:57.500> you're<00:01:57.590> trying<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.830> push<00:01:58.009> underwater

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
that you're trying to push underwater

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.990 
that you're trying to push underwater
that<00:01:58.759> will<00:01:59.000> alone<00:01:59.479> get<00:02:00.020> your<00:02:00.170> hips<00:02:00.320> up<00:02:00.530> higher

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.100 

the<00:02:05.000> other<00:02:05.149> important<00:02:05.630> thing<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.780> do<00:02:05.990> when

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
the other important thing to do when

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.300 
the other important thing to do when
you're<00:02:06.200> doing<00:02:06.440> this<00:02:06.530> drill<00:02:06.710> is<00:02:06.920> make<00:02:07.070> sure<00:02:07.100> you

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
you're doing this drill is make sure you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.949 
you're doing this drill is make sure you
breathe<00:02:07.580> out<00:02:07.729> through<00:02:07.910> your<00:02:07.970> nose<00:02:08.270> as<00:02:08.630> your

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
breathe out through your nose as your

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.050 
breathe out through your nose as your
face<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.410> rotating<00:02:09.950> out<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.429> water<00:02:10.640> and

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
face is rotating out of the water and

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.000 
face is rotating out of the water and
I'll<00:02:11.690> prevent<00:02:12.050> any<00:02:12.200> water<00:02:12.410> from<00:02:12.620> getting<00:02:12.770> up

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
I'll prevent any water from getting up

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.610 
I'll prevent any water from getting up
there<00:02:13.540> good<00:02:14.540> we<00:02:14.690> could<00:02:14.810> possibly<00:02:15.020> have<00:02:15.410> that

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
there good we could possibly have that

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:26.620 
there good we could possibly have that
head<00:02:15.920> looking<00:02:16.280> down<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> little<00:02:16.970> bit<00:02:17.150> more

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.420 

so<00:02:27.230> think<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.710> know<00:02:27.800> your<00:02:27.980> chin<00:02:28.220> being

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
so think of you know your chin being

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.970 
so think of you know your chin being
lined<00:02:28.730> up<00:02:28.910> with<00:02:29.090> one<00:02:29.330> shoulder<00:02:29.630> or<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:30.230> other

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.110 

so<00:02:37.980> there's<00:02:38.129> that<00:02:38.280> good<00:02:38.519> hundred<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.969> eighty

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
so there's that good hundred and eighty

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.809 
so there's that good hundred and eighty
degree<00:02:39.480> rotation<00:02:40.140> from<00:02:40.469> chin<00:02:41.280> going<00:02:41.609> from

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
degree rotation from chin going from

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.970 
degree rotation from chin going from
your<00:02:42.000> right<00:02:42.180> shoulder<00:02:42.689> and<00:02:42.900> chin<00:02:43.469> going<00:02:43.769> from

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
your right shoulder and chin going from

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.370 
your right shoulder and chin going from
your<00:02:44.129> left
