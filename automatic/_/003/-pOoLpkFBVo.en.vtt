you're going to take your for to lie two

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.530 
you're going to take your for to lie two
plates<00:03:45.150> i<00:03:45.450> have<00:03:46.110> no<00:03:46.320> studs<00:03:47.360> then<00:03:48.360> we'll<00:03:48.510> just

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
plates i have no studs then we'll just

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:57.410 
plates i have no studs then we'll just
pop<00:03:49.020> it<00:03:49.170> onto<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.470> corners

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
then sit at any we like but not just

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.340 
then sit at any we like but not just
straightly<00:04:26.740> vertical<00:04:27.750> I'll<00:04:28.750> put<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.110> like

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
straightly vertical I'll put it like

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.900 
straightly vertical I'll put it like
this<00:04:31.169> just<00:04:32.169> like<00:04:32.320> that<00:04:32.530> looks<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.550> best<00:04:33.729> from

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
this just like that looks the best from

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.400 
this just like that looks the best from
there<00:04:34.200> take<00:04:35.200> my<00:04:35.410> take<00:04:35.620> your<00:04:35.770> plane<00:04:36.240> and<00:04:37.410> Gwen

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
there take my take your plane and Gwen

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:45.480 
there take my take your plane and Gwen
done<00:04:39.250> now<00:04:39.639> just<00:04:39.820> count<00:04:40.120> 2<00:04:41.110> by<00:04:41.290> 2<00:04:42.479> 1<00:04:43.479> and<00:04:43.889> 2<00:04:44.889> then

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
done now just count 2 by 2 1 and 2 then

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.100 
done now just count 2 by 2 1 and 2 then
just<00:04:45.729> want<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:45.970> pop<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.419> on<00:04:46.540> there<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:48.900> can<00:04:49.900> get

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
just want to pop it on there I can get

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.879 
just want to pop it on there I can get
on<00:04:50.820> just<00:04:51.820> like<00:04:52.000> that's<00:04:55.410> now<00:04:56.410> going<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:56.740> move<00:04:56.770> a

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
on just like that's now going to move a

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.750 
on just like that's now going to move a
victim<00:04:58.020> just<00:04:59.020> just<00:04:59.830> pop<00:05:00.100> it<00:05:00.220> on<00:05:00.340> right<00:05:00.550> there

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
victim just just pop it on right there

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.120 
victim just just pop it on right there
because<00:05:01.300> it's<00:05:01.600> physics<00:05:02.500> better<00:05:02.800> from<00:05:03.010> there

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
because it's physics better from there

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.800 
because it's physics better from there
and<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:04.210> plus<00:05:04.419> it's<00:05:04.630> more<00:05:04.840> balanced<00:05:06.810> there

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
and the plus it's more balanced there

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.380 
and the plus it's more balanced there

Maine as I goes with the stands and plus
plus<00:05:16.090> at<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.450> angle<00:05:16.660> like<00:05:16.750> that<00:05:16.960> because<00:05:17.140> I'm

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
plus at the angle like that because I'm

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.600 
plus at the angle like that because I'm
going<00:05:17.440> to<00:05:17.560> take<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:17.800> off<00:05:17.950> so<00:05:18.130> awesome<00:05:18.570> or<00:05:19.570> just
