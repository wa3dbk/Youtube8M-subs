00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
and you think at all I mean can you even

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.550 
and you think at all I mean can you even
think<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.179> far<00:01:17.330> ahead<00:01:17.539> about<00:01:18.080> what<00:01:18.350> it<00:01:18.439> would

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
think that far ahead about what it would

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.550 
think that far ahead about what it would
mean<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.830> you<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.399> be<00:01:19.780> potentially<00:01:20.780> involved

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
mean to you to be potentially involved

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.520 
mean to you to be potentially involved
in<00:01:21.799> that<00:01:21.950> um<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:22.970> just<00:01:23.000> think<00:01:23.420> if<00:01:24.110> it<00:01:24.259> were<00:01:24.409> to

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
in that um I just think if it were to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.430 
in that um I just think if it were to
happen<00:01:24.590> that<00:01:25.069> would<00:01:25.130> be<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.310> tremendous

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
happen that would be a tremendous

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.399 
happen that would be a tremendous
opportunity<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:28.069> would<00:01:28.159> be<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.280> lot<00:01:28.490> of<00:01:28.520> fun<00:01:29.409> but

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
opportunity it would be a lot of fun but

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.990 
opportunity it would be a lot of fun but
it's<00:01:30.560> we're<00:01:30.679> pretty<00:01:30.830> far<00:01:31.039> off<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:31.580> we're<00:01:31.850> not

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
it's we're pretty far off so we're not

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.910 
it's we're pretty far off so we're not
thinking<00:01:32.179> too<00:01:32.299> much<00:01:32.450> about<00:01:32.899> it<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.440> it's<00:01:33.740> one

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
thinking too much about it and it's one

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.010 
thinking too much about it and it's one
of<00:01:33.979> those<00:01:34.069> things<00:01:34.159> where<00:01:34.429> you<00:01:35.090> know<00:01:35.119> it's<00:01:35.810> nice

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
of those things where you know it's nice

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.690 
of those things where you know it's nice
to<00:01:36.170> have<00:01:36.319> but<00:01:36.619> it's<00:01:36.679> you<00:01:37.159> know<00:01:37.280> it's<00:01:37.310> not<00:01:37.549> what

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
to have but it's you know it's not what

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.130 
to have but it's you know it's not what
we<00:01:37.759> step<00:01:38.119> on<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.330> court<00:01:38.509> for<00:01:38.600> every<00:01:38.959> single

we step on the court for every single
day<00:01:39.380> I'm<00:01:40.009> thinking<00:01:40.490> about<00:01:40.549> trying<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:40.970> make
