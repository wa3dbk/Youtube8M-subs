see<00:00:20.369> I'm<00:00:20.460> just<00:00:20.670> creating<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.090> crisscross<00:00:21.630> find

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
see I'm just creating a crisscross find

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.009 
see I'm just creating a crisscross find
my<00:00:22.560> nails<00:00:22.769> by<00:00:23.760> creating<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.210> line<00:00:24.390> down<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.900> a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
my nails by creating a line down and a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.779 
my nails by creating a line down and a
line<00:00:25.230> across<00:00:25.470> I'm<00:00:26.070> not<00:00:26.250> too<00:00:26.430> worried<00:00:26.730> about

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
line across I'm not too worried about

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.609 
line across I'm not too worried about
how<00:00:27.060> perfectly<00:00:27.539> shaped<00:00:27.869> those<00:00:28.109> lines<00:00:28.380> are

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
how perfectly shaped those lines are

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.650 
how perfectly shaped those lines are
because<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.429> will<00:00:29.699> get<00:00:29.820> tidied<00:00:30.090> up<00:00:30.330> at<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
because that will get tidied up at the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.049 
because that will get tidied up at the
end<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.199> also<00:00:31.500> wanted<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.009> show<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.969> you

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
end I also wanted to show you that you

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.090 
end I also wanted to show you that you
can<00:00:33.239> stagger<00:00:33.630> those<00:00:33.960> lines<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.829> give<00:00:35.010> it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
can stagger those lines just to give it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.729 
can stagger those lines just to give it
a<00:00:35.160> little<00:00:35.280> bit<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.640> different<00:00:36.000> look<00:00:36.739> then

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
a little bit of a different look then

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.830 
a little bit of a different look then
fill<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.160> each<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> colors<00:00:38.730> at<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> tip<00:00:39.719> of

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
fill in each of the colors at the tip of

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.229 
fill in each of the colors at the tip of
my<00:00:39.870> nail<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.469> use<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.739> regular<00:00:41.160> brush<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
my nail I just use the regular brush and

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.380 
my nail I just use the regular brush and
I<00:00:42.840> don't<00:00:43.110> worry<00:00:43.290> too<00:00:43.350> much<00:00:43.530> if<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.550> cover<00:00:45.030> over

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
I don't worry too much if I cover over

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.180 
I don't worry too much if I cover over
that<00:00:45.539> white<00:00:45.719> line<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.230> also<00:00:46.469> don't<00:00:46.770> worry<00:00:46.950> too

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that white line I also don't worry too

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.830 
that white line I also don't worry too
much<00:00:47.219> but<00:00:47.579> should<00:00:47.789> leave<00:00:48.030> some<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.539> white

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
much but should leave some of that white

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.709 
much but should leave some of that white
line<00:00:49.079> showing<00:00:49.760> for<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> areas<00:00:51.239> near<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.480> base

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
line showing for the areas near the base

line showing for the areas near the base
of<00:00:51.930> my<00:00:52.050> nail<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> prefer<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.890> use<00:00:53.100> at<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> Nerf

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
of my nail I prefer to use at the Nerf

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.479 
of my nail I prefer to use at the Nerf
brush<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.420> there's<00:00:54.629> less<00:00:54.809> cleanup<00:00:55.489> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
brush just so there's less cleanup and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you'll see here those white lines need

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.029 
you'll see here those white lines need
some<00:00:58.109> work<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.440> we'll<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.890> near<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.129> end

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
some work but we'll do that near the end

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.410 
some work but we'll do that near the end
