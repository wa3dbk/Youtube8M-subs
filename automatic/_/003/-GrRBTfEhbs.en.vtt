00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:15.019
 dear here last night I sprinkled 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:15.019
 ground skin from tangerines oranges 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.230
 on ant 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:33.290
 but in the evening I did not check here I got up in the morning 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:39.110
 there are no ants 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:45.710
 the further point is that when we are with this 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.719
 ordinary millet then ants take it away and 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.300
 takes and themselves 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.829
 leaves but then after a while but 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:01.079
 maybe in a month comes back a 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:05.540
 here ground pretty so there 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.240
 there are big parts of these skins 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.110
 they did n't even touch where you were 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.110
 shorter look 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:24.850
 It was a little higher 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:31.500
 birch log she is already here well 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.500
 say lie long well it was 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.550
 fencing 2 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:55.120
 plots well, as you understand what you see 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:59.730
 here we will continue well there will be no ants 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:03.960
 still watch and so keep in mind that 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:07.750
 Here are the usual such skins 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:13.090
 maybe they are dry not much 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:18.370
 exude a smell here and somewhere under a well 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:22.300
 some kind of furtive swell 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.860
 gets wet and it turns out that the ant 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.860
 don't like it
