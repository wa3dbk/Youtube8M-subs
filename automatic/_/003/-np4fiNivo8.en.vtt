00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.820 

let<00:00:01.800> us<00:00:01.920> do<00:00:02.100> problem<00:00:02.460> number<00:00:02.490> one<00:00:03.230> so<00:00:04.230> here<00:00:04.529> we

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
let us do problem number one so here we

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.320 
let us do problem number one so here we
are<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:05.130> find<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.759> value<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.830> 3<00:00:07.830> 2

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
are to find the value of a 3 2

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.650 
are to find the value of a 3 2
multiplied<00:00:09.330> by<00:00:09.360> capital<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:10.139> 3<00:00:10.410> 2<00:00:11.330> we<00:00:12.330> know<00:00:12.480> that

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
multiplied by capital a 3 2 we know that

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.709 
multiplied by capital a 3 2 we know that
the<00:00:13.500> capital<00:00:13.980> AAA<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.910> cofactor<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
the capital AAA is the cofactor of the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.040 
the capital AAA is the cofactor of the
element<00:00:16.080> AJ<00:00:17.570> so<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:19.650> cofactor<00:00:20.480> capital<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.630> AJ

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
element AJ so the cofactor capital a AJ

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.220 
element AJ so the cofactor capital a AJ
of<00:00:22.439> an<00:00:23.010> element<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.760> given<00:00:23.970> by<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.300> formula<00:00:25.849> -1

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
of an element is given by the formula -1

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.010 
of an element is given by the formula -1
power<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.529> plus<00:00:28.619> J<00:00:29.840> multiplied<00:00:30.840> by<00:00:32.480> capital<00:00:33.480> M

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
power I plus J multiplied by capital M

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.549 
power I plus J multiplied by capital M
of<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.410> J<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.360> capital<00:00:36.360> M<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.719> nothing<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
of I J a capital M is nothing but the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.799 
of I J a capital M is nothing but the
minor<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.910> J<00:00:39.800> therefore<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:42.110> of<00:00:43.110> 3<00:00:43.710> 2<00:00:44.360> is<00:00:45.360> equal

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
minor of I J therefore a of 3 2 is equal

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.200 
minor of I J therefore a of 3 2 is equal
to<00:00:46.190> minus<00:00:47.190> 1<00:00:47.550> or<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.570> plus<00:00:48.930> J<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.980> 3<00:00:50.550> J<00:00:51.059> is

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
to minus 1 or I plus J here I is 3 J is

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.389 
to minus 1 or I plus J here I is 3 J is
2<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.379> get<00:00:52.559> -1<00:00:53.160> power<00:00:53.730> 3<00:00:54.510> plus<00:00:54.750> 2<00:00:55.399> multiplied

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
2 so we get -1 power 3 plus 2 multiplied

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.540 
2 so we get -1 power 3 plus 2 multiplied
by<00:00:56.809> minor<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.109> Pi<00:00:58.320> J<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.829> minor<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.820> M<00:01:00.449> 3<00:01:01.140> 2

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
by minor of Pi J that is minor of M 3 2

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.850 
by minor of Pi J that is minor of M 3 2
that<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.670> equal<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.739> -1<00:01:04.739> power<00:01:05.519> 5<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.500> minor<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that is equal to -1 power 5 and minor of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.109 
that is equal to -1 power 5 and minor of
an<00:01:08.130> element<00:01:08.960> minor<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.170> 3<00:01:10.470> 2<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.040> nothing<00:01:11.610> but

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.640 

you<00:01:15.500> remove<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> second<00:01:17.420> column<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.659> third

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
you remove the second column and third

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.570 
you remove the second column and third
row<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.400> m32<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.150> third<00:01:22.080> row<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.710> second

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
row or m32 is third row and second

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.570 
row or m32 is third row and second
column<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> minor<00:01:25.560> happens<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> be

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
column so we get the minor happens to be

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.560 
column so we get the minor happens to be
2<00:01:27.860> 5<00:01:29.000> 6<00:01:30.079> 4<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.799> minor<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.299> minor

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
2 5 6 4 that is the minor so the minor

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.499 
2 5 6 4 that is the minor so the minor
of<00:01:33.840> minor<00:01:34.470> M<00:01:34.710> 3<00:01:34.979> 2<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.310> nothing<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
of minor M 3 2 is nothing but the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.440 
of minor M 3 2 is nothing but the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
determinant of 2 5 6 that is equal to so

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.210 
determinant of 2 5 6 that is equal to so
the<00:01:42.540> value<00:01:42.810> happens<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:43.920> equal<00:01:44.189> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the value happens in that is equal to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.319 
the value happens in that is equal to
minus<00:01:44.880> 1<00:01:45.530> determine<00:01:46.530> values<00:01:46.770> 8-30<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:48.240> is

minus 1 determine values 8-30 there is

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.889 
minus 1 determine values 8-30 there is
minus<00:01:48.659> 22<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.159> value<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.670> cofactor<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.540> 3

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
minus 22 then the value of cofactor a 3

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.819 
minus 22 then the value of cofactor a 3
2<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.290> equal<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.070> 22<00:01:54.259> so<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.470> found<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
2 is equal to 22 so we have found the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.270 
2 is equal to 22 so we have found the
world<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.310> 3<00:01:56.670> 2<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.119> obviously<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.799> small<00:01:59.070> a

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
second column element is 5 so a 3 2 is 4

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.130 
second column element is 5 so a 3 2 is 4
and<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.340> cost<00:02:13.549> after<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:14.030> f32<00:02:14.599> we<00:02:14.810> have<00:02:14.900> found

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
and the cost after a f32 we have found

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.319 
and the cost after a f32 we have found
the<00:02:15.290> value<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.650> be<00:02:15.739> 22<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:16.970> when<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.209> multiply

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
the value to be 22 so when you multiply

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.780 
the value to be 22 so when you multiply
these<00:02:17.659> two<00:02:18.019> you<00:02:18.470> get<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.799> hundred<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.129> ten<00:02:19.280> that

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
these two you get a hundred and ten that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.089 
these two you get a hundred and ten that
is<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.150> value<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:22.159> product<00:02:23.890> now<00:02:24.890> let<00:02:25.069> us

with this young so we to get the
differential<00:02:50.060> equation<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:51.010> there<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.099> only

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
differential equation and there is only

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.399 
differential equation and there is only
one<00:02:52.370> orbit<00:02:52.940> rate<00:02:53.090> constant<00:02:53.540> we<00:02:54.200> are<00:02:54.290> to

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
one orbit rate constant we are to

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.530 
one orbit rate constant we are to
differentiate<00:02:54.889> the<00:02:55.340> function<00:02:55.549> with<00:02:56.150> respect

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
differentiate the function with respect

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.869 
differentiate the function with respect
to<00:02:56.599> X<00:02:56.750> money<00:02:57.019> wants

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
to X money wants

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.410 
to X money wants
therefore<00:02:59.470> differentiate<00:03:00.670> Y<00:03:01.670> with<00:03:02.030> respect

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
therefore differentiate Y with respect

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.390 
therefore differentiate Y with respect
to<00:03:02.480> X<00:03:02.629> we<00:03:02.750> get<00:03:02.840> dy<00:03:03.170> by<00:03:03.349> DX<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:04.010> equal<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.370> M<00:03:04.940> and

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
to X we get dy by DX is equal to M and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.569 
to X we get dy by DX is equal to M and
here<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:07.760> have<00:03:07.879> to<00:03:08.000> eliminate<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:09.579> arbitrary

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579

MX M is equal to Y by X and substitute

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.520 
MX M is equal to Y by X and substitute
this<00:03:20.540> value<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:21.010> M<00:03:22.209> in<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.530> differential

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
this value of M in the differential

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.430 
this value of M in the differential
equation<00:03:24.620> we<00:03:25.400> get<00:03:25.579> therefore<00:03:25.849> we<00:03:26.060> get<00:03:26.209> dy<00:03:26.959> by

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
equation we get therefore we get dy by

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.360

change of total revenue therefore to get
the<00:04:56.480> marginal<00:04:56.960> revenue<00:04:57.850> we<00:04:58.850> have<00:04:58.880> to

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
the marginal revenue we have to

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.350 
the marginal revenue we have to
differentiate<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:01.460> total<00:05:01.820> revenue<00:05:02.120> function

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
differentiate the total revenue function

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.230 
differentiate the total revenue function
with<00:05:02.750> respect<00:05:03.140> to<00:05:03.200> X<00:05:03.410> obviously<00:05:04.400> rate<00:05:05.000> of

with respect to X obviously rate of

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.940 
with respect to X obviously rate of
change<00:05:05.540> it<00:05:05.630> already<00:05:05.780> means<00:05:06.080> is<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.440> first

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
change it already means is the first

change it already means is the first
order<00:05:07.130> derivative<00:05:08.230> so<00:05:09.230> marginal<00:05:09.950> revenue<00:05:10.400> is

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
order derivative so marginal revenue is

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.070 
order derivative so marginal revenue is
equal<00:05:10.670> to<00:05:12.490> differentiate<00:05:13.490> our<00:05:14.480> FX<00:05:14.990> with

equal to differentiate our FX with

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.310 
equal to differentiate our FX with
respect<00:05:15.140> to<00:05:15.500> X<00:05:15.650> that<00:05:15.740> VR<00:05:16.370> of<00:05:16.550> X<00:05:16.730> by<00:05:16.910> DX<00:05:17.090> that<00:05:17.570> is

respect to X that VR of X by DX that is
equal<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:19.630> 6x<00:05:20.630> plus<00:05:21.140> 36<00:05:22.510> now<00:05:23.710> we<00:05:24.710> have<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:24.950> find

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
equal to 6x plus 36 now we have to find

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.420 
equal to 6x plus 36 now we have to find
the<00:05:25.370> marginal<00:05:25.580> revenue<00:05:25.910> when<00:05:26.210> X<00:05:26.360> equal<00:05:26.660> to<00:05:26.780> 5

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
the marginal revenue when X equal to 5

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.600 
the marginal revenue when X equal to 5
so<00:05:28.430> in<00:05:29.120> this<00:05:30.070> derivative<00:05:31.990> at<00:05:32.990> X<00:05:33.350> equal<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.830> 5<00:05:34.070> we

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
so in this derivative at X equal to 5 we

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.670 
so in this derivative at X equal to 5 we
get<00:05:34.760> 6<00:05:35.660> times<00:05:36.020> 5<00:05:36.440> plus<00:05:37.070> 36<00:05:37.610> that<00:05:37.970> is<00:05:38.120> equal<00:05:38.390> to

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
get 6 times 5 plus 36 that is equal to

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.040 
get 6 times 5 plus 36 that is equal to
66<00:05:39.680> is<00:05:39.919> the<00:05:40.190> correct<00:05:40.880> answer<00:05:41.030> for<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.780> given

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
66 is the correct answer for the given
