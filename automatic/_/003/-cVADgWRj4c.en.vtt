00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
transition from the trunk to the side of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.100 
transition from the trunk to the side of
the<00:01:04.559> body<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.460> starts<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.119> warp<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.689> distort

the body it starts to warp and distort

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
the body it starts to warp and distort
and<00:01:07.320> refract<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:08.820> interesting

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and refract you get really interesting

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
and refract you get really interesting
images<00:01:09.659> these<00:01:10.470> images<00:01:10.530> are<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.250> powerful

images these images are so powerful

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.700 
images these images are so powerful
they're<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.479> abstract<00:01:13.170> they're<00:01:13.470> they're

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
they're so abstract they're they're

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.700 
they're so abstract they're they're
works<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.130> art<00:01:14.340> they<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:14.939> beyond<00:01:15.299> just
