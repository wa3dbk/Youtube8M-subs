00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510
 and studies on the web 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.070
 all 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.160
 pass 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.700
 where is I do not know anything 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.700
 you 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.700
 you are 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.540
 before 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.440
 I am now 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.900
 deser 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.720
 yes 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.090
 no no 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.390
 do not 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.460
 good 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.100
 very well with which this part ended 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.540
 of training 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.790
 and if it has become stronger 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.550
 really 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.550
 but good is still garbage 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:03.170
 ok let's say now you're not garbage so 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.170
 you are only but yes 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.930
 then you hear that lift the stones 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.780
 we are 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.680
 what 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.540
 it's fine I think now I'll teach you to 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.020
 move on the branches of the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.200
 trees 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:43.320
 if it is and well follows then with the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.320
 boy do not go to the forbidden forest 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.160
 do you mean that forest 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.280
 just follow me 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.150
 well this later makes for the trees 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.140
 the truth I do not know what the fuck is for 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:05.660
 but it's been like that to see to start 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.660
 how would you climb the branch of that tree 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.159
 well it would be something more or less so do not be 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.159
 click so little 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.480
 to egg but to make you laugh 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:30.620
 I'll show you how it's done and boy careful 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:36.099
 you're just a decrepit old man there 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.099
 and that's great 36 I'll try 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.730
 more shit 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.850
 and good 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.760
 very well 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.760
 now lets stand out and decent 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.280
 I'll try 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.870
 if it has been the word dine until a 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.709
 egg and they were aboriginal troglodyte 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.759
 illiterate 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.600
 so why it was not for axis is that 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.600
 a landing gear failed me 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.700
 and well what do you expect try again and 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.700
 this time he tries to stop 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.479
 because death does not put me 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.479
 200 I'm just a decrepit old man 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.190
 or not 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.560
 shit shit shit shit but 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:06.990
 it was the prince more this time 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:06.990
 with this the brake does not stop 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:23.810
 I did it but I did not succeed 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:28.230
 there or in the tsjm you do not achieve back 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.620
 the normal ones you did summer 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.620
 big 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.850
 you have to accept that if you hear a lot 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.850
 best
