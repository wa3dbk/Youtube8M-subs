00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.210
 Speak, people, beauty today. We will. 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.990
 learn how to tune the bass 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.269
 You're starting is an instrument. 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.610
 then the new one that is the low one goes only 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.640
 now and has not yet 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.630
 tune his instrument bass 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.600
 four strings 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.640
 I have here a boat of four 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.160
 gene strings 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.199
 we are going to learn the basic way of 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.929
 tune the double bass 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.370
 already purposely out of tune for 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:40.469
 we have a concept to pass to you 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.350
 here more or less ok beauty 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.770
 When you're going to play somewhere, it's 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.579
 at 1 and 6 in any group 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:56.100
 it is interesting that you do not even 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:02.370
 fast tuning you are the end or the last 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:05.159
 rope or by the first rope you 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.299
 tuning the first one you will fine tune the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.180
 others also 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.170
 or you tuning the last one you too 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.710
 will fine-tune the other three 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.240
 because as you see the 1st to do if 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.490
 can a guitarist come because he is a 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.100
 guitarist he usually has a 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.340
 pedalboard there on the pedalboard already has a 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.670
 system says one end of the electronic 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.470
 The guitarist can 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.450
 for you, after all, these strings 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.009
 if it was in quick action you can 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.869
 sink your first end the others only 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.030
 so if it's quiet you can sink 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.950
 4 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.570
 right or on the keyboard 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.140
 You can, after all, the first or last 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.110
 final another certain but how are we? 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.680
 This first one is tuned I already gave 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.780
 this first tuned string 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:02:02.470
 you have a first notion rope 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:07.030
 the name of the string is only the second defendant to 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:10.209
 third there and the last me sure we 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.130
 we are waiting for a sun tuned in this 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.709
 rope is only tuned 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.430
 but the others I challenged 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.590
 purposefully certain that the rope only 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.590
 tuned 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:31.390
 Now I go there for the seventh house flight. 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 offers a house here at the headquarters of 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.450
 first string only for your note is a is 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.140
 just the name of the second string 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.580
 so this is the first rope in the house 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.370
 7 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.150
 this ahave to look like a let 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:53.260
 Just like that, it's like waking up. 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.290
 ok let's try 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.290
 1 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.280
 it's all burnt once 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.690
 the most notorious been already ok tuned 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.580
 wake up by the rope 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.780
 the first sun rope now there and they inhabit 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.600
 out of tune 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.410
 the first one I saw nothing the second one too 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.960
 It's already there but it's not tuned there. Let 's go. 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.640
 to refine it by the same scheme 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.000
 was made on the first rope 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:52.190
 now you will be in the second the same 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.340
 house 7 not of that note she does not you have 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.570
 that to leave the note to the rope there is similar 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.080
 with that note 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.080
 there too 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.100
 well, then 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.580
 1 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:34.400
 but I look like that right now 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.150
 ok the three am the fan tuned missed vision 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.010
 huh 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:47.950
 a name is already almost fine tuned already 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:47.950
 Let's check 2011 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:03.670
 Hmm 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:03.670
 with 11 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.960
 Ok it got a little more similar 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:17.850
 let's see the four notes four strings 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:19.890
 the people who are already can hear 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.900
 experienced the sound of blessing ever met 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:26.520
 ropes then automatically when 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:29.840
 beat the four strings she will know 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.840
 that will last the 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:42.880
 the time you can take this technique 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.390
 also a person to perfect his or her 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.570
 ear will decrease the sound of four 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.570
 ropes 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:55.410
 ok sure that we start technique 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.890
 technique but started on rope 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:02.820
 the first rope now has the other rope that is 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:05.100
 holier the last rope my rope 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.860
 here we will no longer use the 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.940
 seventh house we are going to launch the fifth 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.440
 house a little easier here have the 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:18.230
 rope my 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.230
 I'm going to vote for the fifth of my rope. 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.150
 on that note there then I have to see if 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.510
 la tercera wake rope has to be 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.340
 according to Juan, remembering that you 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:33.700
 after all this here already has to be 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.700
 tuned and the other two days ram 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:43.870
 that already gave what it had down 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:47.490
 Got it here with 11 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.490
 in a corner near the rope 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:09.979
 to glue the sun of 111 thousand 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.310
 I know you only do 1 of these 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:15.199
 techniques begin to apply from below to 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.419
 up and from top to bottom because 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:20.389
 I do not usually know what it's like to be a business. 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:23.599
 up goes to the final and when it comes down 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:26.150
 here the arm is different from the arm 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:28.280
 which is already a bit different will change a 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:33.729
 little tuning you do the right shape 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.729
 or commotion from the pulou of s√£o paulo
