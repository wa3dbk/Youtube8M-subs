I would probably recommend wiping cache
and<00:04:29.620> dalvik<00:04:29.800> cache<00:04:30.189> just<00:04:30.249> checking<00:04:30.939> that<00:04:31.030> box

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
and dalvik cache just checking that box

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.839 
and dalvik cache just checking that box
before<00:04:31.810> you<00:04:31.900> do<00:04:32.050> this<00:04:32.229> I<00:04:32.499> know<00:04:33.159> I<00:04:33.280> didn't<00:04:33.699> the

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
before you do this I know I didn't the

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.550 
before you do this I know I didn't the
reason<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.300> didn't<00:04:34.659> is<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:34.930> didn't<00:04:35.289> know<00:04:35.319> if<00:04:35.439> this

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
reason I didn't is I didn't know if this

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.399 
reason I didn't is I didn't know if this
group<00:04:35.860> did<00:04:36.009> it<00:04:36.189> for<00:04:36.639> you<00:04:36.819> but<00:04:37.139> when<00:04:38.139> it<00:04:38.169> wipes

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
group did it for you but when it wipes

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.450 
group did it for you but when it wipes
dalvik<00:04:38.770> cache<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.189> Budo<00:04:39.490> takes<00:04:39.759> a<00:04:39.909> longer<00:04:40.389> so

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
dalvik cache the Budo takes a longer so

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.369 
dalvik cache the Budo takes a longer so
just<00:04:42.460> kind<00:04:42.639> of<00:04:42.699> didn't<00:04:43.060> for<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.389> guys<00:04:43.599> but

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.379 
just kind of didn't for you guys but

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.290 
just kind of didn't for you guys but
it's<00:04:44.919> up<00:04:45.009> to<00:04:45.159> you<00:04:45.219> if<00:04:45.340> you<00:04:45.370> want<00:04:45.639> to<00:04:45.729> decide<00:04:46.029> to

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
it's up to you if you want to decide to

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:53.999 
it's up to you if you want to decide to
wipe<00:04:46.449> cache<00:04:46.719> or<00:04:47.020> or<00:04:47.349> not<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:52.469> there<00:04:53.469> you<00:04:53.590> go<00:04:53.770> as

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
wipe cache or or not and there you go as

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.619 
wipe cache or or not and there you go as
you<00:04:54.039> can<00:04:54.219> see<00:04:54.610> my<00:04:54.849> font<00:04:55.210> is<00:04:55.569> much<00:04:56.469> different<00:04:56.919> a

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:57.629 
you can see my font is much different a

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:02.100 
you can see my font is much different a
lot<00:04:58.629> thinner<00:04:58.990> and<00:05:00.569> it<00:05:01.569> just<00:05:01.779> looks<00:05:01.960> different

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
lot thinner and it just looks different

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.519 
lot thinner and it just looks different
I'll<00:05:02.379> go<00:05:02.500> ahead<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:02.740> go<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:02.949> market<00:05:03.310> again

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:04.529 
I'll go ahead and go to the market again

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.189 
I'll go ahead and go to the market again
even<00:05:05.529> the<00:05:05.620> loading<00:05:05.949> is<00:05:06.240> different<00:05:07.240> all<00:05:07.960> the

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
even the loading is different all the

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.070 
even the loading is different all the
fonts<00:05:08.529> are<00:05:08.680> just<00:05:08.860> different<00:05:09.539> so<00:05:10.539> that<00:05:10.930> would

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
fonts are just different so that would

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.939 
fonts are just different so that would
be<00:05:11.259> changing<00:05:11.860> your<00:05:12.129> system<00:05:12.759> font<00:05:13.800> go<00:05:14.800> ahead

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
be changing your system font go ahead

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.619 
be changing your system font go ahead
and<00:05:15.039> go<00:05:15.129> to<00:05:15.159> this<00:05:15.310> menu<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:15.879> it's<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.150> good

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:16.629 
and go to this menu and it's a good

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.399 
and go to this menu and it's a good
preview<00:05:17.169> of<00:05:17.409> the<00:05:17.620> fonts<00:05:18.069> right<00:05:18.490> there<00:05:19.139> so<00:05:20.139> as

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:20.409 
preview of the fonts right there so as

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:22.439 
preview of the fonts right there so as
you<00:05:20.560> can<00:05:20.650> see<00:05:20.710> that<00:05:21.310> would<00:05:21.460> be<00:05:21.610> two<00:05:21.849> ways<00:05:22.060> you

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
you can see that would be two ways you

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.929 
you can see that would be two ways you
can<00:05:22.689> change<00:05:22.719> your<00:05:23.469> system<00:05:24.189> font<00:05:24.520> on<00:05:24.909> your
