world and a question that comes up so

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.640 
world and a question that comes up so
often<00:00:18.550> is<00:00:18.940> Diane<00:00:19.900> what's<00:00:20.140> the<00:00:20.290> difference

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
often is Diane what's the difference

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.150 
often is Diane what's the difference
between<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.779> orchestra<00:00:23.380> model<00:00:23.770> and<00:00:23.950> the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
between the orchestra model and the

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.710 
between the orchestra model and the
triple<00:00:24.610> o<00:00:24.760> well<00:00:27.000> usually<00:00:28.000> you<00:00:28.270> hear<00:00:28.540> the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
triple o well usually you hear the

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.330 
triple o well usually you hear the
answer<00:00:29.140> and<00:00:29.290> it<00:00:29.380> kind<00:00:29.560> of<00:00:29.590> glides<00:00:29.890> over<00:00:30.220> you

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
answer and it kind of glides over you

may<00:00:30.490> not<00:00:30.669> understand<00:00:31.300> here's<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.930> the<00:00:32.290> short

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
may not understand here's the the short

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.950 
may not understand here's the the short
answer<00:00:33.160> it's<00:00:33.370> three<00:00:33.640> things<00:00:33.940> the<00:00:34.360> pickguard

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
answer it's three things the pickguard

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.270 
answer it's three things the pickguard
you'll<00:00:35.140> notice<00:00:35.470> the<00:00:35.620> pickguard<00:00:35.829> on<00:00:36.100> this

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
you'll notice the pickguard on this

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.740 
you'll notice the pickguard on this
instrument<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:37.150> what<00:00:37.390> we<00:00:37.480> call<00:00:37.660> a<00:00:37.690> teardrop

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
instrument is what we call a teardrop

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.300 
instrument is what we call a teardrop
that's<00:00:40.750> what's<00:00:40.990> on<00:00:41.110> the<00:00:41.230> orchestra<00:00:41.410> model<00:00:41.980> but

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
that's what's on the orchestra model but

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.220 
that's what's on the orchestra model but
the<00:00:42.400> orchestra<00:00:42.850> model<00:00:43.120> also<00:00:43.329> has<00:00:43.510> two<00:00:43.900> things

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
the orchestra model also has two things

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.030 
the orchestra model also has two things
a<00:00:44.940> slightly<00:00:45.940> wider<00:00:46.450> width<00:00:46.900> at<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.170> nut<00:00:47.650> this

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
a slightly wider width at the nut this

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.860 
a slightly wider width at the nut this
is<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.370> nut<00:00:48.550> of<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.700> guitar<00:00:48.790> and<00:00:49.300> what<00:00:49.750> we

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
is the nut of the guitar and what we

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.430 
is the nut of the guitar and what we
call<00:00:50.080> a<00:00:50.110> longer<00:00:50.830> scale<00:00:51.610> length<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.570> bodies<00:00:53.230> of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
call a longer scale length the bodies of

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.280 
call a longer scale length the bodies of
these<00:00:53.560> guitars<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:55.090> depth<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.750> profile

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
these guitars the depth and the profile

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.180 
these guitars the depth and the profile
are<00:00:56.530> identical<00:00:57.340> so<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:58.420> difference<00:00:58.840> is<00:00:59.190> long

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
are identical so the difference is long

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.490 
are identical so the difference is long
scale<00:01:00.700> length<00:01:01.030> versus<00:01:01.630> short<00:01:01.960> scale<00:01:02.290> length

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
scale length versus short scale length

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.289 
scale length versus short scale length
now<00:01:02.650> how<00:01:03.190> does<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.520> translate<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:04.089> the

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
now how does that translate to the

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.870 
now how does that translate to the
player<00:01:04.570> well<00:01:05.350> I<00:01:05.379> was<00:01:05.920> grateful<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.520> have<00:01:06.610> dick

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
player well I was grateful to have dick

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.030 
player well I was grateful to have dick
Boak<00:01:07.090> give<00:01:07.330> me<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:07.509> great<00:01:07.780> way<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:07.990> explain<00:01:08.830> this

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
Boak give me a great way to explain this

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.350 
Boak give me a great way to explain this
to<00:01:09.250> you<00:01:09.369> if<00:01:10.119> I<00:01:10.710> wanted<00:01:11.710> to<00:01:11.770> make<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.700> orchestra

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
to you if I wanted to make the orchestra

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.109 
to you if I wanted to make the orchestra
model<00:01:13.720> be<00:01:14.080> just<00:01:14.619> like<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.100> triple<00:01:15.400> O<00:01:15.610> in<00:01:15.820> terms

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
model be just like the triple O in terms

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.489 
model be just like the triple O in terms
of<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.630> scale<00:01:17.049> length

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
of the scale length

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:20.069 
of the scale length
I<00:01:17.619> could<00:01:18.039> put<00:01:18.249> a<00:01:18.280> capo<00:01:18.729> here<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.179> then<00:01:19.899> they

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
I could put a capo here and then they

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.440 
I could put a capo here and then they
would<00:01:20.259> be<00:01:20.409> equal<00:01:20.799> scale<00:01:21.070> lengths<00:01:21.310> however<00:01:22.240> if

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
would be equal scale lengths however if

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.139 
would be equal scale lengths however if
I<00:01:22.570> do<00:01:22.630> that<00:01:23.109> then<00:01:24.100> this<00:01:24.340> is<00:01:24.520> going<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.729> be<00:01:24.850> a

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
I do that then this is going to be a

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.389 
I do that then this is going to be a
half<00:01:25.719> a<00:01:25.810> step<00:01:26.020> higher<00:01:26.320> in<00:01:26.590> tone<00:01:26.829> so<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.189> make

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
half a step higher in tone so to make

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.760 
half a step higher in tone so to make
them<00:01:27.520> equivalent<00:01:28.420> I'd<00:01:29.049> have<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.380> tune<00:01:29.590> this

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
them equivalent I'd have to tune this

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.340 
them equivalent I'd have to tune this
down<00:01:30.100> okay<00:01:30.850> and<00:01:31.270> then<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:31.899> would<00:01:32.020> become<00:01:32.319> a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
down okay and then it would become a

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.609 
down okay and then it would become a
triple<00:01:32.770> oh<00:01:32.890> well<00:01:33.850> if<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.689> loosen<00:01:35.170> these<00:01:35.289> strings

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
triple oh well if I loosen these strings

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.020 
triple oh well if I loosen these strings
this<00:01:35.770> would<00:01:35.950> be<00:01:36.039> kind<00:01:36.249> of<00:01:36.340> loose<00:01:36.490> well<00:01:36.819> guess

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
this would be kind of loose well guess

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.260 
this would be kind of loose well guess
what<00:01:37.299> that<00:01:37.569> means<00:01:37.630> it'd<00:01:38.079> be<00:01:38.200> easy<00:01:38.409> to<00:01:38.560> bend

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
what that means it'd be easy to bend

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.410 
what that means it'd be easy to bend
that's<00:01:40.270> why<00:01:40.659> triple<00:01:41.289> O's<00:01:41.439> are<00:01:42.270> favored<00:01:43.270> by

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
that's why triple O's are favored by

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.020 
that's why triple O's are favored by
blues<00:01:43.780> players<00:01:44.259> like<00:01:44.710> Eric<00:01:45.219> Clapton<00:01:45.249> because

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
blues players like Eric Clapton because

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.660 
blues players like Eric Clapton because
you<00:01:46.149> can<00:01:46.359> bend<00:01:46.659> them<00:01:46.929> whereas<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.039> orchestra

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
you can bend them whereas the orchestra

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.359 
you can bend them whereas the orchestra
model<00:01:49.060> with<00:01:49.689> that<00:01:49.719> longer<00:01:50.499> scale<00:01:50.799> length<00:01:51.100> it's

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
model with that longer scale length it's

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.520 
model with that longer scale length it's
a<00:01:51.490> little<00:01:51.789> bit<00:01:51.939> tighter<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:52.479> louder<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:53.380> more

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
a little bit tighter and louder and more

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.010 
a little bit tighter and louder and more
