00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.480

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.550
 channel our brother andré silva 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.900
 we will be showing here how 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 show hidden folders on windows 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.640
 So let's learn how to do it now. 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.129
 no bpp vtv pains 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.160
 I'm already here on the desktop and 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.410
 To make this person to show these 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.840
 hidden folders or files're 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.420
 first let me show what they are 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.079
 I came here the sport of files in the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.770
 computer I go here on the local disk 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.809
 're seeing here O 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.930
 I'm zooming in here so you can see 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.199
 the hidden folder is like this when it gets 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.660
 transparent is different from that here 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.909
 the entire folder the document you are 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.820
 so because if these documents are 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.790
 the mention of the files is the course if 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.880
 this mode was enabled 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.220
 folders and files and would not be 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.549
 appearing so for here we see how 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.159
 do to configure is this option 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.780
