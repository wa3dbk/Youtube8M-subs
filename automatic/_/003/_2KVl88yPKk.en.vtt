00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.340
 hello everyone it's an order string and we'll do 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.199
 finally a series on honest american 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.150
 gibson lp standard 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:00.640
 that is, in fact , the standard is a kind 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.119
 really such a standard of inflamed 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.430
 sounding rumble call it somehow 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.229
 Well, there is still well know 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.259
 great perfect tool 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.560
 here is the back of the glued neck peg here 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.420
 I do not know mine were native or replaced 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.350
 on the brow but no matter here is the tool 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.680
 heavy tool is very voluminous 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.500
 velvety powerful here and 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.800
 Well, there is nothing special to say 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.200
 in my opinion even there if already there 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.960
 talk about gibson lp custom caste 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.420
 it will sound different which is why 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.520
 for those who want a lot of fat there 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.720
 izhora that's still nothing better here 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.660
 you can't think too much 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.840
 well let's listen to marshal jetem 60 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.440
 classic bunch yes there gibson and 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.440
 marshal 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.870
 and 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.850
 Yes 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.019
 Well, now let's do it naturally 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.360
 let's listen to the fraction because everything is there 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.069
 how would the gibson beauties be yes because 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.349
 that on pure sound you can play there and 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.080
 no te le castel this is stratocaster and yet 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.940
 on something to the acoustics ball 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.459
 a gypsum no other guitar in my opinion 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.060
 especially gibson lp will not sound at all 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.060
 standard 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.860
 and 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.860
 and 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.570

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.470
 they 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.360
 Well, something like that here 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.300
 stump thick stands for me but 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.130
 again I knew how to play there 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.940
 on gypsum though i honestly say 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:46.160

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.770

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.120
