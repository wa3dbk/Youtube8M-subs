00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.130
 Then I want to do a little internal introduction 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.580
 Appearance is well 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.510
 Oh ThatLookLikeThis 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.590
 top 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:21.150
 I like this inside the battery is battery-operated 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:25.410
 I thought that it was going to be that battery type, but that oneself is not to use 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:31.030
 I feel completely knowledge that I can not charge when I feel tired 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.240
 In order to hold down to this case, the device is a little ingenious 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.790
 I'll mess up the foundation 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.460
 It is this by making it dense 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.260
 I try to fit in a small case 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.570
 The internal introduction is more than this 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.680
 I would like to introduce the time-shortening amplifier in cage 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.980
 In to the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.980
 t 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.010
 8 connection method is btl connection 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.520
 So it is hard to get noise 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.960
 Well 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.900
 Because it is a guitar amplifier, it outputs 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.409
 Both input output tower is also Naa 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:12.740
 Well the front has become quite simple and roughly ThatLookLikeThis 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:16.370
 As it is power supply and battery type, it looks like this 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.530
 Even without connected nothing power is normally 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.140
 It is usable 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.640
 so 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.640
 Just call the combo 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.290
 Next I would like to connect it to the guitar and make a sound 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.290
 The 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.150
 Now I think that I want to turn on the power of the amplifier and let it flow in the station. 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.240
 goo 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.240
 N Onn 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.630
 par 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.330
 ni 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.349
