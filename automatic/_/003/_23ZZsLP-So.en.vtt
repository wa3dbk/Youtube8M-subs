00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.669
 i 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.880
 started in the year 80 my brother david and 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.900
 I went on a trip to california 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.239
 because we were very clear about what was 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.340
 our future then good friends the 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.200
 first loads of printed shirts that 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.840
 always had in our life will 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.870
 I liked the graphic design we went back 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.370
 to Spain with the idea of â€‹â€‹doing our 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.680
 collection of t-shirts printed with 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.570
 our graphics we went to talk to 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.280
 several manufacturers was it was difficult 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.110
 convince them of that factories in this 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.330
 product because you do not know the prices 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.220
 you do not know the distribution channels and 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.440
 well I guess we really paid 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.080
 many hazing what happens is that the 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.750
 project went forward and well then 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.100
 the results possibly suffered 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.590
 many many many anomalies us 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.140
 us in the 96 to usa with a way 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.270
 of 17 shirts and good with the idea 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.030
 key that we had to see that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.890
 look for us life and we were not going to sell 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.470
 door to door we did the salons of 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.640
 fashion that it was very difficult to convince the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.600
 people that to be our product 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.250
 because at that time it was the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.820
 minimalism but I had a luck of 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.310
 sell things four or five stores 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.770
 known from the angels and one of them 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.080
 coincidentally to give a store very very 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.910
 usual in hollywood stylists 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.090
 surprises everyone because they still 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.580
 we had not placed more than a thousand garments 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.180
 in the whole market what way they looked 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.009
 in television series in productions 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.280
 the important productions of 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:07.000
 hollywood la la the wheel began to spin 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.709
 and well, it's not the same when you turn 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.959
 the wheel in the USA that when it rotates in 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.980
 Spain and also when the 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.130
 american market they come to look for you 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.130
 from others from other markets 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.830
 and it is very important to have a project a 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.720
 project very clear and not discouraged not 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.820
 it's going to be easy that it's going to be very difficult 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.910
 but if you have a clear project a 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.730
 vision of a new product and is capable 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.650
 to surround yourself with a team that I think is 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.610
 important with a lot of capacity 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.930
 individual you have 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.930
 but we must get it 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.270
