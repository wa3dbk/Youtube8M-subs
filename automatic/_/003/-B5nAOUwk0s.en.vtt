00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:51.699 

all<00:02:38.790> right<00:02:38.910> here's<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.269> Douglas

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.869 

now<00:02:52.250> look<00:02:52.640> closely<00:02:52.790> now<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:54.579> think<00:02:55.579> does<00:02:55.760> this

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
now look closely now I think does this

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.819 
now look closely now I think does this
is<00:02:56.060> faster<00:02:56.480> than<00:02:56.599> Donald<00:02:57.079> I<00:02:57.260> don't<00:02:57.590> know<00:02:57.680> why

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
is faster than Donald I don't know why

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:05.530 
is faster than Donald I don't know why
right<00:02:58.159> that's<00:02:58.430> what<00:02:58.549> I<00:02:58.579> think<00:03:04.390> carry<00:03:05.390> down

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
right that's what I think carry down

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:26.860 
right that's what I think carry down
again<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.019> put<00:03:06.200> Don<00:03:06.379> back<00:03:06.680> on<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:26.629> second

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
again and put Don back on the second

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.610
