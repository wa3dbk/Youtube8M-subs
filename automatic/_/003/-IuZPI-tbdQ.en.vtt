00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.630
 hello friends welcome to a new video 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.000
 today we are in a tutorial already 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.200
 a while ago it does not bring a tutorial and well 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.360
 truth is that people follow me 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.360
 asking how he recorded the videos of 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.400
 lol lol replay and good as I 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.470
 right now not only the replay but is the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.240
 baron replace so well this is a 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.430
 small tutorial about the baron replace 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.960
 that I think is a better program for 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.380
 record since it does not generate so many errors 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.649
 that the replay and well I think it records 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.170
 a little bit more high quality good 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.449
 this can be said to be a request by 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.920
 two people who have asked me 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.050
 how I recorded my games the league of 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.640
 legends and good friends then then 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.970
 let's proceed to download it 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.579
 first is the page as such 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.710
 I will leave in the description of the video the 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.000
 link to download it is going to 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.420
 appear in Koreans almost always 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.489
 good does not charge no yes no 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.890
 in street letters in streets then 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.210
 you read in English and proceed to 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.930
 alacant download and give it here in click 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.930
 to download 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.600
 then after downloading then they 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.100
 will appear as such the program the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.080
 program will never appear in the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.700
 desktop screen unless that 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.370
 you keep it there the mortal thing that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.960
 but in this case, I have it in 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:30.390
 local disk on a local disk then 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.370
 Well, we're going to open it maybe there 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.110
 current and six 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.970
 and like in that street of some games 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.160
 saved the same can also do that 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.210
 come in another language 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.159
 It is usually Turkish 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.369
 so 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.590
 or the Spanish language and good friends here 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.549
 already in the program it is very easy to record 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.679
 this program that has very good 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.780
 options one can look at games of 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.240
 professional people if they are playing in 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.130
 that moment only going to games 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.049
 highlighted 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.820
 in highlighted games show us 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.100
 different regions different servers 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.500
 I think they are almost all missing very 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.459
 few are really among the most 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.510
 known north america europe east korea 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.510
 is Brazil and Latin America 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.060
 Oceania 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.760
 and well then let's say one wants to see 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.310
 a chord match so maybe it's 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.349
 a good player marks me among the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.750
 well-known names and good one gives you 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.129
 record this game as well as such 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.580
 here I gave him five 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:38.480
 options on each server 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.700
 then first first error first 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.400
 I think the first and only good mistake 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.950
 there are two simple errors the value of 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.310
 plays has two errors here shows us 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.069
 the duration of the game as such 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.930
 if the game takes more than 8 minutes , the 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.280
 game is not recorded and this already 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.410
 tried any number of times 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.300
 then that is not going to record game 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.920
 the game is seen later in the 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.849
 repetitions but when he does not want it 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.800
 look says the game is left to record 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.840
 because it's been a long time then 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.360
 after 8 minutes it is advisable 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.860
 do not click to record this game 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.380
 because the time is not going to record it 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.750
 really and the other problem is that in 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.870
 some regions sometimes how they are given 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.870
 account here loads our cargo to 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.120
 show the server and sometimes everything comes 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.069
 at the time of loading and it shows nothing 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.200
 so maybe it's because the server is 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.880
 the fallen or because the program in that 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.970
 moment I was not taking that server 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.950
 that is, recognizing that server is more 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.610
 that all are those those two questions 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.890
 so then to record us only 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.370
 we must know is where nothing will remain 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.470
 the games 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.450
 what he says is going to be present 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.069
 this is in place plate value 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.020
 then that we leave the program 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.840
 open and then we proceed is to play 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.190
 as such purpose to record a game 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.450
 then we go to games 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.080
 We are looking for a server 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.820
 and we look at time more than anything 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.250
 can as I say can you find 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.850
 quite famous players here are 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.100
 games from platinum to diamond 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.260
 they are very competitive games and 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.030
 since it does not happen in 8 minutes then 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.670
 the game is advisable to record it then 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.340
 then let's do as the 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.960
 the question here is seven minutes 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:33.539
 let's let's record this 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.539
 tells us to look now I'm going to tell you what 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.440
 that if by then he as such does not 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.220
 it does not open to me it does not take me to the screen 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.840
 of lol but only here is 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.940
 recording for one to look at it because it gives here 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.270
 and then as the game and less than eight 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.370
 minutes will record it then for 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.360
 Then watch the games after three 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.210
 minutes 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.980
 the game is saved can not 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.140
 rename one can erase it or not 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.190
 can look and good guys more than 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.530
 everything is that 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.970
 here also about maybe the two 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.410
 problems specifying the two 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.860
 problems that has brown replace 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:14.699
 remember that I leave the link there in 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.860
 in the description of youtube and good 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.590
 friends then without more 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.840
 I missed the rest is very easy as 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.969
 you know the program is difficult to reach 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.080
 to Spanish will arrive in another language 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.080
 they change the language here 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.700
 maybe you need an update one you 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.740
 It looks for updates but here says 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.960
 that is the newest version of the rest 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.300
 normal boys I hope there's 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.910
 liked this tutorial do not forget to leave 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.130
 its like your comments and good friends 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:49.290
 then without more eshkol says goodbye so 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.290
 see you until the next chao chao
