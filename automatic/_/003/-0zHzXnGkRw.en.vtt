got the MVP award
Kobe<00:04:55.999> if<00:04:56.270> for<00:04:56.479> adversity<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:57.319> know<00:04:57.439> could

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710

the appearing and finals

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.920 
the appearing and finals
I<00:05:02.810> think<00:05:03.499> proved<00:05:04.360> another<00:05:05.360> go<00:05:05.629> down<00:05:05.779> in

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930

Kobe<00:06:03.139> transgressed<00:06:04.139> one<00:06:04.379> of<00:06:04.500> the<00:06:04.590> things<00:06:04.830> I

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
Kobe transgressed one of the things I

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.800 
Kobe transgressed one of the things I
think<00:06:05.039> that's<00:06:05.340> really<00:06:05.669> a<00:06:05.699> mistake<00:06:05.849> colleges

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
think that's really a mistake colleges

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.350 
think that's really a mistake colleges
are<00:06:06.990> farm<00:06:07.289> system<00:06:07.740> basically

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.999 

I think<00:06:10.599> that<00:06:10.810> it's<00:06:10.960> important<00:06:11.500> that<00:06:11.530> players

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:12.009 
I think that it's important that players

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:14.249 
I think that it's important that players
go<00:06:12.699> to<00:06:12.729> that<00:06:13.060> process<00:06:13.659> to<00:06:13.810> learn<00:06:13.930> how<00:06:14.199> to

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
go to that process to learn how to

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.140 
go to that process to learn how to
succeed<00:06:14.770> in<00:06:15.009> a<00:06:15.159> peer<00:06:15.400> group<00:06:15.430> setting<00:06:16.030> that's

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
succeed in a peer group setting that's

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.300 
succeed in a peer group setting that's
mostly<00:06:16.539> their<00:06:16.750> own<00:06:16.870> age<00:06:17.229> group<00:06:17.530> but<00:06:18.189> if

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
mostly their own age group but if

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.219 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:52.469 

expected<00:06:51.219> that<00:06:51.340> he<00:06:51.430> would<00:06:51.580> become<00:06:51.909> the<00:06:51.939> number

one<00:06:52.689> American<00:06:53.229> basketball<00:06:53.830> player<00:06:53.860> I<00:06:55.650> think

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
one American basketball player I think

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.050 
one American basketball player I think
he<00:06:56.830> will<00:06:56.949> play<00:06:57.189> in<00:06:57.400> the<00:06:57.490> league<00:06:57.669> for<00:06:57.879> another

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
he will play in the league for another

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.779 
he will play in the league for another
ten<00:06:58.330> years<00:06:58.569> or<00:06:58.779> so<00:06:58.990> and<00:06:59.229> he<00:07:00.219> will<00:07:00.370> lead<00:07:00.520> the<00:07:00.669> NBA

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:00.789 
ten years or so and he will lead the NBA
