00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.539 
guys have done so well why is the show
doing<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:12.990> well<00:00:13.170> at<00:00:13.320> moment<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.769> think<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> last

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
doing so well at moment I think the last

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.090 
doing so well at moment I think the last
series<00:00:15.120> was<00:00:15.420> just<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:15.960> much<00:00:16.199> drama<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.890> I

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
series was just so much drama and I

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.620 
series was just so much drama and I
think<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:17.699> kind<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.150> brought<00:00:18.359> everything

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
think it just kind of brought everything

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.740 
think it just kind of brought everything
back<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.680> what's<00:00:19.859> how<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.070> used<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.670> be<00:00:20.760> so

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
back to what's how we used to be so

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.120 
back to what's how we used to be so
hopefully<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.170> next<00:00:22.380> series<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.650> even<00:00:22.920> better

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130
