00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.380
 very good I am the address we are going to 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.570
 tell you a little about the new 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.580
 tracing of lebrija that we inaugurate today 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.350
 in the procyclical of Andalusia and on 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.750
 an edition 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.480
 after the races that we give this year 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.700
 that was championship of spain and 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.200
 championship andalusia and talk to jose 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.530
 mari and we decided to do a remodeling 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.110
 entire circuit from the ground the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.820
 completely drawn we started with a 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.080
 project in which we believe that the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.720
 circuit had to be a little bit more 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.440
 big we have climbed the 270 meters 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.330
 that we had rope 365 more or less and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.570
 of course then the theme of the earth 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.710
 also uses a mixture 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.460
 approximately 40 percent clay 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.379
 with 60 from topsoil has 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.909
 compacted pretty well and we're 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.409
 watching the opening day of 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.680
 circuit the first characteristics 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:07.409
 that you have is a straight end in 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.000
 Carpeted do Vale that delays quite the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.980
 braking point 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.690
 we continue with an individual jump a 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.460
 double what if we had them in the jump 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.040
 old that link to the curve 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.660
 sliding and we start with the novelties 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 we started with a big leap that 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.210
 we fall to a plateau and jump 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.520
 over a second double jump to a 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.820
 girl who is a girl of three 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.580
 vertices that is contracted in its three 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.940
 vertices 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.730
 a quick descent makes a Chinese 180 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.010
 degrees against peralta 2 is an idea that 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.330
 it occurred to us to delay a bit that 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.830
 part of the circuit and that was not 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.650
 excessively fast 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.540
 that we pass to an area that is a sign and 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.390
 straight because it has a little bit towards the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.890
 right hand we make a plateau and 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.430
 a kind double jump to rotate in the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.470
 high curve is a curve that the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.720
 we had to do for the design of the 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.340
 circuit we make sure we have a good 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.630
 visibility because if it's not enough 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.490
 complicated down curve 180 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.710
 degrees we take a double pretty 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.900
 complicated because of the curve 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.270
 and we have a semi straight it also has 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.560
 a little bend left hand to 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.050
 get to the most reality zone of 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.610
 circuit is the circuit has two parts 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.930
 quite differentiated the right part 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.790
 it's a faster area the part 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.690
 left where we entered now is a 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.970
 a lot more twisty 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.170
 You see that in this part there is a 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.850
 series of 180 degree linked curves 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.560
 and the part that we want more complicated 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.970
 this area may be what we call the 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.890
 jump from the hole is a jump what 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.810
 we copied or we saw it in padua is a jump 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.580
 where and low to soon 55 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.120
 centimeters above the zero level or line 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.400
 ground 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.080
 we go up 50 centimeters and then we have 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.410
 a second crest that is like a 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.050
 metro on the line d 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.120
 of ground is not especially complicated 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.100
 get to the other side yes yes that is 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.710
 complicated to look for good traction in 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.350
 the descent we hook again with a 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.690
 another new girl another curve against 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.090
 banked and one last 180 before finish 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.580
 that has a double and a plateau is worth and 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.930
 the last 180 of straight the truth that is 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.460
 a circuit for what we have been told 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.690
 pilots has been pretty good to 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.850
 we like people are 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.650
 happy and we hope so in the future 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.510
 to be able to accept any international test 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.570
 and bring back a national and that the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.190
 people enjoy giving thanks to model and 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.870
 is to produce for the support that they have given us 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.170
 given for this test and of course to 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.900
 all the pilots who have come from 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.810
 several parts of Spain that have come to 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.130
 enjoy with us this opening 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.950
 a cool night in Seville that does not 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.530
 We expected but but happy 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.440
 count on everyone and both 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.120
 miguel zambrana as there is strength for 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.010
 his presence and by talking about this answer 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.560
 reports that help us all to 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.970
 spread this beautiful hobby without more 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.410
 dismiss many thanks here 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.410
 we wait for the breeze thank you
