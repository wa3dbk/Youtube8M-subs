here's<00:00:00.659> what<00:00:00.870> we're<00:00:00.989> layering<00:00:01.380> on<00:00:01.500> top<00:00:01.530> of<00:00:01.979> a

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
here's what we're layering on top of a

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.039 
here's what we're layering on top of a
blue<00:00:02.370> graduation<00:00:03.060> from<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.330> paint<00:00:03.540> box<00:00:03.750> and

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
blue graduation from the paint box and

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.680 
blue graduation from the paint box and
here's<00:00:04.440> what's<00:00:04.890> on<00:00:05.040> top<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.640> color<00:00:06.390> bars

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
here's what's on top of that color bars

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.930 
here's what's on top of that color bars
with<00:00:07.049> scribed<00:00:07.500> type<00:00:07.799> stick<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.490> in<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.700> ATO

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
with scribed type stick that in the ATO

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.790 
with scribed type stick that in the ATO
and<00:00:09.360> one<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.630> first<00:00:09.809> things<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.260> usually<00:00:10.410> do

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
and one of the first things I usually do

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.280 
and one of the first things I usually do
is<00:00:11.010> double<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.880> normal<00:00:12.030> perspective<00:00:12.809> from

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
is double the normal perspective from

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.310 
is double the normal perspective from
0.06<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:14.280> 0.12<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.780> looks<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.020> we're

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
0.06 to 0.12 so it looks like we're

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.429 
0.06 to 0.12 so it looks like we're
looking<00:00:16.590> at<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.830> through<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> wide<00:00:17.430> lens<00:00:18.439> this

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
looking at it through a wide lens this

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.750 
looking at it through a wide lens this
is<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> global<00:00:20.070> move<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.460> I'm<00:00:20.580> thinking

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
is the global move that I'm thinking

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.880 
is the global move that I'm thinking
about<00:00:21.000> for<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.510> demonstration<00:00:21.769> does<00:00:22.769> it

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
about for this demonstration does it

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.740 
about for this demonstration does it
look<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.130> much<00:00:23.430> right<00:00:23.460> now<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> 10

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
look like much right now it is a 10

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.500 
look like much right now it is a 10
second<00:00:25.260> move<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.800> only<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.609> camera<00:00:27.090> move

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510

only the point of reference is moving we

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.020 
only the point of reference is moving we

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
take the corresponding Matt signal from

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.600 
take the corresponding Matt signal from
the<00:00:33.180> ATO<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.809> route<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.530> through<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.950> switcher

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.690 
effects back into the a 62 key in I'll
explain<00:00:39.719> why<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.290> moment<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.430> gives

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
explain why in a moment but that gives

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.490 
explain why in a moment but that gives

more<00:03:24.000> exciting<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.570> take<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.780> paint<00:03:25.200> box<00:03:25.470> image

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
more exciting to take a paint box image

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.069 
more exciting to take a paint box image
and<00:03:26.280> add<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:26.760> as<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.030> layer<00:03:27.480> onto<00:03:27.959> our

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
and add that as a layer onto our

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.840 
and add that as a layer onto our
composite<00:03:28.650> we<00:03:29.100> have<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.340> take<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.670> matte

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
composite we have to take the matte

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.430 
composite we have to take the matte
signal<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:30.390> corresponds<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.200> same

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
signal that corresponds to the same

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.740 
signal that corresponds to the same
shape<00:03:31.799> as<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.130> irregular<00:03:32.519> cutout<00:03:32.880> story<00:03:33.600> it

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
shape as the irregular cutout story it

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.680 
shape as the irregular cutout story it
off<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.200> feed<00:03:34.829> it<00:03:34.860> into<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.489> ados<00:03:36.000> digi<00:03:36.420> matte

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
off and feed it into the ados digi matte

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.740 
off and feed it into the ados digi matte
because<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.560> way<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.160> ad<00:03:38.370> oaky<00:03:38.910> signal<00:03:39.390> then

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
because that way the ad oaky signal then

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.020 
because that way the ad oaky signal then
is<00:03:40.019> exactly<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.100> shape<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.640> irregular

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
is exactly the shape of the irregular

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.960 
is exactly the shape of the irregular
cutout<00:03:42.420> giving<00:03:42.930> us<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.140> nice<00:03:43.380> clean<00:03:43.859> key<00:03:44.459> signal

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
box cut out in the ATO as we're doing

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.349 
box cut out in the ATO as we're doing
here<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.709> can<00:03:52.859> really<00:03:53.220> see<00:03:53.430> some<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.850> NTSC

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
here you can really see some of the NTSC

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.849 
here you can really see some of the NTSC
artifacts<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.410> course<00:03:55.620> some<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.769> the

general noise that's introduced by the
ATO<00:03:57.840> itself<00:03:58.380> those<00:03:58.920> little<00:03:59.190> dots<00:03:59.459> are<00:03:59.760> the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
ATO itself those little dots are the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.660 
ATO itself those little dots are the
NTSC<00:04:00.299> artifacts<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.290> noise<00:04:01.500> well<00:04:01.890> isn't

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
NTSC artifacts and the noise well isn't

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.699 
NTSC artifacts and the noise well isn't
too<00:04:02.790> bad<00:04:02.940> this<00:04:03.180> particular<00:04:03.750> day<00:04:03.959> but<00:04:04.560> that's

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
too bad this particular day but that's

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.740 
too bad this particular day but that's
why<00:04:04.950> we<00:04:05.130> create<00:04:05.459> these<00:04:05.640> elements<00:04:06.090> as<00:04:06.209> large<00:04:06.540> as

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
why we create these elements as large as

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.210 
why we create these elements as large as
possible<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.470> when<00:04:07.650> we<00:04:07.739> stick<00:04:07.980> them<00:04:08.130> in

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
possible so that when we stick them in

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.430 
possible so that when we stick them in
the<00:04:08.310> ATO<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.790> move<00:04:08.940> them<00:04:09.150> around<00:04:09.239> we<00:04:09.870> lose<00:04:10.170> as

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
the ATO and move them around we lose as

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.009 
the ATO and move them around we lose as
little<00:04:10.680> as<00:04:10.980> possible<00:04:11.549> so<00:04:12.209> now<00:04:12.359> we've<00:04:12.570> stuck<00:04:12.840> in

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
little as possible so now we've stuck in

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.449 
little as possible so now we've stuck in
two<00:04:13.260> or<00:04:13.410> three<00:04:13.590> of<00:04:13.680> these<00:04:13.769> sevens<00:04:14.160> is<00:04:14.310> the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
two or three of these sevens is the

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.909 
two or three of these sevens is the
final<00:04:14.880> layer<00:04:15.090> on<00:04:15.420> this<00:04:15.690> big<00:04:16.140> mess<00:04:16.680> a

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
final layer on this big mess a

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.349 
final layer on this big mess a
simulation<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.910> an<00:04:18.450> actual<00:04:18.840> layered<00:04:19.320> project

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
simulation of an actual layered project

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.729 
simulation of an actual layered project
perhaps<00:04:20.659> you'd<00:04:20.810> like<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:21.049> take<00:04:21.139> a<00:04:21.199> look<00:04:21.379> now<00:04:21.439> at

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
perhaps you'd like to take a look now at

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.219 
perhaps you'd like to take a look now at
a<00:04:21.769> little<00:04:22.009> more<00:04:22.039> real-world<00:04:22.750> scenario<00:04:23.750> on<00:04:23.900> how

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
a little more real-world scenario on how

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.100 
a little more real-world scenario on how
these<00:04:24.500> layers<00:04:24.889> can<00:04:25.280> be<00:04:25.490> used<00:04:25.849> to<00:04:26.300> create<00:04:26.659> a

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
these layers can be used to create a

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.619 
these layers can be used to create a
piece<00:04:27.650> of<00:04:27.800> animation<00:04:28.090> here's<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.150> project<00:04:29.389> I

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:29.629 
piece of animation here's a project I

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.179 
piece of animation here's a project I
worked<00:04:29.659> on<00:04:29.900> last<00:04:30.169> year<00:04:30.530> I<00:04:30.680> started<00:04:31.039> with<00:04:31.159> a

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:31.189 
worked on last year I started with a

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:33.040 
worked on last year I started with a
graduation<00:04:31.759> then<00:04:32.090> created<00:04:32.449> layers<00:04:32.750> of

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
graduation then created layers of

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.379 
graduation then created layers of
texture<00:04:33.379> going<00:04:33.680> down<00:04:34.039> as<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.759> camera<00:04:35.150> rotates

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
texture going down as the camera rotates

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.629 
texture going down as the camera rotates
around<00:04:35.930> them<00:04:36.169> then<00:04:36.740> I<00:04:36.770> added<00:04:37.009> layers<00:04:37.400> of

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
around them then I added layers of

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.969 
around them then I added layers of
texture<00:04:38.030> going<00:04:38.090> up<00:04:38.659> as<00:04:39.259> the<00:04:39.439> camera<00:04:39.770> does

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
texture going up as the camera does

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.999 
texture going up as the camera does
exactly<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.759> same<00:04:40.789> thing<00:04:41.289> then<00:04:42.289> off<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:42.919> the

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
exactly the same thing then off to the

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.800 
exactly the same thing then off to the
right<00:04:43.219> I<00:04:43.400> added<00:04:43.759> these<00:04:43.849> three<00:04:44.330> lines<00:04:44.569> that

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
right I added these three lines that

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.420 
right I added these three lines that
assemble<00:04:45.319> on<00:04:45.409> the<00:04:45.439> right<00:04:45.770> side<00:04:46.069> of<00:04:46.189> the<00:04:46.310> screen

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
assemble on the right side of the screen

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.990 
assemble on the right side of the screen
just<00:04:47.240> as<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.659> global<00:04:47.810> Move<00:04:48.259> ends<00:04:48.969> then<00:04:49.969> I

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
just as the global Move ends then I

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.320 
just as the global Move ends then I
created<00:04:50.509> a<00:04:50.659> paint<00:04:51.050> box<00:04:51.349> frame<00:04:51.919> to<00:04:52.490> hold<00:04:52.729> shots

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
created a paint box frame to hold shots

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.300 
created a paint box frame to hold shots
that<00:04:53.719> I'd<00:04:53.840> pick<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.169> various<00:04:54.770> sports

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
that I'd pick the various sports

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.730 
that I'd pick the various sports
elements<00:04:56.060> in<00:04:56.180> action<00:04:56.539> and<00:04:56.719> I<00:04:57.020> added<00:04:57.199> kind<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.650> a

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
elements in action and I added kind of a

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.680 
elements in action and I added kind of a
switcher<00:04:58.250> glow<00:04:58.610> across<00:04:58.849> each<00:04:59.240> one<00:04:59.479> of<00:04:59.599> these

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
switcher glow across each one of these

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.200 
switcher glow across each one of these
as<00:04:59.900> I<00:04:59.930> laid<00:05:00.229> them<00:05:00.469> down<00:05:00.500> on<00:05:00.979> a<00:05:01.009> work<00:05:01.280> tape<00:05:01.580> these

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
as I laid them down on a work tape these

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.209 
as I laid them down on a work tape these
were<00:05:02.479> placed<00:05:02.750> into<00:05:03.020> exactly<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.620> same<00:05:03.919> global

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:04.219 
were placed into exactly the same global

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.339
