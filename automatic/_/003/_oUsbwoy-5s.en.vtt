another awesome Superman pic this is

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.619 
another awesome Superman pic this is
probably<00:00:39.780> my<00:00:40.760> predictions<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.120> one<00:00:42.360> it's

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
probably my predictions on this one it's

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.619 
probably my predictions on this one it's
going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.350> probably<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.629> quintessential

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
going to be probably the quintessential

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.959 
going to be probably the quintessential
Superman<00:00:46.530> figure<00:00:46.980> they<00:00:47.399> were<00:00:47.460> talking<00:00:47.879> about

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
Superman figure they were talking about

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.660 
Superman figure they were talking about
making<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.620> dominant<00:00:50.160> Superman

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
making like I just the dominant Superman

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.430 
making like I just the dominant Superman
figure<00:00:51.000> I'm<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> guess<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
figure I'm going to guess this is the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709 
figure I'm going to guess this is the
one<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.340> other<00:00:53.520> Superman<00:00:54.239> figure

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
one because the other Superman figure

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.650 
one because the other Superman figure
that<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.879> looks<00:00:56.879> really<00:00:57.210> good<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.449> I

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
that we have looks really good but I

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.260 
that we have looks really good but I
don't<00:00:57.870> think<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> exact<00:00:59.090> one<00:01:00.090> that

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
don't think it's the exact one that

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.939 
don't think it's the exact one that
they're<00:01:00.390> talking<00:01:00.930> about<00:01:01.020> which<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.680> will<00:01:01.829> go

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
they're talking about which we will go

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.830 
they're talking about which we will go
into<00:01:01.980> later<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:03.059> here's<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.420> picture<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
into later and then here's a picture of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.920 
into later and then here's a picture of

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
figure it's going to be a super rare the

figure it's going to be a super rare the
stats<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.259> see<00:01:43.470> there<00:01:43.740> looks<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
stats you can see there looks like it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.020 
stats you can see there looks like it
might<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.640> 10<00:01:45.149> range<00:01:45.479> or<00:01:46.220> 8<00:01:47.220> range<00:01:47.610> with<00:01:47.880> two

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
might be 10 range or 8 range with two

might be 10 range or 8 range with two
targets<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.540> can't<00:01:48.869> really<00:01:49.170> tell<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:50.159> it's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
targets I can't really tell but it's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.880 
targets I can't really tell but it's
going<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> tray<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.590> far<00:01:52.590> as<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.829> know

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
going to have a tray and far as I know

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.069 
going to have a tray and far as I know
it's<00:01:53.250> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.460> be<00:01:53.670> Quinn<00:01:54.180> testin<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.869> it's

going<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.230> have<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.880> play<00:02:38.880> them<00:02:39.120> probably<00:02:39.600> at<00:02:39.780> a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
going to have to play them probably at a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.920 
going to have to play them probably at a
full<00:02:40.110> 300<00:02:40.500> points<00:02:40.650> or<00:02:40.950> 150<00:02:41.940> but<00:02:42.690> no<00:02:42.810> matter

full 300 points or 150 but no matter

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.030 
full 300 points or 150 but no matter
where<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.230> start<00:02:43.380> you're<00:02:43.770> going<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.950> have

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
where you start you're going to have

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.540 
where you start you're going to have

kind of like this one a little bit

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.170 
kind of like this one a little bit
better<00:05:22.620> because<00:05:22.920> you<00:05:23.280> can<00:05:23.310> kind<00:05:23.850> of<00:05:23.910> get<00:05:24.060> in

going to get an object in their face
kind<00:05:31.410> of<00:05:31.470> like<00:05:31.620> this<00:05:31.830> one<00:05:32.010> a<00:05:32.040> little<00:05:32.370> bit

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
kind of like this one a little bit

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.850 
kind of like this one a little bit
better<00:05:32.820> but<00:05:33.210> both<00:05:34.080> of<00:05:34.110> them<00:05:34.380> are<00:05:34.500> kind<00:05:34.740> of

better but both of them are kind of
pretty<00:05:35.010> close
