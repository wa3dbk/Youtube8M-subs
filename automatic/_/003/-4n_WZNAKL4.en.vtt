00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:36.450
 from which the blade of the knife is made bar knife 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:41.370
 who participated in my response to 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:45.870
 competition in the ear for tests for tests 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.090
 yeast reference in the description but who in 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.170
 first time inside you came across my 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.949
 channel can see there two videos 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:59.070

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.000
 with another knife and that street 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.129
 the blade of that is even made from here because 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.070
 of this piece I told there myself from 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.960
 mining equipment 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.799
 I saw this blank in the pantry 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.700
 I saved her 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.780
 Well, I just wondered for I do not know what 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:26.400
 packaging is made of them 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.710
 I talked there with a blacksmith and here he is a river I 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.369
 recommended here what exactly to do 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.800
 the packaging of this part is not there 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.950
 explained there lived some kind of martensite 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.320
 and explained technology well here technology 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.680
 how is this this packaging is done from this 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.860
 the donut here is cut afterwards 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:57.490
 heats up spins 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.490
 spins and forges into the plate 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.460
 forged into the plate and he told me that 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.250
 harden it is not necessary 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:13.670
 that it should cool down in the air and will 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:17.240
 that's enough here in the test 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:23.660
 knife principle coped fashionable chopped 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.530

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:36.470
