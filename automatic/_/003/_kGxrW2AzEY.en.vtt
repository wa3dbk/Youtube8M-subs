like that i'll post your link on it Nick
my<00:02:12.400> channel<00:02:12.819> um<00:02:13.150> then<00:02:13.959> I<00:02:14.049> have<00:02:14.430> 66<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.640> this

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
my channel um then I have 66 on this

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.600 
my channel um then I have 66 on this
side<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.360> it's<00:02:17.140> uh<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.920> way<00:02:18.069> you<00:02:18.129> do<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.400> is

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
side and it's uh the way you do it is

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.460 
side and it's uh the way you do it is
you<00:02:18.670> went<00:02:19.510> when<00:02:19.629> you<00:02:19.660> work<00:02:19.870> on<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.080> length<00:02:20.319> you

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
you went when you work on a length you

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.289 
you went when you work on a length you
want<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.709> use<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> resistor<00:02:21.519> don't<00:02:22.180> use<00:02:22.269> a

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
want to use a resistor don't use a

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.059 
want to use a resistor don't use a
resistor<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.200> currents<00:02:23.620> will<00:02:23.709> be<00:02:23.799> too<00:02:23.950> much

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
resistor the currents will be too much

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.559 
resistor the currents will be too much
gonna<00:02:24.310> burn<00:02:24.549> it<00:02:24.700> lay<00:02:24.819> right<00:02:25.030> out<00:02:25.180> cuz<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.450> can

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
gonna burn it lay right out cuz you can

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.539 
gonna burn it lay right out cuz you can
use<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.900> much<00:02:26.049> power<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.470> off<00:02:26.560> like<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.220> little

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
use that much power it off like a little

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.949 
use that much power it off like a little
bit<00:02:27.670> keep<00:02:27.819> these<00:02:27.970> are<00:02:28.120> all<00:02:28.299> night<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.690> my

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
bit keep these are all night and my

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.530 
bit keep these are all night and my
battery<00:02:29.170> fine<00:02:29.680> because<00:02:30.040> LEDs<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.060> little<00:02:31.450> to

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
battery fine because LEDs you little to

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.170 
battery fine because LEDs you little to
none<00:02:31.720> power<00:02:31.989> no<00:02:32.260> power<00:02:32.290> oh<00:02:32.769> I<00:02:33.130> have<00:02:34.000> another

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
none power no power oh I have another

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.300 
none power no power oh I have another
six<00:02:34.420> on<00:02:34.599> this<00:02:34.750> side<00:02:37.739> that's<00:02:38.739> not<00:02:38.920> all<00:02:39.099> though

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
six on this side that's not all though

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:50.840 
six on this side that's not all though
huh<00:02:40.049> I'd<00:02:41.049> only<00:02:41.230> one

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.160

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
little different now these ones right

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.510 
little different now these ones right
here<00:03:04.190> these<00:03:05.190> ones<00:03:05.340> cuddle<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.150> cut<00:03:06.450> those

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
here these ones cuddle and I cut those

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.559 
here these ones cuddle and I cut those
those<00:03:08.520> are<00:03:08.550> signal<00:03:09.239> lights<00:03:09.420> on<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.890> I'll<00:03:11.099> have

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
those are signal lights on and I'll have

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.320 
those are signal lights on and I'll have
or<00:03:12.569> D<00:03:12.900> give<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.190> awesome<00:03:14.370> millimeter<00:03:15.030> and

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
if you can put a sub in your car you can

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.740 
if you can put a sub in your car you can
do<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:31.430> well<00:03:32.430> these<00:03:33.150> four<00:03:33.510> right<00:03:33.720> here

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
do this well these four right here

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.979 
do this well these four right here
actually<00:03:34.230> hooked<00:03:34.620> up<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.209> dish<00:03:36.540> well

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
actually hooked up to this dish well

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.590 
actually hooked up to this dish well
these<00:03:37.290> two<00:03:37.350> hooked<00:03:38.130> up<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.640> light<00:03:38.910> and

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
these two hooked up to this light and

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.780 
these two hooked up to this light and
these<00:03:39.780> two<00:03:39.989> look<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.530> life<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.459> I'm<00:03:41.610> also

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
these two look to this life and I'm also

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.809 
these two look to this life and I'm also
running<00:03:42.600> on<00:03:42.870> foot<00:03:43.110> in<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.670> try<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.700> little

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
running on foot in it try a little

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.420 
running on foot in it try a little
wiping<00:03:45.330> right<00:03:45.510> there<00:03:45.799> maybe<00:03:46.799> what<00:03:47.040> signal

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
wiping right there maybe what signal

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.860 
wiping right there maybe what signal
across<00:03:47.819> right<00:03:48.150> there<00:03:48.590> this<00:03:49.590> might<00:03:49.830> as<00:03:50.010> well<00:03:50.870> go

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
across right there this might as well go

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.009 
across right there this might as well go
by<00:03:52.019> turn<00:03:52.319> signal<00:03:52.920> across<00:03:53.660> well<00:03:54.660> yeah<00:03:54.780> that's

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
by turn signal across well yeah that's

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.720 
by turn signal across well yeah that's
basically<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:55.769> hard<00:03:55.980> updates<00:03:56.459> going<00:03:56.670> to

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
basically and it's hard updates going to

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.870 
basically and it's hard updates going to
view<00:03:56.850> another<00:03:57.030> look<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:59.340> looks<00:03:59.489> better<00:03:59.640> at

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
view another look it looks better at

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
view another look it looks better at
night<00:04:00.060> trust<00:04:00.360> me<00:04:00.769> you<00:04:01.769> can<00:04:01.890> kind<00:04:02.100> of

so<00:04:04.980> there's<00:04:05.980> a<00:04:06.040> little<00:04:06.400> LED<00:04:06.730> private<00:04:07.120> guest

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
so there's a little LED private guest

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.410 
so there's a little LED private guest
I'd<00:04:07.540> might<00:04:08.379> not<00:04:08.680> make<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:08.980> uh<00:04:09.099> I<00:04:09.579> make<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.239> video

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
I'd might not make it uh I make a video

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.580 
I'd might not make it uh I make a video
of<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.689> minute<00:04:10.930> I<00:04:11.049> might<00:04:11.260> as<00:04:11.319> well<00:04:11.349> have

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
of the minute I might as well have

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.860 
of the minute I might as well have
posted<00:04:12.040> oh<00:04:12.189> and<00:04:12.459> by<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.610> way<00:04:12.700> if<00:04:13.390> you<00:04:13.510> did<00:04:13.689> not
