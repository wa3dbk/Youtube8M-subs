00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
format dragons back in my day a 44

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.800 
format dragons back in my day a 44
flying<00:02:09.560> dragon<00:02:10.560> 46<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.790> mean<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.390> had<00:02:12.540> haste

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
flying dragon 46 I mean if you had haste

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.449 
flying dragon 46 I mean if you had haste
it<00:02:13.050> would<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.260> called<00:02:13.470> volcanic<00:02:13.950> dragon<00:02:14.340> it

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
it would be called volcanic dragon it

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.619 
it would be called volcanic dragon it
would<00:02:14.579> be<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.969> best<00:02:15.150> card<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
would be like the best card in the

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.569 
would be like the best card in the
format<00:02:16.019> you've<00:02:16.620> been<00:02:16.769> in<00:02:16.920> standard<00:02:17.400> at<00:02:17.489> the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
format you've been in standard at the

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.650 
format you've been in standard at the
time

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
time

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.199 
time
nowadays<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:20.230> seems<00:02:20.410> like<00:02:20.860> every<00:02:21.220> dragon<00:02:22.030> is

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
nowadays it seems like every dragon is

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.870 
nowadays it seems like every dragon is
some<00:02:22.540> type<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.810> bomb<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:23.740> now<00:02:24.550> when<00:02:24.760> I'm

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
some type of bomb and now when I'm

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.370 
some type of bomb and now when I'm
looking<00:02:25.240> at<00:02:25.360> all<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.690> creatures<00:02:26.140> i<00:02:26.430> see<00:02:27.430> a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
looking at all the creatures i see a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.740 
looking at all the creatures i see a
sub-theme<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.890> aggro<00:02:30.430> which<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:31.000> much<00:02:31.450> weaker

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
sub-theme of aggro which is much weaker

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.870 
sub-theme of aggro which is much weaker
than<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.350> my<00:02:32.470> opinion<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:33.010> cons<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.430> talk<00:02:33.640> here

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
than in my opinion and cons of talk here

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.449 
than in my opinion and cons of talk here
or<00:02:34.120> even<00:02:35.310> m4m<00:02:36.310> 15<00:02:37.030> no<00:02:37.209> m14<00:02:38.020> was<00:02:38.260> very<00:02:38.560> agro<00:02:39.190> like

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
or even m4m 15 no m14 was very agro like

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.720 
or even m4m 15 no m14 was very agro like
because<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.060> burn<00:02:40.270> was<00:02:40.510> good<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.890> one<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
because the burn was good this one the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.479 
because the burn was good this one the
burn<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.180> good<00:02:43.480> but<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.440> dragons<00:02:44.950> are<00:02:45.040> just<00:02:45.280> so

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
burn is good but the dragons are just so

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.130 
burn is good but the dragons are just so
huge<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.270> might<00:02:46.480> be<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.959> format<00:02:47.830> where<00:02:48.069> aggro<00:02:48.640> is

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
huge it might be a format where aggro is

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.520 
huge it might be a format where aggro is
easily<00:02:50.140> outpaced<00:02:51.040> because<00:02:51.720> if<00:02:52.720> I'm<00:02:52.930> aggro<00:02:53.380> I'm

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
easily outpaced because if I'm aggro I'm

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.580 
easily outpaced because if I'm aggro I'm
trying<00:02:53.770> to<00:02:53.860> get<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.160> some<00:02:54.400> damage<00:02:55.590> opponent

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
trying to get in some damage opponent

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.860 
trying to get in some damage opponent
playing<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:56.920> 44<00:02:57.459> dragon<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.180> really<00:02:58.600> going<00:02:58.750> to

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
playing a 44 dragon is really going to

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.140 
playing a 44 dragon is really going to
stop<00:02:59.140> me<00:02:59.170> from<00:02:59.380> attacking<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.280> then<00:03:00.850> divine

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
stop me from attacking and then divine

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.300 
stop me from attacking and then divine
somehow<00:03:01.630> remove<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.200> dragon<00:03:02.560> normally<00:03:03.160> what

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
somehow remove the dragon normally what

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.979 
somehow remove the dragon normally what
happens<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.790> if<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:03.970> can<00:03:04.150> remove<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.510> dragon<00:03:04.870> I

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
happens is if I can remove the dragon I

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.360 
happens is if I can remove the dragon I
can<00:03:05.140> win<00:03:05.380> because<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.650> can<00:03:05.830> do<00:03:06.010> enough<00:03:06.340> damage

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
can win because I can do enough damage

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.850 
can win because I can do enough damage
and<00:03:06.940> my<00:03:07.510> poet<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.930> not<00:03:08.050> going<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.290> draw<00:03:08.530> another

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
and my poet is not going to draw another

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.840 
and my poet is not going to draw another
bomb<00:03:09.360> but<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:10.720> this<00:03:11.590> format<00:03:11.980> where<00:03:12.250> every

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
bomb but in this format where every

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
bomb but in this format where every
dragon<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.930> 44<00:03:14.230> flyer<00:03:14.790> pretty<00:03:15.790> much<00:03:16.030> it's

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
dragon is a 44 flyer pretty much it's

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.630 
dragon is a 44 flyer pretty much it's
going<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.230> be<00:03:17.320> very<00:03:17.470> hard<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:17.860> play<00:03:18.100> an<00:03:18.160> aggro

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
going to be very hard to play an aggro

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.110 
going to be very hard to play an aggro
builder<00:03:19.290> evasion<00:03:20.370> again<00:03:21.370> it's<00:03:21.760> going<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.060> be

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
builder evasion again it's going to be

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.910 
builder evasion again it's going to be
hard<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.420> have<00:03:22.660> evasion<00:03:23.320> because<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.739> looks

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
hard to have evasion because it looks

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.500 
hard to have evasion because it looks
like<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:24.370> many<00:03:24.579> of<00:03:24.700> these<00:03:24.820> dragons<00:03:25.329> have

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
like so many of these dragons have

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.080 
like so many of these dragons have
flying<00:03:25.959> which<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.440> type<00:03:26.709> of<00:03:26.769> evasion<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.670> if

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
flying which is a type of evasion and if

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.960 
flying which is a type of evasion and if
all<00:03:28.329> these<00:03:28.660> creatures<00:03:28.989> are<00:03:29.230> flying<00:03:29.590> then<00:03:30.400> you

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
all these creatures are flying then you

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.979 
all these creatures are flying then you
know<00:03:31.090> flying<00:03:31.570> does<00:03:31.810> not<00:03:31.959> become<00:03:32.140> as<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.810> can

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
know flying does not become as you can

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.030 
know flying does not become as you can
won't<00:03:35.140> be<00:03:35.290> able<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.560> attack<00:03:35.769> your<00:03:35.980> opponent

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
won't be able to attack your opponent

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.850 
won't be able to attack your opponent
like<00:03:36.790> you<00:03:37.180> normally<00:03:37.390> would<00:03:37.630> be<00:03:38.019> in<00:03:38.260> a<00:03:38.410> limited

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
like you normally would be in a limited

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.390 
like you normally would be in a limited
format<00:03:39.220> with<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:40.600> average<00:03:41.230> amount<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.160> fliers

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
format with the average amount of fliers

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.199 
format with the average amount of fliers
now<00:03:43.560> bombs<00:03:44.560> like<00:03:44.890> again<00:03:45.220> there's<00:03:45.640> so<00:03:46.030> many

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
now bombs like again there's so many

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.759 
now bombs like again there's so many
different<00:03:46.510> bombs<00:03:46.840> in<00:03:47.049> this<00:03:47.170> format<00:03:47.500> heavy

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
different bombs in this format heavy

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.470 
different bombs in this format heavy
dragon<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.400> essentially<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.880> bomb<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.360> my

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
dragon is essentially a bomb in my

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.610 
dragon is essentially a bomb in my
opinion<00:03:49.780> it's<00:03:50.590> hard<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:52.140> it's<00:03:53.140> hard<00:03:53.260> to

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
opinion it's hard to it's hard to

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.620 
opinion it's hard to it's hard to
emphasize<00:03:55.110> playing<00:03:56.110> your<00:03:56.410> bombs<00:03:56.650> when<00:03:57.630> my

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
emphasize playing your bombs when my

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.780 
emphasize playing your bombs when my
opponent<00:03:58.930> has<00:03:59.170> probably<00:03:59.739> is<00:03:59.860> when<00:04:00.400> your<00:04:00.549> deck

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
opponent has probably is when your deck

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.569 
opponent has probably is when your deck
has<00:04:01.060> one<00:04:01.360> or<00:04:01.480> two<00:04:01.630> bombs<00:04:01.870> out<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.650> 40<00:04:03.010> that's<00:04:03.340> a

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
has one or two bombs out of 40 that's a

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.789 
has one or two bombs out of 40 that's a
lot<00:04:03.790> different<00:04:03.820> playing<00:04:04.600> your<00:04:05.320> play<00:04:05.560> style

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
lot different playing your play style

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.130 
lot different playing your play style
should<00:04:06.130> be<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.280> lot<00:04:06.459> different<00:04:06.519> than<00:04:07.000> if<00:04:07.209> let's

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
should be a lot different than if let's
