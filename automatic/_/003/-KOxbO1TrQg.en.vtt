difficult<00:03:03.490> to<00:03:03.730> prepare<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.180> norm<00:03:04.450> so<00:03:04.810> I

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
difficult to prepare to the norm so I

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.020 
difficult to prepare to the norm so I
think<00:03:05.710> if<00:03:05.800> it<00:03:05.890> rains<00:03:06.130> for<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.700> race<00:03:06.850> it's

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
think if it rains for the race it's

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.230 
think if it rains for the race it's
going<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.210> be<00:03:07.270> better<00:03:07.510> for<00:03:07.720> us<00:03:07.870> and

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
going to be better for us and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.510 
going to be better for us and
unpredictable<00:03:10.240> weather<00:03:11.130> will<00:03:12.130> have<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.370> better

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
unpredictable weather will have a better

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.760 
unpredictable weather will have a better
chance<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.910> getting<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.209> good<00:03:13.330> result<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.870> for

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
chance of getting a good result so for

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:27.740 
chance of getting a good result so for
rain<00:03:15.190> I've<00:03:15.880> been<00:03:16.000> doing<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.180> rain<00:03:16.330> dance<00:03:16.360> here<00:03:16.750> I

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.540 

think<00:03:28.750> we<00:03:28.900> have<00:03:28.930> achieved<00:03:29.320> quite<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:29.950> lot<00:03:30.220> just

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
think we have achieved quite a lot just

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.270 
think we have achieved quite a lot just
to<00:03:30.610> be<00:03:30.850> here<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.270> mean<00:03:31.450> frankly<00:03:32.020> of<00:03:32.200> course<00:03:32.440> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
to be here I mean frankly of course the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.220 
to be here I mean frankly of course the
other<00:03:33.430> big<00:03:33.850> teams<00:03:34.120> will<00:03:34.450> have<00:03:34.630> three<00:03:34.959> cars

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
other big teams will have three cars

that's<00:03:44.140> ever<00:03:44.320> been<00:03:44.500> done<00:03:44.580> but<00:03:45.580> that's<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.880> great

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
that's ever been done but that's a great

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.810 
that's ever been done but that's a great
challenge<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.690> this<00:03:47.590> am<00:03:47.800> a<00:03:47.830> very<00:03:48.160> brave<00:03:48.550> I

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
challenge and this am a very brave I

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.140 
challenge and this am a very brave I
think<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.630> put<00:03:50.230> this<00:03:50.860> kind<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.370> innovation<00:03:51.640> on

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
think to put this kind of innovation on

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.310 
think to put this kind of innovation on
the<00:03:52.270> world<00:03:52.450> stage<00:03:52.690> it<00:03:53.680> took<00:03:53.950> nurse<00:03:54.250> Ann<00:03:54.459> to

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
the world stage it took nurse Ann to

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.430 
the world stage it took nurse Ann to
insist<00:03:56.320> on<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:57.070> truly<00:03:57.820> innovative<00:03:58.209> layout<00:03:58.989> and

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
insist on a truly innovative layout and

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.090 
insist on a truly innovative layout and
being<00:04:00.400> disruptive<00:04:01.150> within

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
being disruptive within

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.510 
being disruptive within
the<00:04:03.370> conventional<00:04:04.060> car<00:04:04.300> pattern<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.310> we<00:04:06.310> were

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
the conventional car pattern and we were

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.660 
the conventional car pattern and we were
the<00:04:06.700> fastest<00:04:07.300> three<00:04:07.570> cars<00:04:07.980> on<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.220> on<00:04:09.640> the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
the fastest three cars on the on the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.400 
the fastest three cars on the on the
straight<00:04:10.060> in<00:04:10.210> the<00:04:10.300> first<00:04:10.510> running<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:11.050> we<00:04:11.230> do

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
straight in the first running so we do

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.530 
straight in the first running so we do
the<00:04:11.500> top<00:04:11.740> of<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.890> times<00:04:12.100> in<00:04:12.370> that<00:04:12.550> respect<00:04:12.940> so

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
the top of the times in that respect so

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.750 
the top of the times in that respect so
you<00:04:13.600> know<00:04:13.840> that<00:04:14.170> proves<00:04:14.530> some<00:04:14.860> aspects<00:04:15.640> of<00:04:15.700> the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
you know that proves some aspects of the

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.550 
you know that proves some aspects of the
concept<00:04:16.270> now<00:04:16.720> we<00:04:16.780> have<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.080> get<00:04:17.170> all<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.440> other

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
concept now we have to get all the other

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:28.410 
concept now we have to get all the other
parts<00:04:17.920> road<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:27.430> when<00:04:27.580> I<00:04:27.610> was<00:04:27.850> 12<00:04:28.120> years<00:04:28.240> old

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
parts road so when I was 12 years old

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.460 
parts road so when I was 12 years old
there<00:04:28.600> would<00:04:28.720> come<00:04:28.930> just<00:04:29.740> by<00:04:30.670> myself<00:04:31.050> stay<00:04:32.050> 24

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
there would come just by myself stay 24

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
spectator and it's kind of funny for me

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.750 
spectator and it's kind of funny for me
after<00:04:37.410> 30<00:04:38.410> years<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:38.710> racing<00:04:38.950> coming<00:04:39.580> back
