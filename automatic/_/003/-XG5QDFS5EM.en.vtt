00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.019 

last<00:00:14.320> week<00:00:14.620> we<00:00:14.830> introduced<00:00:15.219> the<00:00:15.430> star<00:00:15.700> tip<00:00:16.000> and

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
last week we introduced the star tip and

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.550 
last week we introduced the star tip and
today<00:00:16.570> we're<00:00:16.900> going<00:00:17.020> to<00:00:17.110> do<00:00:17.200> some<00:00:17.380> other

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
today we're going to do some other

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.980 
today we're going to do some other
techniques<00:00:18.100> using<00:00:18.550> that<00:00:18.789> same<00:00:19.060> star<00:00:19.630> tip

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
techniques using that same star tip

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.230 
techniques using that same star tip
we're<00:00:20.680> going<00:00:20.800> to<00:00:20.860> do<00:00:20.980> shells<00:00:21.369> and<00:00:21.700> rosettes

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
we're going to do shells and rosettes

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.030 
we're going to do shells and rosettes
and<00:00:22.509> you<00:00:22.570> can<00:00:22.720> see<00:00:22.900> around<00:00:23.349> the<00:00:23.470> border<00:00:23.800> of<00:00:23.830> the

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
and you can see around the border of the

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.400 
and you can see around the border of the
cake<00:00:24.279> we<00:00:24.790> have<00:00:24.820> shells<00:00:25.330> and<00:00:25.660> in<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:25.900> center<00:00:26.200> we

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
cake we have shells and in the center we

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.460 
cake we have shells and in the center we
have<00:00:26.439> rosettes<00:00:27.099> and<00:00:27.720> they're<00:00:28.720> very<00:00:28.930> easy<00:00:29.199> to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
have rosettes and they're very easy to

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.740 
have rosettes and they're very easy to
do<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.670> let<00:00:30.880> me<00:00:30.939> just<00:00:30.970> show<00:00:31.269> you<00:00:31.300> how<00:00:31.539> easy

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
do and let me just show you how easy

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.110 
do and let me just show you how easy
they<00:00:31.960> are<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.140> do<00:00:32.379> with<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.160> shell<00:00:33.519> you<00:00:33.879> want<00:00:34.030> it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
they are to do with a shell you want it

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.060 
they are to do with a shell you want it
at<00:00:34.239> a<00:00:34.269> 45<00:00:34.809> degree<00:00:34.840> angle<00:00:35.230> kind<00:00:35.800> of<00:00:35.890> at<00:00:36.040> a

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
at a 45 degree angle kind of at a

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.920 
at a 45 degree angle kind of at a
position<00:00:36.400> as<00:00:36.790> if<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:36.970> clock<00:00:37.300> was<00:00:37.570> six<00:00:37.840> o'clock

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
position as if the clock was six o'clock

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.080 
position as if the clock was six o'clock
straight<00:00:38.500> up<00:00:38.650> and<00:00:38.800> down<00:00:38.860> you<00:00:39.220> have<00:00:39.879> it<00:00:40.000> a

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
straight up and down you have it a

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.299 
straight up and down you have it a
little<00:00:40.120> above<00:00:40.449> the<00:00:40.870> top<00:00:41.470> of<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.800> cake<00:00:42.040> you

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
little above the top of the cake you

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.910 
little above the top of the cake you
squeeze<00:00:42.780> stop<00:00:43.780> squeezing<00:00:44.170> and<00:00:44.469> then<00:00:44.590> pull<00:00:44.800> it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
squeeze stop squeezing and then pull it

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.340 
squeeze stop squeezing and then pull it
out<00:00:44.980> so<00:00:45.190> it<00:00:45.280> has<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:45.489> tail<00:00:45.879> now<00:00:46.690> most<00:00:47.050> of<00:00:47.230> the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
out so it has a tail now most of the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.430 
out so it has a tail now most of the
time<00:00:47.590> shells<00:00:47.950> are<00:00:48.160> used<00:00:48.190> for<00:00:49.020> borders<00:00:50.020> but<00:00:50.289> you

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
time shells are used for borders but you

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.290 
time shells are used for borders but you
could<00:00:50.590> use<00:00:50.770> this<00:00:50.920> as<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.160> picture<00:00:51.520> frame<00:00:51.879> and

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
could use this as a picture frame and

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.299 
could use this as a picture frame and
the<00:00:53.140> main<00:00:53.350> thing<00:00:53.620> is<00:00:53.829> just<00:00:53.860> have<00:00:54.610> consistency

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the main thing is just have consistency

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.569 
the main thing is just have consistency
if<00:00:57.309> you<00:00:58.000> have<00:00:58.899> very<00:00:59.140> large<00:00:59.530> fat<00:00:59.890> shells<00:01:00.250> that's

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
if you have very large fat shells that's

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.670 
if you have very large fat shells that's
fine<00:01:00.910> if<00:01:01.329> that's<00:01:01.600> your<00:01:01.960> technique<00:01:02.230> then

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
fine if that's your technique then

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.260 
fine if that's your technique then
people<00:01:02.920> will<00:01:03.070> recognize<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:03.579> that's<00:01:03.969> your

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
people will recognize that that's your

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.330 
people will recognize that that's your
decorating<00:01:04.869> technique<00:01:05.289> but<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.039> can<00:01:06.190> see

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
decorating technique but you can see

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.249 
decorating technique but you can see
it's<00:01:06.490> just<00:01:06.580> a<00:01:06.759> continuous<00:01:07.330> motion<00:01:07.600> that<00:01:08.110> you

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
it's just a continuous motion that you

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.440 
it's just a continuous motion that you
do<00:01:08.440> with<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.680> shell<00:01:08.950> banding<00:01:09.820> it<00:01:09.940> out<00:01:10.060> pulling

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
do with the shell banding it out pulling

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.029 
do with the shell banding it out pulling
it<00:01:10.630> down<00:01:10.869> and<00:01:10.899> then<00:01:11.289> you're<00:01:11.410> kind<00:01:11.560> of<00:01:11.680> covering

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
it down and then you're kind of covering

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.070 
it down and then you're kind of covering
the<00:01:12.160> tail<00:01:12.369> with<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.640> next<00:01:13.030> part<00:01:13.509> of<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.869> body

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
the tail with the next part of the body

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.300 
the tail with the next part of the body
of<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.950> shell<00:01:15.459> you<00:01:16.530> could<00:01:17.530> also<00:01:17.679> use<00:01:17.979> this<00:01:18.130> to

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
of the shell you could also use this to

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.919 
of the shell you could also use this to
frame<00:01:18.550> something<00:01:19.030> in<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.209> middle<00:01:19.509> of<00:01:19.599> a<00:01:19.690> cake

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
frame something in the middle of a cake

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.109 
frame something in the middle of a cake
if<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.289> wanted<00:01:20.679> you<00:01:21.280> could<00:01:21.399> do<00:01:21.580> this<00:01:21.700> in<00:01:21.880> any

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
if you wanted you could do this in any

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.969 
if you wanted you could do this in any
color<00:01:22.420> icing<00:01:22.929> I<00:01:23.020> just<00:01:23.200> happen<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.530> be<00:01:23.649> using

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
color icing I just happen to be using

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.400 
color icing I just happen to be using
pink<00:01:24.310> but<00:01:25.179> it's<00:01:25.300> very<00:01:25.569> simple<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.200> it's<00:01:26.319> very

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
pink but it's very simple and it's very

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.730 
pink but it's very simple and it's very
easy<00:01:26.830> now<00:01:27.640> for<00:01:28.119> rosette<00:01:28.660> it<00:01:28.929> actually<00:01:29.380> looks<00:01:29.590> a

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
easy now for rosette it actually looks a

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.559 
easy now for rosette it actually looks a
little<00:01:29.770> bit<00:01:30.009> like<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.310> rose<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:31.270> start

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
little bit like a rose you start

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.260 
little bit like a rose you start
squeezing<00:01:31.869> as<00:01:32.140> if<00:01:32.259> you're<00:01:32.410> a<00:01:32.440> star<00:01:33.030> making<00:01:34.030> a

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
squeezing as if you're a star making a

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.749 
squeezing as if you're a star making a
star<00:01:34.539> and<00:01:34.840> then<00:01:34.929> you<00:01:35.020> just<00:01:35.229> bring<00:01:35.410> it<00:01:35.590> around

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
star and then you just bring it around

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.490 
star and then you just bring it around
so<00:01:36.759> you're<00:01:36.970> squeezing<00:01:37.179> straight<00:01:37.720> up<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.020> down

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
so you're squeezing straight up and down

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.979 
so you're squeezing straight up and down
and<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:39.729> like<00:01:39.940> a<00:01:39.970> star<00:01:40.300> and<00:01:40.569> you<00:01:40.660> wrap<00:01:40.840> it

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:40.989 
and it's like a star and you wrap it

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:43.320 
and it's like a star and you wrap it
around<00:01:41.080> you're<00:01:42.009> starting<00:01:42.459> basically<00:01:42.880> around

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
around you're starting basically around

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.089 
around you're starting basically around
nine<00:01:43.569> o'clock<00:01:43.599> and<00:01:44.259> then<00:01:44.410> coming<00:01:44.709> back<00:01:44.739> if

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099 
nine o'clock and then coming back if

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.850 
nine o'clock and then coming back if
you're<00:01:45.220> used<00:01:45.399> to<00:01:45.489> working<00:01:46.330> with<00:01:46.599> the<00:01:47.020> face<00:01:47.619> of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
you're used to working with the face of

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.180 
you're used to working with the face of
a<00:01:47.920> clock<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:50.200> can<00:01:50.349> see<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.830> these<00:01:50.950> look

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
a clock and you can see that these look

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.800 
a clock and you can see that these look
a<00:01:51.280> little<00:01:51.310> bit<00:01:51.610> like<00:01:51.640> roses<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:52.420> if<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.569> wanted

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
a little bit like roses so if you wanted

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.749 
a little bit like roses so if you wanted
to<00:01:52.869> make<00:01:52.989> some<00:01:53.020> quick<00:01:53.349> fast<00:01:53.679> roses<00:01:54.190> on<00:01:54.369> top<00:01:54.399> of

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
to make some quick fast roses on top of

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.130 
to make some quick fast roses on top of
something<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.239> could<00:01:56.700> now<00:01:57.700> if<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:58.539> like<00:01:58.840> that

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
something you could now if you like that

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
and you want to make some variation you

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.010 
and you want to make some variation you
also<00:02:01.780> could<00:02:02.200> put<00:02:02.410> a<00:02:02.440> little<00:02:02.880> Center<00:02:03.880> dot<00:02:04.360> as

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
also could put a little Center dot as

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.190 
also could put a little Center dot as
I'm<00:02:05.410> using<00:02:05.619> a<00:02:05.800> five<00:02:06.069> round<00:02:06.580> tip<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:08.080> can

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
I'm using a five round tip and you can

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.220 
I'm using a five round tip and you can
get<00:02:08.349> some<00:02:08.530> contrast<00:02:09.099> with<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:11.020> see

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
get some contrast with that and you see

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.960 
get some contrast with that and you see
it<00:02:11.349> gives<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.800> totally<00:02:12.250> different<00:02:12.700> look<00:02:12.819> and

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
it gives a totally different look and

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.420 
it gives a totally different look and
I'll<00:02:13.060> leave<00:02:13.239> one<00:02:13.450> open<00:02:13.930> there<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.069> you<00:02:15.160> can<00:02:15.280> see

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
I'll leave one open there so you can see

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.010 
I'll leave one open there so you can see
how<00:02:15.580> plain<00:02:15.819> it<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:16.480> these<00:02:16.629> are<00:02:16.690> very

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
how plain it is but these are very

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.670 
how plain it is but these are very
versatile<00:02:17.530> very<00:02:17.770> easy<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.340> use
