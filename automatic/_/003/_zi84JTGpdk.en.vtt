00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
it would put creases at the right places

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.979 
it would put creases at the right places
so<00:02:28.359> you<00:02:28.600> could<00:02:28.810> fold<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.230> up<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.530> have<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.769> box

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
so you could fold it up and have a box

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:37.110 
so you could fold it up and have a box
this<00:02:31.989> was<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> coat<00:02:32.650> pocket<00:02:33.609> GPS<00:02:35.819> really<00:02:36.819> didn't

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
this was a coat pocket GPS really didn't

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.620 
this was a coat pocket GPS really didn't
I<00:02:37.269> guess<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.630> could<00:02:37.780> get<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:37.989> in<00:02:38.079> my<00:02:38.230> pocket<00:02:38.410> but

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
I guess I could get it in my pocket but

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.319 
I guess I could get it in my pocket but
nothing<00:02:40.630> like<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.810> newbie<00:02:44.579> at<00:02:45.579> garments<00:02:46.030> 10th

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
little about and I will go to libraries

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.070 
little about and I will go to libraries
and<00:04:53.830> research<00:04:54.280> them<00:04:54.850> buy<00:04:55.090> books<00:04:55.419> about<00:04:55.660> them
