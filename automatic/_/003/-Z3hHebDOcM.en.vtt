people<00:00:42.470> have<00:00:42.710> with<00:00:42.740> chipping<00:00:43.070> at<00:00:43.280> this<00:00:43.430> do<00:00:44.390> I

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
people have with chipping at this do I

what's that got to do with contact so

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.550 
what's that got to do with contact so
most<00:00:49.970> people<00:00:50.270> either<00:00:50.420> hit<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:51.020> bottom<00:00:51.350> of<00:00:51.470> the

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
most people either hit the bottom of the

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
on the top of the golf ball and the ball

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.130 
on the top of the golf ball and the ball
is<00:00:54.590> scaled<00:00:55.010> or<00:00:55.160> top<00:00:55.430> rolls<00:00:55.940> too<00:00:56.150> far<00:00:56.390> that<00:00:56.690> they

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
is scaled or top rolls too far that they

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.540 
is scaled or top rolls too far that they
tend<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.470> chips<00:00:57.680> on<00:00:57.800> one<00:00:57.950> side<00:00:58.190> of<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.340> green

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
tend the chips on one side of the green

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.460 
tend the chips on one side of the green
to<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.030> other<00:00:59.180> backward<00:00:59.900> and<00:01:00.020> forward<00:01:00.320> and

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
to the other backward and forward and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.620 
to the other backward and forward and
get<00:01:00.890> very<00:01:01.100> frustrated<00:01:01.760> they<00:01:02.090> can<00:01:02.270> waste<00:01:02.450> as

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
get very frustrated they can waste as

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.899 
get very frustrated they can waste as
many<00:01:02.840> shots<00:01:03.080> around<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.500> green<00:01:03.530> as<00:01:04.010> they<00:01:04.640> can

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
many shots around the green as they can

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.490 
many shots around the green as they can
to<00:01:05.210> get<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.479> green<00:01:05.689> in<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.810> first<00:01:05.990> place

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
to get to the green in the first place

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.109 
to get to the green in the first place
the<00:01:07.070> other<00:01:07.219> problem<00:01:07.640> is<00:01:07.670> hitting<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:07.969> ball

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
the other problem is hitting the ball

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.539 
the other problem is hitting the ball
fat<00:01:08.420> meaning<00:01:09.079> hitting<00:01:09.289> too<00:01:09.409> much<00:01:09.590> grass<00:01:09.920> or

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
fat meaning hitting too much grass or

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.849 
fat meaning hitting too much grass or
laying<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.000> side<00:01:11.240> over<00:01:11.539> the<00:01:11.630> ball<00:01:11.840> behind<00:01:12.530> the

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
laying the side over the ball behind the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.069 
laying the side over the ball behind the
ball<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:14.060> ball<00:01:14.210> obviously<00:01:14.390> rolls<00:01:14.840> just<00:01:14.929> a

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
ball and the ball obviously rolls just a

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.200 
ball and the ball obviously rolls just a
couple<00:01:15.289> of<00:01:15.380> meters<00:01:15.530> in<00:01:15.859> front<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:16.130> them<00:01:16.250> that's

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
couple of meters in front of them that's

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.569 
couple of meters in front of them that's
the<00:01:17.420> other<00:01:17.539> issue<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.740> what<00:01:18.920> what<00:01:19.219> is<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.399> most

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
the other issue so what what is the most

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.700 
the other issue so what what is the most
people<00:01:19.939> do<00:01:20.090> to<00:01:20.329> subscribe<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:21.259> fixing<00:01:21.619> this

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
people do to subscribe to fixing this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.560 
people do to subscribe to fixing this
problem<00:01:21.939> well<00:01:22.939> if<00:01:23.060> someone<00:01:23.359> is<00:01:23.420> hitting

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
problem well if someone is hitting

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.969 
problem well if someone is hitting
behind<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.109> ball<00:01:24.289> hitting<00:01:24.499> the<00:01:24.560> top<00:01:24.799> of<00:01:24.920> the

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
behind the ball hitting the top of the

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.249 
behind the ball hitting the top of the
ball<00:01:25.189> most<00:01:26.060> people<00:01:26.509> then<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:26.840> get<00:01:26.990> them<00:01:27.140> to

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
ball most people then just get them to

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.419 
ball most people then just get them to
move<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.530> ball<00:01:27.649> further<00:01:27.859> back<00:01:28.159> in<00:01:28.310> their

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
move the ball further back in their

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:29.859 
move the ball further back in their
stance<00:01:28.609> get<00:01:29.149> them<00:01:29.329> to<00:01:29.450> move<00:01:29.539> their<00:01:29.689> weight

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
stance get them to move their weight

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.929 
stance get them to move their weight
further<00:01:30.170> forward<00:01:30.679> in<00:01:30.770> this<00:01:30.890> in<00:01:31.130> in<00:01:31.759> their

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
further forward in this in in their

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.059 
further forward in this in in their
stance<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.479> obviously<00:01:33.319> now<00:01:33.469> they<00:01:33.619> come<00:01:33.859> down

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
stance and obviously now they come down

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:35.679 
stance and obviously now they come down
up<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.609> down<00:01:34.640> way<00:01:34.909> too<00:01:34.969> much<00:01:35.240> on<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.509> golf

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
up and down way too much on the golf

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.209 
up and down way too much on the golf
ball<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.469> there's<00:01:36.649> actually<00:01:36.740> trying<00:01:37.130> to

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
ball so there's actually trying to

ball so there's actually trying to
ensure<00:01:37.399> contact<00:01:37.909> is<00:01:38.030> correct<00:01:38.359> no<00:01:39.289> doubt<00:01:39.499> about

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
ensure contact is correct no doubt about

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.319 
ensure contact is correct no doubt about
it<00:01:39.799> you<00:01:39.950> will<00:01:40.130> hit<00:01:40.369> correct<00:01:40.759> contact<00:01:41.179> with

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
it you will hit correct contact with

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.739 
it you will hit correct contact with
that<00:01:41.479> particular<00:01:42.170> adjustment<00:01:43.240> but<00:01:44.240> when<00:01:44.630> you

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
that particular adjustment but when you

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.289 
that particular adjustment but when you
over<00:01:45.109> lean<00:01:45.319> the<00:01:45.560> wedge<00:01:45.770> forward<00:01:46.399> what<00:01:47.149> to

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
over lean the wedge forward what to

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.300 
over lean the wedge forward what to
actually<00:01:47.420> end<00:01:47.810> up<00:01:47.960> doing<00:01:48.380> is<00:01:48.590> taking<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:49.130> loft

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
actually end up doing is taking the loft

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.279 
actually end up doing is taking the loft
off<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.729> wedge<00:01:49.939> and<00:01:50.270> changing<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.049> bounce

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
off the wedge and changing the bounce

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.340 
off the wedge and changing the bounce
design<00:01:51.679> of<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:51.889> wedge<00:01:52.039> as<00:01:52.219> well<00:01:52.569> and<00:01:53.569> not<00:01:54.289> only

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
design of the wedge as well and not only

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.069 
design of the wedge as well and not only
that<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.130> make<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.340> very<00:01:55.579> Undine<00:01:56.179> amic<00:01:56.539> jamming

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
that you make a very Undine amic jamming

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.679 
that you make a very Undine amic jamming
swing<00:01:57.439> and<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.460> ball<00:01:58.490> reacts<00:01:58.999> in<00:01:59.179> all<00:01:59.299> kinds

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
swing and the ball reacts in all kinds

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.660 
swing and the ball reacts in all kinds
of<00:01:59.749> ways<00:01:59.929> so<00:02:00.829> what<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.009> actually<00:02:01.159> get<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.579> the

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
of ways so what I actually get to the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.849 
of ways so what I actually get to the
point<00:02:01.880> is<00:02:02.119> why<00:02:02.719> people<00:02:03.109> have<00:02:03.439> problems<00:02:03.829> with

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
point is why people have problems with

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:06.129 
point is why people have problems with
chipping<00:02:04.280> it's<00:02:04.850> faulty<00:02:05.270> hands<00:02:05.569> they<00:02:05.929> don't

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:06.139 
chipping it's faulty hands they don't

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:07.510 
chipping it's faulty hands they don't
actually<00:02:06.259> understand<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:06.979> correct<00:02:07.219> hand

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
actually understand the correct hand

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.389 
actually understand the correct hand
motion<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:07.969> the<00:02:08.030> chipping<00:02:08.330> stroke<00:02:08.600> so<00:02:09.590> if<00:02:10.130> you

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
motion and the chipping stroke so if you

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.270 
motion and the chipping stroke so if you
scale<00:02:10.729> your<00:02:10.759> chip<00:02:11.210> shot<00:02:11.590> there<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.710> no<00:02:12.950> doubt

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
scale your chip shot there is no doubt

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.770 
scale your chip shot there is no doubt
you<00:02:13.580> have<00:02:13.700> flipped<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.150> with<00:02:14.270> your<00:02:14.420> bottom

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
you have flipped it with your bottom

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.010 
you have flipped it with your bottom
hand<00:02:15.020> what<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.160> does<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.730> lowers<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.630> low

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
hand what this does is lowers the low

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.230 
hand what this does is lowers the low
point<00:02:18.260> or<00:02:18.500> bottoming<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.340> golf<00:02:19.550> club<00:02:19.790> spot

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
point or bottoming of the golf club spot

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.380 
point or bottoming of the golf club spot
behind<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.260> golf<00:02:21.410> ball<00:02:21.910> rather<00:02:22.910> than<00:02:23.180> being

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
behind the golf ball rather than being

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.260 
behind the golf ball rather than being
in<00:02:23.600> front<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:23.960> golf<00:02:24.170> ball<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:25.850> faulty

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
in front of the golf ball so this faulty

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.210 
in front of the golf ball so this faulty
hand<00:02:26.540> issue<00:02:26.780> should<00:02:27.470> not<00:02:27.500> be<00:02:27.680> solved<00:02:28.100> by

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
hand issue should not be solved by

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.260 
hand issue should not be solved by
moving<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.640> ball<00:02:28.790> back<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.150> your<00:02:29.180> stance

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
moving the ball back in your stance

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.450 
moving the ball back in your stance
that's<00:02:29.960> throwing<00:02:30.200> good<00:02:30.380> money<00:02:30.440> after<00:02:30.680> bad

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
that's throwing good money after bad

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.910 
that's throwing good money after bad
the<00:02:32.120> other<00:02:32.270> problem<00:02:32.690> people<00:02:32.870> have<00:02:33.050> is<00:02:33.470> when

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
the other problem people have is when

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.950 
the other problem people have is when
they<00:02:34.040> hit<00:02:34.160> behind<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.640> ball<00:02:34.910> is<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.720> fact

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
they hit behind the ball is the fact

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.420 
they hit behind the ball is the fact
that<00:02:36.050> they're<00:02:36.260> actually<00:02:36.440> not<00:02:36.830> understanding

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
that they're actually not understanding

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.550 
that they're actually not understanding
how<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.610> pivot<00:02:38.060> or<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.720> body<00:02:38.930> turn<00:02:39.230> works

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
how the pivot or the body turn works

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.950 
how the pivot or the body turn works

do you move the ball further back it's

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.260 
do you move the ball further back it's
insane<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.190> just<00:02:46.370> fixing<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.880> fault<00:02:47.120> with<00:02:47.240> a
