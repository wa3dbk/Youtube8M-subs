what's<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.740> on<00:00:01.860> YouTube<00:00:03.529> all<00:00:04.529> right<00:00:04.680> so

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
what's going on YouTube all right so

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:15.709 
what's going on YouTube all right so
here's<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.750> deal<00:00:14.059> have<00:00:15.059> these<00:00:15.240> two<00:00:15.480> little

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
here's the deal have these two little

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.630 
here's the deal have these two little
holes<00:00:16.910> leaking<00:00:17.910> over<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.300> got<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.199> fixed

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
holes leaking over here got that fixed

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.759 
holes leaking over here got that fixed
we're<00:00:20.640> still<00:00:20.880> leaking<00:00:21.289> that<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.410> leaking<00:00:22.680> it

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
we're still leaking that is leaking it

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.679 
we're still leaking that is leaking it
from<00:00:22.890> on<00:00:23.039> top<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.850> basically<00:00:24.240> when<00:00:24.480> at<00:00:24.570> least

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
from on top so basically when at least

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.349 
from on top so basically when at least
when<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.140> overfill<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.920> just<00:00:26.210> sputters<00:00:27.210> out

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
when it overfill and just sputters out

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.210 
when it overfill and just sputters out
all<00:00:27.539> over<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> place<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> pump

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
all over the place it's not the pump

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.209 
all over the place it's not the pump
it's<00:00:29.760> usually<00:00:29.910> an<00:00:30.179> air<00:00:30.650> air<00:00:31.650> getting<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.099> one

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
it's usually an air air getting in one

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.299 
it's usually an air air getting in one
of<00:00:32.309> these<00:00:32.369> holes<00:00:32.610> these<00:00:33.239> two<00:00:33.480> hoses<00:00:33.719> are<00:00:34.050> good

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
of these holes these two hoses are good

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.979 
of these holes these two hoses are good
yeah<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.460> kind<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.700> windy<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.149> bear<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.570> me

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.650 

let's<00:00:39.989> go<00:00:40.140> down<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:40.410> check<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.890> out<00:00:44.660> power

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
let's go down here check it out power

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.760 
let's go down here check it out power
steering<00:00:46.050> pump<00:00:46.879> pulley<00:00:47.879> it'll<00:00:48.440> either<00:00:49.440> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
steering pump pulley it'll either to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.010 
steering pump pulley it'll either to
your<00:00:50.489> turn<00:00:50.730> will<00:00:50.969> slow<00:00:51.239> two<00:00:51.300> hoses<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.930> were

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
your turn will slow two hoses that were

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.880 
your turn will slow two hoses that were
up<00:00:52.140> there<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:57.170> right<00:00:58.170> there

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
up there go here in here right there

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.660 
up there go here in here right there
that<00:00:59.160> I'm<00:00:59.250> moving<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:00.989> above<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:04.670> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that I'm moving that and one above it to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.550 
that I'm moving that and one above it to
pressure<00:01:05.970> line<00:01:06.210> hoses<00:01:06.860> now<00:01:08.510> they're<00:01:09.510> kind<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
pressure line hoses now they're kind of

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.640 
pressure line hoses now they're kind of
metal<00:01:11.000> this<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> return<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.780> power

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
metal this is a return one power

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.010 
metal this is a return one power
steering<00:01:14.100> they're<00:01:14.760> metal<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.420> they<00:01:15.570> have

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
steering they're metal because they have

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.399 
steering they're metal because they have
a<00:01:16.049> lot<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> pressure<00:01:16.740> angles<00:01:17.130> through<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:18.409> but

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
a lot of pressure angles through it but

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.120 
a lot of pressure angles through it but
I'm<00:01:19.560> pretty<00:01:19.830> tight<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:22.009> that<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.180> a<00:01:24.180> week<00:01:25.130> is

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
I'm pretty tight with that one a week is

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.830 
I'm pretty tight with that one a week is
that<00:01:26.310> not<00:01:26.490> only<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> hard<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.360> get<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.659> down

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that not only is it hard to get to down

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.940 
that not only is it hard to get to down
there<00:01:28.549> but<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.479> right<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
there but this is it right here and it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.140 
there but this is it right here and it
runs<00:01:32.130> all<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.509> midst<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:35.150> pops

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
runs all in the midst of all this pops

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.819 
runs all in the midst of all this pops
out<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.540> top<00:01:36.689> here<00:01:36.960> see<00:01:37.229> I'll<00:01:37.320> loosen<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> bit

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
out on top here see I'll loosen it a bit

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.319 
out on top here see I'll loosen it a bit
and<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:39.090> hydraulically<00:01:39.689> controlled<00:01:41.329> all

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and it hydraulically controlled all

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.670 
and it hydraulically controlled all
right<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> all<00:01:43.700> one<00:01:44.700> big<00:01:44.729> piece<00:01:45.090> you

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
right so this is all one big piece you

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.560 
right so this is all one big piece you
now<00:01:47.160> if<00:01:47.670> you're<00:01:47.880> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.060> do<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.360> on

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
now if you're going to do this on

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.140 
now if you're going to do this on
yourself<00:01:53.000> if<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.480> the<00:01:54.600> right<00:01:54.720> tools

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
yourself if you have the right tools

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.220 
yourself if you have the right tools
very<00:01:57.150> difficult<00:01:58.880> this<00:01:59.880> right<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:01.700> this<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.760> a

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
very difficult this right here this is a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.130 
very difficult this right here this is a
let<00:02:04.230> me<00:02:04.290> get<00:02:04.440> inside

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
let me get inside

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.370 
let me get inside
this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> stubby<00:02:07.830> open<00:02:08.640> head<00:02:08.820> wrench<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:10.350> I

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
this is a stubby open head wrench that I

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.160 
this is a stubby open head wrench that I
just<00:02:10.649> bought<00:02:10.860> from<00:02:11.460> Sears<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:12.060> don't<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
just bought from Sears I don't have the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.680 
just bought from Sears I don't have the
small<00:02:13.440> ones<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.740> had<00:02:13.970> all<00:02:14.970> these<00:02:15.150> big<00:02:15.360> ones<00:02:15.600> over

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
small ones I had all these big ones over

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.750 
small ones I had all these big ones over
here<00:02:15.840> which<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.920> course<00:02:16.950> if<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.400> notice<00:02:17.730> down

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
here which of course if you notice down

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:28.850 
here which of course if you notice down
there<00:02:18.120> there's<00:02:18.810> barely<00:02:19.140> any<00:02:19.440> room<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:28.530> take

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
there there's barely any room so in take

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.830 
there there's barely any room so in take
out<00:02:29.010> out<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.520> way<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.880> stuff<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.690> know<00:02:30.810> I

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
out out of the way and stuff you know I

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.330 
out out of the way and stuff you know I
was<00:02:31.020> able<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.290> see<00:02:31.530> better<00:02:33.709> these<00:02:34.709> hoses<00:02:35.040> are

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
was able to see better these hoses are

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.740 
was able to see better these hoses are
just<00:02:35.520> clamped<00:02:35.910> on<00:02:36.030> with<00:02:36.209> these<00:02:36.330> little<00:02:36.570> clamps

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
just clamped on with these little clamps

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:50.010 
just clamped on with these little clamps
that<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.050> just<00:02:42.920> down<00:02:43.920> here

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.119 

right<00:02:51.670> this<00:02:52.670> which<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.629> camera<00:02:54.319> has<00:02:54.830> been

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
right this which is the camera has been

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.190 
right this which is the camera has been
leaking<00:02:55.400> up<00:02:55.970> there<00:02:56.330> all<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.629> way<00:02:56.720> down<00:02:56.959> so

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
leaking up there all the way down so

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.770 
leaking up there all the way down so
this<00:02:57.379> is<00:02:57.530> probably<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.920> source<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.489> leak<00:02:58.780> the

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
this is probably the source of leak the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.530 
this is probably the source of leak the
flats<00:03:00.140> all<00:03:02.319> make<00:03:03.319> a<00:03:03.349> little<00:03:03.590> stubby<00:03:04.540> bridge

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
flats all make a little stubby bridge

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.520 
flats all make a little stubby bridge
