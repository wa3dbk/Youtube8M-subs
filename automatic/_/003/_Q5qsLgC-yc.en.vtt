federation force is something that's

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.490 
federation force is something that's
like<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.740> side<00:01:59.100> game<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.700> metroid<00:02:00.060> prime<00:02:00.500> that

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
like a side game to metroid prime that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.319 
like a side game to metroid prime that
is<00:02:01.560> why<00:02:01.890> i'm<00:02:02.009> not<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.310> necessarily<00:02:02.430> mad<00:02:03.030> about

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
is why i'm not to necessarily mad about

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.870 
is why i'm not to necessarily mad about
it<00:02:03.509> yes<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.290> not<00:02:04.500> metroid<00:02:04.950> prime<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.490> of

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
it yes it's not metroid prime for of

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.789 
it yes it's not metroid prime for of
course<00:02:06.479> it's<00:02:06.659> not<00:02:06.719> metroid<00:02:07.079> prime<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.560> I

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
course it's not metroid prime for I

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.589 
course it's not metroid prime for I
don't<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.489> it's<00:02:08.729> not<00:02:08.819> much<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.149> prayin<00:02:09.239> for

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
don't know it's not much of a prayin for

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.330 
don't know it's not much of a prayin for
and<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:10.379> course<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:10.890> not<00:02:10.920> metroid<00:02:11.310> prime

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and of course it's not metroid prime

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.700 
and of course it's not metroid prime
hunters<00:02:11.970> to

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
hunters to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.940 
hunters to
so<00:02:13.710> it's<00:02:14.130> like<00:02:14.550> something<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.650> gotta<00:02:16.650> take<00:02:16.890> it

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
so it's like something I gotta take it

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.040 
so it's like something I gotta take it
for<00:02:17.160> what<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:17.910> not<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> metra<00:02:18.810> prawn

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
for what it is it's not a metra prawn

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.780 
for what it is it's not a metra prawn
game<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.530> wanted<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.550> metro

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
game that we wanted but it's a metro

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.330 
game that we wanted but it's a metro
pronged<00:02:21.150> game<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:22.170> doesn't<00:02:22.500> have<00:02:22.620> samisen<00:02:23.220> it

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
pronged game it doesn't have samisen it

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.640 
pronged game it doesn't have samisen it
but<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.120> has<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.450> title<00:02:24.750> Metroid<00:02:25.020> Prime<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
but it has the title Metroid Prime in it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.050 
but it has the title Metroid Prime in it
I<00:02:25.770> guess<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.150> guess<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.890> thing<00:02:29.070> is<00:02:29.250> about<00:02:29.280> this

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
I guess I guess the thing is about this

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.600 
I guess I guess the thing is about this
game<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.720> entirely<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.470> why<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.920> think<00:02:32.130> most<00:02:32.490> of

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
game and entirely is why I think most of

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.730 
game and entirely is why I think most of
the<00:02:32.760> Metroid<00:02:33.630> Prime<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.960> fandom<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.410> actually

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
the Metroid Prime and fandom is actually

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.860 
the Metroid Prime and fandom is actually
upset<00:02:35.070> it's<00:02:35.250> because<00:02:35.580> it's<00:02:36.540> not<00:02:36.630> what<00:02:36.780> we

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
upset it's because it's not what we

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.300 
upset it's because it's not what we
wanted<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.320> basically<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.770> what<00:02:37.920> we<00:02:38.010> wanted

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
wanted it's basically not what we wanted

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.210 
wanted it's basically not what we wanted
and<00:02:38.930> when<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.050> look<00:02:40.260> at<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.650> game<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.100> know

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
and when you look at the game you know

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.980 
and when you look at the game you know
it's<00:02:41.460> more<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.920> feel<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.210> feel<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:45.630> it's

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
it's more I feel I just I feel like it's

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.350 
it's more I feel I just I feel like it's
more<00:02:46.350> it's<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.830> month<00:02:47.190> monster<00:02:47.730> 100<00:02:48.030> related

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.460 
me want to say that Nintendo gave up on
Metroid<00:03:44.130> but<00:03:44.450> I'm<00:03:45.450> looking<00:03:46.050> at<00:03:46.140> all<00:03:46.320> their

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
Metroid but I'm looking at all their

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.010 
Metroid but I'm looking at all their
past<00:03:46.770> Metro<00:03:47.190> games<00:03:47.430> on<00:03:47.700> gamecube<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
past Metro games on gamecube and the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.900 
past Metro games on gamecube and the
week<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.440> they<00:03:49.709> were<00:03:49.830> like<00:03:50.100> really<00:03:50.490> really

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
week and they were like really really

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.720 
week and they were like really really
big<00:03:51.330> sellers<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:52.709> what<00:03:53.130> I'm<00:03:53.250> really<00:03:53.610> thinking

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
big sellers so what I'm really thinking

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.030 
big sellers so what I'm really thinking
is<00:03:54.270> that<00:03:54.410> they<00:03:55.410> either<00:03:55.709> did<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.700> as<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.450> as<00:03:58.040> a

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
is that they either did this as a as a

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.320 
is that they either did this as a as a
waitlist<00:03:59.580> er<00:03:59.730> basically<00:04:00.180> they're

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
waitlist er basically they're

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.540 
waitlist er basically they're
waitlisting<00:04:00.780> us<00:04:00.959> there<00:04:01.230> were<00:04:01.350> saying<00:04:01.590> hey<00:04:01.800> you

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
waitlisting us there were saying hey you

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.250 
waitlisting us there were saying hey you
want<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.850> metra<00:04:03.090> Prime<00:04:03.360> we<00:04:03.630> gave<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:03.959> measure<00:04:04.170> a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
want a metra Prime we gave you measure a

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.600 
want a metra Prime we gave you measure a

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
prime but it's not that much of a

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.010 
prime but it's not that much of a
problem<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:05.910> wanted<00:04:06.300> because<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.750> metra
