00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
right so if you think if you think that

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.520 
right so if you think if you think that
he's<00:02:39.730> probably<00:02:39.970> not<00:02:40.510> gonna<00:02:40.750> get<00:02:40.989> released<00:02:41.380> to

he's probably not gonna get released to
some<00:02:41.709> type<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:41.950> point<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.970> know<00:02:43.090> I'd<00:02:43.209> be

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
some type of point you know I'd be

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.440 
some type of point you know I'd be
shocked<00:02:43.989> if<00:02:44.520> Jeffrey<00:02:45.520> Lurie<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.209> the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
shocked if Jeffrey Lurie and the

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.420 
shocked if Jeffrey Lurie and the
Philadelphia<00:02:47.110> Eagles<00:02:47.140> have<00:02:47.680> this<00:02:47.890> guy<00:02:48.070> come

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
even near their stadium facility I think

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.940 
even near their stadium facility I think
his<00:02:51.970> football<00:02:52.390> career<00:02:52.570> is<00:02:52.780> probably<00:02:52.900> over<00:02:53.350> but

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
his football career is probably over but

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.560 
his football career is probably over but
