00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.150
 is a youtube channel wired to them 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.769
 what tests do you think this is 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.410
 they put some products while the 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.630
 bison in extreme conditions so that 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.529
 they are broken and see if they continue 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.320
 working or not 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.199
 beauty this time was the part of the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.930
 playstation 4 with your against xbox one 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.080
 that will be expensive is that if you drop the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.300
 that if it falls it breaks and stops 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.070
 then the first one was tested 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.510
 As an actor, he once survived the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.910
 chainsaw attack 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.190
 it was not an engine if you think nothing 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.020
 survived the attack scored saw goes to 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.969
 showed a top-10 of 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.829
 chainsaws last week you can give 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.500
 a glance there in games that did not fit 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.270
 The first test is to drop it from a 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.440
 height of about a meter and a half 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.190
 both playstation 4 and xbox o 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.940
 year a chan look at super camera 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.129
 Slow or high turns per second to a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.979
 look there in the ground shook all the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.860
 xbox one released the top cap and the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.490
 playstation 4 unlocked front cover 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.009
 I think this makes your bets and I think 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.290
 that will work or will not work 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.810
 now it was 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.310
 no precise sign four xbox onu 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.700
 working 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.119
 after a few seconds the filet is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.340
 both playstation 4 while the xbox or 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.290
 operated with a drop of 1 meter and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.850
 Middle is going to be done at home, right? 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.250
 You will not test to see if it works. 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.140
 it is logical that there is an issue 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.130
 You dropped a mouse, you see. 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.380
 ie the impact surface has been 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.299
 totally divided by the pressure then 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.070
 if it fell on the tip 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.579
 if it had turned around a bit 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.439
 tip hit be much higher at that point 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.700
 there was in his place underneath a 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.579
 important piece could have broken 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.290
 they let out the right beauty 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.090
 Now this one O opa was uglier than 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.879
 almost four meters 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.410
 half a height happened four meters and 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.900
 How tall will it be that some league 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.180
 it is difficult and this time you will see also 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.130
 what opel 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.620
 now hit the tip carlos fell 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.930
 mouse will have to pass through the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.550
 The test makes your bets again. 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.920
 will any of them work there so I do not know 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.620
 business all too many guys, huh? 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:37.620
 ov looks like it's working not 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:41.640
 need 14 of the xbox will be will not is 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.910
 possible of the xbox group or connected with a 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.050
 four point drop 5 meters four 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.580
 meters and a half too much quality, right? 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.800
 logical that you will try to do at home but 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.720
 It's nice to know that there are still 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.670
 durable electronics because we know 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.600
 that two days that are now made for 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.640
 do not last 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.910
 except for some exceptions with the proton 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.700
 we seek that they are many and very strong 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.680
 unfortunately Playstation 4 was 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.130
 destroyed and they will put a 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.680
 chainsaw wrong guys reads know that 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.510
 always place the registration video here 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.220
 I hope you have enjoyed this crash. 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.220
 test done by wired staff
