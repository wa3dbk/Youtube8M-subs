will cook the potatoes until they're
soft<00:00:41.880> I'll<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.420> stick<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.630> fork<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.170> I'm

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
soft I'll just stick a fork in it I'm

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.810 
soft I'll just stick a fork in it I'm
going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> roughly<00:00:44.070> tell<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.399> if<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.579> take

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
going to roughly tell you if you take

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.360 
going to roughly tell you if you take
about<00:00:44.940> 20<00:00:45.390> minutes<00:00:45.559> but<00:00:46.559> when<00:00:47.040> they're<00:00:47.190> done

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
about 20 minutes but when they're done

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100 
about 20 minutes but when they're done
you<00:00:47.700> need<00:00:47.850> an<00:00:47.910> exact<00:00:48.300> time<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:48.930> guessing

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
you need an exact time but I'm guessing

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.470 
you need an exact time but I'm guessing
about<00:00:49.379> ten<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.070> five<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.610> I'm<00:00:50.730> leading<00:00:51.059> by<00:00:51.210> 20

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
about ten to five so I'm leading by 20

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.350 
about ten to five so I'm leading by 20
up<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.840> five<00:00:52.020> they<00:00:52.230> should<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.530> good<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:53.360> ok

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
up to five they should be good to go ok

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.940 
up to five they should be good to go ok
so<00:00:54.420> our<00:00:54.600> potatoes<00:00:55.050> were<00:00:55.200> cooked<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.680> 10

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
so our potatoes were cooked it's 10

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.630 
so our potatoes were cooked it's 10
after<00:00:55.980> five<00:00:56.539> and<00:00:57.539> i'm<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:58.460> don't<00:00:59.460> you

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
after five and i'm just going don't you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:09.060 
after five and i'm just going don't you
drain<00:00:59.969> them<00:01:00.180> into<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:02.000> strainer

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:17.510 

and<00:01:09.580> then<00:01:09.700> add<00:01:09.940> them<00:01:10.150> into<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:11.310> mixing<00:01:12.310> bowl

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:28.370 

just<00:01:18.520> match<00:01:18.820> them<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.450> little<00:01:19.600> bit<00:01:23.430> down<00:01:24.430> and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.990 

I'm<00:01:29.380> going<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.619> add<00:01:29.830> just<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:30.250> little<00:01:30.280> bit<00:01:30.790> of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
I'm going to add just a little bit of

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.210 
I'm going to add just a little bit of
butter<00:01:31.210> not<00:01:31.570> much<00:01:31.810> not<00:01:32.320> even<00:01:32.440> necessary<00:01:33.009> that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220

butter not much not even necessary that
you're<00:01:33.340> a<00:01:33.369> bit<00:01:33.700> but<00:01:33.970> I<00:01:34.180> think<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.540> adds<00:01:34.690> some

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
you're a bit but I think it adds some

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.010

blade

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.929 

and<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.829> get<00:01:41.979> enough<00:01:42.250> potatoes<00:01:42.789> without

and it to get enough potatoes without
any<00:01:43.359> lumps<00:01:43.719> is<00:01:43.929> to<00:01:44.170> mix<00:01:44.409> them<00:01:44.679> first<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.219> then

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
any lumps is to mix them first and then

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
any lumps is to mix them first and then
add<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.820> liquid

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.150 

keep<00:01:56.350> stopping<00:01:56.950> pushing<00:01:57.820> them<00:01:57.940> off<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.300> sides

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.690
