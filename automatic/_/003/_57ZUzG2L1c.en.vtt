 he was dressed up in the most ordinary military 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.509
 camouflage and just near the head to 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.429
 brilliant limbs give out a robot 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.280
 or rather humanoid robot 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.110
 avatar his operator sits in the next 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.179
 room he just makes a move in 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.359
 air and the robot shoots a pistol 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.410
 hit five targets and drive around the landfill 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.900
 on quad bike 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.710
 Vladimir Putin looks at the army soldier 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.210
 of the future 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.920
 from the observation post chapter 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.560
 States explain soon such 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.119
 androids will be able to navigate themselves 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.059
 areas provide medical care 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.739
 or drive a tank later on 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.170
 meeting of the military-industrial commission 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.059
 President reminds Russia again 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.149
 get into an arms race not 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.690
 intends but high technology is a sphere 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.960
 wherein 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.000
 I can not keep up I have already given me so 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.629
 related to the amount of money which 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.969
 Russia directs 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.399
 that direct other countries to 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.250
 military needs are incomparable just 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.500
 the values â€‹â€‹are simply not comparable at times 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.780
 more than we spend 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.720
 but I repeat once again we can and should 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.220
 answer this challenge and how i 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.650
 said at the start don't type 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.530
 costly arms race 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.930
 can we do that of course husband on and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.460
 then should have done in the east are waiting 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.259
 made high technology 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.729
 the fund is engaged in such developments 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.590
 prospective studies 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.020
 already approved forty nine projects 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.110
 weapons that have no analogues anywhere 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.540
 the world for 26 of them is specific work 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.159
 right here at the meeting Vladimir Putin 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.259
 tell the commission member what he is 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.990
 signed a decree on the general designer 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.939
 to create weapons of military and 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.070
 special technology it will be 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.979
 limited circle of people on whom 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.960
 that all responsibility for the future 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:50.119
 Russian turnaround relies that 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.200
 there will be no more than 20 such designers 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.409
 each candidacy 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.750
 will consider the board of the MIC and then they 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.369
 will be approved at our meeting 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.049
 commissions 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.250
 thus status and personal 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.719
 general responsibility 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.770
 Designer markedly increased 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.830
 I hope that it will serve more 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.540
 effective implementation of key projects 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.840
 in the field of national defense and 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.099

 macroeconomic reality task 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.160
 not easy but doable to 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.180
 military ceased to be dependent on others 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.000
 countries had to take 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.799
 two import substitution programs also 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.019
 Vladimir Putin recalled that the program 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.060
 weapons must take into account and new 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.760
