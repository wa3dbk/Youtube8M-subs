00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.129
 or the people and you here with us pod 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.899
 commenting and as you have already seen in the 

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:07.939
 video title today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.669
 how can you unlock the kinematics 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.290
 final or rather the epilogue of this 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:14.589
 new map that has left for exxon 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.589
 zombies this new episode called 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.589
 inflection 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.489
 this kinematics is not for nothing 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.050
 complicated to unlock still if still 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.480
 You have not touched the map of Cuellar 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.100
 enough time but good let's go to the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.290
 grain and that is what you have to do to 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.660
 unlock this kinematics so good 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.019
 guys , all you have to do is 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.620
 save 25 civilians 25 survivors of 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.320
 those who have to rescue during the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.390
 game and they will bring what comes next 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280
 being the achievement of the kinematics and 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.750
 you can see it whenever you want 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.270
 what do you want 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.250
 obviously you will not have to save 25 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.380
 civilians in a single game are 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.860
 cumulative and you can always see how much 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.409
 if you have seen turning markers 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.929
 career 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.060
 and you can see how many civilians and 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.759
 rescued and remember that for 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.050
 unlock the kinematics you need 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.330
 have rescued 25 civilians 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.280
 after the game in which you have 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.740
 reached the figure of 25 civilians 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.960
 rescued you will appear the following 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.550
 poster telling you how good he has 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.590
 unlocked the final kinematics that 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.690
 you do blocked in this epilogue and that 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.670
 You can see it whenever you want so nothing 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.240
 guys, I hope you liked this one 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.310
 tutorial 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.650
 I tried to bring you something that is 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.260
 different something other than the song 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.690
 hidden or stereo exo zombies like 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.730
 They have already climbed many other places as well 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.740
 that nothing I think that this unlock 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.320
 the kinematics can also be quite 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.270
 interesting not good I think I 've 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.179
 explained the procedure quite well 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.369
 and that you can do it without any 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.230
 type of problem if you are still a 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.430
 lazy and do not want to do all this 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.130
 procedure to unlock the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.650
 cinematic and yet you want to see it 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.260
 I will leave a link in the description 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.000
 that you can see the complete kinematics 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.920
 so nothing would have come to the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.349
 end of the video you liked you can 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.720
 leave me a like and subscribe if you do not 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.099
 you are and well see you in the next 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.099
 goodbye video guys 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.970
