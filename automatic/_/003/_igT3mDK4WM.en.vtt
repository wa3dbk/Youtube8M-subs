your 7/32 drill bits gonna that's what's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.970 
your 7/32 drill bits gonna that's what's
in<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.550> drill<00:00:32.850> right<00:00:33.090> now<00:00:33.329> okay<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.320> first

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
in this drill right now okay so first

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.040 
in this drill right now okay so first
thing<00:00:35.190> we're<00:00:35.399> gonna<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.820> Center<00:00:36.540> our<00:00:36.690> board

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
thing we're gonna do is Center our board

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.220 
thing we're gonna do is Center our board
onto<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.649> frame<00:00:38.090> it's<00:00:39.090> nicely<00:00:39.360> centered<00:00:39.899> here

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
onto the frame it's nicely centered here

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.810 
onto the frame it's nicely centered here
then<00:00:40.800> we're<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.070> take<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> measuring

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
then we're going to take the measuring

then we're going to take the measuring
tape<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:43.260> could<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.980> able<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
tape you could be able to see that

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.229 
tape you could be able to see that
through<00:00:45.800> our<00:00:46.800> truck<00:00:47.160> holes<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:49.700> frame<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.879> 15

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
through our truck holes here frame is 15

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.279 
through our truck holes here frame is 15
and<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> half<00:00:51.480> inches<00:00:51.930> wide<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.960> markets<00:00:54.960> seven

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and a half inches wide so markets seven

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.369 
and a half inches wide so markets seven
three<00:00:55.500> quarters<00:00:56.750> next<00:00:57.750> thing<00:00:57.899> we're<00:00:58.020> gonna<00:00:58.079> do

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
three quarters next thing we're gonna do

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.310 
three quarters next thing we're gonna do
is<00:00:58.410> measure<00:00:58.800> our<00:00:59.129> wheelbase<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> board

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
is measure our wheelbase of the board

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.500 
is measure our wheelbase of the board
wheelbase<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.620> board<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.010> 13<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.579> 7/8

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
wheelbase of the board is 13 and 7/8

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.000 
wheelbase of the board is 13 and 7/8
we<00:01:03.899> are<00:01:04.049> gonna<00:01:04.229> measure<00:01:04.530> 13<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.460> 7/8<00:01:07.010> from

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
we are gonna measure 13 and 7/8 from

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.460 
we are gonna measure 13 and 7/8 from
this<00:01:08.280> mark<00:01:08.640> right<00:01:10.189> here<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:12.869> make<00:01:13.200> sure

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
this mark right here and make sure

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.240 
this mark right here and make sure
that's<00:01:13.680> centered<00:01:14.689> that's<00:01:15.689> 7<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.259> 3/4

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that's centered that's 7 and 3/4

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.330 
that's centered that's 7 and 3/4
go<00:01:17.700> back<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.090> 8<00:01:19.040> there's<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:22.220> next<00:01:23.220> thing

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
go back in 8 there's that next thing

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.289 
go back in 8 there's that next thing
that<00:01:23.400> we're<00:01:23.670> gonna<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:24.060> we're<00:01:24.720> gonna<00:01:24.810> drill

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
that we're gonna do we're gonna drill

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:40.040 
that we're gonna do we're gonna drill
our<00:01:27.299> holes

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:48.540 

clean<00:01:41.050> up<00:01:41.200> our<00:01:41.350> holes<00:01:47.160> take<00:01:48.160> one<00:01:48.370> of<00:01:48.460> our

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
clean up our holes take one of our

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.030 
clean up our holes take one of our
displays<00:01:50.520> there<00:01:51.900> so<00:01:52.900> this<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.470> notes<00:01:53.890> of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
displays there so this is the notes of

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.210 
displays there so this is the notes of
the<00:01:54.100> board<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:54.460> going<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.640> be<00:01:54.730> up<00:01:54.880> here<00:01:59.130> so<00:02:00.130> we

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
the board it's going to be up here so we

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.900 
the board it's going to be up here so we
take<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:01.710> basically<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.920> hanging<00:02:03.310> tab<00:02:03.550> right

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
take the basically the hanging tab right

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:14.040 
take the basically the hanging tab right
here<00:02:08.310> put<00:02:09.310> this<00:02:09.460> in<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:13.300> not<00:02:13.510> only<00:02:13.630> does<00:02:13.990> the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
here put this in so not only does the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.160 
here put this in so not only does the
screw<00:02:14.620> hole<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.340> display<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.390> frame<00:02:16.780> but

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
screw hole the display to the frame but

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
screw hole the display to the frame but
it<00:02:17.290> also<00:02:18.360> holds<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.420> tab<00:02:19.810> onto<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.620> back<00:02:20.890> so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
it also holds the tab onto the back so

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.220 
it also holds the tab onto the back so
it<00:02:21.310> makes<00:02:21.550> for<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:21.850> really<00:02:22.240> solid<00:02:23.970> solid<00:02:24.970> piece

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.589 

so<00:02:29.230> there's<00:02:29.409> one<00:02:29.680> display<00:02:30.159> on<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:31.269> tail<00:02:31.569> of

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
so there's one display on the tail of

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.470 
so there's one display on the tail of
the<00:02:31.870> board<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:33.700> gonna<00:02:33.849> have<00:02:34.090> one<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.329> these

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
the board just gonna have one of these

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.509 
the board just gonna have one of these
go<00:02:34.750> on<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.049> side<00:02:37.379> I'm<00:02:38.379> gonna<00:02:38.470> remove<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
go on this side I'm gonna remove the

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.440 
go on this side I'm gonna remove the
t-nuts

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
t-nuts

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.600 
t-nuts
there's<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.930> little<00:02:41.140> paint<00:02:41.379> and<00:02:41.530> resin<00:02:42.099> inside

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
drop the board on here t-nuts

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.860 
drop the board on here t-nuts
the<00:02:57.849> white<00:02:58.090> part<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.569> t-nut<00:03:00.000> facing<00:03:01.000> me

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
the white part of the t-nut facing me

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.640 
the white part of the t-nut facing me
basically<00:03:03.480> with<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.569> outside<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.170> board

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.059 

tighten<00:03:08.650> up<00:03:08.739> these<00:03:09.010> bolts<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:11.290> you've<00:03:11.500> got<00:03:11.769> a
