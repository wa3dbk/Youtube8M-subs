00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
there are advantages to this and also

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.910 
there are advantages to this and also
disadvantages<00:01:30.530> one<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> obvious

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
disadvantages one of the obvious

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.069 
disadvantages one of the obvious
advantages<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.880> course<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.570> sounds

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
advantages of course is that it sounds

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.550 
advantages of course is that it sounds
really<00:01:34.320> cool

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
really cool

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.819 
really cool
and<00:01:37.560> while<00:01:38.039> kids<00:01:38.850> really<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.799> some<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
and while kids really like that some of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.010 
and while kids really like that some of
the<00:01:40.950> major<00:01:41.189> advantages<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.329> though<00:01:42.539> is

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the major advantages of it though is

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.880 
the major advantages of it though is
that<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.710> neck<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.450> often<00:01:45.450> smaller<00:01:45.990> than<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that the neck is often smaller than the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.520 
that the neck is often smaller than the
neck<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.549> Marilyn<00:01:48.240> acoustic<00:01:48.810> which<00:01:49.229> makes

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
neck on a Marilyn acoustic which makes

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.069 
neck on a Marilyn acoustic which makes
it<00:01:49.710> easier<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:51.060> child<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.630> wrap<00:01:51.840> their

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
it easier for the child to wrap their

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.830 
it easier for the child to wrap their
hand<00:01:52.350> around<00:01:53.090> which<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> real<00:01:54.509> advantage

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
hand around which is a real advantage

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.230 
hand around which is a real advantage
one<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.679> disadvantages<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.640> course<00:01:56.850> is

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
one of the disadvantages of course is

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.270 
one of the disadvantages of course is
that<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.509> got<00:01:57.659> steel<00:01:58.049> strings<00:01:58.590> they<00:01:58.890> will

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
that it's got steel strings they will

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.819 
that it's got steel strings they will
cut<00:01:59.869> more<00:02:00.869> into<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> fingertips<00:02:02.069> of<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.179> kid

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
cut more into the fingertips of the kid

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
the thin picks are better because they

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.230
