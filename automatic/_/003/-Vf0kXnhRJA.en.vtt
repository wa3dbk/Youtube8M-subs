00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.920
 damn guys with you again i'm poor students 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.199
 sat listening to music pondering life here 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.880
 last money headphones broke like 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.900
 you always want to listen to the prisoner 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.900
 let's solve problems 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.539
 one of the easiest ways is 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.800
 shorter and more reliable store and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.800
 buy headphones let's do it 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.680
 can tell if you have cheap 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.980
 good headphones yes of course further on 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.980
 here is the blame 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.180
 let us build something that is very valid 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.930
 roads from 290 to 90 sound like a barrel 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 but the price is very tasty these are ours 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.800
 heroes thanks still in my life was such 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.510
 case once I took the headphones in 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.700
 one of the supermarkets of our city and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.400
 they word me out practically through 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.990
 month and then I changed the warranty took 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.640
 next next so I held in 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.740
 for half a year that is practically 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.229
 free fit care with headphones 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.539
 than not an option but now we will try and 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.479
 several headphones to collect one begin 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.740
 we need to get it from the plug 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.899
 plug such thing that most often 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.640
 breaks in headphones if you have 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.680
 headphone broke 8 percent of what's here 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.750
 problem with plug from mernem contact 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.750
 Clean it here and so yes strainer knife 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.310
 just strip the wire we are now 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.310
 we tell isolation 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.750
 here are two reasons blue and yellow and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.580
 red yellow yellow wires we need 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.890
 twist yourself together and tin 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.890
 for this we take on this 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.790
 nickname rosin 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.829
 water ready for them to be soldered 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.170
 read first yellow to the bottom 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:21.099
 questioned part of the plugs right at 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.099
 grounds at the very 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.380
 left under red and blue they 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.690
 bathe on top and no longer matters 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.560
 where do you solder them and red on top 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.560
 canopy below or vice versa 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.769
 in general, then we all finished left 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.590
 only put isolation i for isolation 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.450
 use a smoldering gun here in 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.219
 classroom can actually hit so 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.909
 even ordinary clay or against 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:53.909
 wish squeeze as smear 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.849
 in general, the glue is dry everything is fine now 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.849
 check dad and 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.180
 by chance 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:22.329
 this ear works 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:25.090
 this is which one to work on here 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.109
 I bought headphones but not only bought Noah 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.689
 soldered his steel 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.859
 I even have a spare headphones I 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.859
 I can listen to music further
