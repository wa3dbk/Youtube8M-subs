will build and go faster and faster this
film<00:04:46.350> starts<00:04:46.890> off<00:04:47.100> like<00:04:47.310> at<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.550> reasonable

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
film starts off like at a reasonable

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.480 
film starts off like at a reasonable
pace<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.690> gets<00:04:48.930> faster<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:49.590> one<00:04:49.920> tense<00:04:50.250> and

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
pace and gets faster and one tense and

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.030 
pace and gets faster and one tense and
then<00:04:50.670> it<00:04:50.790> slows<00:04:51.360> down<00:04:51.530> quite<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.560> lot<00:04:52.830> to

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
then it slows down quite a lot to

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.400 
then it slows down quite a lot to
actually<00:04:53.460> they<00:04:53.640> go<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:53.880> like<00:04:54.150> desert<00:04:55.050> world

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
actually they go to like desert world

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.290 
actually they go to like desert world
but<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:55.860> actually<00:04:56.100> liked<00:04:56.580> everything<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.210> was

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
but I actually liked everything that was

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.490 
but I actually liked everything that was
going<00:04:57.420> on<00:04:57.600> with<00:04:57.810> slow<00:04:57.960> down<00:04:58.170> once<00:04:58.380> you

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
going on with slow down once you

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.380 
going on with slow down once you
readjust<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.430> see<00:04:59.790> that<00:04:59.970> there's<00:05:00.120> a<00:05:00.210> lot<00:05:00.330> of
