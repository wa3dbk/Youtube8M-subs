00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
like a super reverb type of tone let's

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.199 
like a super reverb type of tone let's
see<00:05:56.759> if<00:05:56.879> I<00:05:56.999> had<00:05:57.179> to<00:05:57.300> pick<00:05:57.599> one<00:05:57.899> I<00:05:58.439> think

00:05:59.199 --> 00:05:59.209 
see if I had to pick one I think

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:01.549 
see if I had to pick one I think
thinking<00:06:00.209> like<00:06:00.389> the<00:06:00.509> bottom<00:06:00.869> awesome<00:06:01.379> better

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:01.559 
thinking like the bottom awesome better

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:04.790 
thinking like the bottom awesome better
yet<00:06:02.279> the<00:06:02.909> bottle<00:06:03.270> of<00:06:03.389> masa<00:06:03.629> over<00:06:04.379> the<00:06:04.529> Eric

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
yet the bottle of masa over the Eric

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.549 
yet the bottle of masa over the Eric
Johnson<00:06:05.389> although<00:06:06.389> I<00:06:06.419> do<00:06:06.539> like<00:06:06.779> the<00:06:06.930> color<00:06:07.259> and

00:06:07.549 --> 00:06:07.559 
Johnson although I do like the color and

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:09.489 
Johnson although I do like the color and
the<00:06:07.709> nobbies<00:06:08.099> on<00:06:08.309> the<00:06:08.430> Eric<00:06:08.729> Johnson<00:06:08.999> better

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:09.499 
the nobbies on the Eric Johnson better

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:12.170 
the nobbies on the Eric Johnson better
so<00:06:10.499> if<00:06:10.619> we<00:06:10.770> can<00:06:10.919> take<00:06:11.099> the<00:06:11.279> bottle<00:06:11.639> of<00:06:11.729> monster

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
so if we can take the bottle of monster

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.429 
so if we can take the bottle of monster
and<00:06:12.389> put<00:06:12.569> her<00:06:12.689> into<00:06:13.319> the<00:06:13.349> air<00:06:13.709> Johnson<00:06:14.550> case

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:15.439 
and put her into the air Johnson case

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:19.159 
and put her into the air Johnson case
we'd<00:06:16.439> be<00:06:16.619> cooking<00:06:17.099> with<00:06:17.219> Pam<00:06:18.080> shouldn't<00:06:19.080> have

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
we'd be cooking with Pam shouldn't have

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:20.809 
we'd be cooking with Pam shouldn't have
set<00:06:19.319> my<00:06:19.469> phone<00:06:19.709> on<00:06:19.889> top<00:06:20.129> of<00:06:20.279> my<00:06:20.369> amp<00:06:20.580> either

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
set my phone on top of my amp either

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.689 
set my phone on top of my amp either
because<00:06:21.119> it<00:06:21.360> just<00:06:21.509> went<00:06:21.779> off<00:06:21.959> mm-hmm<00:06:22.860> anyway

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 
because it just went off mm-hmm anyway

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.600 
because it just went off mm-hmm anyway
both<00:06:23.879> great<00:06:24.330> fuzzies<00:06:24.869> and<00:06:25.169> that's<00:06:26.099> the

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
both great fuzzies and that's the

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:38.490 
both great fuzzies and that's the
difference<00:06:27.059> yeah

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.560
