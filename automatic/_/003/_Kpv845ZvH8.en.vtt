00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
to it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.080 
to it
I<00:00:54.860> still<00:00:55.860> haven't<00:00:56.100> seen<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.280> Queen<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.879> for

I still haven't seen the Queen so for

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.910 
I still haven't seen the Queen so for
now<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.690> shot<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:57.930> dark<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.559> don't

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
now it's just a shot in dark I don't

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310 
now it's just a shot in dark I don't
know<00:00:59.070> where<00:00:59.250> she<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.600> or<00:01:00.600> if<00:01:00.629> she's<00:01:00.719> even<00:01:01.109> here

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
know where she is or if she's even here

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.160 
know where she is or if she's even here
but<00:01:01.940> it's<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.059> eggs<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.629> that's<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.840> good<00:01:03.960> sign

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
but it's all eggs so that's a good sign

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.270 
but it's all eggs so that's a good sign
but<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.559> think<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:04.860> right<00:01:04.949> now<00:01:05.010> we're<00:01:05.250> just

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
but I think for right now we're just

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.440 
but I think for right now we're just
gonna<00:01:05.460> try<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.640> let<00:01:05.790> him<00:01:05.880> calm<00:01:06.060> down<00:01:06.119> keep

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
gonna try to let him calm down keep

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270 
gonna try to let him calm down keep
pouring<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.720> into<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> box<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.380> hopefully

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
pouring it into the box and hopefully

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.039 
pouring it into the box and hopefully

good and sugary and sticky so they can't

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.789 
good and sugary and sticky so they can't
fly<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.820> well<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:03.990> them<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.380> flying

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.930 
around are ones that were inside the
wall<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.630> I've<00:02:06.719> been<00:02:07.099> squirting<00:02:08.099> be<00:02:08.250> quick<00:02:08.489> up

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
wall and I've been squirting be quick up

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.150 
wall and I've been squirting be quick up
inside<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> wall

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
inside the wall

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.590 
inside the wall
and<00:02:10.520> every<00:02:10.790> time<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:10.970> do<00:02:11.090> they<00:02:11.300> just<00:02:11.480> come

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
and every time I do they just come

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.090 
and every time I do they just come
pouring<00:02:11.780> out<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.170> their<00:02:12.290> butt<00:02:12.470> seems<00:02:12.950> like

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
pouring out of their butt seems like

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.170 
pouring out of their butt seems like
there's<00:02:13.280> never<00:02:13.370> quite<00:02:13.670> enough<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:13.970> get<00:02:14.060> them

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.720 
there's never quite enough to get them
all<00:02:14.300> out<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:14.890> we're<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:15.920> hoping<00:02:16.160> they'll<00:02:16.490> uh

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
remember this is the first deep that I

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.730 
remember this is the first deep that I
brought<00:02:38.480> him<00:02:38.600> from<00:02:38.960> that<00:02:39.080> first<00:02:39.320> cut<00:02:39.500> out<00:02:39.620> that

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
brought him from that first cut out that

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.700 
brought him from that first cut out that
I<00:02:39.800> did<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:41.140> it's<00:02:42.140> out<00:02:42.260> here<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.380> couple<00:02:42.590> days

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
I did and it's out here a couple days

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.690 
I did and it's out here a couple days
and<00:02:42.890> checked<00:02:43.100> in<00:02:43.220> on<00:02:43.310> them<00:02:43.460> and<00:02:43.550> they<00:02:43.610> were

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
and checked in on them and they were

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.190 
and checked in on them and they were
pulling<00:02:43.970> clean<00:02:44.150> cells<00:02:44.420> pretty<00:02:44.660> heavy<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.170> I

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
pulling clean cells pretty heavy so I

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.980 
pulling clean cells pretty heavy so I
don't<00:02:45.500> know<00:02:45.590> if<00:02:45.710> I<00:02:45.890> injured<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.700> Queen<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.960> I

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
don't know if I injured the Queen and I

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.510 
don't know if I injured the Queen and I
did<00:02:48.170> when<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.620> moved<00:02:48.770> her<00:02:49.010> what<00:02:49.160> I've<00:02:49.280> released

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
did when I moved her what I've released

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.250 
did when I moved her what I've released
her<00:02:49.640> from<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.880> cage<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.630> she<00:02:50.870> crawled<00:02:51.110> down

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
her from the cage and she crawled down

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.160 
her from the cage and she crawled down
the<00:02:51.410> frames<00:02:51.620> like<00:02:51.770> she<00:02:51.890> was<00:02:52.010> fine<00:02:52.220> but<00:02:52.460> I<00:02:53.170> guess

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
the frames like she was fine but I guess

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.330

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
a whole lot of comb to begin with but I

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.380 
a whole lot of comb to begin with but I
never<00:03:18.920> did<00:03:19.130> find<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.460> Queen<00:03:19.670> never<00:03:20.120> spotted

a pretty weak colony so I think what I'm
gonna<00:03:26.270> do<00:03:26.420> today<00:03:26.540> is<00:03:26.660> just<00:03:26.750> go<00:03:26.960> ahead<00:03:27.050> and

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
hives come that close together I'm a

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
hives come that close together I'm a
little<00:04:05.510> curious<00:04:05.690> how<00:04:05.810> this<00:04:05.870> is<00:04:05.990> gonna<00:04:06.080> work

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
little curious how this is gonna work

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.980 
little curious how this is gonna work
out<00:04:06.530> because<00:04:06.740> of<00:04:07.040> what<00:04:07.160> I<00:04:07.220> said<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.780> don't<00:04:08.780> think

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
out because of what I said I don't think

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.560 
out because of what I said I don't think
this<00:04:09.110> one<00:04:09.290> has<00:04:09.440> a<00:04:09.470> queen<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:10.300> this<00:04:11.300> one<00:04:11.450> does

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
this one has a queen and this one does

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.850 
this one has a queen and this one does
not<00:04:11.600> have<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:11.840> queen<00:04:12.050> either<00:04:12.320> right<00:04:12.560> now<00:04:12.709> though

not have a queen either right now though

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.590 
not have a queen either right now though
they're<00:04:13.040> raising<00:04:13.220> more<00:04:13.580> so<00:04:13.940> it<00:04:14.450> might

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
they're raising more so it might

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.670 
they're raising more so it might
actually<00:04:14.750> be<00:04:14.959> really<00:04:15.080> simple<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.590> that

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
actually be really simple and that

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.599 
actually be really simple and that
they'll<00:04:15.800> just<00:04:15.830> accept<00:04:16.250> each<00:04:16.340> other<00:04:16.489> as

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
they'll just accept each other as

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.909 
they'll just accept each other as
friends<00:04:16.760> since<00:04:17.180> both<00:04:17.480> of<00:04:17.510> them<00:04:17.690> are<00:04:17.780> wingless

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
friends since both of them are wingless

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.840 
friends since both of them are wingless
see<00:04:20.370> what<00:04:20.489> happens<00:04:20.700> if<00:04:20.940> folks<00:04:21.180> I'm<00:04:22.610> all<00:04:23.610> done
