note she stands on her own I did not
expect<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:47.380> considering<00:03:48.380> that<00:03:48.530> she's

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
expect that considering that she's

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.060 
expect that considering that she's
leaning<00:03:49.040> over<00:03:49.340> she<00:03:50.470> balances<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.530> lot<00:03:51.800> better

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
leaning over she balances a lot better

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.790

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.320 
interesting although apparently the new
colors<00:04:38.510> that<00:04:38.870> they're<00:04:39.140> coming<00:04:39.560> out<00:04:39.710> with<00:04:40.330> have

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
colors that they're coming out with have

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.550 
colors that they're coming out with have
a<00:04:41.360> colored<00:04:41.870> basis<00:04:42.380> now<00:04:43.840> which<00:04:44.840> is<00:04:44.870> kind<00:04:45.410> of

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
a colored basis now which is kind of

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.420 
a colored basis now which is kind of
dumb<00:04:46.810> because<00:04:47.810> they<00:04:48.260> shouldn't<00:04:48.590> come<00:04:48.800> up<00:04:48.980> with

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
dumb because they shouldn't come up with

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.770 
dumb because they shouldn't come up with
that<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:50.390> first<00:04:50.660> place<00:04:51.220> but<00:04:52.220> whatever<00:04:55.780> one

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
that the first place but whatever one

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.200 
that the first place but whatever one
colors<00:04:57.320> enough<00:04:57.650> for<00:04:57.919> me<00:04:58.100> thank<00:04:58.580> you<00:04:58.730> very<00:04:58.760> much
