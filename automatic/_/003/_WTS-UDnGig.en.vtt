unlike the hundred mil system these

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.399 
unlike the hundred mil system these
filters<00:02:49.599> all<00:02:49.749> the<00:02:49.840> same<00:02:50.049> they<00:02:50.290> are<00:02:50.319> 75<00:02:51.280> by<00:02:51.579> 90

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
filters all the same they are 75 by 90

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.309 
filters all the same they are 75 by 90
so<00:02:53.409> even<00:02:54.069> so<00:02:54.370> they<00:02:54.489> don't<00:02:54.669> do<00:02:54.819> 75<00:02:55.750> mil<00:02:55.989> square

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
so even so they don't do 75 mil square

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.599 
so even so they don't do 75 mil square
ones<00:02:56.530> like<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.859> hundred<00:02:57.129> mil<00:02:57.250> system<00:02:57.519> will

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
ones like the hundred mil system will

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.759

have<00:02:57.699> 100<00:02:57.849> mil<00:02:58.150> square<00:02:58.449> or<00:02:58.629> 100<00:02:58.930> by<00:02:59.019> 150<00:02:59.560> all

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
the same shape and size so the holder

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.110 
the same shape and size so the holder

for various attachments the most popular
is<00:03:10.449> a<00:03:10.480> polarizer<00:03:11.519> so<00:03:12.519> this<00:03:12.879> is<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.060> polarizer

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
is a polarizer so this is a polarizer

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.339 
is a polarizer so this is a polarizer
again<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.469> will<00:03:14.560> fit<00:03:14.829> both<00:03:15.099> 75<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.659> RS<00:03:16.900> 75

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
again it will fit both 75 and the RS 75

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.089 
again it will fit both 75 and the RS 75
systems<00:03:17.859> it's<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.939> circular<00:03:19.180> polarizer<00:03:19.599> and<00:03:20.199> it

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
systems it's a circular polarizer and it

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.099 
systems it's a circular polarizer and it
has<00:03:21.310> holes<00:03:21.730> on<00:03:21.879> the<00:03:21.969> back<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.629> fit<00:03:22.959> into

has holes on the back that fit into
these<00:03:23.349> lugs<00:03:23.680> now<00:03:23.919> I'll<00:03:24.069> probably<00:03:24.250> have<00:03:24.519> to

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
these lugs now I'll probably have to

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.860 
these lugs now I'll probably have to
just<00:03:24.970> do<00:03:25.720> this<00:03:26.009> looking<00:03:27.009> at<00:03:27.159> it<00:03:27.400> here<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.599> can

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
just do this looking at it here you can

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.050 
just do this looking at it here you can
if<00:03:29.139> you<00:03:29.229> wish<00:03:29.409> take<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.769> holder<00:03:30.099> off<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.759> snap

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
if you wish take the holder off and snap

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.119 
if you wish take the holder off and snap
it<00:03:31.180> in<00:03:31.299> position<00:03:31.419> but<00:03:32.229> there<00:03:32.680> we<00:03:32.769> go<00:03:32.889> it's

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
it in position but there we go it's

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.929 
it in position but there we go it's
locked<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.639> like<00:03:34.079> so<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:36.220> now<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.459> can<00:03:36.849> adjust

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
locked in like so so now I can adjust

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:38.729 
locked in like so so now I can adjust
the<00:03:37.239> polarize<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:38.049> can<00:03:38.229> just<00:03:38.259> a<00:03:38.560> grab

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
the polarize it I can just a grab

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.939 
the polarize it I can just a grab
position<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.659> can<00:03:40.659> rotate<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:41.290> as<00:03:41.470> well<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:41.889> if

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949 
position I can rotate it as well so if

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.069 
position I can rotate it as well so if
I've<00:03:42.099> got<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.400> uneven<00:03:43.000> horizon<00:03:43.509> I<00:03:43.599> can<00:03:43.750> do<00:03:43.870> that

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
I've got a uneven horizon I can do that

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.469 
I've got a uneven horizon I can do that
but<00:03:44.949> also<00:03:45.129> I've<00:03:45.310> got<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.579> polarizer<00:03:46.090> on<00:03:46.299> the

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
but also I've got the polarizer on the

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.050 
but also I've got the polarizer on the
front<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:47.229> adjust<00:03:47.500> polarization<00:03:48.459> if<00:03:48.669> I<00:03:48.849> need

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
front to adjust polarization if I need

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.330 
front to adjust polarization if I need
to<00:03:49.299> obviously<00:03:50.139> cameras<00:03:50.500> like<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:50.889> you<00:03:51.159> can

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
to obviously cameras like this you can

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.780 
to obviously cameras like this you can
see<00:03:52.030> live<00:03:52.299> view<00:03:52.629> but<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.620> can<00:03:53.979> also<00:03:54.220> take<00:03:54.639> the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
see live view but you can also take the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.920 
see live view but you can also take the
holder<00:03:55.090> off<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.479> look<00:03:55.629> through<00:03:55.780> the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
holder off and look through the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.439 
holder off and look through the
polarizer<00:03:56.409> to<00:03:57.220> achieve<00:03:57.699> the<00:03:57.819> polarizing

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:58.449 
polarizer to achieve the polarizing

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:00.300 
polarizer to achieve the polarizing
effect<00:03:58.509> so<00:03:59.079> it<00:03:59.169> it's<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.769> very<00:03:59.979> Universal

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
effect so it it's a very Universal

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.729 
effect so it it's a very Universal
system<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.209> think<00:04:01.659> quite<00:04:01.930> quickly<00:04:02.259> pulling<00:04:02.620> on

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
system I think quite quickly pulling on

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.289 
system I think quite quickly pulling on
that<00:04:02.889> I<00:04:02.949> can<00:04:03.129> take<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.400> whole<00:04:03.579> thing<00:04:03.819> off<00:04:04.000> in

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
that I can take the whole thing off in

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.249 
that I can take the whole thing off in
one<00:04:04.959> go<00:04:05.519> nice<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:06.549> compact<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:07.569> perfect<00:04:08.169> for

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:08.259 
one go nice and compact and perfect for

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.009 
one go nice and compact and perfect for
this<00:04:08.409> sort<00:04:08.620> of<00:04:08.680> setup<00:04:08.939> we<00:04:09.939> are<00:04:10.209> expanding<00:04:10.719> the

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
this sort of setup we are expanding the

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.219 
this sort of setup we are expanding the
system<00:04:11.439> with<00:04:11.979> a<00:04:12.400> hood<00:04:12.879> that's<00:04:13.569> coming<00:04:13.989> soon

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
system with a hood that's coming soon

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.469 
system with a hood that's coming soon
and<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.859> will<00:04:14.949> clip<00:04:15.159> on<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.519> front<00:04:15.789> and

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
and that will clip on to the front and

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.120 
and that will clip on to the front and
it's<00:04:16.659> a<00:04:16.750> removable<00:04:17.169> system<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:17.859> as<00:04:17.919> soon<00:04:18.070> as

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
it's a removable system and as soon as

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.069 
it's a removable system and as soon as
we<00:04:18.340> have<00:04:18.489> those<00:04:18.699> in<00:04:18.909> stock<00:04:18.940> we'll<00:04:19.419> do<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:19.900> quick

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
we have those in stock we'll do a quick

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.770 
we have those in stock we'll do a quick
video<00:04:20.349> but<00:04:21.159> other<00:04:21.789> than<00:04:21.969> that<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.270> system<00:04:22.659> is

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
video but other than that the system is

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
video but other than that the system is
pretty<00:04:23.020> straightforward

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
pretty straightforward

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.129 
pretty straightforward
and<00:04:23.919> you<00:04:24.759> can<00:04:24.880> see<00:04:25.060> it<00:04:25.150> all<00:04:25.240> on<00:04:25.360> our<00:04:25.479> website<00:04:25.840> so

emails the sales at what white code

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:35.339 
emails the sales at what white code
okay<00:04:32.619> or<00:04:33.129> look<00:04:33.339> at<00:04:33.429> our<00:04:33.489> website<00:04:33.899> but<00:04:34.899> I<00:04:35.110> hope
