00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.830
 hi you these drum course.nl this 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.380
 video we go to one to exercise 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.170
 We all play for this exercise 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.410
 limbs needed with the right foot 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:21.300
 we play the bass drum with the left foot 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:25.419
 we play the hi-hat with the right hand 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.829
 let's play on the floor and with the 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.829
 left hand spell on the snare drum 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:35.230
 this will remain so throughout the entire exercise 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.650
 the exercise consists of twelve measures 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.840
 because the 12 combinations are that anyway 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.230
 see the first three sizes you see 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.230
 Below 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.900
 these first three sizes so the first 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.390
 rule therein leads the right hand 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.490
 so you always come first 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.780
 size goes as follows 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.450
 that is a combination between the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:05.140
 right hand and left hand 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:07.120
 so one two three in the second measure 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.460
 have the combination between the 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:16.210
 right hand and right foot so one 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.630
 baby and in the third size 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.740
 you see the combination right hand 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:28.900
 left foot 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.610
 so one the whole line sounds like 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:39.990
 follows 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:46.920
 no no no no no no 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:50.009
 yes go to the next line and on this one 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.470
 rule it is the left hand that leads with 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.880
 that is, the short egg 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.470
 the first combination is with the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.110
 right hand so in the second measure you see 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.320
 the combination with the right foot master 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.320
 and thus 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.280
 and in the third measure see combination here 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:13.730
 left edge so left foot 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:25.730
 snare drum hi the whole line sounds like this 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:25.730
 no no no no no 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.910
 well on the third line it is the master 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.170
 the one who suffers and is the first combination 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.769
 with the hi-hat 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.390
 so one etc. 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.040
 in the second measure you have a combination 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.250
 master him 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.079
 right hand and in the third measure master 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.870
 save him 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:56.690
 so left the entire third line 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.690
 sounds so one two three you celebrate and 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.909
 That 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.260
 and finally the fourth line have and 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.890
 the fourth line is the left foot 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:16.379
 which leads the first combination is left 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.299
 foot right foot so he beasts him 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.590
 in the second measure you see the combination 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:25.510
 left foot 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:30.069
 right hand and in the last measure it is 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:44.280
 left foot and left hand is the whole 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:44.280
 don't rule like that 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.700
 well you are supposed to 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.739
 exercise as a whole but if 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.810
 it is still a bit tricky in the beginning time 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.519
 also tackle it per line 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.370
 I will now leave the entire exercise behind 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.950
 play each other and stupid a little faster and 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:16.590
 the two three four 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:16.590
 no no no no no no no no 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.919
 1212 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:35.669
 4,941 tr4 244 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.919
 and then you can of course repeat again 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.500
 you can make it more difficult for yourself 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.830
 firstly through the exercise a little faster 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.830
 to play 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.570
 but you can also halve the exercise 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.970
 in terms of length, that game and always four 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.430
 count each combination 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.740
 you can also realized it to two 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.789
 so we make a two quartz measure 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.470
 of his traits a plus 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:12.639
 and then you go to the next combination 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:15.220
 no no no no no no 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.690
 etc I will also let you know how 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:24.310
 this sounds 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:28.500
 times 2 no no no no no no no no 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:40.000
 no no no no 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:42.370
 tnt the one tnt 2 and if not yet 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.340
 tricky enough you can even do it 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.990
 choose to only have one each 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.370
 to play variation 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.979
 we now actually get a one 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.740
 a quarter defamation or a two-eighth is just 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:59.880
 how you see it but the players each 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.880
 combination only once a one 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.530
 etc well if you are that completely behind 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.860
 playing together you get this no no no 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:17.560
 no no 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:17.560
 hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.660
 well you notice how short the exercise here 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.340
 The trickier it is to get this right 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.930
 to play 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.850
 this was a lot of fun for this lesson 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.510
 with practice and thanks for watching 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.510
 bye
