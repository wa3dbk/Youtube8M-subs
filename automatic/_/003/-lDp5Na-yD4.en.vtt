really<00:00:39.570> badly<00:00:40.940> it's<00:00:41.940> quite<00:00:42.239> amazing<00:00:45.230> well

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
really badly it's quite amazing well

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.799 
really badly it's quite amazing well
yeah<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.579> should<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.360> getting<00:00:48.570> ready<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
yeah I should know just getting ready to

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.930 
yeah I should know just getting ready to
fire<00:00:49.200> again<00:00:49.379> but<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:50.129> making<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> defense

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
fire again but just making the defense
