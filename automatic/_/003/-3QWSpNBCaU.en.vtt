00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
on I believe on twelve or thirteen I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.080 
on I believe on twelve or thirteen I
have<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> thirteen<00:00:37.739> millimeter<00:00:37.770> socket<00:00:38.579> taking

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
have a thirteen millimeter socket taking

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.810 
have a thirteen millimeter socket taking
them<00:00:39.270> off<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.840> I'll<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> twelve<00:00:41.670> or

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.709 
them off so I'll be like a twelve or
thirteen<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:43.530> usually<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.219> will<00:00:47.360> will<00:00:48.360> go

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
thirteen and usually this will will go

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.250 
thirteen and usually this will will go
over<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.200> go<00:00:49.440> through<00:00:49.980> here<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:51.260> you'll

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
over here go through here and you'll

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.560 
over here go through here and you'll
hold<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> thermostat<00:00:53.250> housing<00:00:56.899> so<00:00:59.449> I'll<00:01:00.449> be

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
hold the thermostat housing so I'll be

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.640 
hold the thermostat housing so I'll be
right<00:01:00.780> here<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:02.100> then<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:04.080> bottom<00:01:04.409> part

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
right here and then this the bottom part

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.800 
right here and then this the bottom part
will<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.360> front<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
will be right here in front of the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.840 
will be right here in front of the
thermostat<00:01:07.320> housing<00:01:10.430> so

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
thermostat housing so

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.590 
thermostat housing so
I<00:01:14.340> would<00:01:15.340> show<00:01:15.640> you<00:01:15.670> how<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.030> do<00:01:16.210> it<00:01:16.330> but<00:01:16.479> I'm

screw in there or the scroll be on there

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.350 
screw in there or the scroll be on there
and<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.390> just<00:01:37.450> remove<00:01:37.900> it<00:01:39.150> that's<00:01:40.150> how<00:01:40.330> easy

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
and you just remove it that's how easy

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.870 
and you just remove it that's how easy
it<00:01:40.690> is<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:41.560> take<00:01:41.680> off<00:01:41.860> but<00:01:42.130> that<00:01:42.400> thermistor

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
it is to take off but that thermistor
