so<00:00:31.080> let<00:00:31.259> me<00:00:31.349> ask<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.740> doctor<00:00:32.399> why's<00:00:32.750> it

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
so let me ask you this doctor why's it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.990 
so let me ask you this doctor why's it
what<00:00:34.469> kind<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.680> evidence<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
what kind of evidence do we have of

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.069 
what kind of evidence do we have of
dinosaurs<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.379> humans<00:00:38.269> concurrently<00:00:39.269> at<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
dinosaurs and humans concurrently at the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.009 
dinosaurs and humans concurrently at the

same time cohabiting earth as a

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.810 
same time cohabiting earth as a
paleontologist<00:00:43.309> having<00:00:44.309> looked<00:00:44.489> at<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.640> lot<00:00:44.790> of

paleontologist having looked at a lot of

paleontologist having looked at a lot of
that<00:00:45.000> those<00:00:45.719> claims<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.350> there's<00:00:46.530> thousands

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that those claims and there's thousands

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.130 
that those claims and there's thousands
of<00:00:47.489> claims<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:48.000> there<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.390> humans<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
of claims out there that humans and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.569 
of claims out there that humans and
dinosaurs<00:00:49.260> live<00:00:49.890> together<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.460> there's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
dinosaurs live together and there's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.060 
dinosaurs live together and there's
evidence<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.269> my<00:00:51.930> contention<00:00:52.589> is<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:53.040> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
evidence of it my contention is as a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.799 
evidence of it my contention is as a
paleontologist<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:54.030> there's<00:00:54.210> none<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.720> that

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
paleontologist that there's none of that

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.680 
paleontologist that there's none of that
that's<00:00:55.110> conclusive<00:00:55.710> enough<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.040> convince<00:00:56.309> me

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
that's conclusive enough to convince me

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.229 
that's conclusive enough to convince me
that<00:00:57.860> human<00:00:58.860> and<00:00:59.010> dinosaur<00:00:59.129> remains<00:00:59.579> are

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that human and dinosaur remains are

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.209 
that human and dinosaur remains are
found<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> same<00:01:00.960> sediments<00:01:01.440> ok<00:01:01.829> simply

found in the same sediments ok simply
not<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.870> then<00:01:04.080> Curt<00:01:04.710> what<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.039> do<00:01:05.190> with

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
not not so then Curt what do we do with

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.300 
not not so then Curt what do we do with
the<00:01:05.729> 1930s<00:01:06.509> what<00:01:06.630> was<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.869> Paluxy<00:01:07.140> River<00:01:07.320> Texas

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the 1930s what was it Paluxy River Texas

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.910 
the 1930s what was it Paluxy River Texas
they<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.000> claim<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.660> side<00:01:10.320> by<00:01:10.350> side<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
they the claim was it side by side you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.710 
they the claim was it side by side you
had<00:01:11.039> a<00:01:11.070> dinosaur<00:01:11.310> print<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.149> human<00:01:12.450> print

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.779 
had a dinosaur print and a human print
whatwhat<00:01:13.350> about<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.740> story<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.520> many

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
are found in the same sediments but

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.910 
are found in the same sediments but
subsequent<00:01:20.970> studies<00:01:21.330> indicated<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.590> far<00:01:22.800> as

subsequent studies indicated as far as

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.469 
subsequent studies indicated as far as
I'm<00:01:23.039> concerned<00:01:23.429> there's<00:01:23.850> definitely

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
I'm concerned there's definitely

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.810 
I'm concerned there's definitely
dinosaur<00:01:24.869> prints<00:01:25.200> there<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.670> no

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
dinosaur prints there but I see no

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.700 
dinosaur prints there but I see no
definite<00:01:27.210> evidence<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.659> human<00:01:27.960> prints<00:01:28.500> in

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
definite evidence of human prints in

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.160 
definite evidence of human prints in
those<00:01:28.950> anywhere<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.819> the<00:01:29.970> Paluxy<00:01:30.600> resist

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
those anywhere in the Paluxy resist

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.440 
those anywhere in the Paluxy resist
they're<00:01:31.409> not<00:01:31.619> there<00:01:31.979> he's<00:01:32.340> not<00:01:32.520> there<00:01:32.789> so<00:01:33.060> is

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
they're not there he's not there so is

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.219 
they're not there he's not there so is
there<00:01:33.810> evidence<00:01:34.050> of<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:35.340> cohabiting<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.479> this

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
there evidence of a cohabiting of this

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.980 
there evidence of a cohabiting of this
planet<00:01:37.619> at<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> same<00:01:38.100> time<00:01:38.430> no<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.180> humans<00:01:39.810> and

planet at the same time no of humans and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.270 
planet at the same time no of humans and
dinosaurs<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.530> would<00:01:40.649> say<00:01:40.740> no<00:01:40.890> physical

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
dinosaurs I would say no physical

00:01:41.280 --> 00:02:03.060 
dinosaurs I would say no physical
evidence

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.140 

there's<00:02:04.070> no<00:02:04.190> physical<00:02:04.400> evidence<00:02:04.670> for<00:02:05.090> it

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
there's no physical evidence for it

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.640 
there's no physical evidence for it
there's<00:02:05.570> no<00:02:05.690> physical<00:02:05.930> evidence<00:02:06.170> for<00:02:06.590> it

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
there's no physical evidence for it

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:51.430 
there's no physical evidence for it
there's<00:02:07.190> no<00:02:07.310> physical<00:02:07.580> evidence<00:02:07.790> for<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:50.440> so

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
there's no physical evidence for it so

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.850 
there's no physical evidence for it so
is<00:02:51.770> there<00:02:52.190> evidence<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.720> cohabiting<00:02:54.680> of

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
is there evidence of a cohabiting of

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.070 
is there evidence of a cohabiting of
this<00:02:55.610> planet<00:02:56.000> at<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.240> same<00:02:56.420> time

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
this planet at the same time

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.110 
this planet at the same time
no<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.560> humans<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.370> dinosaurs<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.880> would<00:02:59.030> say

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
no of humans and dinosaurs I would say

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.610 
no of humans and dinosaurs I would say
no<00:02:59.240> physical<00:02:59.660> evidence<00:02:59.959> no<00:03:00.020> physical

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
no physical evidence no physical

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
evidence well what kind of evidence is

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.520 
evidence well what kind of evidence is
there<00:03:02.480> then<00:03:02.660> there's<00:03:02.930> no<00:03:03.050> physical<00:03:03.290> evidence

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
there then there's no physical evidence

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.350 
there then there's no physical evidence
for<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.010> but<00:03:04.130> there<00:03:04.280> is<00:03:04.370> scriptural<00:03:04.970> evidence
