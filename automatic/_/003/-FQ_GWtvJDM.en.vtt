00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello exit to our review of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.259
 many merits of dehor of 1886 and matteo 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.530
 we wanted to have our say on the game vi 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.389
 I say my after it is certain I gave him 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.670
 7.8 because for me it is a game that 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.590
 obviously graphically technically yes 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.320
 defines many current canons of the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.210
 games on consoles not only on the side 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.609
 purely technical but also because 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.500
 however all the artistic side the care 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.760
 for the detail they compose a scene 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 which is fantastic 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.960
 a film is exactly the same as a film 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.579
 seems to live a piece of film 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.190
 black bands and have a little trouble after 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.530
 a little forget these bands 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.219
 obviously if you have a small monitor 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.620
 no 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.379
 the gameplay at the field jack and the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.809
 pessino left me a little bitter 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.700
 in the mouth but I'm not so negative in the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.840
 sense that the base is not bad is one 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.600
 third person shooter 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.640
 I like the physicality of the clashes and the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.989
 unfortunately diversification of weapons 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.230
 artificial intelligence enemies e 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.969
 school are very very very 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.129
 there is no standard when they attack you 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.110
 that sense of typical involvement of the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.150
 great titles like gears of war and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.040
 company and therefore it is much to improve 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.650
 and from this point of view however there is a 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 great potential is antonio tu 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.869
 you said well everything good but second 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.759
 myself 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.860
 you should have perhaps remarked the 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.930
 lack stronger than you in yours 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.729
 review is said all right ie 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.950
 we are talking about a shooter in 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.979
 third person with a strong component 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.930
 narrative with an exaggerated technical side 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.000
 but if you call it all shot 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.030
 you should shoot a lot more and 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.470
 above all it should be the shoot 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.170
 it should be much more rewarding 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.689
 second mary order sins a lot in this 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.299
 that when it comes to holding up the 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.399
 rifle and you have little fun doing the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.640
 spell you shoot enemies that are a 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.110
 a little stupid, but it ends there 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.549
 graphically beautiful a story 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.050
 interesting the comparison nor what 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.670
 you think 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.830
 we want to make cinema we want to do 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.830
 kubrick but here we have to do video games 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.950
 I think they should have chosen 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.560
 a different way or being a lot 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.360
 the focus would have been much more 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.619
 stronger on the shootings not on 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.550
 story because if i want to play one 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.350
 third person shooter 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.690
 I want to shoot and I want to shoot and 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.250
 have so much fun, I understand though 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.930
 first of all he sees who he was 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.780
 this name of shooter because 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.250
 many have put against her will want to 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.800
 comparison with gears of war but reality i 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.960
 developers have always said it was 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.150
 a game a strong native component of 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.190
 story that had some shooter phases e 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.020
 so obviously they are not done well 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.460
 they are lots of bass especially for 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.220
 regarding everything he has a 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.020
 what to do with enemies surely 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.920
 balancing and too much against 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.170
 parts of gameplay 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.720
 however the game is still a beautiful one 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.720
 experience to see from even from 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.920
 to appreciate from which to reason from 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.840
 this point of view me or why not 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.060
 I conceive the reviews they have 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.080
 given two three four five ie 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.930
 assoutenti you can agree 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.880
 maybe giving 76 and half tastes sound 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.380
 of the scale of values ​​of a site though 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.270
 who gave two three four and five 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.980
 I think he is in bad faith he has not 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.320
 understood nothing expected from the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.700
 game and therefore to the penalized second 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.290
 your tastes not according to a value 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.570
 objective is a title that has a great 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.090
 potential that is from ten of graphics and 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.620
 from 67 of the gameplay is averaged 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.480
 weighted in favor of institutions of course 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.280
 which then goes on 7 7 and a half 8 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.470
 then hopefully with the second 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.850
 chapter these defects which are clear 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.380
 and even developers have understood it 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.900
 be solved and make a masterpiece like 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.970
 maybe it was uncharted 2 is indeed 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.190
 antonio celli and base are those though 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.980
 in the second chapter you have to beat 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.660
 many 2 on the bite on the rhythm here you 10 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.310
 false expectations however is if you put me in 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.320
 hand a rifle and the apple camera then 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.780
 in the shoulders and in the movies he shows me 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.790
 especially moments when you shoot me 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.980
 I expect players to shoot 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.780
 in the third person if the shooter stages 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.610
 they are lacking compared to those 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.180
 narrative for me there is an antonio problem 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.500
 is and I would n't tell you to leave the comment 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.090
 to our users so if you have played 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.310
 the order however you have seen in 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.990
 heavily leave a comment on the 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.520
 our youtube channel let us know what 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.390
 think in the game if you agree with 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.970
 our vote to agree to co2 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.730
 with nine and a half that also existed 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.040
 however definitely of order i dehor 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.870
 of 1886 to a title intended to make 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.400
 to discuss and wait also to understand 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.400
 then how it will evolve to the saga
