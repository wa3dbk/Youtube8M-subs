00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.950
 hello my name is evgeny priests 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.019
 in this video I will tell you about the useful 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.289
 program for which he recently 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.240
 stumbled and she got accustomed she 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.520
 called web drive 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.199
 it allows you to connect 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.140
 certain resources 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.769
 such as your website such as google 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.990
 drive 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.030
 and the amazon s3 service for storing files 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.100
 as a separate virtual hard 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
 disk that is, as you say I 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.780
 now drive c there drive and drive as much as I 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.280
 Here, for example, here it will be possible 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.500
 connect let's say drive n which will be 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.149
 completely like a mirror of your site 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.000
 that is, you can go there to see 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.039
 immediately all the files on your site 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.350
 immediately copy and upload them from there 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.260
 there that is working with your site by 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.190
 Essentially as with a separate hard drive 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.090
 now you will see it all on an example 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.130
 after installing the web drive program you 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.189
 should be and see here such 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.640
 interface program it really is 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.979
 paid but 30 days it works in full 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.960
 fully functional completely 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.990
 for free that is for 30 days you can and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.170
 by test and after 30 days exactly 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.840
 you know, did she get caught up with you or not and 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.890
 is it worth buying it or not so 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.350
 let's try to connect 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.720
 some kind of site and hard drive 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.390
 from i press the new button 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.030
 here you need to choose exactly what we will 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.820
 connect as a separate drive i 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.110
 I tried to connect and box amazon 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.049
 s3 google drive 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.909
 everything works fine here now show 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.090
 how to connect an ordinary site 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.729
 choose for this ftp connection 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.840
 normal click next here we specify 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.329
 our ftp server 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.640
 if your hosting provider gave 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.689
 specific server now prescribe it 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.300
 here usually ftp server itself coincides with 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.440
 your website address by 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:16.970
 I just write my test site here 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.570
 and here we specify the login and password for ftp 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.570
 access 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.490
 so everything is stabbed 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.150
 test connection comes from me 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.250
 test connection they write to me that all 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.330
 connection successfully established by pressing 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.430
 claus and click next here indicate 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.530
 as it will be called the disk that is both 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.200
 that's what will be written in the description here 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.990
 Now I like a boot camp mac 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.780
 what you list will be written here 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.150
 price I will leave the site address 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.620
 here I immediately advise to tick 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.870
 connect when you run the program to 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.960
 this disc automatically turned on and 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.440
 here you can also choose a letter for here 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.200
 This virtual disk so all I press 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.120
 ready here he is not here now appeared 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.780
 need to connect with the right mouse button 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.180
 connect 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.760
 so here I am showing by example 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.409
 free version that is not yet 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.209
 paid therefore at the first 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.650
 the connection comes out such a window 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.980
 where you need to press the triple 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.980
 it 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.250
 all he joined and if i am now 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.090
 open my computer i will see that i have 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.770
 here is a separate disk w 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.080
 which if i go inside 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.550
 shows me all my contents 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.590
 the site here I can go to the root 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.750
 you can immediately register the root 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.470
 folder so that it automatically opens 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.170
 you root of your site 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.860
 for this you need to go right click 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.200
 mouse select properties so here 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.960
 go down to connection sightings a 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.760
 now these places here are the hands directory but 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.010
 here we can specify the root 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.970
 the directory in which you need to immediately 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.130
 open 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.940
 so for this, I'll just register 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.940
 it turns out 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.950
 but somehow I have for him public servers 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.630
 tml hear 10x became a dot ru in my 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.630
 If you have some 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:33.159
 ok so now he says 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.550
 will not be visible only after reconnect 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:41.250
 so I first turned it off not then 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.250
 reconnect right 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.280
 so that's it 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.919
 ethical access when accessing this 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.099
 the disk opens this directory already 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.199
 the root of my site is very convenient and if 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:58.130
 I say quickly need here is something 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:02.490
 copy or vice versa here 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:05.400
 download then i'm not opening any 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.340
 programs I just have my computer 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.560
 straight my site is already connected exactly 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.810
 you can connect as a separate disk 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.500
 to amazon of 3 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.110
 google drive dropbox and immediately 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.930
 have quick access to these your 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.540
 resources plus everything 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.660
 but let's say in the same amazon and more like 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:32.100
 you know there is such a function that files 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.900
 have access rights and through special 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.390
 programs there these permissions can be 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.850
 install or through the site right here 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.070
 in fact, there are such functions too 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.640
 you just right-click 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.500
 on some file go here and 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.720
 web drive menu 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.390
 here you will see additional 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.550
 opportunities that can be used 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.250
 that is, when you are allowed with amazon s3 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.760
 connect here there is an option to open 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.470
 public file access ie 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.710
 principle this program allows 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.690
 work fully with such resources and 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.280
 no need to put some some 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.780
 clients to connect 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.450
 that's basically all I wanted here 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.900
 tell so try I think 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:21.000
 you will like it convenient when fast 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:26.270
 access to the site can be done directly 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.270
 from a computer as a virtual disk
