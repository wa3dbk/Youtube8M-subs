00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.819
 hello cubero we continue in one minute 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.549
 known advanced venue in this video 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.129
 let's see the cases in the 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:13.280
 that we have the two pieces that we have 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:15.769
 interest together in another video we saw 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.260
 like when the white sticker is 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.180
 up two things can happen either 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.810
 we have the block already formed is removed and 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.030
 it goes where it goes or well as it is in 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.270
 this case that we already saw that was resolved 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:34.070
 with sexism in the comments give 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:36.800
 called and he made it clear to me that it's more effective 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.810
 do the anti sexy move then let's 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.620
 see it I will teach you with the sexmo 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:46.660
 because hereu ere prima or prima tres 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:50.360
 times and case resolved but it is true that 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.250
 to see if you're starting by improving 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.540
 well but it is true that already with the 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.309
 practice we will see that it is faster to do 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.840
 well instead of starting with ere there 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.720
 to change the hand here to do ere 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.309
 it would be to start with what we have 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.909
 here more by hand 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.159
 r raw premium so three times and also 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.100
 it is solved so thank you very much dani 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.960
 for the comment well white sticker 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.720
 up already solved we forgot about 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.939
 that what cases are left for us 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.520
 would be for example here is no longer the 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.690
 white sticker above we talk about the del 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.520
 orange and blue pair 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.920
 we have the case of two colors equal to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.170
 the right then we'll see the case of two 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.520
 same colors on the left but 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.280
 now it's on the right that we do 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.400
 when we find this case 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.590
 Well, how do I solve it? 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.590
 this corner here 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.640
 the hidden 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:58.150
 I move the edge here at his side to 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.750
 go up and have the pair formed you see it and 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:06.250
 and insert it as we know well what 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:09.270
 happens when we have the two colors in 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.510
 this case the pair is blue and red 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.640
 we have the same two colors in the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.890
 part of the left if they match then 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.450
 very similar to the other one actually 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.629
 I take me back to take the corner here 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.019
 I hide it here all the same and in 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:32.310
 instead of taking me the edge here I 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:36.150
 I'm going to take here 1 and 2 recovered the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.720
 corner and we see that automatically it 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.950
 we have formed a case 1 of f 2 l 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.340
 basic colors opposite over where 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.340
 have to go 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:53.950
 resolved case and we lack we lack or 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.870
 a situation that is already of course the 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.730
 white sticker is not up and only 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.650
 we need that happens when here 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.739
 they agree nothing at all then we 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.730
 we have to fix on two things in the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.819
 color above 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.409
 and in the color that we have in front of 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.959
 such way that separating the two pieces 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:19.129
 we have to look for an angle where they are 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:22.250
 the opposite colors for example I would 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:25.010
 I take it to the opposite corner 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.620
 you have to take the als corner to the 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.569
 opposite corner and here we see that 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.549
 we have the opposite colors this is what 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.430
 that we are interested if we were seeing 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.110
 the cube from here I do like that and no I do not 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.629
 this is interesting because they are the same colors 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.100
 we look for colors opposed to the 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.230
 circumstance what 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.350
 doing so we see the two colors 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:52.350
 opposites and what we do so simple 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:55.530
 like r &amp; r premium and if we form the for rv 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.270
 represses similar to the basic case 1 def and 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.560
 2 l 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:05.310
 and we insert it as we want 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.980
 the next video will be of inserts 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.010
 of pairs because we will see that there are several 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.250
 ways to insert the pairs and according to 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.930
 which we use especially in the last 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.239
 place in the last pair of effects he is 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.720
 depending on what we use we will have a case 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.430
 or another of or the l 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.780
 Well, I do not expect this video to be 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.850
 useful if any of these cases you have 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.330
 another more effective way to do it for 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.390
 supposed 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.500
 leave it in the comments and I'll 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.770
 I will thank you and everyone will thank you so 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.230
 that nothing cuberos to continue practicing and 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.230
 greetings to all see you later
