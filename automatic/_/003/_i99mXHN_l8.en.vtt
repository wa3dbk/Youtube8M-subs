00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.379
 the dawn to tie the chest and senac 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.990
 how to destroy that skyscraper dots 

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:09.840
 and the Shanghai siege of button was the 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.850
 room 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.830
 first educational 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.200
 I recommend left destroying dot soon 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.990
 A good face, a good point. 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.390
 strategy of defense unless it is 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.570
 very hard you resume the point you 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.360
 does the building here does not have four 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.980
 necklaces with two tank shots in each 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.950
 pillar you can take it down 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.790
 when you destroyed the fourth pillar 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.790
 building starts to collapse 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.780
 ultimately is a bit difficult 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.710
 turn if there was no one taking the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.710
 easy way 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:06.440
 Mother taking a shot is a little bit 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.440
 because the second round here 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.730
 during this turn will you roll a 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.280
 little lori here 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.320
 in the second newspaper 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.500
 the naive of the game lets you 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.330
 listen to everything only 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.060
 so as not to disturb the gutter too much 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.180
 gameplay they only limited that 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.790
 building 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.680
 option you can total destruction 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.660
 resorting to the knowledge that some 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.180
 pillars you can destroy others 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.670
 buildings but the building will collapse if 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.620
 get sport with credit can everything 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.620
 Let's increase the aim here in the last one. 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:52.030
 Lack of wonder, the destruction has begun. 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.560
 comes closer for you to have a 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.850
 privileged view and unfortunately half 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.010
 than the team was there at the base and 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.500
 I hope you forgive me beat him spout 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.240
 I hope you have enjoyed it and in 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.240
 power failure you have now 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.930
 I hope to see you there
