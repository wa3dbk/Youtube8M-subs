00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.870 
which gave Martin his biggest thrill
what<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.079> did<00:01:55.409> was<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.829> use<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.340> script<00:01:56.700> that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
what I did was to use the script that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.380 
what I did was to use the script that
Bleasdale<00:01:57.180> had<00:01:57.540> written<00:01:57.750> as<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.259> base<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
Bleasdale had written as my base and

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.080 
Bleasdale had written as my base and
then<00:02:00.390> used<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.960> lot<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.229> taped<00:02:02.189> interviews<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
then used a lot of taped interviews and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.740 
then used a lot of taped interviews and
videotapes<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.990> anything<00:02:04.920> visual<00:02:05.430> or

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
videotapes and anything visual or

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.999 
videotapes and anything visual or
audible<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.079> could<00:02:07.259> get<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.409> Elvis<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
audible that I could get on Elvis and

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.369 
audible that I could get on Elvis and
then<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.340> absorb<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:09.030> okay<00:02:10.020> having<00:02:10.229> work

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
then just absorb that okay having work

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.750 
then just absorb that okay having work
done<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:10.979> play

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
done on that play

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.300 
done on that play
