than we thought and it was very

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.850 
than we thought and it was very
difficult<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.299> our<00:01:09.390> costume<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
difficult to get our costume so it

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.260

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
beautifully you can see they've had a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.700 
beautifully you can see they've had a
really<00:01:37.399> unique<00:01:37.850> fade<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.720> them<00:01:38.899> it<00:01:39.680> just

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
really unique fade to them it just

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.460 
really unique fade to them it just
really<00:01:40.159> looks<00:01:40.250> great<00:01:40.759> it<00:01:41.630> looks<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.930> logo<00:01:42.259> pop

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470

out<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.880> these<00:01:44.030> pedals<00:01:44.420> are<00:01:44.689> actually<00:01:45.020> they

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
out and these pedals are actually they

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.859 
out and these pedals are actually they
insert<00:01:45.860> from<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.159> back<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:47.750> an

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
insert from the back so this is an

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.770 
insert from the back so this is an
entire<00:01:48.259> rubber<00:01:48.649> piece<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.820> goes<00:01:50.000> in<00:01:50.060> which

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
entire rubber piece that goes in which

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.330 
entire rubber piece that goes in which
means<00:01:51.050> they<00:01:51.170> can't<00:01:51.409> break<00:01:51.740> off<00:01:51.950> from<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
means they can't break off from the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.080 
means they can't break off from the
front<00:01:54.069> sold<00:01:55.069> a<00:01:55.159> lot<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.399> these<00:01:55.520> pedals<00:01:55.819> people
