one of them being casters I've come up

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.589 
one of them being casters I've come up
with<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.500> little<00:00:13.830> rig<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.250> fish<00:00:14.429> casters<00:00:15.030> it

with a little rig to fish casters it

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.830 
with a little rig to fish casters it
involves<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.320> small<00:00:16.949> piece<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.609> zig<00:00:18.390> rig<00:00:18.570> foam

involves a small piece of zig rig foam
and<00:00:19.470> I've<00:00:19.560> super<00:00:20.010> glued<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:21.210> fake<00:00:22.020> casters

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
and I've super glued for fake casters

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.040 
and I've super glued for fake casters
around<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> outside<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.240> made<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> nice

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
around the outside of it and made a nice

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.080 
around the outside of it and made a nice
little<00:00:25.289> balanced<00:00:25.740> rig<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.189> go<00:00:26.310> inside<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.670> PVA

bag<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:28.730> fished<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> rig<00:00:30.000> inside<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.689> large<00:00:31.529> bulk

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
bag I fished the rig inside a large bulk

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.700 
bag I fished the rig inside a large bulk
PVA<00:00:32.940> bag<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.480> casters<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.230> tend<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.559> fish

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
PVA bag of casters and I tend to fish

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.220 
PVA bag of casters and I tend to fish
them<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> clear<00:00:35.520> spots<00:00:36.079> one<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
them on the clear spots one of the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.290 
them on the clear spots one of the
reasons<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.739> casters<00:00:38.370> seem<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.059> very

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
reasons that casters seem to be very

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.420 
reasons that casters seem to be very
effective<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.200> initially<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.950> visual

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
effective is initially is the visual

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.000 
effective is initially is the visual
factor<00:00:41.879> they're<00:00:42.600> very<00:00:42.809> sort<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.230> bright<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.860> in

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
factor they're very sort of bright in in

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.590 
factor they're very sort of bright in in
your<00:00:44.129> face<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> fish<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.910> see<00:00:45.120> them<00:00:45.360> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
your face and the fish can see them and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.840 
your face and the fish can see them and
once<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.140> feed<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.890> them<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.399> something

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
once they do feed on them is something

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.000 
once they do feed on them is something
different<00:00:48.090> something<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:49.050> they<00:00:49.289> tend<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
different something that they tend to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.850 
different something that they tend to
have<00:00:50.160> probably<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.850> seen<00:00:50.910> before<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.739> has

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
have probably not seen before and it has

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.650 
have probably not seen before and it has
one<00:00:53.070> hell<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.399> crunch<00:00:53.670> factor<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.270> think<00:00:54.480> once

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
one hell of a crunch factor I think once

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.750 
one hell of a crunch factor I think once
they<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.530> start<00:00:55.739> feeding<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
they get in and start feeding on it the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.119 
they get in and start feeding on it the
casters<00:00:57.210> are<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.420> crunching<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
casters are all crunching up and it

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.459 
casters are all crunching up and it
releases<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.699> their<00:00:59.879> natural<00:01:00.030> juices<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
releases all their natural juices and it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.070 
releases all their natural juices and it
seems<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.890> really<00:01:02.070> work<00:01:02.370> another<00:01:03.210> reason<00:01:03.719> why

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
seems to really work another reason why

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.690 
seems to really work another reason why
casters<00:01:04.680> might<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:05.040> an<00:01:05.100> advantage<00:01:05.220> over

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
casters might be an advantage over

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.300 
casters might be an advantage over
maggots<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:07.049> because<00:01:07.409> they<00:01:07.560> don't<00:01:07.710> crawl<00:01:08.040> away

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
maggots is because they don't crawl away

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.800 
maggots is because they don't crawl away
like<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> maggots<00:01:09.030> might<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.420> The<00:01:09.570> Magus

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
like the maggots might do The Magus

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.179 
like the maggots might do The Magus
might<00:01:09.960> crawl<00:01:10.200> into<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> seal<00:01:10.799> whereas<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
might crawl into the seal whereas the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.920 
might crawl into the seal whereas the
casters<00:01:11.640> will<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.119> lay<00:01:12.299> there<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:12.900> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
casters will just lay there and have a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.810 
casters will just lay there and have a
nice<00:01:13.110> little<00:01:13.380> pile<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.860> bait<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.610> clear

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
nice little pile of bait on the clear

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.420 
nice little pile of bait on the clear
spot<00:01:15.150> ready<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> fish<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:15.990> eat<00:01:16.430> well

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
spot ready for the fish to eat well

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.190 
spot ready for the fish to eat well
though<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.700> bag<00:01:17.970> does<00:01:18.210> look<00:01:18.450> very<00:01:18.689> big<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
though this bag does look very big and

though this bag does look very big and
has<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> three<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.890> half<00:01:20.070> ounce<00:01:20.280> lead<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.729> it

has a three and a half ounce lead in it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.910 
has a three and a half ounce lead in it
by<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> time<00:01:21.659> I've<00:01:21.810> rounded<00:01:22.049> off<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> corners

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
by the time I've rounded off the corners

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.310 
by the time I've rounded off the corners
and<00:01:23.100> made<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.430> aerodynamic<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.780> still<00:01:25.020> cast

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and made it aerodynamic I can still cast

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.710 
and made it aerodynamic I can still cast
it<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.799> excess<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.369> 60<00:01:26.759> yards<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.450> great

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
it in excess of 60 yards with great

up<00:01:30.479> my<00:01:30.509> PVA<00:01:30.990> bags<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.530> always<00:01:31.950> pull<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> hook

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
up my PVA bags I always pull the hook

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.640 
up my PVA bags I always pull the hook
point<00:01:32.759> through<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> bottom<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> bag<00:01:34.079> this

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
point through the bottom of the bag this

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.590 
point through the bottom of the bag this
stops<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.130> from<00:01:35.159> penetrating<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.970> caster

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
stops it from penetrating the caster

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600 
stops it from penetrating the caster
which<00:01:37.110> means<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.590> pop<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> caster<00:01:38.430> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
which means it will pop the caster and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
which means it will pop the caster and
the<00:01:38.790> caster<00:01:39.150> will<00:01:39.390> melt<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.259> PVA<00:01:40.590> bag<00:01:40.890> also

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
the caster will melt the PVA bag also

are<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.850> effective<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.869> because<00:02:03.930> they're

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
are so effective is because they're
