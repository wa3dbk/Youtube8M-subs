trying to figure out how to build them
for<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.620> TCG<00:00:14.040> because<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.700> get<00:00:14.820> some<00:00:15.059> really

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
broken exclusives that make us able to

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.060 
broken exclusives that make us able to
build<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.510> much<00:00:18.720> better<00:00:19.050> deck<00:00:19.320> than<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> ocg

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
engine that will be applied into it just

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.060 
engine that will be applied into it just
to<00:00:30.689> go<00:00:30.840> ahead<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.140> cover<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> bases<00:00:31.859> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
basics just so people aren't like later

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.190 
basics just so people aren't like later
on<00:00:35.399> like<00:00:35.579> why<00:00:36.180> are<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.390> doing<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.750> why<00:00:36.960> doing

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
on like why are you doing this why doing

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.450 
on like why are you doing this why doing
that<00:00:37.460> basically<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
that basically you have to have the

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.000 
that basically you have to have the
old-school<00:00:41.460> dragon<00:00:41.879> engine<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:43.440> deck<00:00:43.739> in

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
old-school dragon engine in this deck in

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.360 
old-school dragon engine in this deck in
order<00:00:44.750> to<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.050> function<00:00:46.800> quickly

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
order to have it function quickly

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.430 
order to have it function quickly
because<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.390> know<00:00:48.480> darkness<00:00:48.930> metal<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
because you know darkness metal is

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.799 
because you know darkness metal is
arguably<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> most<00:00:50.969> broken<00:00:51.360> cards<00:00:51.719> in

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809

arguably one of the most broken cards in
the<00:00:51.899> game<00:00:52.039> darkness<00:00:53.039> metal<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.520> pretty<00:00:53.940> much

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the game darkness metal is pretty much

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.080 
the game darkness metal is pretty much
the<00:00:54.120> single-handed<00:00:54.930> reason<00:00:55.320> why<00:00:55.730> up<00:00:56.730> until

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the single-handed reason why up until

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.490 
the single-handed reason why up until
now<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.539> haven't<00:00:57.750> been<00:00:57.899> able<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.140> print<00:00:58.320> any

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
now they haven't been able to print any

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.770 
now they haven't been able to print any

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.880 
honestly it might be one of those ocg
exclusives<00:03:25.050> so<00:03:26.050> we<00:03:26.230> might<00:03:26.380> have<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.650> replace

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890

it with why brands and honestly from

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.860 
it with why brands and honestly from
what<00:03:29.800> i<00:03:29.830> see<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.640> most<00:03:30.820> from<00:03:31.270> what<00:03:31.420> I'm<00:03:31.510> tested

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
what i see the most from what I'm tested

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.600 
what i see the most from what I'm tested
so<00:03:31.990> far<00:03:32.020> the<00:03:32.260> most<00:03:32.380> consistent<00:03:32.740> thing<00:03:33.460> that

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
so far the most consistent thing that

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.700 
so far the most consistent thing that
I've<00:03:33.700> found<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.240> to<00:03:34.690> darkness<00:03:35.170> metals<00:03:35.560> and

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
I've found is to darkness metals and

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.320 
I've found is to darkness metals and
three<00:03:35.860> wyverns<00:03:36.250> because<00:03:36.850> three<00:03:37.060> darkest

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
three wyverns because three darkest

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.390 
three wyverns because three darkest
metals<00:03:37.660> is<00:03:37.840> too<00:03:38.260> redundant<00:03:38.590> but<00:03:39.040> i'm<00:03:39.130> sure

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
metals is too redundant but i'm sure

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.700 
metals is too redundant but i'm sure

future<00:05:10.430> fusion<00:05:10.639> our<00:05:10.819> Foolish<00:05:11.150> there's<00:05:11.569> no<00:05:11.840> way

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
future fusion our Foolish there's no way

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.839 
future fusion our Foolish there's no way
around<00:05:12.080> it<00:05:12.349> and<00:05:12.529> basically<00:05:13.189> they<00:05:13.550> just<00:05:13.580> make

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
around it and basically they just make

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:15.749 
around it and basically they just make
the<00:05:13.939> deck<00:05:14.060> a<00:05:14.090> lot<00:05:14.330> more<00:05:14.449> consistent<00:05:14.960> because

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
the deck a lot more consistent because

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.980 
the deck a lot more consistent because
you<00:05:16.759> don't<00:05:16.909> rely<00:05:17.210> on<00:05:17.240> future<00:05:17.629> fusion<00:05:17.839> or

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
you don't rely on future fusion or

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.749 
you don't rely on future fusion or
foolish<00:05:18.319> but<00:05:18.889> there's<00:05:19.099> just<00:05:19.250> an<00:05:19.310> extra<00:05:19.550> card

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
foolish but there's just an extra card

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.909 
foolish but there's just an extra card
like<00:05:20.089> in<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:21.139> deck<00:05:21.259> I've<00:05:21.409> been<00:05:21.560> playing<00:05:21.740> I've
