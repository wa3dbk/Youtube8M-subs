00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
not a fan of these one reason is because

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.369 
not a fan of these one reason is because
these<00:00:54.899> clips<00:00:55.730> do<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:56.879> fit<00:00:58.010> on<00:00:59.930> this<00:01:00.930> very<00:01:01.199> well

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
these clips do not fit on this very well

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.560 
these clips do not fit on this very well
it<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:02.070> tilts<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.760> basically<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.239> does

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
it it tilts and it basically just does

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.289 
it it tilts and it basically just does
not<00:01:03.690> work<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.549> turn<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.880> I've<00:01:06.150> also

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
not work I turn like that I've also

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.260 
not work I turn like that I've also
tried<00:01:06.689> them<00:01:07.100> upside<00:01:08.100> down<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.729> still<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.240> not

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
tried them upside down they still do not

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.130 
tried them upside down they still do not
work<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.840> because<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.350> bars<00:01:10.560> are<00:01:10.860> too<00:01:11.130> small

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
work just because the bars are too small

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.219

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.310 

still<00:05:36.560> no<00:05:36.770> major<00:05:37.070> effects<00:05:37.490> though<00:05:38.199> with<00:05:39.199> it

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
still no major effects though with it

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.839 
still no major effects though with it
being<00:05:39.500> a<00:05:39.590> lot<00:05:39.740> colder<00:05:39.949> than<00:05:40.039> my<00:05:40.280> freezer<00:05:40.550> it

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
being a lot colder than my freezer it

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.879 
being a lot colder than my freezer it
does<00:05:41.150> fog<00:05:41.389> which<00:05:41.840> I<00:05:42.020> can<00:05:42.229> speak<00:05:42.560> of<00:05:42.710> from

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
does fog which I can speak of from

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.710 
does fog which I can speak of from
experience<00:05:43.430> so<00:05:44.120> again<00:05:44.300> I<00:05:44.330> would<00:05:44.690> not

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
experience so again I would not

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.000 
experience so again I would not
recommend<00:05:46.449> a<00:05:47.449> visor<00:05:47.870> in<00:05:48.199> the<00:05:48.349> cold<00:05:48.680> or<00:05:48.830> rain

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
recommend a visor in the cold or rain

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.060 
recommend a visor in the cold or rain
