00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.610
 I would like to tell you that if you have a 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.550
 great appetite is because you still have a 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.800
 Big stomach 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.130
 I 'm going to help you reduce the size 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.230
 with two tips in this video you can 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.310
 lose weight without having to do much 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.800
 exercise without drastic diets just look 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.810
 It takes two minutes to watch this video so that 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.380
 you can solve this once and for all 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.390
 all 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.600
 very well let's see what they are about 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.430
 the first is the next walk in 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.220
 a slope 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.200
 If you already go for a walk, you probably 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.590
 you have realized that you are not going to take 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.220
 the weight very fast unless you can 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.010
 walk on a slope or on a hill 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.750
 then you will lose weight very fast 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.640
 as you will see there is a big difference 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.700
 Regarding walking on a surface 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.900
 flat or on a flat ribbon instead of 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.780
 inclined ribbons and hills 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.050
 your body basically yawns when walking 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.600
 on flat surfaces anyway 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.970
 so you can lose weight faster 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.240
 you must walk on a tape that you can 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.760
 lean to 15 degrees walk on the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.580
 tape for at least 20 minutes a day 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.820
 four days a week that's it 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.700
 the second is the next add two 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.670
 apples and a can of black beans a 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.400
 your daily diet no matter what you eat 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.340
 nowadays I'm not going to try that what 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.520
 change in this video but if I want that 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.890
 just do these two things add two 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.050
 apples in your daily diet and also 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.890
 add a can of black beans for 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.340
 a meal or divide it between two meals 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.020
 for many people a digestive tract 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.810
 inefficient is holding back progress 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.570
 to lose weight by adding 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.690
 about 35 grams of fiber to your diet 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.420
 daily 10 grams of the two apples and 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.060
 25 grams of a can of black beans 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.940
 is to boost your potential to burn 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.430
 grease 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.430
 so if you have a big stomach 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.160
 This is a definite and easy way to 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.340
 begin to reduce its size and without doing 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.970
