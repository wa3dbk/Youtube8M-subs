00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.359
 ever made a glaze of 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:12.500
 barbecue sauce and coconut milk no 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.500
 then stay tuned to hit the grill 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.220
 Today we do some partaking 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.220
 send 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.720
 we start with a few 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.180
 chicken legs this is nature 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.490
 and respect free-roaming 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.260
 Chicken this great I taste great 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.520
 and that comes before all things synonymous 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.219
 a better attitude than we do that 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.600
 meadow yard and watch 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.980
 here we separate the Schlegel from 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.359
 backside there you have to feel once 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.140
 approximately where the joint is once again 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.909
 cut through 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.670
 while sharp knife has and there 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.739
 not quite the same it does not matter 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.210
 bones still in the middle is the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.010
 must send for our muffin pen 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.469
 it will be removed here 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.389
 cool video of text from black forest 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.809
 ptv who explains you to someone i am 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:59.190
 I do not send for penn 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.769
 someone rush through with one 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.369
 small knife all bones trigger the 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.930
 in the interior of this chicken are partly 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.750
 that is a very dirty job and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.909
 takes a little longer but that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.170
 result makes up for it all the more 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.909
 as so often and when that's done 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.320
 and the bone, then fired 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.770
 we have such a part with skin and 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.189
 then meat and packing your side 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.189
 Let's take half a can of coconut milk 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.110
 crazy chicken that is also a don 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.580
 markus babbel spice from my show 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.620
 who got from those then come 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.240
 to a few roughly diced 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:54.880
 garlic cloves something very coarse ginger 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.880
 a few snowflakes and lime juice 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.760
 Lime juice can be where I am neat 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.650
 purely 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.330
 I think that's just fine, I'm standing there 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.690
 on it again a whole the mette 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.090
 because the precise disclosures course 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.300
 again and again in the video description 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.530
 below the videos 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.850
 yes and then we lose all that well 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.850
 and finished is our marinade 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.980
 since I have a muffin baking mold for six 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.950
 make people, so to speak, gotten 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.130
 of course I have six munich too 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.900
 Keulen separated and triggered and this 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.410
 then we pack our marinade and 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:49.330
 then let the six to eight hours 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.980
 pull in the marinade and more 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.630
 that mixes up everywhere 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.630
 and then off in cooling 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.380
 when we are ready and that is 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.270
 Everything is beautifully taken care of 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.700
 a few chili peppers in the fall in the 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.040
 three to four teams just aside 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.840
 then we have to chicken things out 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.740
 take out of the marinade and 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.050
 pat dry 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.130
 in that case I have seen afterwards 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.720
 that you even tick one better 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.320
 dry dab everything that they did 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.230
 have a bit of help later 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.230
 well then we need apricots something 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.570
 I need bacon and the butter in the end 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.440
 Not 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.910
 I thought I just want one 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.570
 a bit of a mute is a stereo 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.080
 real and our muffin baking mold always in 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.760
 background 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.520
 and now we feel make our 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.450
 send the brand homemade freestyle 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.680
 idea of ​​me apricot shilling 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.660
 depending on how big your chicken pieces 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.940
 Half an apricot is enough 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.070
 It must be clear that they are getting very tall 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.690
 with a whole apricot in it is enough 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.930
 even if half a apricot takes 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:04:03.810
 some chili fills and these in pool 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:06.150
 the whole thing looks like this and 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.280
 then we feel that in the mines 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.920
 side of our teeth package is so that 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.820
 The skin outside is closing that and 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.609
 Put that in our akin baking mold 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.560
 See this ribbon bafin is relative 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.330
 I only have big with the others 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.980
 another half are removed 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.360
 a fat little and someone you too 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.080
 already that there is something too much marinade 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.870
 with this is that just across the 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.860
 grill something a bit crazy then 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.050
 chicken wrap on top and then you can 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.880
 we're already green to our monolith 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.760
 We have prepared for this 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.420
 circa 160 degrees indirect heat reflector 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.790
 stone in the middle 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.310
 and then we pack our cain 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.570
 Send in front with the felt 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.860
 chicken parts pure 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.860
 that's the whole thing 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:00.009
 I believe that for about the same time 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:05:00.550
 20 minutes the whole thing a little smaller 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.159
 has become 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.900
 In the meantime , ours will take care of it 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.699
 we can not take the group here 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.889
 rest of our coconut milk can and then 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.419
 we give save us says, as already 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:15.610
 a marinade in the case even the 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.779
 double part and barbecue sauce that is 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.699
 Overall, a large amount so much 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:20.979
 I do not need you at all 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.419
 I tried coconut milk and barbecue 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.159
 sauce about the same 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.080
 to mix with each other 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:27.610
 that is abundant we need in the end 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.710
 not then we take the muffins 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:34.240
 shape out and put out of our pack 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.259
 These are still on our lust travel 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.749
 and moscow on direct heat though 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:44.319
 fair enough to say that now there the 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:48.330
 heat development, he is middle direct 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.330
 heat otherwise diana deep recover 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:57.939
 you see they stay even 

00:05:52.119 --> 00:06:00.009
 relatively good in shape and 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:02.830
 Now we'll mark them with you 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:05.919
 our mix of focus milk the 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:13.119
 metten sauce, the juice segments barbecue 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:17.639
 sauce and then leave them five more 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:17.639
 until ten more minutes on the grill 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.030
 this is what they look like when they are done 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.889
 I find it very appetizing 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.090
 I get up to send the pen 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:40.710
 that we also do not guarantee that 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:42.360
 last video so I think it's great me 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.419
 I like it, that's really nice 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.330
 a good mix of sweet and by the 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:51.180
 lime a certain acidity 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.229
 coconut coconut milk super good as long 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.820
 I would be happy to watch 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:56.010
 First let me grill 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.270
 know every case if I know 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.300
 you did that, you found it 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.229
