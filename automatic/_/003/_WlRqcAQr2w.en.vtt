you<00:00:06.559> can<00:00:06.740> see<00:00:06.979> actually<00:00:07.340> independent<00:00:07.880> leg

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029 
you can see actually independent leg

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.570 
you can see actually independent leg
movement<00:00:08.540> and<00:00:08.750> you<00:00:09.590> can<00:00:09.620> see<00:00:09.920> back<00:00:10.160> to<00:00:10.190> forth

movement and you can see back to forth
how<00:00:10.790> it<00:00:10.910> actually<00:00:11.089> gives<00:00:11.990> but<00:00:12.290> that's<00:00:12.469> not<00:00:12.650> why

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
how it actually gives but that's not why

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.919 
how it actually gives but that's not why
I'm<00:00:13.160> sure<00:00:13.459> because<00:00:13.700> this<00:00:13.969> is<00:00:14.120> this<00:00:14.690> has

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
I'm sure because this is this has

your bike and you cannot relate to these
forces<00:00:20.150> and<00:00:20.689> that's<00:00:21.050> why<00:00:21.730> you<00:00:22.730> put<00:00:22.760> that<00:00:22.910> on

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
forces and that's why you put that on

forces and that's why you put that on
there<00:00:23.269> I<00:00:23.420> put<00:00:23.720> some<00:00:23.900> wheels<00:00:24.109> I<00:00:24.500> took<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:25.009> some

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
there I put some wheels I took to some

your bike's car is forces from the side
okay<00:00:48.920> right<00:00:49.520> it's<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.240> forces<00:00:50.600> that<00:00:50.630> are

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
okay right it's the forces that are

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.150 
okay right it's the forces that are
going<00:00:50.900> to<00:00:50.960> go<00:00:51.110> against<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:51.560> wheel<00:00:51.740> to<00:00:51.920> tire

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
going to go against the wheel to tire

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.980 
going to go against the wheel to tire
you'll<00:00:52.670> have<00:00:52.850> some<00:00:53.060> inherent<00:00:53.210> it<00:00:53.540> flex<00:00:53.780> in<00:00:53.900> the

you'll have some inherent it flex in the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.300 
you'll have some inherent it flex in the
wheel<00:00:54.140> that's<00:00:54.350> normal<00:00:54.770> you<00:00:54.800> can<00:00:54.920> see<00:00:55.040> it

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
wheel that's normal you can see it

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.010 
wheel that's normal you can see it
flexes<00:00:55.670> a<00:00:55.700> bit<00:00:55.850> but<00:00:56.270> after<00:00:56.420> that<00:00:56.660> but<00:00:56.900> actually

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
flexes a bit but after that but actually

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.810 
flexes a bit but after that but actually
you<00:00:57.710> can<00:00:57.860> see<00:00:58.010> it's<00:00:58.130> only<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.460> wheel<00:00:58.640> the

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
you can see it's only the wheel the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.000 
you can see it's only the wheel the
forks<00:00:59.090> not<00:00:59.240> doing<00:00:59.510> anything<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.260> then<00:01:00.710> you

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
forks not doing anything and then you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.970 
forks not doing anything and then you
still<00:01:01.250> is<00:01:01.460> still<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:02.930> can<00:01:03.080> still<00:01:03.320> receive<00:01:03.620> an

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
still is still you can still receive an

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.679 
still is still you can still receive an
obstacle<00:01:04.309> right<00:01:04.610> you<00:01:04.760> go<00:01:04.879> in<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.059> corner<00:01:05.449> you<00:01:05.570> go

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
obstacle right you go in a corner you go

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.630 
obstacle right you go in a corner you go
over<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.049> rock<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:06.590> go<00:01:06.740> through<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.130> water<00:01:07.369> bar

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
over a rock you go through a water bar

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.330 
over a rock you go through a water bar
or<00:01:07.789> something<00:01:08.179> and<00:01:08.359> you<00:01:08.420> see<00:01:08.750> how<00:01:09.320> how<00:01:10.280> the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
or something and you see how how the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.249 
or something and you see how how the
wheel<00:01:10.579> gets<00:01:10.820> deflected<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.539> then<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:12.049> get<00:01:12.140> an

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
wheel gets deflected and then you get an

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.810 
wheel gets deflected and then you get an
impact<00:01:12.679> and<00:01:12.950> then<00:01:13.219> what<00:01:13.429> it's<00:01:13.549> done<00:01:13.700> it's

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
impact and then what it's done it's

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.219 
impact and then what it's done it's
crucial<00:01:14.359> that<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.570> don't<00:01:14.719> get<00:01:14.810> knocked<00:01:15.049> off

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
crucial that you don't get knocked off

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.230 
crucial that you don't get knocked off
your<00:01:15.439> trail<00:01:15.649> so<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.159> get<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.369> side<00:01:16.609> load<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.149> if

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
your trail so you get a side load and if

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.090 
your trail so you get a side load and if
the<00:01:17.509> fortunes<00:01:17.929> still<00:01:18.109> work<00:01:18.320> as<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.770> matter<00:01:19.009> of

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
the fortunes still work as a matter of

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.010 
the fortunes still work as a matter of
fact<00:01:19.280> we<00:01:19.429> cannot<00:01:19.640> really<00:01:19.880> big<00:01:20.179> you<00:01:20.749> know<00:01:20.840> look

that's<00:01:28.460> just<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:29.060> way<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:29.420> they<00:01:30.289> can

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
that's just the way to you they can

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.719 
that's just the way to you they can
break<00:01:30.649> in<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.979> little<00:01:31.189> bit<00:01:31.310> but<00:01:31.520> when<00:01:31.640> they

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
break in a little bit but when they

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.660 
break in a little bit but when they
break<00:01:31.969> in<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.270> develop<00:01:32.659> more<00:01:32.840> play<00:01:33.460> here<00:01:34.460> you

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
break in to develop more play here you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.260 
break in to develop more play here you
can<00:01:34.819> see<00:01:34.969> there's<00:01:35.210> no<00:01:35.390> station<00:01:36.460> so<00:01:37.460> but<00:01:37.759> when<00:01:38.240> I

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
can see there's no station so but when I

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.899 
can see there's no station so but when I
start<00:01:38.749> moving<00:01:39.710> this<00:01:39.829> when<00:01:40.039> I<00:01:40.069> siloed<00:01:40.579> you<00:01:40.759> can

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
start moving this when I siloed you can

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.249 
start moving this when I siloed you can
actually<00:01:41.060> see<00:01:41.420> already<00:01:41.659> here

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
actually see already here

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.230 
actually see already here
the<00:01:42.439> independent<00:01:43.130> leg<00:01:43.280> movement<00:01:43.729> this<00:01:43.880> moves

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
the independent leg movement this moves

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.450 
the independent leg movement this moves
independent<00:01:44.990> from<00:01:45.139> this<00:01:45.350> because<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:46.310> only

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
independent from this because you only

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.419 
independent from this because you only
have<00:01:46.729> this<00:01:46.909> bridge<00:01:47.240> this<00:01:47.689> bridge<00:01:47.749> and<00:01:48.319> the<00:01:48.889> hub

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
have this bridge this bridge and the hub

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.149 
have this bridge this bridge and the hub
that's<00:01:49.880> connecting<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.539> so<00:01:50.689> when<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.979> you<00:01:51.979> can

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
that's connecting it so when I you can

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.160 
that's connecting it so when I you can
see<00:01:52.369> how<00:01:52.549> this<00:01:52.700> goes<00:01:52.939> up<00:01:53.149> this<00:01:53.539> goes<00:01:53.600> in<00:01:54.020> and

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
see how this goes up this goes in and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.889 
see how this goes up this goes in and
this<00:01:54.229> goes<00:01:54.439> out<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:55.210> this<00:01:56.210> actually<00:01:56.509> deflects

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
this goes out and this actually deflects

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.919 
this goes out and this actually deflects
the<00:01:57.020> more<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:57.439> we<00:01:57.560> will<00:01:57.859> even<00:01:58.069> more<00:01:58.340> okay<00:01:59.209> but

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
the more that we will even more okay but

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.169 
the more that we will even more okay but
what's<00:02:00.170> what<00:02:00.439> actually<00:02:00.829> worse<00:02:01.039> is<00:02:01.369> now<00:02:01.609> you

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
what's what actually worse is now you

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.899 
what's what actually worse is now you
know<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.299> can<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:02.749> can<00:02:02.929> actually<00:02:03.170> move<00:02:03.319> it<00:02:03.469> if<00:02:03.560> I

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
know I can I can actually move it if I

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.749 
know I can I can actually move it if I
and<00:02:04.689> I<00:02:04.900> can<00:02:05.200> move<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.470> but<00:02:05.619> if<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:05.890> start<00:02:06.280> just

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
and I can move it but if I start just

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.100 
and I can move it but if I start just
side<00:02:07.030> load<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.270> little<00:02:07.420> bit<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:10.720> act<00:02:10.929> this

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
side load a little bit and that act this

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.010 
side load a little bit and that act this
is<00:02:11.230> not<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> lot<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:11.680> force<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:12.130> mean<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.209> you

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
is not a lot of force I mean and you

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.020 
is not a lot of force I mean and you
could<00:02:14.260> get<00:02:14.380> you're<00:02:14.530> welcome<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.980> try<00:02:15.130> de<00:02:15.280> just

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
could get you're welcome to try de just

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.000 
could get you're welcome to try de just
to<00:02:16.150> see<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.840> that's<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.319> principle<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
to see and that's the principle of the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.140 
to see and that's the principle of the
bushings<00:02:18.370> that's<00:02:18.520> how<00:02:18.610> they<00:02:18.760> work<00:02:18.940> because

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
bushings that's how they work because

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.690 
bushings that's how they work because
these<00:02:19.330> these<00:02:19.780> are<00:02:19.959> round<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.380> round<00:02:20.620> here<00:02:21.520> we

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
these these are round and round here we

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.210 
these these are round and round here we
have<00:02:21.880> square<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.600> square<00:02:22.950> square<00:02:23.950> tube

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
have square and square square tube

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.740 
have square and square square tube
inside<00:02:24.520> square<00:02:24.880> scooped<00:02:25.209> on<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.390> outside

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
inside square scooped on the outside

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.690 
inside square scooped on the outside
we've<00:02:25.930> got<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.140> needle<00:02:26.319> burns<00:02:26.560> around<00:02:26.739> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
we've got the needle burns around the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.490 
we've got the needle burns around the
edges<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> lot<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.510> can<00:02:28.690> option<00:02:29.050> them<00:02:29.230> because

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
edges a lot you can option them because

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.729 
edges a lot you can option them because
there's<00:02:29.680> flat<00:02:29.980> them<00:02:30.190> flat<00:02:30.400> here<00:02:31.590> we<00:02:32.590> have

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
there's flat them flat here we have

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.550 
there's flat them flat here we have
round<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.340> round<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.880> then<00:02:34.720> we<00:02:34.930> use<00:02:35.350> this

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
round and round and then we use this

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.040 
round and round and then we use this
bridge<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.209> try<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.569> avoid

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
bridge it is and this to try to avoid

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.750 
bridge it is and this to try to avoid
that<00:02:38.110> they<00:02:38.410> twist<00:02:38.860> against<00:02:39.160> each<00:02:39.280> other<00:02:39.459> and

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
that they twist against each other and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.970 
that they twist against each other and
this<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.540> what<00:02:40.810> what<00:02:41.350> we're<00:02:41.470> demonstrate<00:02:41.890> it

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
this is what what we're demonstrate it

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.160 
this is what what we're demonstrate it
right<00:02:42.160> here<00:02:42.400> trended<00:02:45.090> okay<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.630> is<00:02:46.810> why

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
right here trended okay and this is why

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.860 
right here trended okay and this is why
it<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.000> benefit<00:02:49.420> for<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.690> rider

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
it is this is the benefit for the rider

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.030 
it is this is the benefit for the rider
when<00:02:50.080> they've<00:02:50.200> blended<00:02:50.380> when<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.680> customer

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
when they've blended when the customer

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.380 
when they've blended when the customer
says<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.900> technique<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.860> then<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.280> say<00:02:54.519> that

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
says the technique and then you say that

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.600 
says the technique and then you say that
bell<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.080> they<00:02:56.470> say<00:02:56.680> why<00:02:56.890> they<00:02:57.250> say<00:02:57.430> because

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
bell and they say why they say because

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.190 
bell and they say why they say because
it's<00:02:57.760> stiffer<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.239> can<00:02:58.390> explain<00:02:58.750> this<00:02:58.930> differ

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
it's stiffer you can explain this differ

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.660 
it's stiffer you can explain this differ
because<00:02:59.410> these<00:02:59.620> points<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.130> everybody<00:03:00.489> who's

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
because these points and everybody who's

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.970 
because these points and everybody who's
somewhat<00:03:01.480> technically<00:03:01.900> minded<00:03:02.140> you'll<00:03:02.650> see

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
somewhat technically minded you'll see

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.490 
somewhat technically minded you'll see
that<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:03.940> this<00:03:04.660> is<00:03:04.840> definitely<00:03:05.140> stiffer

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
that this this is definitely stiffer

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.430 
that this this is definitely stiffer
than<00:03:06.600> clamping<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.690> axle<00:03:08.019> right<00:03:08.049> here

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
than clamping the axle right here

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.710 
than clamping the axle right here
okay<00:03:08.860> that's<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.310> that's<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.670> no-brainer<00:03:09.820> then

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
okay that's a that's a no-brainer then

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.630 
okay that's a that's a no-brainer then
we<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.049> go<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.590> oversize<00:03:12.070> you<00:03:12.459> know<00:03:12.579> you

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
we can go to the oversize you know you

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.979 
we can go to the oversize you know you
got<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.120> over<00:03:13.329> so<00:03:13.420> you've<00:03:13.540> got<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.720> square

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
got the over so you've got the square

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.030 
got the over so you've got the square
and<00:03:14.140> square<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.620> then<00:03:14.739> you've<00:03:14.829> got<00:03:14.920> the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
and square and then you've got the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.530 
and square and then you've got the
oversize<00:03:15.400> you've<00:03:15.579> got<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.700> double<00:03:15.940> clamp<00:03:16.269> this

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
oversize you've got a double clamp this

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.890 
oversize you've got a double clamp this
is<00:03:16.690> typically<00:03:17.049> an<00:03:17.650> application<00:03:18.280> downhill

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
is typically an application downhill

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.000 
is typically an application downhill
downhill<00:03:19.900> we<00:03:20.170> would<00:03:20.320> do<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.590> but<00:03:20.799> we're

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
downhill we would do that but we're

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.830 
downhill we would do that but we're
talking<00:03:21.280> here<00:03:21.670> oh<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:22.060> forgot<00:03:22.359> to<00:03:22.510> mention<00:03:22.630> that

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
talking here oh I forgot to mention that

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.560 
talking here oh I forgot to mention that
this<00:03:23.440> Fork<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:24.070> more<00:03:24.310> than<00:03:24.430> 300<00:03:24.790> grams<00:03:25.269> lighter

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
this Fork is more than 300 grams lighter

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.069 
this Fork is more than 300 grams lighter
to<00:03:25.780> this<00:03:25.900> fork<00:03:26.230> okay<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:27.280> if<00:03:28.060> we<00:03:28.299> beef<00:03:28.720> up<00:03:28.900> this

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
to this fork okay so if we beef up this

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.050 
to this fork okay so if we beef up this
for<00:03:29.320> about<00:03:29.380> 300<00:03:29.859> grams<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.370> would<00:03:30.579> not<00:03:30.700> move

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
for about 300 grams this would not move

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.520 
for about 300 grams this would not move
at<00:03:31.269> all<00:03:31.359> but<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.690> doesn't<00:03:31.959> make<00:03:32.079> sense<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.440> make

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
at all but it doesn't make sense to make

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.810 
at all but it doesn't make sense to make
it<00:03:32.709> much<00:03:32.859> stronger<00:03:33.190> because<00:03:33.370> do<00:03:33.609> you<00:03:33.670> have<00:03:33.790> a

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
it much stronger because do you have a

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.420 
it much stronger because do you have a
limitation<00:03:34.209> that's<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.600> wheel<00:03:35.250> okay

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
limitation that's the wheel okay

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.520 
limitation that's the wheel okay
and<00:03:36.519> now<00:03:37.150> just<00:03:37.480> for<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.959> guys<00:03:38.109> who<00:03:38.260> have<00:03:38.350> not

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
and now just for the guys who have not

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.280 
and now just for the guys who have not
seen<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:39.010> this<00:03:39.220> they<00:03:40.030> both<00:03:40.209> have<00:03:40.510> arm<00:03:40.840> in<00:03:41.140> the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
seen that this they both have arm in the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.650 
seen that this they both have arm in the
denpa<00:03:41.640> solder<00:03:42.640> vampa<00:03:42.910> there's<00:03:43.269> no<00:03:43.420> paper

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
denpa solder vampa there's no paper

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.060 
denpa solder vampa there's no paper
inside<00:03:43.989> that's<00:03:44.200> why<00:03:44.320> i<00:03:44.350> can<00:03:44.530> move<00:03:44.709> them<00:03:44.859> so

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
inside that's why i can move them so

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.849 
inside that's why i can move them so
it's<00:03:45.190> not<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.810> anyway<00:03:47.079> this<00:03:47.230> is<00:03:47.380> what<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.560> want

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
it's not so anyway this is what I want

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.259 
it's not so anyway this is what I want
you<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.010> Rembrandt<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.640> remember<00:03:48.970> besides

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
you to Rembrandt and remember besides

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.640 
you to Rembrandt and remember besides
the<00:03:49.420> fact<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:50.019> like<00:03:50.380> a<00:03:50.410> like<00:03:50.620> a

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
the fact that this is like a like a

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.880 
the fact that this is like a like a
moyamoya<00:03:51.150> super-strong<00:03:52.150> smooth<00:03:53.079> light<00:03:53.470> stiff

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
moyamoya super-strong smooth light stiff

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.120 
moyamoya super-strong smooth light stiff
and<00:03:54.299> there's<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.450> weight<00:03:55.600> is<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:56.500> that's<00:03:57.010> the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
and there's the weight is so that's the

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.420 
and there's the weight is so that's the
reasons<00:03:57.519> why<00:03:57.900> it's<00:03:58.900> fun<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.530> ride<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.069> lefty

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
reasons why it's fun to ride a lefty

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.520 
reasons why it's fun to ride a lefty
that's<00:04:00.609> why<00:04:00.970> it's<00:04:01.150> confident<00:04:01.840> inspiring

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
that's why it's confident inspiring

lefty after minutes after he's gotten
over<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.799> initial<00:04:08.859> shock<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:10.030> know<00:04:10.060> saying

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
over the initial shock you know saying

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.620 
over the initial shock you know saying
like<00:04:10.569> where's<00:04:10.870> my

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
like where's my

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
the leg if he starts writing he's just

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.130 
the leg if he starts writing he's just
going<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:13.910> start<00:04:14.240> getting<00:04:14.360> confidence<00:04:14.960> and
