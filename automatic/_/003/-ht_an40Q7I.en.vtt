in in our dependence on your genetics

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.719 
in in our dependence on your genetics
where<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.079> where<00:01:34.350> your<00:01:34.470> weight<00:01:34.650> going<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.130> but

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
where you where your weight going to but

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.789 
where you where your weight going to but
my<00:01:35.880> way<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.509> mostly<00:01:37.290> go<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:38.159> course<00:01:38.460> my<00:01:38.640> but

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
my way I mostly go to of course my but

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.920 
my way I mostly go to of course my but
not<00:01:40.799> trying<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.189> brag<00:01:41.400> it's<00:01:41.850> also<00:01:42.060> my<00:01:42.360> butt<00:01:42.570> my

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
not trying to brag it's also my butt my

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.670 
not trying to brag it's also my butt my
face<00:01:43.280> my<00:01:44.280> arms<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.820> little<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.840> my<00:01:46.020> thighs<00:01:46.320> they

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
face my arms a little but my thighs they

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.219 
face my arms a little but my thighs they
go<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> my<00:01:47.159> thighs<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.240> think<00:01:49.020> that's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
go to my thighs but I think that's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.590 
go to my thighs but I think that's
probably<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.070> last<00:01:50.280> place<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.759> go<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.270> it'll

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
probably the last place to go so it'll

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.240 
probably the last place to go so it'll
go<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.720> my<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.229> before<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> go<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.799> my<00:01:53.040> thighs

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
go to my but before I go to my thighs

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.520 
go to my but before I go to my thighs
which<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> bad<00:01:54.420> thing<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.200> course<00:01:55.409> I
