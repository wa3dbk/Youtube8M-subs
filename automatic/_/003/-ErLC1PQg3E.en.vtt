00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.719
 network then drags it instead of deleting

 we see according to this text pack of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.690
 but kraft money I like a point 5 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.690
 it's like you see scorpio z we have a game 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.690
 random 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.569
 he should stay here exactly that 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:42.049
 which enlarge to my prototype for 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:46.280
 the missing cake is fine people must 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.590
 get out some of those who believed on 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:57.289
 which explains a little to me then there was 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:02:01.270
 the absolute route lift ok 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:04.789
 guys, let's talk a little bit about the hack 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.569
 then there are no lists the h is a bit 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:12.680
 as the morbin then to set vi 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.530
 I explain the various keys lr dialects laura 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:21.709
 veli left however description aic 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:25.819
 and the critical hoc and shark p that non bush 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:30.110
 or autostop noè autostop then tg that 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:36.459
 the sprint and jack che and bohème bot 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:39.620
 then j spider search pack is already a criticism 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.579
 then there is the Hebrew or this 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:48.980
 cremonte leave it then there is the cic 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:55.299
 american ok then there is v that is parkour 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:58.130
 then there is one that shows you the deeds 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.549
 we press again says they disappear but 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.549
 cheese 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.280
 after this they play 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.590
 I'll explain a couple more things 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.530
 r we said lucky laurano but who 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.540
 you can now set it up by making yourself to 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.080
 opening this here is a bit like the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.390
 soft guys punto as that aura speed 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.430
 all in small as space and number 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.160
 always a thousand or one hundred from the least 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.560
 puts in jazz guitar spinse to 1000 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.710
 therefore oracle for ages one thousand strokes 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.410
 they will go very fast 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:41.140
 point projects is that the radius there 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:43.030
 almost 23.9 so it hits so which the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.740
 fourth goal put me back with the African 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.730
 can also go through the walls 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.200
 so it would hit even if the finca but can 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.810
 go through the red stone 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:04:00.010
 here are the people of the discovery is 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.670
 however what else there is nothing these 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:08.160
 it was things 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:08.160
 then there is the shark remember that it was time 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.979
 ok guys shark with or so 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.500
 what shark is in practice looking for a tube 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:25.419
 a hot cube that you choose ad 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:29.560
 example if I do t.se space and shores 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.150
 of something like grass this one here 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.630
 earth with grass and two 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.919
 so let's do two we send 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:41.260
 when we approach the grass here 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.310
 you see to see all the grass but highlights 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.250
 all the blocks that have grass 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.990
 skies highlights as with these squares 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.449
 red 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.100
 you can do can search but within a 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.300
 of course radius then ad 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:02.590
 emit lava which is not mistaken 11 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.070
 let's see if it was 11 approaching me here 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.690
 you see viabili uses lava and red 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.680
 or all the other things you can do 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.479
 more 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.250
 would be fine with the host baskets vi 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.750
 would have been according to certain or 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.190
 I don't know if it can be done also with the 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.830
 mouvement command bloc 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:22.570
 let's see if we can do 337 137 let's see 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.560
 here's the guys you have there is a como 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.270
 of little there too 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.910
 even there are three ok guys 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.410

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.750
 my video guys i hope there was 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.770
 useful than I liked how I did it 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.889
 the scorpion throws the use I say to you 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.979
 that between the kronos the scorpion z 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:43.330
 surely the scorpion wins and therefore 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.560
 crimes if my son was useful 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.510
