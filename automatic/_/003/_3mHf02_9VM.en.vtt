1c Neo Geo MVS arcade board BIOS removal
so<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.850> simply<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.300> need<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.540> some<00:00:33.930> wire

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
so it's simply all you need is some wire

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.680 
so it's simply all you need is some wire
snips<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.920> what<00:00:35.610> you're<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:35.879> to<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.269> cut

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
snips and what you're going to do is cut

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.920 
snips and what you're going to do is cut
the<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.500> legs<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.160> BIOS<00:00:38.540> from<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.750> very

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the the legs of the BIOS from the very

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
the the legs of the BIOS from the very
top<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.290> way<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.710> don't<00:00:40.799> gouge<00:00:41.159> any<00:00:41.519> traces

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
top that way you don't gouge any traces

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.740 
top that way you don't gouge any traces
on<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> bottom<00:00:43.129> it's<00:00:44.129> pretty<00:00:44.339> simple<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.699> do

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
on the bottom it's pretty simple to do

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.649 
on the bottom it's pretty simple to do
just<00:00:46.409> snip<00:00:46.769> and<00:00:48.019> repeat<00:00:49.019> for<00:00:49.229> each<00:00:49.260> leg<00:00:49.710> and

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
just snip and repeat for each leg and

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.210 
just snip and repeat for each leg and
we're<00:00:51.659> gonna<00:00:51.750> go<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:52.019> speed<00:00:52.290> this<00:00:52.409> up<00:00:52.619> and

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
we're gonna go and speed this up and

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.799 
we're gonna go and speed this up and
this<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.940> looks<00:00:54.089> like<00:00:54.269> removed<00:00:54.690> with

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
this is what it looks like removed with

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.590 
this is what it looks like removed with
the<00:00:54.900> legs<00:00:55.610> here<00:00:56.610> you'll<00:00:56.790> see<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.390> legs

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the legs here you'll see that the legs

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.840 
the legs here you'll see that the legs
are<00:00:57.809> still<00:00:57.989> attached<00:00:58.369> all<00:00:59.369> you<00:00:59.519> need<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.760> do

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
are still attached all you need to do

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.450 
are still attached all you need to do
here<00:01:00.150> is<00:01:00.299> simply<00:01:00.769> wipe<00:01:01.769> it<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.250> your

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
here is simply wipe it with your

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.640 
here is simply wipe it with your
soldering<00:01:02.820> iron<00:01:02.930> your<00:01:03.930> hot<00:01:04.110> soldering<00:01:04.470> iron

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
soldering iron your hot soldering iron

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.010 
soldering iron your hot soldering iron
to<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.489> clean<00:01:05.790> off<00:01:05.970> all<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> legs<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.960> are

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
to just clean off all the legs that are

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.469 
to just clean off all the legs that are
stuck<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.710> board<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.159> as<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.270> here

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
stuck to the board and as you see here

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.469 
stuck to the board and as you see here
you<00:01:10.080> simply<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.610> heat<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.090> wipe<00:01:12.270> it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you simply just heat it up and wipe it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.300 
you simply just heat it up and wipe it
and<00:01:12.719> then<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.920> want<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.100> clean<00:01:14.280> off

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
and then you know you want to clean off

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.830 
and then you know you want to clean off
your<00:01:14.609> soldering<00:01:14.850> iron<00:01:14.880> after<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.659> know<00:01:15.780> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
your soldering iron after you know you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.169 
your soldering iron after you know you
take<00:01:16.109> off<00:01:16.289> so<00:01:16.500> many<00:01:16.710> legs<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.759> see<00:01:17.969> here

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
take off so many legs so you see here

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.810 
take off so many legs so you see here
how<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.329> goes<00:01:18.450> pretty<00:01:18.689> quick<00:01:19.280> it's<00:01:20.280> pretty

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
how it goes pretty quick it's pretty

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.899 
how it goes pretty quick it's pretty
easy<00:01:20.969> to<00:01:21.149> do

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.880 

and<00:01:25.479> you<00:01:25.600> see<00:01:25.750> can<00:01:25.899> you<00:01:25.990> can<00:01:26.140> see<00:01:26.259> bunching<00:01:26.740> up

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
and you see can you can see bunching up

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.319 
and you see can you can see bunching up
on<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.189> soldering<00:01:27.700> iron<00:01:27.820> so<00:01:28.119> I'm<00:01:28.180> going<00:01:28.299> to

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
on the soldering iron so I'm going to

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.209 
on the soldering iron so I'm going to
speed<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.659> up<00:01:28.750> here<00:01:29.079> because<00:01:29.740> it's<00:01:29.979> a<00:01:30.039> tedious

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
speed it up here because it's a tedious

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.850 
speed it up here because it's a tedious
process<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:32.320> is<00:01:32.439> rather<00:01:32.979> quick<00:01:34.079> mod<00:01:35.079> to<00:01:35.229> do<00:01:35.380> and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
process it is rather quick mod to do and

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.370 
process it is rather quick mod to do and
then<00:01:36.399> just<00:01:36.640> repeat<00:01:36.789> it<00:01:36.939> for<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.149> same<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:38.289> the

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
then just repeat it for the same on the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.529 
then just repeat it for the same on the
other<00:01:38.439> side<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.759> I'm<00:01:43.119> going<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.299> tell<00:01:43.450> you

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
other side and I'm going to tell you

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.929 
other side and I'm going to tell you
quickly<00:01:43.689> as<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:45.280> was<00:01:45.369> making<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:45.640> video<00:01:45.880> about

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
quickly as I was making this video about

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.929 
quickly as I was making this video about
two<00:01:46.329> weeks<00:01:46.509> ago<00:01:46.659> a<00:01:47.530> gentleman<00:01:48.369> by<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.670> name<00:01:48.789> of

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
two weeks ago a gentleman by the name of

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.719 
two weeks ago a gentleman by the name of
neo<00:01:49.360> turf<00:01:49.659> masters<00:01:49.720> on<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.590> Neo<00:01:50.979> Geo<00:01:51.220> forums

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
neo turf masters on the Neo Geo forums

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.289 
neo turf masters on the Neo Geo forums
and<00:01:52.450> she<00:01:52.720> came<00:01:52.899> out<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.140> product<00:01:53.409> called<00:01:53.590> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and she came out the product called the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.660 
and she came out the product called the
Neo<00:01:55.299> BIOS<00:01:55.899> master<00:01:56.380> which<00:01:56.590> is<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:56.829> what<00:01:57.490> you'll

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
Neo BIOS master which is a what you'll

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.179 
Neo BIOS master which is a what you'll
see<00:01:57.849> here<00:01:58.030> in<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.209> second<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.890> what<00:01:59.890> that<00:02:00.039> does

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
see here in a second and what that does

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.980 
see here in a second and what that does
is<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:00.549> actually<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.759> replaces<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.599> need<00:02:04.780> to

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
is it actually it replaces the need to

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.230 
is it actually it replaces the need to
rewire<00:02:05.319> your<00:02:05.560> unit<00:02:05.860> by<00:02:05.950> an<00:02:06.369> MV<00:02:06.610> 1c<00:02:06.939> board

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
rewire your unit by an MV 1c board

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.240 
rewire your unit by an MV 1c board
because<00:02:07.929> people<00:02:08.229> know<00:02:08.349> that<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.739> you<00:02:09.130> know

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
because people know that the you know

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.830 
because people know that the you know
BIOS<00:02:09.519> is<00:02:09.729> actually<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.060> different<00:02:10.390> chip<00:02:10.630> from

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
BIOS is actually a different chip from

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
BIOS is actually a different chip from
what<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.260> MV<00:02:12.040> 1c<00:02:12.400> has<00:02:12.670> on<00:02:13.030> its<00:02:13.239> motherboard<00:02:14.080> so

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
what the MV 1c has on its motherboard so

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.000 
what the MV 1c has on its motherboard so
this<00:02:15.069> is<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.400> new<00:02:15.970> BIOS<00:02:16.480> master<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.260> you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
this is the new BIOS master and you

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.400 
this is the new BIOS master and you
basically<00:02:18.390> follow<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.569> instructions<00:02:20.170> see

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
basically follow the instructions see

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.339 
basically follow the instructions see
here<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.799> says<00:02:20.829> if<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.310> have<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.459> MV<00:02:21.670> 1b<00:02:22.360> it's

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
here it says if you have a MV 1b it's

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.750 
here it says if you have a MV 1b it's
point<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.799> that's<00:02:23.950> where<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.160> jam<00:02:24.400> edge<00:02:24.610> is

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
point and that's where the jam edge is

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.270 
point and that's where the jam edge is
gonna<00:02:24.880> be<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:26.440> also<00:02:26.590> see<00:02:26.920> these<00:02:27.040> two

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
gonna be and you also see these two

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.309 
gonna be and you also see these two
things<00:02:27.310> here<00:02:27.730> says<00:02:28.030> c<00:02:28.239> e<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:28.390> OE<00:02:28.780> that's

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
things here says c e and OE that's

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.150 
things here says c e and OE that's
actually<00:02:29.769> chip<00:02:30.670> enable<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.299> output<00:02:31.660> enable

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
actually chip enable and output enable

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.590 
actually chip enable and output enable
and<00:02:33.160> what<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.400> can<00:02:33.489> do<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.790> since<00:02:34.030> it's<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.420> MV

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
and what you can do is since it's a MV

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.190 
and what you can do is since it's a MV
1c<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.799> look<00:02:36.010> for<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.190> MV<00:02:36.400> 1c<00:02:36.730> itching<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.870> it

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
1c you look for the MV 1c itching and it

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.860 
1c you look for the MV 1c itching and it
says<00:02:38.380> point<00:02:38.739> it<00:02:38.859> this<00:02:39.040> way<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:40.420> what<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.780> can

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
says point it this way and what you can

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.400 
says point it this way and what you can
do<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.139> you're<00:02:41.230> gonna<00:02:41.319> snap<00:02:41.769> it<00:02:42.010> on<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:43.380> 68k

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
do is you're gonna snap it on to the 68k

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.710 
do is you're gonna snap it on to the 68k
surface<00:02:45.400> mount<00:02:45.609> cpu<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.389> see<00:02:46.569> right

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
surface mount cpu that you see right

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.920 
surface mount cpu that you see right
there<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.799> you<00:02:48.670> just<00:02:48.850> you<00:02:49.239> know<00:02:49.269> push<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.780> down

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
there and you just you know push it down

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.370 
there and you just you know push it down
it'll<00:02:50.380> make<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.709> loud<00:02:51.340> snap<00:02:51.819> sound<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.690> that

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
it'll make a loud snap sound and that

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.970 
it'll make a loud snap sound and that
thing<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.620> pretty<00:02:53.859> snug<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.430> know<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:56.079> all

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
thing is pretty snug you know and all

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.270 
thing is pretty snug you know and all
you<00:02:57.100> have<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.340> do<00:02:57.459> there<00:02:58.319> is<00:02:59.319> now<00:02:59.889> you<00:02:59.950> just

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
you have to do there is now you just

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.150 
you have to do there is now you just
need<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.549> connect<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.590> chip<00:03:02.590> enable<00:03:02.799> and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
need to connect the chip enable and

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.720 
need to connect the chip enable and
output<00:03:03.489> enable<00:03:03.850> lines<00:03:04.109> and<00:03:05.109> on<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.799> mv-1<00:03:06.160> see

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
output enable lines and on the mv-1 see

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.420 
output enable lines and on the mv-1 see
it<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.180> actually<00:03:07.540> pin<00:03:08.380> number<00:03:08.680> 10<00:03:08.920> on<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.130> bios

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
it is actually pin number 10 on the bios

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.849 
it is actually pin number 10 on the bios
which<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:09.910> chip<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.299> able<00:03:10.600> and<00:03:10.810> pin<00:03:11.319> number<00:03:11.560> 12

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
which is chip and able and pin number 12

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.879 
which is chip and able and pin number 12
which<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.100> output<00:03:12.340> enable<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:14.530> we're<00:03:14.680> go<00:03:14.769> ahead

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
which is output enable so we're go ahead

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.059 
which is output enable so we're go ahead
and<00:03:15.040> snip<00:03:15.519> these<00:03:15.730> wires<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.120> little<00:03:16.359> bit<00:03:17.069> cuz

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
and snip these wires a little bit cuz

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.670 
and snip these wires a little bit cuz
yeah<00:03:18.280> they<00:03:18.730> are<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> little<00:03:19.120> long<00:03:19.389> and<00:03:19.680> I'm

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
yeah they are a little long and I'm

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.199 
yeah they are a little long and I'm
gonna<00:03:20.799> go<00:03:20.980> ahead<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.250> solder<00:03:21.609> them<00:03:21.849> to<00:03:22.030> those

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
gonna go ahead and solder them to those

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.640 
gonna go ahead and solder them to those
two<00:03:22.810> points<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:25.630> know<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:25.870> this<00:03:26.019> this

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
two points and you know that this this

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.629 
two points and you know that this this
little<00:03:27.630> invention<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:29.260> he<00:03:29.410> had<00:03:29.620> really<00:03:30.220> does

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
little invention that he had really does

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.320 
little invention that he had really does
save<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:31.239> lot<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.599> time<00:03:31.840> doing

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
save a lot of time doing

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.630 
save a lot of time doing
is<00:03:32.360> bios<00:03:32.780> replacement<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:34.130> original<00:03:34.520> way

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
is bios replacement the original way

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.910 
is bios replacement the original way
when<00:03:34.880> you<00:03:35.000> do<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.150> buzz<00:03:35.420> replacement<00:03:35.960> is<00:03:36.110> on<00:03:36.470> the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
when you do a buzz replacement is on the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.130 
when you do a buzz replacement is on the
MVA<00:03:37.190> 1c<00:03:37.490> is<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:37.850> have<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.060> cut<00:03:38.360> out<00:03:38.390> about

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
MVA 1c is that you have to cut out about

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.420 
MVA 1c is that you have to cut out about
38<00:03:39.680> pieces<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.220> wire<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:41.800> you<00:03:42.800> know<00:03:42.890> soldering

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
38 pieces of wire and you know soldering

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.470 
38 pieces of wire and you know soldering
tin<00:03:43.760> both<00:03:43.940> ends<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.600> then<00:03:45.670> sawed<00:03:46.670> them<00:03:46.940> to

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
tin both ends and then sawed them to

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.940 
tin both ends and then sawed them to
each<00:03:47.600> individual<00:03:48.020> pin<00:03:48.290> except<00:03:48.710> for<00:03:48.830> I<00:03:48.860> think

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
each individual pin except for I think

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.480 
each individual pin except for I think
two<00:03:49.220> pins<00:03:49.490> and<00:03:49.880> then<00:03:50.740> then<00:03:51.740> solve<00:03:52.070> that<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.460> a

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
two pins and then then solve that to a

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.780 
two pins and then then solve that to a
socket<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.350> then<00:03:54.350> on<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:55.010> mv-1<00:03:55.250> see<00:03:55.490> it's<00:03:55.670> not

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
socket and then on the mv-1 see it's not

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.210 
socket and then on the mv-1 see it's not
a<00:03:55.850> one-for-one<00:03:56.390> pin<00:03:57.380> out<00:03:57.500> configuration<00:03:58.100> it's

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
a one-for-one pin out configuration it's

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.490 
a one-for-one pin out configuration it's
not<00:03:58.370> you<00:03:58.520> know<00:03:58.640> pin<00:03:58.910> 1<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.270> pin<00:03:59.480> 1<00:03:59.720> pin<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.380> the

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
not you know pin 1 to pin 1 pin to the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.270 
not you know pin 1 to pin 1 pin to the
pin<00:04:00.530> 2<00:04:00.890> it's<00:04:01.610> actually<00:04:01.940> some<00:04:02.150> really<00:04:02.600> weird

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
pin 2 it's actually some really weird

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.860 
pin 2 it's actually some really weird
off-the-wall<00:04:04.280> pin<00:04:05.120> outs<00:04:05.330> you<00:04:05.570> actually<00:04:05.780> have

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
off-the-wall pin outs you actually have

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.410 
off-the-wall pin outs you actually have
to<00:04:05.990> follow<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.290> pin<00:04:06.530> out<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:08.090> gets<00:04:08.270> really

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
to follow a pin out so it gets really

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.080 
to follow a pin out so it gets really
confusing<00:04:08.600> after<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.230> while<00:04:09.790> but<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:10.940> know<00:04:10.970> if

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
confusing after a while but you know if

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.490 
confusing after a while but you know if
you've<00:04:11.180> done<00:04:11.300> it<00:04:11.390> so<00:04:11.510> many<00:04:11.600> times<00:04:11.750> it's<00:04:12.320> really

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
you've done it so many times it's really

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.030 
you've done it so many times it's really
actually<00:04:12.709> pretty<00:04:13.100> simple<00:04:13.820> to<00:04:13.970> do<00:04:14.230> but<00:04:15.230> with

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
actually pretty simple to do but with

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.220 
actually pretty simple to do but with
the<00:04:16.130> Neos<00:04:16.459> bias<00:04:16.760> master<00:04:17.180> it's<00:04:17.330> pretty<00:04:17.900> damn

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
the Neos bias master it's pretty damn

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.650 
the Neos bias master it's pretty damn
easy<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:18.709> mean<00:04:18.950> this<00:04:19.130> is<00:04:19.400> just<00:04:20.299> tick<00:04:20.480> me

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
easy I mean this is just tick me

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.010 
easy I mean this is just tick me
technically<00:04:21.170> about<00:04:22.630> well<00:04:23.630> would<00:04:23.750> have<00:04:23.810> taken

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
technically about well would have taken

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.410 
technically about well would have taken
me<00:04:24.200> a<00:04:24.230> technically<00:04:24.560> 2<00:04:24.800> minutes<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.130> do<00:04:25.420> but

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
me a technically 2 minutes to do but

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.550 
me a technically 2 minutes to do but
then<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.690> was<00:04:26.870> just<00:04:26.900> playing<00:04:27.050> around<00:04:27.350> with<00:04:27.500> a

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
then I was just playing around with a

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.410 
then I was just playing around with a
lot<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.710> stuff<00:04:27.980> so<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.280> see<00:04:28.670> here<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.060> have<00:04:29.390> the

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
lot of stuff so you see here I have the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.410 
lot of stuff so you see here I have the
chip<00:04:30.320> enable<00:04:30.560> which<00:04:30.830> is<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.070> C<00:04:31.280> II<00:04:31.310> wire<00:04:32.090> and

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
chip enable which is the C II wire and

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.570 
chip enable which is the C II wire and
I'm<00:04:32.960> connecting<00:04:33.380> that<00:04:33.530> I'm<00:04:34.010> starting<00:04:34.220> at<00:04:34.400> to

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
I'm connecting that I'm starting at to

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.570 
I'm connecting that I'm starting at to
the<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.300> soldering<00:04:35.630> pad<00:04:35.870> on<00:04:36.170> pin<00:04:36.980> number<00:04:37.310> 10

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
the the soldering pad on pin number 10

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.730 
the the soldering pad on pin number 10
for<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.090> old<00:04:38.450> BIOS<00:04:40.780> and<00:04:41.780> then<00:04:42.110> we<00:04:42.200> repeat<00:04:42.530> the

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
for the old BIOS and then we repeat the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.790 
for the old BIOS and then we repeat the
same<00:04:42.770> thing<00:04:43.430> for<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:44.840> output<00:04:45.230> enable<00:04:45.590> cape

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
same thing for the output enable cape

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.700 
same thing for the output enable cape
wire<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:46.790> that's<00:04:47.360> gonna<00:04:47.510> go<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.750> pin<00:04:48.140> 12<00:04:48.470> on

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
wire and that's gonna go to pin 12 on

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.820 
wire and that's gonna go to pin 12 on
the<00:04:48.980> mv-1<00:04:49.550> see

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.939 

and<00:04:54.639> that's<00:04:55.509> actually<00:04:55.930> all<00:04:56.229> you<00:04:56.289> really<00:04:56.770> need

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
and that's actually all you really need

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.550 
and that's actually all you really need
to<00:04:57.069> do<00:04:57.190> if<00:04:57.819> you<00:04:58.330> actually<00:04:58.509> do<00:04:58.810> use<00:04:59.229> the<00:04:59.379> neo

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
to do if you actually do use the neo

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.170 
to do if you actually do use the neo
bios<00:04:59.949> master<00:05:00.310> there's<00:05:00.460> actually<00:05:00.699> a<00:05:00.729> way<00:05:00.940> that

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
bios master there's actually a way that

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.460 
bios master there's actually a way that
you<00:05:01.389> actually<00:05:01.479> don't<00:05:01.780> have<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:01.960> remove<00:05:02.289> your

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
you actually don't have to remove your

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.879 
you actually don't have to remove your
old<00:05:02.770> bios<00:05:03.280> at<00:05:03.430> all<00:05:03.610> I<00:05:04.509> just<00:05:04.990> prefer<00:05:05.319> to<00:05:05.349> remove

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
old bios at all I just prefer to remove

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.589 
old bios at all I just prefer to remove

my old BIOS
if<00:05:08.319> you're<00:05:08.949> gonna<00:05:09.039> do<00:05:09.340> it<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.520> other<00:05:09.550> way

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
if you're gonna do it the other way

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.240 
if you're gonna do it the other way
which<00:05:10.419> which<00:05:10.990> keeps<00:05:11.349> your<00:05:11.590> old<00:05:11.740> BIOS<00:05:12.009> on<00:05:12.220> the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
board all you need to do is basically

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.119 
board all you need to do is basically
lift<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.669> couple<00:05:15.970> pins<00:05:16.150> they're<00:05:16.690> actually<00:05:16.960> on

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
lift a couple pins they're actually on

some instructions on there and you can
also<00:05:23.740> order<00:05:24.069> the<00:05:24.360> little<00:05:25.360> gizmo<00:05:25.690> from<00:05:25.840> there

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
also order the little gizmo from there

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.820 
also order the little gizmo from there
and<00:05:27.930> it's<00:05:28.930> pretty<00:05:29.080> simple<00:05:29.199> dude<00:05:29.469> he<00:05:29.710> also

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
and it's pretty simple dude he also

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.860 
and it's pretty simple dude he also
includes<00:05:30.219> these<00:05:30.430> two<00:05:31.710> green<00:05:32.710> vinyl<00:05:33.280> stickers

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
includes these two green vinyl stickers

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.390 
includes these two green vinyl stickers
which<00:05:35.009> will<00:05:36.009> aid<00:05:36.310> in<00:05:36.569> holding<00:05:37.569> the<00:05:38.159> the<00:05:39.159> wires

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
which will aid in holding the the wires

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.209 
which will aid in holding the the wires
down<00:05:39.669> should<00:05:40.569> you<00:05:40.840> ever<00:05:40.930> need<00:05:41.349> to<00:05:41.860> hold<00:05:42.069> them

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.219 
down should you ever need to hold them

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:47.840 
down should you ever need to hold them
down<00:05:42.250> with<00:05:42.580> anything

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.210 

so<00:05:48.390> just<00:05:48.570> go<00:05:48.690> ahead<00:05:48.780> and<00:05:48.990> just<00:05:49.350> stick<00:05:49.560> those<00:05:49.770> on

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.100 

push<00:05:53.220> it<00:05:53.370> done<00:05:53.550> and<00:05:54.120> repeat<00:05:54.630> it<00:05:54.720> for<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:54.930> same

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
push it done and repeat it for the same

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.490 
push it done and repeat it for the same
side<00:05:55.640> and<00:05:56.640> I<00:05:57.120> already<00:05:57.540> soldered<00:05:57.780> these<00:05:58.050> two<00:05:58.320> on

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
side and I already soldered these two on

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.710 
side and I already soldered these two on
so<00:05:58.770> you<00:05:59.070> know<00:05:59.160> these<00:05:59.400> two<00:05:59.460> wires<00:06:00.240> on<00:06:00.480> so<00:06:00.660> I

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
so you know these two wires on so I

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.390 
so you know these two wires on so I
don't<00:06:00.780> really<00:06:00.990> need<00:06:01.140> these<00:06:01.320> but<00:06:01.620> I<00:06:01.860> just<00:06:02.250> put

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
don't really need these but I just put

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.250 
don't really need these but I just put
them<00:06:02.490> on<00:06:02.580> just<00:06:02.910> because<00:06:03.090> I'm<00:06:03.300> anal<00:06:03.540> sometimes

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.390 

and<00:06:07.260> that's<00:06:07.500> pretty<00:06:07.680> much<00:06:07.800> it<00:06:07.920> that's<00:06:08.070> all<00:06:08.310> it

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
and that's pretty much it that's all it

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.790 
and that's pretty much it that's all it
takes<00:06:08.520> to<00:06:08.790> install<00:06:08.820> the<00:06:09.630> new<00:06:09.660> BIOS<00:06:10.170> master<00:06:10.560> if

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
takes to install the new BIOS master if

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.130 
takes to install the new BIOS master if
you<00:06:10.950> remove<00:06:11.310> the<00:06:11.550> stock<00:06:12.450> by<00:06:12.630> house<00:06:12.750> completely

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
you remove the stock by house completely

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.530 
you remove the stock by house completely
I<00:06:13.440> know<00:06:14.400> anything<00:06:14.610> that<00:06:14.730> you<00:06:14.850> do<00:06:15.030> you<00:06:15.120> do<00:06:15.270> is

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
I know anything that you do you do is

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.630 
I know anything that you do you do is
put<00:06:16.020> in<00:06:16.140> your<00:06:16.260> you<00:06:16.380> know<00:06:16.470> BIOS<00:06:16.800> and<00:06:17.100> you<00:06:17.460> see

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
put in your you know BIOS and you see

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.730 
put in your you know BIOS and you see
here<00:06:17.880> the<00:06:18.060> notch<00:06:18.240> on<00:06:18.420> the<00:06:18.540> left<00:06:18.780> you<00:06:19.500> want<00:06:19.680> to

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
here the notch on the left you want to

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.470 
here the notch on the left you want to
go<00:06:19.860> ahead<00:06:19.980> and<00:06:20.430> match<00:06:20.610> it<00:06:20.790> up<00:06:20.910> with<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.270> notch

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
go ahead and match it up with the notch

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.260 
go ahead and match it up with the notch
right<00:06:22.380> there<00:06:22.710> so<00:06:23.520> you<00:06:23.550> have<00:06:23.670> to<00:06:23.820> flip<00:06:24.000> it<00:06:24.120> over

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
right there so you have to flip it over

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.710 
right there so you have to flip it over
and<00:06:24.680> then<00:06:25.680> all<00:06:25.890> you<00:06:25.950> need<00:06:25.980> to<00:06:26.100> do<00:06:26.310> is<00:06:26.550> just<00:06:26.820> pop

and then all you need to do is just pop

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.890 
and then all you need to do is just pop
it<00:06:27.960> in<00:06:28.110> and<00:06:28.470> then<00:06:29.340> after<00:06:29.610> that<00:06:29.850> you're<00:06:30.570> good<00:06:30.780> to

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
it in and then after that you're good to

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.790 
it in and then after that you're good to
go<00:06:30.930> and<00:06:31.760> it<00:06:32.760> you<00:06:33.630> know<00:06:33.690> a<00:06:34.020> lot<00:06:34.410> of<00:06:34.530> people<00:06:34.740> are

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
wondering about how tight this socket is

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.880 
wondering about how tight this socket is
on<00:06:37.800> the<00:06:38.040> that<00:06:38.550> clamps<00:06:39.120> on<00:06:39.240> the<00:06:39.330> CPU<00:06:39.840> and<00:06:40.050> I<00:06:40.710> can

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:40.890 
on the that clamps on the CPU and I can

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.290 
on the that clamps on the CPU and I can
tell<00:06:41.040> you<00:06:41.130> after<00:06:41.250> making<00:06:41.700> this<00:06:41.790> video<00:06:42.060> that

exactly<00:06:51.300> how<00:06:51.450> tight<00:06:51.900> this<00:06:52.200> socket<00:06:53.100> is<00:06:53.220> on<00:06:53.460> the

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
exactly how tight this socket is on the

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.930 
exactly how tight this socket is on the
68<00:06:54.450> KC<00:06:54.690> PU<00:06:55.790> I'm<00:06:56.790> gonna<00:06:56.970> go<00:06:57.180> ahead<00:06:57.300> and

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
68 KC PU I'm gonna go ahead and

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.710 
68 KC PU I'm gonna go ahead and
basically<00:07:00.260> lift<00:07:01.260> up<00:07:01.470> the<00:07:01.650> board<00:07:02.090> by<00:07:03.090> the<00:07:03.150> BIOS

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
basically lift up the board by the BIOS

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.760 
basically lift up the board by the BIOS
and<00:07:05.120> you<00:07:06.120> can<00:07:06.270> see<00:07:06.450> exactly<00:07:06.570> how<00:07:06.960> how<00:07:07.470> tight

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
and you can see exactly how how tight

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.010 
and you can see exactly how how tight
that<00:07:08.010> socket<00:07:08.400> is<00:07:08.550> and<00:07:09.000> if<00:07:09.600> you<00:07:09.690> don't<00:07:09.870> think

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
that socket is and if you don't think

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.900 
that socket is and if you don't think
you<00:07:10.290> know<00:07:10.410> that's<00:07:10.590> you<00:07:11.070> know<00:07:11.100> that's<00:07:11.550> enough

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:11.910 
you know that's you know that's enough

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.050 
you know that's you know that's enough

Alfa mission to MVS cart yeah you saw a

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.510 
Alfa mission to MVS cart yeah you saw a
pole<00:07:18.150> star<00:07:18.390> right<00:07:18.510> there<00:07:19.250> this<00:07:20.250> is<00:07:20.400> our

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
pole star right there this is our

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.210 
lifting it by the BIOS that's exactly
how<00:07:31.320> tight<00:07:32.150> that<00:07:33.150> socket<00:07:33.630> is<00:07:33.950> so<00:07:34.950> I'm<00:07:35.070> not

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 
how tight that socket is so I'm not

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.040 
how tight that socket is so I'm not
playing<00:07:35.460> playing<00:07:36.150> around<00:07:36.390> about<00:07:36.630> how<00:07:36.810> tight

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.050
