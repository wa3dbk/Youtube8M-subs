00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.759
 Hello dear friends 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.840
 Bank of Russia destroying lending 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.389
 real sector 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.029
 by raising interest rates 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.439
 immediately 18 percent 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.630
 started quietly yes take it back 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.250
 first reduced to 15 percent now 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.869
 reduced to 14 percent 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.300
 explain it so that he you know 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.160
 inflation decreases it is true in March 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.699
 she clearly does not want January and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.070
 February 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.559
 inflation is declining so here you can 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.640
 lower the refinancing rate further 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.870
 it will now come to revival 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 Russian economy 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.879
 Well, it's bullshit not to swear 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.040
 so as not to burn this nonsense nabiullina and 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.600
 other things 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.530
 let's not swear let's say politically correct 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.180
 it's bullshit because sharp 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.149
 raising the refinancing rate that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.199
 lived in Russia entrusted to the states 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.600
 Russian business is even the most stupid 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.949
 dull finally realized that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.699
 sense of liberal power in russia 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.870
 the entire social and economic policy 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.990
 determined by the liberals 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.270
 this destruction is the destruction of everyone and 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.060
 legal economic activity. 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.939
 another meaning of this policy is to find 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.159
 extremely difficult in this situation the difference 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.040
 between 17 and 14 percent is practically 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.189
 no, I think their reduction is 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.340
 rather caused by the desire to reduce 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.540
 government spending on co-financing 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.380
 mortgage and some other types 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.970
 crediting for the real sector 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.470
 which is now terrible 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.210
 position when he is defenseless before 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.560
 import after joining someone on 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.439
 enslaving conditions our country 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.799
 open like a thoroughfare when he 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.270
 no external lending 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.610
 domestic lending is insanely expensive 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.070
 still unmarried percentage points 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.219
 changes nothing in this situation 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.710
 our economy is doomed to destruction 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.719
 liberals just like our patients 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.640
 in my opinion a significant part of them 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.360
 doomed to destruction by the liberals 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.050
 which are behind him 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.720
 abs health care reform 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.780
 so the interest rate reduction is 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.470
 not bad pr is a good advertising campaign 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.350
 you know how 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.780
 the store say we lowered we lowered 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.030
 prices by 30 percent hold back what 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.250
 transferred to them they battered them twice well 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.850
 Similarly , madam number companies 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.320
 valv did not lower the refinancing rate 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.170
 even once again actually creed 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.680
 remains completely unavailable for 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.660
 Russian economy 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.060
 Russian economy will continue 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.680
 fall god forbid if this year us 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.170
 recession will be five percent 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.330
 they are more god forbid if this year u 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.580
 us decline in real incomes 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.459
 there will be eight percent more give 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.290
 god if this year we have an investment 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.090
 decline will be 16 percent and you will not 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.800
 we returned to politics in the 90s 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.800
 and this is the same policy that 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.280
 Ukraine was held in 2012 and still 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.250
 eighth year and brought Ukraine home and 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.470
 to my deep regret we are confident 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.380
 lead to 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.570
 a public disaster when we do 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.299
 for their part the same thing they did 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:30.150
 Ukrainians because we will be brought to 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:33.180
 exactly the same state and then not for long and 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.959
 promising after all the world championship 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.640
 2018 Russian Federation Football 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.850
 its current state 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.390
 will not live even if Mrs. Nabiullina 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.670
 reduce the refinancing rate again 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.560
 to 13 percent the whole point is 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.240
 that investment money should be 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.390
 separated from speculative 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.400
 until this opportunity is made 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.400
 to develop a country does not exist
