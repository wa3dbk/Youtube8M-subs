this<00:02:50.570> month<00:02:51.100> September<00:02:52.100> 2010<00:02:52.910> about<00:02:53.870> a

this month September 2010 about a

this month September 2010 about a
another<00:02:55.970> creature<00:02:56.300> found<00:02:56.690> in<00:02:57.080> Spain<00:02:57.610> this<00:02:58.610> one

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
another creature found in Spain this one

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.190 
another creature found in Spain this one
has<00:03:00.140> little<00:03:00.920> bumps<00:03:01.280> on<00:03:02.090> some<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.810> its<00:03:02.960> bones

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
has little bumps on some of its bones

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.160 
has little bumps on some of its bones
and<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.970> also<00:03:05.120> has<00:03:05.420> certain<00:03:05.690> features<00:03:05.720> that

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
and it also has certain features that

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.890 
and it also has certain features that
are<00:03:06.320> homologous<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:07.010> modern<00:03:07.400> birds<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:08.690> it's

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
are homologous to modern birds so it's

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.620 
are homologous to modern birds so it's
thought<00:03:09.110> that<00:03:09.350> this<00:03:09.500> might<00:03:09.770> be<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:11.000> ancestor

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
thought that this might be the ancestor

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.970 
thought that this might be the ancestor
that<00:03:11.660> they're<00:03:11.900> looking<00:03:12.050> for<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.590> missing

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
that they're looking for the missing

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.370 
that they're looking for the missing
link<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.280> little<00:03:13.550> bumps<00:03:13.880> being<00:03:14.150> places<00:03:14.990> from

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380

link the little bumps being places from
which<00:03:15.560> feathers<00:03:16.340> sprouted<00:03:17.030> although<00:03:17.270> no

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
which feathers sprouted although no

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.620 
which feathers sprouted although no
feathers<00:03:17.870> were<00:03:17.990> found<00:03:18.230> with<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.470> fossil<00:03:19.630> also

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
feathers were found with the fossil also

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.360 
feathers were found with the fossil also
this<00:03:20.810> fossil<00:03:21.290> is<00:03:21.380> about<00:03:21.650> 20<00:03:22.040> million<00:03:22.220> years

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
this fossil is about 20 million years

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.510 
this fossil is about 20 million years
younger<00:03:22.850> than<00:03:23.090> Archaeopteryx<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.050> once<00:03:24.230> again

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
younger than Archaeopteryx so once again

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.490 
younger than Archaeopteryx so once again
we<00:03:25.520> have<00:03:25.550> an<00:03:25.760> ancestor<00:03:26.150> that's<00:03:27.020> younger<00:03:27.320> than

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
we have an ancestor that's younger than

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.400 
we have an ancestor that's younger than
it's<00:03:28.010> supposed<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.760> descendant<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.630> this

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
it's supposed to descendant and this

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.980 
it's supposed to descendant and this
goes<00:03:30.590> on<00:03:30.770> all<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:31.100> time<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.610> mean<00:03:31.990> Darwinian

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.260 
goes on all the time I mean Darwinian
dogma<00:03:33.470> in<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.830> form<00:03:34.070> of<00:03:34.250> modern<00:03:34.700> cladistic

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
analysis overrides the fossil evidence

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.699 
analysis overrides the fossil evidence
and<00:03:39.550> becomes<00:03:41.170> evidence<00:03:42.170> for<00:03:42.320> Darwinian

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
and becomes evidence for Darwinian

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.860 
and becomes evidence for Darwinian
evolution<00:03:43.250> it's<00:03:43.430> circular<00:03:44.180> thinking<00:03:44.600> all<00:03:44.750> the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870

evolution it's circular thinking all the
way<00:03:45.020> down<00:03:45.459> Darwinian<00:03:46.459> evolution<00:03:46.910> is<00:03:47.030> true

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.040 
way down Darwinian evolution is true
this<00:03:48.290> fossil<00:03:48.890> fits<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.910> theory<00:03:50.330> so<00:03:50.630> therefore

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
this fossil fits the theory so therefore

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.320 
this fossil fits the theory so therefore
it<00:03:51.110> must<00:03:51.200> be<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.680> missing<00:03:51.860> link<00:03:52.330> therefore

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
it must be the missing link therefore

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.660 
it must be the missing link therefore
the<00:03:53.450> theory<00:03:53.660> is<00:03:53.959> true<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.739> here<00:03:55.310> we<00:03:55.430> have<00:03:55.580> it

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
the theory is true and here we have it

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.780 
the theory is true and here we have it
again<00:03:55.940> very<00:03:56.150> recently
