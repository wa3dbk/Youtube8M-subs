so<00:03:17.930> we<00:03:18.140> let<00:03:18.320> this<00:03:18.470> stick<00:03:18.739> on<00:03:18.920> for<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.310> little<00:03:19.790> bit

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
so we let this stick on for a little bit

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.270 
so we let this stick on for a little bit
give<00:03:20.299> it<00:03:20.420> maybe<00:03:20.630> half<00:03:20.930> an<00:03:21.049> hour<00:03:21.170> some<00:03:21.440> and<00:03:21.799> what

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
give it maybe half an hour some and what

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.410 
give it maybe half an hour some and what
we're<00:03:22.370> going<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.549> do<00:03:22.670> is<00:03:22.850> show<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.090> how<00:03:23.269> this

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
we're going to do is show you how this

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.599 
we're going to do is show you how this
works<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:23.900> definitely<00:03:24.320> you<00:03:24.859> pull<00:03:25.100> up<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.489> now

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
works you definitely you pull up and now

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.220 
works you definitely you pull up and now
first<00:03:26.000> this<00:03:26.209> is<00:03:26.269> going<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.630> be<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.780> little<00:03:26.959> tight

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
first this is going to be a little tight

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.990 
first this is going to be a little tight
on<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.560> when<00:03:27.859> you<00:03:27.980> take<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.370> pull<00:03:28.549> it<00:03:28.579> because

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
on you when you take and pull it because

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.150 
on you when you take and pull it because
the<00:03:29.180> string<00:03:30.019> in<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.170> manufacturing<00:03:30.829> makes<00:03:31.040> it

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
the string in the manufacturing makes it

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160 
the string in the manufacturing makes it
pretty<00:03:31.310> tight<00:03:31.579> but<00:03:31.850> what<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.359> can<00:03:32.510> do<00:03:32.660> now<00:03:32.959> is

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
pretty tight but what you can do now is

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.680 
pretty tight but what you can do now is
once<00:03:33.590> you<00:03:33.739> pull<00:03:33.980> that<00:03:34.130> free<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:35.060> can<00:03:35.269> stick

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
once you pull that free you can stick

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.330 
once you pull that free you can stick
your<00:03:35.720> fingers<00:03:36.200> in<00:03:36.230> there<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:36.650> be<00:03:37.070> able<00:03:37.190> to

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
your fingers in there and be able to

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.210 
your fingers in there and be able to
hold<00:03:37.579> the<00:03:37.760> device<00:03:37.880> at<00:03:38.720> will<00:03:38.989> so<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:40.010> great

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
hold the device at will so the great

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.880 
hold the device at will so the great
thing<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:40.880> gives<00:03:41.120> you<00:03:41.560> see<00:03:42.560> if<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.709> can<00:03:42.799> do

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
thing is is it gives you see if I can do

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.220 
thing is is it gives you see if I can do
this<00:03:42.980> with<00:03:43.160> two<00:03:43.310> hands<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:44.450> great<00:03:45.019> thing<00:03:45.049> is

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
this with two hands the great thing is

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.110 
this with two hands the great thing is
it<00:03:45.530> hangs<00:03:45.769> the<00:03:45.920> device<00:03:46.160> like<00:03:46.400> this<00:03:46.640> you<00:03:46.970> can

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
it hangs the device like this you can

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.039 
it hangs the device like this you can
use<00:03:47.150> those<00:03:47.390> for<00:03:47.570> your<00:03:47.690> tablets<00:03:48.230> or<00:03:48.410> your

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
adjust this by pulling this in and out

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.870 
adjust this by pulling this in and out
if<00:04:09.799> you<00:04:09.950> want<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:10.220> make<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:10.519> little<00:04:10.609> tighter

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
if you want to make it a little tighter

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.539 
if you want to make it a little tighter
based<00:04:11.630> upon<00:04:11.959> how<00:04:12.200> your<00:04:12.350> fingers<00:04:12.769> operate<00:04:13.280> you

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
based upon how your fingers operate you

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:14.949 
based upon how your fingers operate you
can<00:04:13.700> take<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.090> do<00:04:14.180> that<00:04:14.389> maybe<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:14.750> have

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
can take and do that maybe you have

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.810 
can take and do that maybe you have
smaller<00:04:15.380> fingers<00:04:15.680> or<00:04:16.010> smaller<00:04:16.250> hands<00:04:16.549> than<00:04:16.639> I

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
smaller fingers or smaller hands than I

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.509 
smaller fingers or smaller hands than I
do<00:04:16.880> so<00:04:17.659> it<00:04:17.900> works<00:04:18.049> out<00:04:18.200> really<00:04:18.440> good<00:04:18.739> that<00:04:19.340> way

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
do so it works out really good that way

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.430 
do so it works out really good that way
the<00:04:20.510> one<00:04:20.659> of<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:20.870> things<00:04:21.049> that<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:21.229> like<00:04:21.380> about

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
the one of the things that I like about

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.470 
the one of the things that I like about
it<00:04:21.709> is<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.070> does

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
it is it does

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.750 
it is it does
give<00:04:23.340> see<00:04:24.340> if<00:04:24.430> we<00:04:24.520> can<00:04:24.670> do<00:04:24.790> this<00:04:26.310> it<00:04:27.310> does<00:04:27.520> kind

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
give see if we can do this it does kind

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.060 
give see if we can do this it does kind
of<00:04:27.790> give<00:04:27.940> an<00:04:28.090> angle<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:28.630> your<00:04:28.810> device<00:04:29.260> if<00:04:29.740> you

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
of give an angle to your device if you

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.950 
of give an angle to your device if you
use<00:04:30.100> it<00:04:30.400> on<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.640> back<00:04:30.820> not<00:04:31.090> much<00:04:31.360> but<00:04:31.630> just<00:04:31.870> a

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
use it on the back not much but just a

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.840 
use it on the back not much but just a
little<00:04:32.110> bit<00:04:32.320> maybe<00:04:32.860> at<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.190> restaurant<00:04:33.640> or

someplace you're eating some food you
want<00:04:35.920> a<00:04:35.980> little<00:04:36.100> bit<00:04:36.280> of<00:04:36.340> angle<00:04:36.820> on<00:04:37.000> your

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
want a little bit of angle on your

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.810 
want a little bit of angle on your
device<00:04:38.350> you<00:04:38.620> can<00:04:38.830> take<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.220> do<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:39.640> way

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
device you can take and do it that way

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.430 
device you can take and do it that way
let's<00:04:40.120> see<00:04:40.240> if<00:04:40.300> I<00:04:40.360> can<00:04:40.570> get<00:04:40.720> more<00:04:40.990> of<00:04:41.200> an<00:04:41.320> angle

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
let's see if I can get more of an angle

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.720 
let's see if I can get more of an angle
just<00:04:42.010> for<00:04:42.190> fun<00:04:43.560> there<00:04:44.560> look<00:04:44.890> I<00:04:45.040> got<00:04:45.220> more<00:04:45.430> well

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
just for fun there look I got more well

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.760 
just for fun there look I got more well
maybe<00:04:46.240> not<00:04:47.070> so<00:04:48.070> ooh<00:04:48.370> look<00:04:49.180> I'm<00:04:49.600> brilliant<00:04:49.990> I'm
