Jabari<00:01:24.780> or<00:01:25.080> maybe<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.890> bit<00:01:26.070> slow<00:01:26.310> but

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
Jabari or maybe because it bit slow but

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.399 
Jabari or maybe because it bit slow but
he<00:01:26.850> has<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> acceleration<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> just

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
he has the acceleration so I just

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.410

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
offense I was hoping for Henderson to be

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.440 
offense I was hoping for Henderson to be
open<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.460> teams<00:04:32.700> because<00:04:32.880> he<00:04:32.970> keeps<00:04:33.120> putting

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
open the teams because he keeps putting

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.000 
open the teams because he keeps putting
the<00:04:33.630> same<00:04:33.840> thing<00:04:33.990> down<00:04:34.200> which<00:04:34.620> makes<00:04:34.920> it

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
the same thing down which makes it

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.490 
the same thing down which makes it
easier<00:04:35.370> for<00:04:35.520> me<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.640> throw<00:04:35.820> deep<00:04:36.090> or<00:04:36.570> Mecca

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
easier for me to throw deep or Mecca

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.770 
easier for me to throw deep or Mecca
because<00:04:37.950> he's<00:04:38.100> playing<00:04:38.310> man-to-man<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:39.150> I'd

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780
