these these headlights for you these are

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.760 
these these headlights for you these are
the<00:00:18.210> first<00:00:18.359> ones<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.199> are<00:00:19.320> coming<00:00:19.619> on

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the first ones that are coming on

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.050 
the first ones that are coming on
they're<00:00:20.430> going<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.730> be<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:21.930> rigid<00:00:22.260> industries

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.939 

already<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.330> fire<00:00:27.960> hydrant<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.529> front<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.830> me

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
already a fire hydrant in front of me

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.139 
already a fire hydrant in front of me
this<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.429> about<00:00:30.230> 40<00:00:31.230> feet<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.619> front<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.009> me

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
this is about 40 feet in front of me

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.630 
this is about 40 feet in front of me
it's<00:00:33.149> not<00:00:33.300> too<00:00:33.510> bad<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:35.460> where<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
it's not too bad you can see where the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.080 
it's not too bad you can see where the
beams<00:00:35.850> overlap<00:00:36.360> very<00:00:36.540> flat<00:00:37.200> very<00:00:37.500> wide<00:00:38.600> okay

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
beams overlap very flat very wide okay

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.310 
beams overlap very flat very wide okay
here's<00:00:42.090> my<00:00:42.840> headlights<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.910> have<00:00:44.910> 6,000<00:00:45.600> K<00:00:45.719> 35

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
here's my headlights I have 6,000 K 35

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.779 
here's my headlights I have 6,000 K 35
watt<00:00:46.739> HIDs<00:00:48.110> those<00:00:49.110> are<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.460> warming

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
watt HIDs those are going to be warming

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.939 
watt HIDs those are going to be warming
up<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:53.420> turn<00:00:54.420> these<00:00:54.600> off<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:55.800> them

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
up I turn these off so you can see them

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.229 
up I turn these off so you can see them
in<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> rigid<00:00:56.520> industries

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
in the rigid industries

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.500 
in the rigid industries
so<00:00:57.840> those<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.109> my<00:00:58.140> headlamps<00:00:59.210> only<00:01:02.390> go<00:01:03.390> ahead

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
so those are my headlamps only go ahead

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.900 
so those are my headlamps only go ahead
to<00:01:03.629> start<00:01:03.840> this

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.540 

so<00:01:11.910> those<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.120> my<00:01:12.150> low<00:01:12.420> beams<00:01:13.250> these<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.400> my

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
so those are my low beams these are my

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.100 
so those are my low beams these are my
high<00:01:14.760> beams<00:01:15.350> those<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.620> 45<00:01:17.130> watt<00:01:18.110> just

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
high beams those are the 45 watt just

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.580 
high beams those are the 45 watt just
standard<00:01:19.500> halogens<00:01:20.720> these<00:01:21.720> are<00:01:21.900> my<00:01:22.380> low<00:01:22.590> beams

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
standard halogens these are my low beams

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.620 
standard halogens these are my low beams
6000k<00:01:27.410> these<00:01:28.410> are<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> rigid<00:01:28.979> industries

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.480 
white there I'll tell you go ahead and
give<00:01:47.869> it<00:01:47.899> a<00:01:47.990> quick<00:01:48.170> little<00:01:48.409> driver<00:01:48.770> on<00:01:49.040> here<00:01:49.340> so

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
give it a quick little driver on here so

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.230 
give it a quick little driver on here so
you<00:01:49.610> can<00:01:49.820> see<00:01:50.649> so<00:01:51.649> that's<00:01:51.820> rigid<00:01:52.820> industries

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
you can see so that's rigid industries

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.929 
you can see so that's rigid industries
KC<00:01:54.049> day<00:01:54.320> lighters

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939

now<00:02:02.479> go<00:02:02.689> ahead<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:02.929> turn<00:02:03.200> these<00:02:03.320> fog<00:02:03.649> lamps

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
now go ahead and turn these fog lamps

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.219 
now go ahead and turn these fog lamps
off<00:02:04.249> real<00:02:04.520> quick<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:04.939> can<00:02:05.060> see<00:02:05.299> so<00:02:06.049> that's

what the rigid industries off a CD
lighters<00:02:11.680> off
