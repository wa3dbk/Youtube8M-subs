00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:22.820
 it's buggy and we do not find ourselves 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:25.669
 review avermedia room then she added 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:35.600
 here are two boxes you receive it 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:38.120
 like this so I'm going there there he is 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.719
 really very very thin and very light 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.390
 finally very very hungry no but it's fine 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.060
 for a case here it is 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.640
 present this way to me personally 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.060
 I had a hd pvr gaming edition monday 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.920
 to tell you that it changes my life 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.160
 So here is below the box 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.860
 of age is so the framework of us is that 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.989
 you will connect to the computer and to the 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.989
 vermin that is below the record 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:18.189
 so the guide in several languages 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:22.789
 so here is the boutis avermedia 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:24.880
 you can see this end finally like 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.679
 a flat screen a brief you hit me 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.359
 but he is very young, that's for sure 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.009
 can do his sport with a month 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.560
 Thursday I praised the pvr gaming 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.810
 edition could close your house my 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.420
 sport with that so it's really 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.670
 super it takes no room and its price 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.689
 is 680 euros 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.810
 so for the place that takes the design 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.899
 is the utility he has I think that 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.369
 it was a very good price that allowed 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.459
 people who do not have too much money going 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.759
 to be able to take a catch because 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:02.060
 I know that the hd pvr gaming edition 12 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:05.060
 the bastide was 200 euros two years 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.529
 so that evolved they did more 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.509
 small boxes and frankly it's 

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:10.459
 super so after I do not know the range 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.099
 of avermedia that they have 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.290
 when we work here I know that 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.200
 purpose besides I will hero thank you thank you 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.840
 a lot to their media to fight 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.510
 here you are with his family with that 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.310
 that I had table so the usb cable that 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.390
 you 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.340
 plugged crooked but well to your 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.110
 computer and then you need two cables 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.970
 hdmi so these two Belgian damian case 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.430
 like would connect TV to their 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.480
 media is a man from the xbox to 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.530
 the world aveyron therefore that of the x box 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.860
 gets on ina 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.740
 that's good so it started on 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.650
 in that of the harvard xbox mediation 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.240
 and then the TV to the pair 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.370
 median on out it's all simple san 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.020
 clutter or not there are a lot of wires 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.580
 it's great I'm delighted at the level of 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.650
 offset time 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.890
 nothing really does not finally target a 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:14.450
 second but that's great what I say 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.160
 not with the age of the baby with the editions 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.580
 already I had movies everywhere it was 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.750
 horrible in addition to that was hardly 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.390
 you change them and at the shift 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.710
 it was bluff 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.660
 good I recommend you before the interest 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:34.280
 for its usefulness for its design for 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.250
 have all of me personally I am 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.720
 very happy that facilitates me notice at 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.450
 level of videos years before I before you 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.459
 do not say the galÃ¨re here it is so there 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:51.410
 will need the eccentric hours software that 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:53.570
 I want to show all his little business 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.000
 central media and you download 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.680
 the software according to your pc 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.060
 so it's so simple, frankly it's 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.260
 the configuration profile this is this 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.220
 barely amount at least I did my 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.080
 small setting 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.090
 here you go in advanced you can 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.670
 all set current computers other 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.609
 computer consoles format games 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.570
 video resolution and terra that's it and this 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.220
 which is good it's from you can 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.530
 register your fingers at the same time as 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.290
 you play a course you'll have two 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.290
 files so your voice in a file 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.300
 and the other the center of the gameplay and 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.070
 the other gameplay so that's great 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.600
 facilitates my friends bankers problems 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.310
 take off every time so here 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.770
 you 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.210
 microphone is saved as 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.700
 microphone mp3 files wants to be active 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.400
 and that of cÃ©dric microphone for my 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.920
 part is mila and it's gone slowly 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.900
 for the cei disable them 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:51.070
 that's it if you want some settings 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.660
 I advise you to go see the little 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.380
 toad to cape is the real i know he has 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.210
 stepped one of his parents 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:03.280
 u19 boxing on it and it's thanks to him 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.870
 we all and all and everything settled there 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.080
 there is a small problem also seen at the beginning 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.530
 for software pole to download from 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.690
 software 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.000
 we had to accept cookies on the 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.450
 site he was asking to accept or so 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.550
 no it's not that access no wait i 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.710
 will get there it was necessary 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.870
 oh yes but here accept the window 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.460
 pop up that's it all and you do 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:32.080
 go up and his daughter sure we are on the 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:35.380
 box here's up top here here you can 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.800
 to make screenshots it's hyper 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.650
 simple and then after you close this 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.490
 page you come back a factor ranging from 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.420
 his next 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.580
 ok and video folders is here you will 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.370
 all the videos you did 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:56.710
 this is after all that at the level 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.750
 from the stream I do not know at all 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.810
 how it works 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.180
 so that will have to go but 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.000
 so it was a little presentation of 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.190
 the old media lgp says I hope that 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.110
 this video in any case you will have well 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.660
 to inform and have made you want 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.550
 to buy this range capture and that's it 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.550
 under kisses and yahoo
