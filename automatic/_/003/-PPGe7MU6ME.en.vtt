00:00:07.183 --> 00:00:08.353
 Have you ever heard of a term? 

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:09.752
 "Glacier summit"? 

00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:11.832
 You know that icebergs are mostly underwater, 

00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:14.100
 It has a huge hidden part under the water 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.742
 But why are they? 

00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:17.975
 Well the density of pure ice 

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:19.966
 Less than the density of sea water 

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.240
 Usually only 1/9 of the size of the glacier 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.662
 Be above the water. 

00:00:23.662 --> 00:00:25.288
 The hidden part is under water 

00:00:25.288 --> 00:00:26.498
 It is difficult to distinguish 

00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:28.774
 By looking at the floating part of the surface. 

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:30.333
 This has led to the expression, 

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.917
 "Glacier Summit". 

00:00:31.917 --> 00:00:33.335
 There are some things you may not know 

00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:35.259
 On the icy islands. 

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:36.350
 The emergence of the glacier 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.849
 It begins several thousand years ago 

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:39.641
 Before reaching the ocean. 

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:41.679
 Unlike sea ice or ice pack, 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.410
 Which forms when the ocean freezes, 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.593
 The glaciers formed from fresh water. 

00:00:45.593 --> 00:00:46.681
 since thousands of years, 

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:49.685
 These glaciers were constructed layers after layer of ice, 

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:50.852
 With continuous pressure, 

00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:51.615
 Continuous movement, 

00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:52.410
 Collected snow 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.108
 And pressure 

00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:54.157
 And animated again 

00:00:54.157 --> 00:00:56.664
 As you progress slowly like a frozen river. 

00:00:56.664 --> 00:00:58.108
 That is the force of gravity 

00:00:58.108 --> 00:01:00.166
 Which draws him towards the sea, 

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.740
 At that time, the glaciers may become an iceberg 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.670
 Or continue to spread as an ice shelf 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.107
 Or glacial glands. 

00:01:07.107 --> 00:01:08.547
 As soon as the iceberg breaks away 

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:10.263
 From glaciers or ice shelves, 

00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:12.308
 It may usually live for 3 - 6 years, 

00:01:12.308 --> 00:01:14.054
 Floating, carrying currents 

00:01:14.054 --> 00:01:16.537
 And tidal movements in the ocean. 

00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:17.756
 Where they float side by side, 

00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:18.923
 And hit by waves 

00:01:18.923 --> 00:01:19.677
 And melt 

00:01:19.677 --> 00:01:21.023
 And crashing on the ground 

00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:23.274
 Sometimes with some other glaciers, 

00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:25.143
 Some glaciers are totally unstable 

00:01:25.143 --> 00:01:27.230
 It has more dramatic ends, 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.691
 Flying 

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:28.229
 And collapse 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.996
 Sometimes it may explode. 

00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:31.305
 As it collapses, 

00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:35.051
 Many of the glaciers are a strange group of sounds. 

00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:36.741
 When melting a piece of iceberg, 

00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:38.192
 They challenged the voice of Furan, 

00:01:38.192 --> 00:01:40.125
 It is called the Seltzer Towers. 

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.306
 This sound is made when the ice water interface reaches 

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:45.630
 To compressed air bubbles trapped in the ice. 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.979
 As this happens, when a bubble bursts, 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.393
 Updated pop sound. 

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:54.015
 There are six official categories of iceberg sizes. 

00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:57.182
 The smaller glaciers are called "grouls". 

00:01:57.182 --> 00:01:59.590
 It can reach the size of a car 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.645
 This is very dangerous for ships and boats 

00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:03.721
 Because they are usually rattling on the water line 

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:05.680
 Where they can not be easily monitored. 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.526
 The following "gestures of my tower" 

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.642
 - Yes, that's her scientific name - 

00:02:09.642 --> 00:02:12.186
 Which can reach the size of a house. 

00:02:12.186 --> 00:02:14.020
 The other four sizes are small 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.684
 And medium 

00:02:14.684 --> 00:02:15.396
 And great 

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:17.081
 And very large. 

00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:20.171
 So what is the enormity of the very large icebergs? 

00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:22.618
 Officially, any glacier looks bigger 

00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:25.670
 From 270 feet above sea level 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.790
 And 670 feet in length 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.348
 It is very large. 

00:02:30.348 --> 00:02:34.140
 The 27-storey looming blue sky. 

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:37.763
 How do glaciers get blue anyway? 

00:02:37.763 --> 00:02:39.157
 When snow falls on the ice 

00:02:39.157 --> 00:02:41.266
 It is compressed on several hundred years, 

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:42.268
 Heavy snow 

00:02:42.268 --> 00:02:44.450
 Air bubbles are forced out of the ice, 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.086
 Create a pure ice with little air trapped inside. 

00:02:48.086 --> 00:02:49.354
 This pressure is seen 

00:02:49.354 --> 00:02:50.887
 When the rivers of ice settle, 

00:02:50.887 --> 00:02:52.556
 Thus establishing a blue glacier. 

00:02:53.186 --> 00:02:54.891
 The iceberg was not exposed 

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:55.900
 For a lot of pressure 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.198
 Contains a large amount of air and surface edges 

00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:00.800
 It also reflects white light. 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.628
 Although they form in areas located to the far north or south, 

00:03:03.628 --> 00:03:06.370
 The glaciers can float thousands of miles away. 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.026
 A glacier from the Arctic 

00:03:08.026 --> 00:03:10.278
 South to Bermuda. 

00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:12.827
 The Antarctic icebergs are mostly besieged 

00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:13.960
 In the current polar, 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.171
 They did not have the opportunity to float north. 

00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:18.490
 However, it has been known that they cut 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.631
 The shipping lanes between Australia, 

00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:20.385
 South america 

00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:21.967
 And South Africa 

00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:23.927
 Despite all their travels, 

00:03:23.927 --> 00:03:25.147
 Many people think 

00:03:25.147 --> 00:03:27.632
 That these ice sheets are barren of life, 

00:03:27.632 --> 00:03:29.724
 But the ice sheets look futile 

00:03:29.724 --> 00:03:32.254
 Harbor their own complex environmental systems 

00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:33.562
 And constitute ecosystems 

00:03:33.562 --> 00:03:35.105
 Which passes through it. 

00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:38.359
 Becoming a floating and mobile ecosystem. 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.621
 Even in the coldest of seas, 

00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:41.112
 The glaciers are constantly melting, 

00:03:41.112 --> 00:03:42.786
 At least a little. 

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:44.364
 This melting has a great effect 

00:03:44.364 --> 00:03:46.412
 On the ocean around the glacier. 

00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:48.081
 Freshwater from the mass 

00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:49.578
 Create a pool of fresh water 

00:03:49.578 --> 00:03:53.177
 Which can extend a mile away from the glacier. 

00:03:53.177 --> 00:03:55.753
 This water is cooler than the seawater surrounding it, 

00:03:55.753 --> 00:03:58.139
 The temperature variation creates thermal currents 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.136
 In the vicinity of the glacier. 

00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:04.076
 Life thrives in and around the glacier. 

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:07.639
 Small fish hiding in small ice holes to avoid predators, 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.311
 While a variety of invertebrates, 

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.341
 Such as jellyfish and samurai, 

00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:13.280
 Gathering in the area. 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.670
 Many of them come to feed on krill, 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.091
 Small creatures like shrimp. 

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:19.115
 Neocons nest on the glaciers 

00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:21.442
 And feed on nearby marine organisms. 

00:04:21.442 --> 00:04:25.230
 Whales, seals and penguins like them. 

00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:28.418
 So now that I've known all this, 

00:04:28.418 --> 00:04:30.949
 We are still at the top of the iceberg. 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.222
 There are a bunch of things 

00:04:32.222 --> 00:04:34.109
 We do not know about icebergs. 

00:04:34.109 --> 00:04:36.509
 Perhaps you are the person who will look deeper.
