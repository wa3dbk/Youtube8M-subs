00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.740
 welcome to this new tutorial 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.020
 tribe of the lanyard today we take care of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.500
 GoPro studio 2.0 animations then 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.890
 more 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.230
 only keyframe what it means 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.320
 animal via keyframe means 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.460
 basically set 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.080
 start animation features 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.470
 end of animation features 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.779
 let the software build i 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.190
 intermediate steps to switch from 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.320
 initial situation to the situation 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.449
 the final 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.140
 so said the explanation clarifies a 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.989
 very little 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.900
 let's see it applied and certainly yes 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.300
 will immediately understand go pro studies 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.410
 2.0 keyframe animations 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.450
 only work on the sequences of 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.110
 therefore you cannot imagine on the videos 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.780
 animate titles and you can't animate 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.370
 nothing about audio tracks that it is 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.809
 in short, a great limitation 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.879
 the important thing is that already there is already 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.640
 important that there is the possibility of 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.640
 animate movies 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.740
 you see that I 'm already in the studio gopro 2.0 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.850
 step 2 with a clip already imported e 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.259
 converted 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.350
 specifically this is a time lapse 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.869
 which we did in the occasion 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.060
 of the via ferrata of the central outlets e 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.549
 not even in the video always on ours 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.390
 channel today imported the clip into the 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.990
 timeline is what we will do 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.890
 animate a zoom out then a zoom 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.830
 back on this timelapse we carry 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.729
 at the beginning of our clip and open 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.979
 the tab framing the parameters that we will go 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.170
 use it will be a horizontal zoom but 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.040
 I would like you to notice that any 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.780
 parameter where the item is present 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.530
 keyframe in this plus can 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.270
 potentially be animated so 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.579
 we will focus only on 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.460
 question of framing I repeat you can 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.630
 change the display in contrast to the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.939
 white balance 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.790
 as long as there is a keyframe and 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.920
 this the more we start we said he has 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.070
 a zoom out so the beginning of 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.730
 sequence will be a little zoomed then 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.890
 what we do is click on more in 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.989
 this way we inserted a keyframe 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.750
 and now let's define the 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.890
 features of that keyframe therefore 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.890
 let's zoom in a bit on the image and 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.620
 moving with the horizontal slider ci 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.930
 we bring to a point where we can 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.060
 frame some of the shelter 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.980
 we have defined what they are 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.290
 characteristics of the first who does and 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.690
 then in the keyframe of the initial of the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.580
 we carry our animation to the end 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.810
 animation then at the end of 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.099
 sequence and insert a new keyframe 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.050
 this new keyframe must be 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.700
 defined for which we modify i 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:05.319
 zoom and sneijder parameters 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:08.230
 horizontal more or less we are the 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.989
 roughly we are there 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.840
 so you see what now 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.000
 we have the keyframe entry is the minus key 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.430
 in fact, if we click, we get less like you 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.190
 also says suggestion we will remove the 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.379
 key latches we entered look at 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.510
 animation as it is as it is now 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.170
 if we carry ourselves at the beginning and we click 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.480
 for play you see that there is this zooming 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.299
 back and this zoomed back e 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.950
 precisely defined by the keyframes that 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.030
 we set from the two keyframes that 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.030
 we set do we suppose of 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.040
 have entered a wrong keyframe or 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.590
 better to have it inserted too late 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.569
 let's say we wanted the zoom 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.190
 it ended before the end of the sequence 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.650
 let's go look 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.079
 scrolling through our clip to where 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.510
 we find the keyframe and you have seen that 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.340
 he found it really understood that this is it 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.200
 precisely because instead of there being more 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.250
 now there is or not if we who ask 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.709
 on less 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.440
 click on unless we removed the 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.510
 keyframe we are back in the same 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.359
 condition as defined by ours 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.099
 first keyframe we said that 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.049
 we wanted the zooming to end first 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.299
 of the end of the clip then we carry 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.450
 approximately here 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:29.800
 we click on more demos and set of 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:32.200
 new the key frame parameters we have 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.060
 set so we look again 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.979
 how the sequence came we have the 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.380
 same zoom in and out 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.360
 the only difference is that bach ends 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.320
 before that there was a piece of the 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.030
 sequence that does not move is not sum is 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.470
 roughly this is what it is from 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.070
 say on the keyframes how you could 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.160
 see are gods 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.370
 points of the image to where they come from 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.380
 defined certain characteristics 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.420
 animation start feature 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.740
 end-of-animation features and the 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.180
 computer via what is pro 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.740
 called the interpolation process 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.210
 creates the various passages that lead downey 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.790
 who brakes at the next 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.380
 as I told you whatever it can 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.690
 be animated let's do a fast 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.510
 example also with the exposure we are 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.250
 at the beginning of the movie 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.680
 we insert a keyframe and suppose to 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.210
 wanting to lower the long exposure 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.330
 the whole movie we take to a 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.550
 francs depending on who incidentally do not think 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.150
 it is necessary species of carlo but better 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.710
 better to do it does not have to match with 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.420
 the precedents we can put where 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.610
 we want keyframes and terms 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.130
 certain different characteristics ie 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.140
 the framing must all be in the 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.640
 same keyframe if we talk about who 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.170
 fring for what concerns the 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.180
 We must not manage image management 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.160
 stay there where we set the 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.110
 previous we can stay where we want 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.410
 create them compress your completely 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.210
 several we add a new keyframe e 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.710
 let's lower the exposure I don't know why 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.130
 we should do it but just repeat it 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:08.690
 for a question of example we carry ourselves 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:12.390
 at the beginning we start the movie e 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.790
 see that slowly the slider will 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.270
 lowers and therefore also the exposure from 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:23.160
 canada and it looks particularly good 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:25.800
 especially at the end so tutorial 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.420
 extremely short but in its own right 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.160
 virtue of the fact that ultimately 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.960
 the discourse of animations through 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.790
 keyframe in this software is 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.350
 extremely simple 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.210
 the controls at your disposal are 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.010
 very few as we have already said 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.760
 concern the possibility of animating 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:44.460
 only iris, however, is already an important plus 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.230
 that for free software there are 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.320
 also these controls available 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.460
 if the user tutorial maybe 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.170
 had liked it 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.449
 let us know by leaving a lay person 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.430
 any comments if you have any questions 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:59.400
 the problems to write in the comments below 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.800
 and if you want to know when i 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.509
 upcoming tutorials join the channel 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.409
 I thank you I wish you good shooting 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:11.599
 if you had the opportunity to do them e 

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:11.599
 I greet you at the next tutorial hello
