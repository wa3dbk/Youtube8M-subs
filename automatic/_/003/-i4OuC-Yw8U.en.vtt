up<00:04:05.490> not<00:04:06.490> that<00:04:06.640> big<00:04:06.820> of<00:04:06.880> a<00:04:07.060> deal<00:04:07.240> I'm<00:04:07.570> probably

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
up not that big of a deal I'm probably

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.970 
up not that big of a deal I'm probably
just<00:04:07.960> going<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.260> be<00:04:08.320> wearing<00:04:08.530> this<00:04:08.590> around<00:04:08.740> the

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
just going to be wearing this around the

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.140 
just going to be wearing this around the
house<00:04:09.160> or<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.680> pool<00:04:12.010> and<00:04:12.370> back<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:13.090> that's

house or to the pool and back and that's

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.330 
house or to the pool and back and that's
about<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.480> so<00:04:13.960> probably<00:04:14.830> wouldn't<00:04:15.070> wear<00:04:15.190> this

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340
