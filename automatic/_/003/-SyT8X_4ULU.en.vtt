 really like inside the package 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.500
 there is an internal controller itself 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.869
 part of which is carefully covered with film 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.909

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.549
 and headphone adapter 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.470
 it is needed here because of the specific 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.929
 gamepad designs when input for 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.570
 headphone overlaps so have to 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.840
 connect such an adapter and already in it 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.810
 your headphones are not the most elegant way but 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.150
 moderately comfortable game does not interfere at all 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.880
 iphone is placed a large notch by 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.190
 the center of the game controller for this 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.320

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.750
