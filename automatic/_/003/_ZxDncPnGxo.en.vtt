by<00:00:02.970> now<00:00:03.179> I've<00:00:03.799> finished<00:00:06.200> good<00:00:07.200> work<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.680> on<00:00:08.130> the

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
by now I've finished good work on on the

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.009 
by now I've finished good work on on the
cathouse<00:00:08.570> I've<00:00:09.570> cocked<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.860> interior<00:00:12.019> I've

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
cathouse I've cocked the interior I've

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.289 
cathouse I've cocked the interior I've
laid<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.440> thermal<00:00:13.830> insulation<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.759> also<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
laid the thermal insulation and also the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.900 
laid the thermal insulation and also the
interior<00:00:15.719> panels<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.500> I've<00:00:17.279> all<00:00:17.400> sustained

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
interior panels and I've all sustained

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.220 
interior panels and I've all sustained
what<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> wanted<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> stain<00:00:19.760> of<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.230> completed

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
what I wanted to stain of it completed

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.560 
what I wanted to stain of it completed
the<00:00:22.380> roof<00:00:22.590> as<00:00:22.769> well<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.210> look<00:00:24.359> here

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the roof as well and if you look here

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.600 
the roof as well and if you look here
you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.900> see<00:00:26.210> this<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:31.160> the<00:00:32.160> primary

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
you can see this is the the the primary

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.040 
you can see this is the the the primary
wood<00:00:32.820> panel<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.540> shows<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
wood panel the one that shows on the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.600 
wood panel the one that shows on the
inside<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.890> insulation<00:00:35.430> this

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
inside then you have the insulation this

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.959 
inside then you have the insulation this
is<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.410> two-centimeter<00:00:37.790> extruded<00:00:38.790> polystyrene

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
is a two-centimeter extruded polystyrene

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.290 
is a two-centimeter extruded polystyrene
which<00:00:39.780> means<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.200> equivalent<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.800> about<00:00:41.300> two

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
which means it's equivalent to about two

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.060 
which means it's equivalent to about two
tents<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.840> about<00:00:43.290> eight<00:00:43.530> centimeters<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
tents for about eight centimeters of

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.750 
tents for about eight centimeters of
expanded<00:00:44.820> polystyrene<00:00:46.219> so<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:47.520> pretty

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
expanded polystyrene so it's it's pretty

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.190 
expanded polystyrene so it's it's pretty
good<00:00:47.879> insulation<00:00:48.239> actually<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.960> roof

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
good insulation actually for the roof

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.260 
good insulation actually for the roof
considering<00:00:50.129> there's<00:00:50.309> also<00:00:50.460> once<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.090> meter

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
considering there's also once in a meter

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.560 
considering there's also once in a meter
of<00:00:51.329> wood<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.940> about<00:00:53.940> 2<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.539> 3

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
of wood here and about 2 to 3

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.810 
of wood here and about 2 to 3
centimeters<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.260> wood<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.680> top<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:56.309> well<00:00:56.610> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
centimeters of wood on top as well so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
centimeters of wood on top as well so
you've<00:00:56.940> got<00:00:56.969> solid<00:00:57.750> insulation<00:00:58.379> all<00:00:58.530> through

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
you've got solid insulation all through

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.119 
you've got solid insulation all through
the<00:00:59.520> same<00:00:59.760> thing<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.180> walls<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.410> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the same thing with the walls here this

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.640 
the same thing with the walls here this
is<00:01:02.309> 2<00:01:02.489> centimeters<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.449> then<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
is 2 centimeters here and then on the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.070 
is 2 centimeters here and then on the
inside<00:01:04.769> you've<00:01:05.129> got<00:01:05.390> 220<00:01:06.390> two<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.810> three

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
inside you've got 220 two or three

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.920 
inside you've got 220 two or three
centimeter<00:01:08.119> polystyrene<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.750> top

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
centimeter polystyrene and then on top

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.620 
centimeter polystyrene and then on top
of<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.590> centimeter<00:01:11.010> wood<00:01:11.250> panels

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
of that the one centimeter wood panels

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.249 
of that the one centimeter wood panels
so<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.369> cat<00:01:14.580> house<00:01:15.259> that's

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
so this is this is a cat house that's

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.340 
so this is this is a cat house that's
gonna<00:01:16.409> withstand<00:01:16.710> severe<00:01:17.580> temperatures

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
gonna withstand severe temperatures

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.080 
gonna withstand severe temperatures
which<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.189> great<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:20.909> so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
which is so which is great it's all so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
which is so which is great it's all so
solidly<00:01:21.509> built<00:01:22.130> at<00:01:23.130> least<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:25.520> so

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
solidly built at least I think so so

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.070 
solidly built at least I think so so
I've<00:01:26.610> stay<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> exteriors<00:01:27.509> well<00:01:27.750> I've

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
I've stay in the exteriors well I've

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.380 
I've stay in the exteriors well I've
mounted<00:01:28.320> wheels<00:01:28.770> here<00:01:29.189> they're<00:01:30.150> locking

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
mounted wheels here they're locking

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.700 
mounted wheels here they're locking
wheels<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:31.049> casters<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:33.320> what<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.590> do

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
wheels with casters and what I can do

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.420 
wheels with casters and what I can do
now<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:34.920> actually<00:01:36.259> first<00:01:37.259> thing<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.860> didn't<00:01:38.220> ok

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
so i can do is pull it up from here just

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.600 
so i can do is pull it up from here just
lift<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:43.920> carry<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.369> i'm<00:01:44.579> not

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
lift it up and then carry it i'm not

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.429 
lift it up and then carry it i'm not
going<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.420> because<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.259> roof

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
going to do it now because of the roof

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.620 
going to do it now because of the roof
is<00:01:46.619> still<00:01:46.710> propped<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.340> waiting<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
is still propped up waiting for the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.950 
is still propped up waiting for the
stain<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.619> dry<00:01:50.420> then<00:01:51.420> i'm<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.720> start

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
stain to dry then i'm going to start

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.480 
stain to dry then i'm going to start
putting<00:01:52.920> some<00:01:53.689> some<00:01:54.689> wood<00:01:54.869> wax<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.490> this

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
putting some some wood wax on it this

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.580 
putting some some wood wax on it this
isn't<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> final<00:01:57.210> color<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.930> final<00:01:58.200> color<00:01:58.409> is

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
isn't the final color the final color is

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.929 
isn't the final color the final color is
actually<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.280> little<00:01:59.460> deeper

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
actually going to be a little deeper

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.690 
actually going to be a little deeper
because<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.479> wood<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.170> wood<00:02:01.740> wax<00:02:02.130> also<00:02:02.549> has

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
because the wood the wood wax also has

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.800 
because the wood the wood wax also has
some<00:02:02.880> built-in<00:02:03.299> stain<00:02:03.719> as<00:02:03.990> well<00:02:05.060> so

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
some built-in stain as well so

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.710 
some built-in stain as well so
it's<00:02:07.740> going<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.099> nice<00:02:08.340> warm<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:09.030> brown<00:02:09.270> on

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
it's going to be a nice warm of brown on

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.260 
it's going to be a nice warm of brown on
the<00:02:09.929> exterior<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> interior<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the exterior and on the interior the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.050 
the exterior and on the interior the
walls<00:02:12.480> are<00:02:12.630> going<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.900> be<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> deep<00:02:14.010> yellow<00:02:14.640> sort

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
walls are going to be a deep yellow sort

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.360

stain inside the wood wax now I did make

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.290

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
because I figured as cats are gonna be

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.660 
because I figured as cats are gonna be
walking<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.310> from<00:02:26.459> outside<00:02:27.440> dirty<00:02:28.440> paws<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:29.099> I

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
walking in from outside dirty paws and I

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.229 
walking in from outside dirty paws and I
didn't<00:02:29.970> want<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.209> ruin<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.349> color<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.430> DPL

there so that's what's still left to do

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.590 
there so that's what's still left to do
this<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:31.079> i<00:03:31.109> guess<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.590> could<00:03:31.739> call<00:03:31.920> this<00:03:32.160> the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.569 

sort<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.840> baffle<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:40.889> also<00:03:41.069> going<00:03:41.459> to

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
sort of a baffle this is also going to

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.160 
sort of a baffle this is also going to
be

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
be

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.040 
be
dunwood<00:03:44.170> watch<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.890> what<00:03:45.040> this<00:03:45.160> actually<00:03:45.400> is

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
dunwood watch and what this actually is

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.650 
dunwood watch and what this actually is
is<00:03:47.050> it<00:03:47.230> fits<00:03:47.440> here<00:03:50.610> inside<00:03:51.610> like<00:03:52.239> this<00:03:52.270> in

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
is it fits here inside like this in

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.150 
is it fits here inside like this in
front<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.080> entrance<00:03:53.200> i'll<00:03:53.560> i'll<00:03:53.800> have<00:03:54.010> to

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
front of the entrance i'll i'll have to

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.479 
front of the entrance i'll i'll have to
readjust<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.270> a<00:03:55.360> bit<00:03:55.540> but<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.739> point<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.160> this

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
readjust it a bit but the point of this

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.990 
readjust it a bit but the point of this
is<00:03:58.060> so<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.480> if<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.680> dog<00:03:59.920> were<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.489> chase<00:04:00.730> them

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
is so that if a dog were to chase them

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.240 
is so that if a dog were to chase them
and<00:04:01.230> they'd<00:04:02.230> go<00:04:02.260> inside<00:04:02.709> their<00:04:02.890> little<00:04:02.980> cat

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
and they'd go inside their little cat

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.100 
and they'd go inside their little cat
house<00:04:03.459> for<00:04:03.730> refuge<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.360> doc<00:04:04.569> couldn't<00:04:04.840> follow

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
house for refuge the doc couldn't follow

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.710 
house for refuge the doc couldn't follow
inside<00:04:05.530> because<00:04:05.890> this<00:04:06.040> would<00:04:06.220> be<00:04:06.370> in<00:04:06.880> front<00:04:07.599> of

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
inside because this would be in front of

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.240 
inside because this would be in front of
the<00:04:07.810> entrance<00:04:07.959> sort<00:04:08.349> of<00:04:08.440> like<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:08.860> but<00:04:09.160> on

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
the entrance sort of like this but on

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.190 
the entrance sort of like this but on
the<00:04:09.340> other<00:04:09.430> side<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:10.480> once<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:10.959> cats

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
the other side and once the cats

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.130 
the other side and once the cats
coincide<00:04:11.830> they<00:04:12.640> can<00:04:12.849> slink<00:04:13.150> by<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.450> corners

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
coincide they can slink by the corners

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.289 
coincide they can slink by the corners
on<00:04:14.739> each<00:04:14.980> side<00:04:15.220> but<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.519> dog<00:04:15.700> won't<00:04:15.970> be<00:04:16.180> able

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
on each side but the dog won't be able

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.870 
on each side but the dog won't be able
to<00:04:16.419> do<00:04:16.540> that<00:04:16.690> so<00:04:16.959> he<00:04:16.989> can't<00:04:17.320> go<00:04:17.470> in<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:18.700> that's

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
to do that so he can't go in so that's

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.390 
to do that so he can't go in so that's
is<00:04:19.299> this<00:04:19.540> something<00:04:19.870> extra<00:04:20.229> it<00:04:20.979> also<00:04:21.130> helps

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
is this something extra it also helps

is this something extra it also helps
with<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.729> wind<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:22.540> know<00:04:22.660> if<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.960> winds

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
right inside so that's a little

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.740 
right inside so that's a little
something<00:04:28.990> extra<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.820> it<00:04:30.970> can<00:04:31.120> be<00:04:31.270> taken

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
something extra and it can be taken

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.110 
something extra and it can be taken

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
better against the elements and and then

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.800 
better against the elements and and then
you've<00:05:45.010> got<00:05:45.220> the<00:05:46.000> other<00:05:46.090> side<00:05:46.419> of<00:05:46.450> the<00:05:46.630> roof

here that's going to sit on the outer

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.230 
here that's going to sit on the outer
element<00:05:50.260> here<00:05:50.410> so<00:05:50.680> I've<00:05:51.669> gotta<00:05:51.849> hold<00:05:52.150> this

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
element here so I've gotta hold this

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.820 
element here so I've gotta hold this
thing<00:05:52.419> up<00:05:52.570> with<00:05:52.599> one<00:05:52.900> hand<00:05:53.110> and<00:05:53.289> talk<00:05:53.590> with<00:05:53.740> the

the roof is going to sit here so you've

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.540 
the roof is going to sit here so you've
got<00:06:04.380> it<00:06:04.650> closing<00:06:05.040> on<00:06:05.160> two<00:06:05.370> sides<00:06:05.610> and<00:06:06.860> I<00:06:07.860> should

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
got it closing on two sides and I should

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.520 
got it closing on two sides and I should
provide<00:06:08.850> enough<00:06:09.200> enough<00:06:10.200> of<00:06:10.410> a<00:06:10.530> close<00:06:11.070> and

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
provide enough enough of a close and

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.550 
provide enough enough of a close and
enough<00:06:13.530> insulation<00:06:13.980> considering<00:06:14.700> deal

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
enough insulation considering deal

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.680 
enough insulation considering deal
