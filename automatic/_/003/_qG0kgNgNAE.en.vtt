00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello friends and in this video I 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.220
 I want to show you very simple 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.519
 refinement as you can improve 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.280
 perception of your model and in this video 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.330
 we will look at how you can do with 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.330
 by ease 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.670
 imitation of front air ducts 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.550
 car and this technology is applied 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.609
 absolutely to any models I use it 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.099
 on models of magazine series on models 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.090
 from firms he was and what is 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.380
 this modification as you can see on 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.450
 front of the car 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.780
 I made small grids 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:46.140
 maybe it 's hard to see in the video but they 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.840
 there is and how to do it is taken ordinary 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.480
 tea bag 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.399
 as you can see it's kind of mesh 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:00.180
 lipton tea in the pyramids and it has a grid 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.350
 which is made of plastic that is it 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.049
 not a paper bag 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.390
 plastic and mesh she is very very 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:12.689
 small and basically very beautiful you 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.689
 take a bag cut it I them still 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.330
 through the gauze I iron to the net itself 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.580
 she was even 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:25.700
 cut the shape you want and just 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.020
 insert between the body model and 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.579
 the plastic part you get 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.640
 imitation 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.770
 mesh it immediately improves perception 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.140
 here I made models by car 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.180
 lamborghini and 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:47.420
 also made on bentley machines immediately mine 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:51.869
 daughter is perceived and looks much 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:57.210
 more expensive than just a model with 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.649
 black plastic plug principle 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.340
 You can paint this mesh in any 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.670
 Colour 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.110
 even from the barrel in black I'm on 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.000
 I haven't asked for my models yet 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.220
 there was a thought and painting in black 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.979
 so she was fighting when 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.330
 very much such a simple refinement 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.610
 which you can do at home 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.500
 conditions 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.420
 which will improve the perception of your model 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.420
 and thank you for your attention bye
