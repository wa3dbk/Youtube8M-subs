00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:15.670
 It 's refreshing to leave the earth and refine it, but I don't want it anymore 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:22.420
 Poverty discrimination war terrorism care 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:25.510
 I very worst of any global warming natural disasters You wanted to run away from such things Takara 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.320
 I wonder if I got on this spaceship 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:33.270
 What's wrong I think kimi looks at fantasy 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.270
 What do you understand now 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.350
 What this 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.260
 It's not like a movie 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:46.480
 It seems that aliens are fighting each other 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.649
 It's two stars between nations are at war around the natural resources of this planet 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.649
 Let's go to other stars 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:01:01.190
 This star feels quiet and good, but it is not always good to be quiet 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:09.460
 People in this country feel extremely bored in such a quiet environment 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:09.460
 I miss my purpose in life and many people are losing their own life Let's go next 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:22.410
 Oh here because here I happily there is snow covered in snow and ice it is difficult to ensure food 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.950
 There's a side of the machine is to the increasing disputes between the tribes 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.610
 It looks like the earth no matter where you go 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:36.090
 I want to go to a paradise free from hunger, poverty and conflict 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:41.000
 Hey take me it's impossible why the stars without any negatives only positive stars 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.000
 Because it does not exist in this universe 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:49.930
 It looks like I was struck somehow 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:56.460
 Such a tribe of this star will come soon soon 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:59.760
 So I'll run away quickly Why not you can't run away with you here 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.120
 You also have a license to operate the spacecraft 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.860
 I knew it was possible for you to escape alone 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.979
 I love you 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:18.260
 Actually I love you too 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.260
 So no I also you want dead in here I do not want dead to you 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.730
 I'll run away soon I can not do that 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.349
 When you die I wonder when I die 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:42.140
 What you've escaped from a negative to this 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:50.000
 The ultimate negative situation that you may die now , but you wo n't run away 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:53.840
 That's why I mean, you mean that you are the first negative thing in your life 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.550
 I realized that there was a positive thing 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.260
 It really is 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.580
 It is your value since you are experiencing the ultimate negative that you may die 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.180
 It was found the name of 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.900
 Me 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:14.450
 It doesn't matter whether you die before you don't want it from the sky of Chinuhane 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.720
 I feel so grateful just because you are here with you now 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.220
 Me also 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.030
 I am grateful to you I love you 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.720
 Thank you the real world is better than the fantasy world 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.720
 I love you
