00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.310 
brilliant look at that same weapon twice
in<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.270> row<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.750> what's<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.930> difference<00:01:49.079> with

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
in a row so what's the difference with

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.260 
in a row so what's the difference with
this<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:49.549> body<00:01:50.549> shots<00:01:50.820> with<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.060> weapon

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
this one body shots with this weapon

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.910 
this one body shots with this weapon
increased<00:01:51.689> precision<00:01:52.020> damage<00:01:52.439> was<00:01:52.560> shot<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
increased precision damage was shot to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980 
increased precision damage was shot to
him<00:01:53.040> that's<00:01:53.220> an<00:01:53.310> interesting<00:01:53.759> perk<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.329> don't

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
him that's an interesting perk I don't

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.120 
him that's an interesting perk I don't
think<00:01:55.140> I've<00:01:55.200> seen<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.590> before

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
think I've seen that one before

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.440 
think I've seen that one before
it<00:01:56.280> might<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.670> predator<00:01:57.030> timepiece

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
it might be on predator timepiece

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.490 
it might be on predator timepiece
actually<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.079> thought<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.350> was

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
actually but I thought that was

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.899 
actually but I thought that was
exclusive<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.310> because<00:01:59.549> it's<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> raid

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
exclusive to it because it's a raid

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.389 
exclusive to it because it's a raid
weapon<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:01.439> we'll<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.920> leave<00:02:02.219> that

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
weapon so we'll just there leave that

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.910 
weapon so we'll just there leave that
one<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:02.759> now<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.750> we'll<00:02:04.380> see<00:02:04.530> what<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.799> in

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
one for now and we'll see what we get in

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.150 
one for now and we'll see what we get in
the<00:02:04.979> next<00:02:05.070> one<00:02:05.250> oh<00:02:06.380> yeah<00:02:07.380> look<00:02:07.710> at<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.860> I

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
the next one oh yeah look at that I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.680 
the next one oh yeah look at that I
think<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:08.640> that's<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.060> future<00:02:09.209> walk<00:02:09.509> or

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
think I think that's the future walk or

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.490 
think I think that's the future walk or

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
these do we have I think I only have two

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.610 
these do we have I think I only have two
left

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
left

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.320 
left
Oh<00:03:32.480> coiled<00:03:33.480> hiss<00:03:34.400> another<00:03:35.400> pulse<00:03:35.700> rifle<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.209> we

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
Oh coiled hiss another pulse rifle so we

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.699 
Oh coiled hiss another pulse rifle so we
might<00:03:36.480> actually<00:03:36.600> get<00:03:36.810> no<00:03:37.019> Hank<00:03:37.290> Aaron's<00:03:37.590> if

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
might actually get no Hank Aaron's if

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.990 
might actually get no Hank Aaron's if
these<00:03:37.830> two<00:03:37.980> don't<00:03:38.130> give<00:03:38.310> hand<00:03:38.489> cannons<00:03:38.820> and

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
these two don't give hand cannons and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.860 
these two don't give hand cannons and
that<00:03:39.120> means<00:03:39.299> will<00:03:39.420> get<00:03:39.540> me<00:03:39.690> nothing

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
that means will get me nothing

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.530 
that means will get me nothing
yeah<00:03:42.870> that's<00:03:43.140> oh<00:03:43.410> wow<00:03:44.340> full<00:03:44.790> auto<00:03:44.940> mode<00:03:45.090> I

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
yeah that's oh wow full auto mode I

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.590 
yeah that's oh wow full auto mode I
might<00:03:46.200> give<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:46.380> one<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> try<00:03:46.769> actually<00:03:47.160> then

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
might give that one a try actually then

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.690 
might give that one a try actually then
that<00:03:48.600> sounds<00:03:48.810> really<00:03:49.019> good<00:03:49.140> although<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.830> think

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
that sounds really good although I think

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.910 
that sounds really good although I think
we<00:03:50.880> want<00:03:51.120> one<00:03:51.269> with<00:03:51.390> higher<00:03:51.570> impacts<00:03:52.140> high

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
we want one with higher impacts high

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.140 
we want one with higher impacts high
impact<00:03:53.280> pulse<00:03:53.549> rifles<00:03:53.880> are<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.000> better

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
impact pulse rifles are the better

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.940 
impact pulse rifles are the better
versions<00:03:54.570> so<00:03:55.260> I've<00:03:55.350> got<00:03:55.470> two<00:03:55.590> anchor<00:03:55.830> arms

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
versions so I've got two anchor arms

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.100 
versions so I've got two anchor arms
left<00:03:56.130> hopefully<00:03:57.120> we<00:03:57.239> get<00:03:57.330> at<00:03:57.450> least<00:03:57.540> one<00:03:57.900> hand

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
left hopefully we get at least one hand

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.460 
left hopefully we get at least one hand
cannon<00:03:58.440> that's<00:03:58.709> what<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:58.830> really<00:03:59.160> want<00:04:00.350> and<00:04:01.350> it

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
cannon that's what I really want and it

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.350 
cannon that's what I really want and it
gives<00:04:01.500> me<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.950> worst<00:04:02.280> possible<00:04:02.670> hand<00:04:02.880> cannon

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
gives me the worst possible hand cannon

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.740 
gives me the worst possible hand cannon
in<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.660> whole<00:04:03.840> game<00:04:04.760> five<00:04:05.760> magazine<00:04:06.360> look<00:04:06.600> at

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
in the whole game five magazine look at

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.140 
in the whole game five magazine look at
that<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.920> does<00:04:08.070> have<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.250> max<00:04:08.519> ammo<00:04:08.640> increase

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
that it does have a max ammo increase

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.460 
that it does have a max ammo increase
but<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.420> don't<00:04:09.570> know<00:04:09.630> how<00:04:09.720> much<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:10.019> increases

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
but I don't know how much that increases

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.070 
but I don't know how much that increases
it<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.799> I'd<00:04:11.510> still<00:04:12.510> much<00:04:12.690> rather<00:04:12.870> use<00:04:13.049> my

an<00:04:33.720> exotic<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:34.289> wasn't<00:04:34.560> expecting<00:04:34.919> that<00:04:34.950> one

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
an exotic I wasn't expecting that one

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.029 
an exotic I wasn't expecting that one
alright<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.930> deleted<00:04:37.169> my<00:04:37.410> other<00:04:37.620> last<00:04:37.860> word

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
alright so I deleted my other last word

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.610 
alright so I deleted my other last word
because<00:04:38.340> I<00:04:38.370> never<00:04:38.610> use<00:04:38.849> it<00:04:38.880> so<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:40.050> guess<00:04:40.500> this

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
because I never use it so I guess this

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.900 
because I never use it so I guess this
gives<00:04:40.860> me<00:04:40.979> reason<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:41.280> actually<00:04:41.370> try<00:04:41.669> and<00:04:41.789> use

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
gives me reason to actually try and use

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.670 
gives me reason to actually try and use
one<00:04:42.060> now<00:04:42.210> because<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.930> one<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.080> deleted<00:04:43.440> was

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
one now because the one I deleted was

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.830 
one now because the one I deleted was
the<00:04:43.860> old<00:04:44.010> version<00:04:44.539> so<00:04:45.539> yeah
