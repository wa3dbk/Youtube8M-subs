rigidity sits on and you open up the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.640 
rigidity sits on and you open up the
loop<00:01:53.320> with<00:01:53.650> it

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
loop with it

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.370 
loop with it
take<00:01:55.580> it<00:01:55.760> out<00:01:55.940> there<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:56.900> go<00:01:57.050> you've<00:01:57.230> got<00:01:57.350> a

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
nice wide loop which gives you chod rig

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.850 
nice wide loop which gives you chod rig
loads<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.490> loads<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.760> movement<00:02:02.710> so<00:02:03.710> that's

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
loads and loads of movement so that's

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.790 
loads and loads of movement so that's
the<00:02:04.040> multi-tool<00:02:04.580> really<00:02:05.570> really<00:02:05.870> handy<00:02:06.350> bit
