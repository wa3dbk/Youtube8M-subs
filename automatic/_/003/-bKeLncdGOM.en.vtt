00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello you dear welcome to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.000
 lady sides i just got it right 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.429
 hungry and we have only video anyway 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.130
 viewed and indeed she has one of them 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.380
 internet guide so sweet rolls 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.910
 and I just thought about it 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.609
 why can not I currently known 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.130
 do and we have something in no time 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.439
 I'll make it up for you soon 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.060
 show but the instructions are actually 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.910
 the same I link the video 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 below and that's just the spicy 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.019
 version of this video 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.270
 for me very well imagine three 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.390
 of those 50 per write because I 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.250
 stop hungry right then yes want to have 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.540
 we start and the recipe is 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.160
 actually you can easily 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.670
 expression for preparation and for 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.559
 gobble up, we need something like that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.239
 we are all for those spicy rolls 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.250
 just five slices of toast five 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.699
 slices turkey breast many I have 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 just just brought by aldi and then 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.170
 five slices of smoked cheese so first 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.489
 We must move from the brink of death 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.360
 liberate the cut I now here 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.360
 very fine 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.500
 next we have to do this one 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:46.810
 clean up a bit or place 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:49.780
 make so wendy make the bread 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.880
 is done now follows only the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.100
 Occupancy now I have a slice 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.470
 turkey breast and a slice of melted cheese 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:02.259
 and then I roll it all over 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.200
 just look at it that way 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.520
 the whole thing out 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.180
 and that works really well 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.180
 I must say 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.140
 this is what the finished tubes look like when 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.390
 You have done this now 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.160
 Consulting this bread rolls 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.330
 I just thought why 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.240
 I do not just lose them 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.710
 little bit before I fry and 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:50.100
 So here are two eggs 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:54.070
 on and dark then saute 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.200
 Just put these little tubes in this one 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.570
 eggs nailed I think then will 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.700
 better fried and tastes that easy 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.830
 even better that's really 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.320
 Optionally you do not have to do that 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.540
 I just caught myself again 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.950
 think no bad then in mainz 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.950
 is me soon 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.340
 actually already did that 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.950
 Ruckzuck and my bread rolls are 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.930
 finished look almost like snack big 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.450
 I wish you much fun 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.630
 my taste is to be relieved 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.400
 I hope the video has you 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.720
