00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
the power system of this Scion let's say

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.560 
the power system of this Scion let's say
if<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.850> put<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> radio<00:00:24.630> or<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:25.350> ship<00:00:26.300> to<00:00:27.300> drive

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
if we put on a radio or we ship to drive

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.259 
if we put on a radio or we ship to drive
we<00:00:27.930> even<00:00:28.080> put<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.410> our<00:00:28.590> stop<00:00:28.980> lights<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:30.029> car

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
we even put on our stop lights this car

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.089 
we even put on our stop lights this car
would<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.449> die<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.439> Hugh<00:00:31.830> blower

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.060 

flashlight<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:49.420> right<00:01:49.600> once<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:50.710> would<00:01:50.770> give

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
flashlight all right once I would give

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.100 
flashlight all right once I would give
it<00:01:51.220> load<00:01:51.490> or<00:01:52.030> even<00:01:52.300> start<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.690> car<00:01:52.900> it<00:01:53.020> would

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
it load or even start the car it would

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.770 
it load or even start the car it would
work<00:01:53.350> without<00:01:53.650> any<00:01:54.160> load<00:01:54.760> on<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.090> car<00:01:55.300> it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
work without any load on the car it

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.400 
work without any load on the car it
would<00:01:55.900> work<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:58.360> would<00:01:58.570> touch<00:01:58.810> this<00:01:59.050> bolt

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
would work and I would touch this bolt

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.050 
would work and I would touch this bolt
it<00:01:59.980> will<00:02:00.190> be<00:02:00.370> really<00:02:00.850> hot<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:01.390> just<00:02:02.020> burn<00:02:02.260> me

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it will be really hot it just burn me

it will be really hot it just burn me
the<00:02:04.060> problem<00:02:04.510> was<00:02:04.660> with<00:02:04.840> this<00:02:05.020> car<00:02:05.230> is<00:02:05.440> a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
the problem was with this car is a

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.920 
the problem was with this car is a
rusted<00:02:05.980> bolt<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.400> just<00:02:06.550> got<00:02:06.730> rusted<00:02:07.180> corroded

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
rusted bolt it just got rusted corroded

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.710 
rusted bolt it just got rusted corroded
and<00:02:08.490> that<00:02:09.490> caused<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.970> problem<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.330> just<00:02:10.540> took

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
and that caused the problem I just took

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.780 
and that caused the problem I just took
it<00:02:10.869> off<00:02:10.990> with<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.230> new<00:02:11.380> bolt<00:02:11.650> on<00:02:11.890> clean<00:02:12.670> out<00:02:12.850> the
