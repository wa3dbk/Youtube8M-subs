00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:34.290 

I<00:03:12.900> bet<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:24.270> good<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:32.370> it's<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.430> plaid<00:03:33.640> shirt<00:03:33.670> look

like<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.570> did<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:36.030> now<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.150> next<00:03:37.270> guy<00:03:37.570> doing<00:03:38.140> is

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
like I did it now the next guy doing is

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.080 
like I did it now the next guy doing is
low<00:03:38.530> E<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.890> I'd<00:03:38.980> probably<00:03:39.250> have<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.520> say<00:03:39.790> that

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
low E and I'd probably have to say that

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.690 
low E and I'd probably have to say that
Louise<00:03:40.480> is<00:03:40.510> probably<00:03:41.020> like<00:03:41.410> but<00:03:41.890> easiest<00:03:42.550> to

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
Louise is probably like but easiest to

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:54.740 
Louise is probably like but easiest to
do<00:03:42.820> because<00:03:43.150> Justin<00:03:43.660> stripes

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.280 

okay<00:03:55.750> next<00:03:56.290> nail<00:03:56.680> is<00:03:57.069> on<00:03:57.459> say<00:03:58.420> now<00:03:58.629> the<00:03:58.900> next

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
okay next nail is on say now the next

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.670 
okay next nail is on say now the next
step<00:03:59.530> is<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:01.209> put<00:04:01.709> red<00:04:02.709> suspenders<00:04:03.219> on<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:05.560> I'm

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
step is to put red suspenders on so I'm

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:17.040 
step is to put red suspenders on so I'm
just<00:04:05.859> taking<00:04:06.280> some<00:04:06.730> red<00:04:08.370> and

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.050 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:25.540 

go<00:04:18.050> up<00:04:19.300> almond<00:04:20.300> a<00:04:20.330> pulse<00:04:20.630> is<00:04:20.840> sooo<00:04:21.110> so<00:04:21.500> thin<00:04:24.550> in

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
go up almond a pulse is sooo so thin in

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:33.400 
go up almond a pulse is sooo so thin in
scopus<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:31.130> let's<00:04:31.310> go<00:04:31.810> ok<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:32.870> I<00:04:33.050> trained<00:04:33.320> up

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
scopus so let's go ok so I trained up

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.860 
scopus so let's go ok so I trained up
the<00:04:33.560> angle<00:04:33.980> bit<00:04:34.250> because<00:04:34.490> it's<00:04:34.760> easier<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.720> do

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
the angle bit because it's easier to do

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.490 
the angle bit because it's easier to do
this<00:04:36.380> nail<00:04:36.680> what's<00:04:36.980> this<00:04:37.160> angle<00:04:37.910> so<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:39.110> next

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
this nail what's this angle so the next

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.160 
this nail what's this angle so the next
the<00:04:40.490> last<00:04:40.730> night<00:04:40.970> i'm<00:04:41.060> going<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.300> do<00:04:41.390> is<00:04:41.420> a<00:04:41.810> nail

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
the last night i'm going to do is a nail

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.190 
the last night i'm going to do is a nail
and<00:04:42.470> the<00:04:43.370> reason<00:04:43.700> why<00:04:43.820> I<00:04:43.850> detains<00:04:44.420> on<00:04:44.660> my<00:04:44.840> thumb

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
and the reason why I detains on my thumb

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.620 
and the reason why I detains on my thumb
is<00:04:45.500> because<00:04:45.920> he's<00:04:46.700> a<00:04:46.850> little<00:04:47.030> bigger<00:04:47.300> than<00:04:47.480> all

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
is because he's a little bigger than all

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.270 
is because he's a little bigger than all
the<00:04:47.690> rest<00:04:47.840> it's<00:04:48.140> like<00:04:48.170> you<00:04:48.440> can<00:04:48.590> do<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.950> will<00:04:49.040> do

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
the rest it's like you can do I will do

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.160 
the rest it's like you can do I will do
