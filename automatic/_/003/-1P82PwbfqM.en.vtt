just<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.170> bunch<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.530> eggs<00:02:37.890> laying<00:02:38.340> on<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.550> Lonnie

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
just a bunch of eggs laying on a Lonnie

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.510 
just a bunch of eggs laying on a Lonnie
just<00:02:39.720> like<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> lawn<00:02:40.350> yeah<00:02:40.950> that's<00:02:41.250> not

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
just like a lawn yeah that's not

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.280 
just like a lawn yeah that's not
exciting<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.150> me<00:02:42.240> that<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.450> doesn't<00:02:42.960> do<00:02:43.170> it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
exciting to me that that doesn't do it

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.470 
exciting to me that that doesn't do it
for<00:02:43.320> me<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.460> opposite<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:45.000> moist<00:02:45.240> when

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
for me just the opposite of moist when

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.380 
for me just the opposite of moist when
that<00:02:45.630> happens<00:02:45.990> so<00:02:46.560> when<00:02:47.460> I<00:02:47.490> think<00:02:47.820> about<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.210> I

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
that happens so when I think about it I

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.600 
that happens so when I think about it I
think<00:02:49.320> they<00:02:49.740> need<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.070> like<00:02:50.220> Easter<00:02:50.520> egg

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
think they need to have like Easter egg

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.920 
think they need to have like Easter egg
hunts<00:02:50.850> for<00:02:50.880> adults<00:02:51.210> but<00:02:51.390> they<00:02:51.570> need<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.810> make

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
hunts for adults but they need to make

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.110 
hunts for adults but they need to make
it<00:02:52.050> like<00:02:52.170> Sherlock<00:02:52.560> Holmes<00:02:52.800> style<00:02:53.220> like<00:02:53.520> you

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
it like Sherlock Holmes style like you

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.520 
it like Sherlock Holmes style like you
got<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.420> find<00:02:54.660> these<00:02:54.810> eggs<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.290> then<00:02:55.350> they're

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
got to find these eggs and then they're

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.990 
got to find these eggs and then they're
clues<00:02:55.740> inside<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.250> eggs<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.670> then<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.850> need

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
clues inside the eggs and then you need

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.030 
clues inside the eggs and then you need
minecraft<00:02:57.450> tools<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.870> dig<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.350> uncover<00:02:58.860> the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
minecraft tools to dig and uncover the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.860 
minecraft tools to dig and uncover the
chest<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.550> then<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.270> chest<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.690> going<00:03:00.810> to

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
chest and then that chest is going to

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.140 
chest and then that chest is going to
have<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.080> secret<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.850> so-and-so's<00:03:02.850> treasure

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.250 
have the secret to so-and-so's treasure
or<00:03:03.330> something<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.690> think<00:03:03.750> there<00:03:03.990> needs<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.230> be

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
or something I think there needs to be

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.780 
or something I think there needs to be
like<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.470> legitimate<00:03:05.010> thing<00:03:05.190> but<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.430> think<00:03:05.490> we

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
like a legitimate thing but I think we

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.120 
like a legitimate thing but I think we
need<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.030> have<00:03:06.210> a<00:03:06.240> dolt<00:03:06.770> Easter<00:03:07.770> egg<00:03:07.860> hunts

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
need to have a dolt Easter egg hunts

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.040 
need to have a dolt Easter egg hunts
there<00:03:08.370> needs<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.760> be<00:03:08.790> something<00:03:09.180> about<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.870> and

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
there needs to be something about it and
