hey Brian it's Alex over Murdoch gun day
I<00:00:02.490> just<00:00:02.820> can't<00:00:02.939> record<00:00:03.179> for<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.449> real<00:00:03.659> quickly

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
I just can't record for you real quickly

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.889 
I just can't record for you real quickly
the<00:00:04.440> vehicle<00:00:04.920> that<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.190> were<00:00:05.310> interested<00:00:05.580> in

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899 
the vehicle that you were interested in

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.070 
the vehicle that you were interested in
this<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.109> our<00:00:07.290> 2011<00:00:08.069> Sonata<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:09.900> would

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
this is our 2011 Sonata and this would

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.560 
this is our 2011 Sonata and this would
be<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> red<00:00:10.530> one<00:00:10.740> with<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.010> package<00:00:11.280> -<00:00:11.880> now

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
be a red one with that package - now

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.720 
be a red one with that package - now
which<00:00:12.780> means<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.259> got<00:00:13.559> like<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.340> alloy

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
which means it's got like the alloy

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.980 
which means it's got like the alloy
wheels<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> power<00:00:15.420> seat<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> couple

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
wheels and the power seat and a couple

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.599 
wheels and the power seat and a couple
other<00:00:16.199> things<00:00:16.410> I'll<00:00:16.529> show<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.770> inside<00:00:17.070> but

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
other things I'll show you inside but

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.099 
other things I'll show you inside but
the<00:00:17.730> algorithms<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.210> think<00:00:18.420> give<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.810> really

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
the algorithms I think give it a really

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.710 
the algorithms I think give it a really
really<00:00:19.320> nice<00:00:19.470> touch<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.400> versus<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> hubcaps

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
really nice touch and versus the hubcaps

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.980 
really nice touch and versus the hubcaps
just<00:00:22.020> makes<00:00:22.230> them<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.619> think<00:00:22.920> look<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.340> lot<00:00:23.550> nicer

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
just makes them I think look a lot nicer

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.179 
just makes them I think look a lot nicer
but<00:00:24.990> I'm<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:25.230> gonna<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> walk<00:00:25.740> around<00:00:26.039> or

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
but I'm just gonna do a walk around or

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.529 
but I'm just gonna do a walk around or
on<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> outside<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.939> car<00:00:27.150> again<00:00:27.300> we

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
on the outside of the car again we

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.330 
on the outside of the car again we
