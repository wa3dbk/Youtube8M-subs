then<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.180> grab<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> knife<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.590> level<00:01:56.159> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
then just grab a knife and just level it

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.370 
then just grab a knife and just level it
off<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.700> like<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.450> then<00:01:57.899> take<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
off just like that and then take the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.280 
off just like that and then take the
flour<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.130> pour<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.579> directly<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
flour and just pour it directly in to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.410 
flour and just pour it directly in to
the<00:02:01.530> batter<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.100> now<00:02:02.759> we're<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:02.939> gonna<00:02:03.149> give

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the batter and now we're just gonna give

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.940 
the batter and now we're just gonna give
this<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.659> little<00:02:03.899> buzz<00:02:04.200> around<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:04.860> maybe

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
this a little buzz around for maybe

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.219 
this a little buzz around for maybe
fifteen<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.909> thirty<00:02:05.939> seconds<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.079> make

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
fifteen to thirty seconds just to make

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.749 
fifteen to thirty seconds just to make
sure<00:02:07.259> everything<00:02:07.890> gets<00:02:07.979> really<00:02:08.250> thoroughly

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
sure everything gets really thoroughly

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.290 
sure everything gets really thoroughly
combined<00:02:09.410> now<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.920> last<00:02:11.190> thing<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.670> go<00:02:11.819> into

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
combined now the last thing to go into

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.810 
combined now the last thing to go into
the

my lid back on buzz that around and get
it<00:02:27.670> mixed<00:02:27.940> through<00:02:28.470> now<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.500> it's<00:02:29.830> all<00:02:30.070> mixed

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100

I<00:02:30.790> like<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.300> transfer<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.110> mixture<00:02:32.440> into<00:02:32.560> a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
I like to transfer the mixture into a

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.550 
I like to transfer the mixture into a
bowl<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.790> then<00:02:34.480> cover<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:35.050> with<00:02:35.290> some

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
bowl and then cover that with some

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.780 
bowl and then cover that with some
plastic<00:02:35.890> wrap<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:37.800> then<00:02:38.800> you're<00:02:39.370> gonna<00:02:39.490> let

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
plastic wrap and then you're gonna let

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.780 
plastic wrap and then you're gonna let
this<00:02:40.060> rest<00:02:40.540> we<00:02:41.200> riled<00:02:41.709> things<00:02:41.950> up<00:02:42.220> during<00:02:42.580> the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
this rest we riled things up during the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.880 
this rest we riled things up during the
blending<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.959> gluten<00:02:44.410> has<00:02:44.680> been

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
blending and the gluten has been

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.860 
blending and the gluten has been
activated<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:45.910> needs<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.330> chance<00:02:46.570> to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
activated and that needs a chance to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.360 
activated and that needs a chance to
settle<00:02:47.140> down<00:02:47.410> because<00:02:47.830> we've<00:02:47.980> got<00:02:48.130> really

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
settle down because we've got really

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.060 
settle down because we've got really
tender<00:02:49.000> crepes<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:50.380> also<00:02:50.590> want<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:50.920> to

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
tender crepes and you also want it to

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.770 
tender crepes and you also want it to
rest<00:02:51.280> because<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:51.700> want<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.000> flour<00:02:52.300> to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
rest because you want the flour to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.110 
rest because you want the flour to
absorb<00:02:53.230> as<00:02:53.440> much<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.340> liquid<00:02:55.000> as

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
absorb as much of that liquid as

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.560 
absorb as much of that liquid as
possible<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.560> needs<00:02:56.800> about<00:02:57.100> an<00:02:57.640> hour<00:02:57.910> now

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
possible so it needs about an hour now

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.330 
possible so it needs about an hour now
you<00:02:58.630> can<00:02:58.900> leave<00:02:59.080> this<00:02:59.290> on<00:02:59.470> your<00:02:59.680> counter<00:03:00.130> for

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
you can leave this on your counter for

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.010 
you can leave this on your counter for
an<00:03:00.430> hour<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:00.970> it'll<00:03:01.180> be<00:03:01.300> good<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.540> go

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
an hour and it'll be good to go

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.690 
an hour and it'll be good to go
but<00:03:02.290> if<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.470> need<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.650> wait<00:03:02.950> longer<00:03:03.250> than<00:03:03.580> that

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
but if you need to wait longer than that

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.610

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
moving until the batter stops moving and

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.400 
moving until the batter stops moving and
when<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.250> happens<00:04:09.790> put<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:10.420> pan<00:04:10.660> back<00:04:10.690> on

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
just like that you'll see it looks like

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.370 
just like that you'll see it looks like

would be the outside of the crepe the

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.690 
would be the outside of the crepe the
underside<00:04:47.110> that'll<00:04:47.650> be<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.920> inside<00:04:48.430> of<00:04:48.610> the

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
10 to 20 seconds just so that batter

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.920 
10 to 20 seconds just so that batter
sets<00:04:54.520> you<00:04:54.760> don't<00:04:54.910> want<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.090> overcook<00:04:55.450> it<00:04:55.780> or<00:04:55.900> a

little become rubbery now it's important

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.330 
little become rubbery now it's important
that<00:04:58.390> your<00:04:58.630> pan<00:04:58.870> isn't<00:04:59.140> too<00:04:59.530> hot<00:04:59.740> because<00:05:00.010> when

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
that your pan isn't too hot because when

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.280 
that your pan isn't too hot because when
you<00:05:00.430> pour<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:00.700> batter<00:05:00.940> on<00:05:01.270> there<00:05:01.540> it'll<00:05:02.020> start

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
you pour the batter on there it'll start

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.590 
you pour the batter on there it'll start
to<00:05:02.410> sizzle<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:03.100> cook<00:05:03.520> before<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:04.330> gets<00:05:04.510> a

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
to sizzle and cook before it gets a

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.960 
to sizzle and cook before it gets a
chance<00:05:04.630> to<00:05:05.080> spread<00:05:05.320> out<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:05.950> if<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.730> pan<00:05:06.940> is

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
chance to spread out and if the pan is

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.210 
chance to spread out and if the pan is
too<00:05:07.300> cool<00:05:07.570> it'll<00:05:08.350> take<00:05:08.560> longer<00:05:08.800> for<00:05:09.130> the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
too cool it'll take longer for the

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.770 
too cool it'll take longer for the
crepes<00:05:09.460> to<00:05:09.700> cook<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.120> then<00:05:10.300> they'll<00:05:10.450> come<00:05:10.630> out

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
crepes to cook and then they'll come out

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.810 
crepes to cook and then they'll come out
tough<00:05:11.110> so<00:05:11.380> it's<00:05:11.410> kind<00:05:11.800> of<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:11.950> delicate<00:05:12.130> balance

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
tough so it's kind of a delicate balance

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.970 
tough so it's kind of a delicate balance
the<00:05:12.970> first<00:05:13.150> couple<00:05:13.660> usually<00:05:14.080> come<00:05:14.500> out<00:05:14.710> kind

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
the first couple usually come out kind

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.920 
the first couple usually come out kind
of<00:05:15.100> like<00:05:15.280> duds<00:05:15.820> and<00:05:16.150> you<00:05:16.450> have<00:05:16.630> to<00:05:16.750> either

of like duds and you have to either
trash<00:05:17.290> them<00:05:17.590> or<00:05:17.800> give<00:05:18.280> them<00:05:18.460> to<00:05:18.610> the<00:05:18.730> dog<00:05:18.910> and
