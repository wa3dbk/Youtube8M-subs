right here so they're not very

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.819 
right here so they're not very
noticeable<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.930> said<00:02:04.140> after<00:02:04.530> six

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
noticeable and like I said after six

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.889 
noticeable and like I said after six
hours<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.520> feel<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.119> foundation<00:02:06.780> has

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
hours I feel like this foundation has

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.320 
hours I feel like this foundation has
really<00:02:07.200> stayed<00:02:07.409> true<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:08.039> itself<00:02:08.759> into<00:02:09.179> what

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
really stayed true to itself into what

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.420 
really stayed true to itself into what
it<00:02:09.450> claims<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:10.080> claims<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> 24<00:02:11.220> hour

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
it claims it claims that it's a 24 hour

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.790 
it claims it claims that it's a 24 hour
foundation<00:02:12.410> I'm<00:02:13.410> not<00:02:13.590> going

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
foundation I'm not going

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.610 
foundation I'm not going
keep<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.070> on<00:02:14.160> for<00:02:14.310> 24<00:02:14.670> hours<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.240> I'd<00:02:16.200> kind<00:02:16.560> of

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
keep it on for 24 hours and I'd kind of

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.680 
keep it on for 24 hours and I'd kind of
be<00:02:16.680> scared<00:02:17.130> if<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.460> did<00:02:17.670> last<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.270> 24<00:02:18.630> hours

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
be scared if it did last for 24 hours

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.750 
be scared if it did last for 24 hours
just<00:02:19.170> because<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:20.100> what<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.640> doing

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
just because it's like what is it doing

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.250 
just because it's like what is it doing
to<00:02:20.940> your<00:02:21.030> face<00:02:21.210> if<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:21.600> staying<00:02:21.840> on<00:02:22.050> that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
to your face if it's staying on that

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.560 
to your face if it's staying on that
long<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:25.400> guess<00:02:26.400> if<00:02:26.550> you're<00:02:26.730> someone<00:02:27.510> that

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
long but I guess if you're someone that

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.100 
long but I guess if you're someone that
needs<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.960> be<00:02:28.050> out<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.320> 24<00:02:28.650> hours<00:02:28.680> then<00:02:29.870> go<00:02:30.870> for

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
needs to be out for 24 hours then go for

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.480 
needs to be out for 24 hours then go for
it<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.320> see<00:02:31.560> if<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.740> works<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.160> let<00:02:32.370> me<00:02:32.460> know

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
it and see if it works and let me know

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.720 
it and see if it works and let me know
but<00:02:33.170> all<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.410> all<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:34.860> said<00:02:35.070> one<00:02:35.310> out<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.520> 10

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
but all in all like I said one out of 10

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.460 
but all in all like I said one out of 10
it's<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.120> 10<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.750> were<00:02:36.840> skeptical<00:02:37.350> about

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
it's a 10 if you were skeptical about

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.340 
it's a 10 if you were skeptical about
trying<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.370> would<00:02:39.120> definitely<00:02:39.480> say<00:02:39.780> go<00:02:40.200> out

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
trying it I would definitely say go out

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.820 
trying it I would definitely say go out
and<00:02:40.530> get<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.860> if<00:02:41.040> you're<00:02:41.340> interested<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.330> a

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
and get it if you're interested in a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.590 
and get it if you're interested in a
foundation<00:02:43.830> that's<00:02:43.860> kind<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.940> thicker

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
foundation that's kind of a thicker

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.750 
foundation that's kind of a thicker
consistency<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.710> does<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.280> some<00:02:47.580> pretty

good coverage I always use a concealer

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.430 
good coverage I always use a concealer

covers all of that and it kept it

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.390 
covers all of that and it kept it
covered<00:03:04.020> so<00:03:04.710> I<00:03:04.740> feel<00:03:04.980> like<00:03:05.010> it's<00:03:05.250> really

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400
