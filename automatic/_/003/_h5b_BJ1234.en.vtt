00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
with the new system let's start with the

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.090 
with the new system let's start with the
dive<00:00:44.109> light<00:00:44.379> amount<00:00:46.079> ok<00:00:47.079> so<00:00:47.139> this<00:00:47.440> BCD<00:00:47.889> mount

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
dive light amount ok so this BCD mount

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.129 
dive light amount ok so this BCD mount
has<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:49.719> BCD<00:00:50.170> plate<00:00:50.760> which<00:00:51.760> has<00:00:51.999> a<00:00:52.690> strap

has a the BCD plate which has a strap

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.369 
has a the BCD plate which has a strap
and<00:00:53.499> this<00:00:54.069> plate<00:00:54.339> is<00:00:54.659> both<00:00:55.659> plates<00:00:55.989> actually

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
and this plate is both plates actually

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.559 
and this plate is both plates actually
this<00:00:56.589> year<00:00:56.859> are<00:00:57.429> the<00:00:57.609> same<00:00:57.879> there<00:00:58.299> are<00:00:58.359> a<00:00:58.389> lot

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:58.569 
this year are the same there are a lot

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:00.899 
this year are the same there are a lot
beefier<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:59.049> lot<00:00:59.229> thicker<00:00:59.469> so<00:00:59.859> we<00:01:00.579> did<00:01:00.729> make

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
beefier a lot thicker so we did make

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.430 
beefier a lot thicker so we did make
some<00:01:01.059> improvements<00:01:01.539> on<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.719> camera<00:01:02.079> map<00:01:02.229> as

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
some improvements on the camera map as

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.340 
some improvements on the camera map as
well<00:01:02.679> but<00:01:03.579> this<00:01:03.639> you'll<00:01:04.600> note<00:01:04.809> that<00:01:04.839> it's<00:01:05.170> got

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
well but this you'll note that it's got

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.090 
well but this you'll note that it's got
a<00:01:05.880> thick<00:01:06.990> lock<00:01:07.990> lined<00:01:08.290> on<00:01:08.470> there<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.799> Sun

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
a thick lock lined on there the Sun

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.550 
a thick lock lined on there the Sun
half-inch<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.570> inside<00:01:10.930> diameter<00:01:11.140> of<00:01:11.440> the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
half-inch the inside diameter of the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.340 
half-inch the inside diameter of the
lock<00:01:11.800> lines<00:01:12.040> haven't<00:01:12.720> connected<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:14.140> our

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
lock lines haven't connected to our

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.910 
lock lines haven't connected to our
plate<00:01:14.980> system<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:15.730> also<00:01:16.690> it<00:01:16.990> has<00:01:17.170> clamps

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
plate system and also it has clamps

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.780 
plate system and also it has clamps
these<00:01:18.220> clamps<00:01:18.610> are<00:01:20.490> adjustable<00:01:21.490> so<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:21.670> can

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
these clamps are adjustable so you can

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.640 
these clamps are adjustable so you can
actually<00:01:22.090> loosen<00:01:22.600> them<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:22.990> that<00:01:23.110> gives<00:01:23.470> you

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
actually loosen them and that gives you

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.680 
actually loosen them and that gives you
the<00:01:23.910> flexibility<00:01:24.910> to<00:01:25.000> have<00:01:25.450> movement<00:01:26.080> on<00:01:26.470> them

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
the flexibility to have movement on them

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.990 
the flexibility to have movement on them
so<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.840> good<00:01:28.960> thing<00:01:29.110> about<00:01:29.200> this<00:01:29.500> this<00:01:30.310> dive

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
so the good thing about this this dive

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.460 
so the good thing about this this dive
light<00:01:31.270> mount<00:01:31.510> is<00:01:31.660> now<00:01:31.870> you're<00:01:32.050> able<00:01:32.350> to

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
light mount is now you're able to

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.640 
light mount is now you're able to
actually<00:01:32.620> have<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:33.460> hands-free<00:01:34.110> mount<00:01:35.110> for

to<00:03:50.140> take<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.380> elbow<00:03:50.620> so<00:03:50.769> you<00:03:50.829> can<00:03:50.980> have<00:03:51.160> the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
to take the elbow so you can have the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.520 
to take the elbow so you can have the
mount<00:03:52.030> tightening<00:03:52.600> next<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.049> body<00:03:53.230> and

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
the elbows in this position so that it's

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.319 
the elbows in this position so that it's
kind<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.410> way<00:03:56.590> from<00:03:56.650> your<00:03:57.040> face<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:57.579> that's

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
kind of a way from your face so that's

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.880 
kind of a way from your face so that's
why<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.540> elbows<00:03:58.870> here<00:03:59.140> so<00:03:59.350> you<00:03:59.410> wouldn't<00:03:59.650> need

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
why the elbows here so you wouldn't need

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.800 
why the elbows here so you wouldn't need
that<00:03:59.950> down<00:04:00.310> here<00:04:00.700> we<00:04:01.209> would<00:04:01.329> actually<00:04:01.600> get<00:04:01.690> in

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
that down here we would actually get in

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.660 
that down here we would actually get in
the<00:04:01.900> way<00:04:01.989> so<00:04:02.049> you<00:04:02.260> remove<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.860> elbow<00:04:03.250> but<00:04:03.489> now

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
the way so you remove the elbow but now

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.539 
the way so you remove the elbow but now
you<00:04:03.730> have<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:05.530> lights<00:04:05.769> in<00:04:05.920> this<00:04:06.070> position

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
you have the the lights in this position

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.270 
you have the the lights in this position
so<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:06.730> can<00:04:06.910> grab<00:04:07.120> those<00:04:07.360> and<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.890> know<00:04:09.040> ate

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
so you can grab those and you know ate

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.259 
so you can grab those and you know ate
them<00:04:09.430> upwards<00:04:09.850> when<00:04:09.940> you're<00:04:10.090> swimming

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
forward and then you're you're you can

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.800 
forward and then you're you're you can
point<00:04:12.489> them<00:04:12.669> in<00:04:12.790> words<00:04:13.090> or<00:04:13.269> out

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
point them in words or out

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.570 
point them in words or out
you<00:04:13.870> can<00:04:13.959> illuminate<00:04:14.260> different<00:04:14.920> areas<00:04:15.250> so

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
you can illuminate different areas so
