00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.670
 now 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.269
 I'm going to travel today I'll do the unboxing of 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.349
 phone from china 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.900
 wine from 215 ordering by focal price 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.920
 I did it but I had problems because I did not 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.779
 it was in stock 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.170
 so I had to do it by means of 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.680
 aerocasillas fortunately came to me in 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.730
 a very short time of 9 more days or 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.380
 less packaged 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:42.670
 it comes very protected in quite 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.670
 careful by the way 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.370
 wine from 200 come in a very box 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.260
 presentable the truth I like a lot 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.850
 as it comes in the box compared to 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.850
 Other models that are branded 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.990
 and here is deploy we see for 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.210
 start the terminal 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.460
 we put it here for later I'm going to 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.270
 write what you have in the part 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.270
 Exterior 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.979
 ok as we can see brings this foam 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.549
 protective that the truth takes care of 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.490
 of blows and all that kind of abuse 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.220
 during the trip because if we can 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.830
 observe that he does not have a good deal 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.250
 throughout this long journey as 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.250
 can see 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:48.600
 ok we continue with the unpacking 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.600
 this carton 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.710
 contains this protective sheet 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.710
 does so much 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.250
 a leather case is not like many say 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.320
 than in other devices that bring 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.970
 coming from china this kind of 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.380
 protectors not this is the truth you see 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.130

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.980
 suede and on the outside a semi 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.200
 picture so to speak so if it looks very 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.360
 well I do not know my matte leather and we make it 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.990
 internal looks very good and something that is 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.170
 thanks these manufacturers because today 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.080
 day practically in the very terminal with 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.110
 a cable and headphones at a price 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.270
 exorbitant then this yes the truth 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.970
 thank you 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.970
 we see the basic guide 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.530
 we follow 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.440
 it looks very good 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.910
 this 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.910
 of your charger 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.120
 of European tips and in the part of 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.090
 china imagine they use it here to my 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.609
 seller because as I say I bought it 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.090

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.390
 adapt in the part from here 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:28.050

 very well presented this is appreciated 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.980
 a cable I think it should be in size 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.080
 normal I tell them 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.390

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.960
 big 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.440
 seeing it quality-price quality 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.630
 seeing the ranges like this or whatever 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.250
 what brings is very good 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.960

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.870
 drums 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.909
 of 2200 milliamps 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.659
 that they say and I have investigated in 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.680
 different forums has a very long duration 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.590
 good 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.989
 these are the headphones pretty 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.680
 regular come well protected with in 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.430
 this little bag ok 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.740
 this would be all unpacked let's go 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.940
 to see where the device is because 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.940
 this is the device 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.629
 we take it out of these bags ok I'm going to 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.770
 show them the device everything that is 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:47.879
 the outside because soon 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.880
 the review of how it works in the system 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:53.000
 and all that 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:58.190
 we see that it has a 4.7 ips screen 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.160
 at 854 x 480 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.000
 I think I do not know if this is a plate 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.580
 protective or is he or is he doing so much 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.460
 that he usually puts on protection 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.289
 only for the moment ok that moss in 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.589
 The front part 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:19.669
 your sensors the approach sensor 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:22.520
 5 megapixel front camera all three 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.199
 digital laser buttons in the part in 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.330
 the laterals 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:30.800
 we see the volume up and down 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:34.590
 the physical buttons the power on the 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:38.840
 input to the audio jack 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.840
 in the part of here is the microphone 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.440
 the usb input and on the back 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:48.100
 the logo of the brand 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.990
 and also in the plant of the camera 8 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.660
 megapixels that so far not the 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.900
 I have tried very well but 7 8 megapixels 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.540
 it must be pretty good it 's a unique 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.870
 led 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.270
 that must be very useful too 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.450
 ok what can i say about the 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.870
 device the truth I am as a customer 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.000

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.460
 for the presentation and quality of 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.200
 product 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:17.050
 it's not all that light 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.670
 it weighs a little and I like it well too 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.000
 I like that devices weigh 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:24.160
 the size I love 4.7 inches already 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.810
 a little bigger not because of the problem of 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.040
 that are portable all that but be 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.730

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.350
 because they go they go very very well this one has 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.780
 a website 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.340

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.150
 can see in English in Spanish option no 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:54.670

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.990
 that tries hard because this is that 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:01.530
 everything comes very well protected 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.030
 the cable that was lengthened as I go to 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.920
