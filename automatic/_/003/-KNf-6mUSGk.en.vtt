00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 we find a team that probably 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.809
 has one of the best attacks of the whole 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.780
 of the whole series in terms of men 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.700
 have five players among others 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.500
 five players one better than the act 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.910
 year they are spoiled for choice in 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.460
 that position 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.060
 so it's a team in the department 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.960
 offensive has the best qualities 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.619
 so it will be an extremely game 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.840
 difficult just because of for 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.829
 quality they have for the type of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.640
 team that we are therefore definitely 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.760
 however, we will have problems 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.789
 we have qualities in my opinion 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.680
 they can create problems for him 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:52.500
 so it's an interesting game 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.920
 I must say then we go to 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.930
 play with it and we'll play it with 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.899
 courage and then we'll see what 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.489
 happens mommy looks at the attitude 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.700
 the team has always been a good one 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.680
 attitude part with Verona where 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.570
 probably like I said e 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.939
 repeated we took a step back 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.979
 in terms of the game in terms of 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.009
 difficulty playing with verona in 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.659
 those with that verona after that after 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.580
 seven minutes or nine minutes 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.799
 take goals is an extremely thing 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 difficult he had big problems 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.090
 problems the rome that surely to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.229
 Quality has more about us 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.409
 yes we say that I do not expect any 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.960
 gift 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.579
 it is such a moment but in short it is useless 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.469
 bandaging your head you have to understand that 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.990
 this is the moment he had not not 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:50.719
 we have no we will have no help though 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:54.219
 not by ourselves so head high well 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:58.000
 yes yes we have is a department where we have 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:02:01.340
 some problems though 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.849
 let's say players who have that yes 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.549
 they can adopt in midfield or even 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:09.799
 the opportunity to change the number of 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.459
 in short, midfielders then 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:17.500
 there are solutions we have tried 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.500
 so we are prepared for this in short
