00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 there is no secret to 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.650
 blooming rosebushes 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.650
 know how to recut them 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.320
 so the first flowering period 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.059
 is now over on the rose bushes 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.750
 but on the other hand sometimes it stays 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.400
 some roses 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.650
 then of course we will keep them 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.390
 although we could almost remove them 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.689
 if you are absent for fifteen 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.720
 days 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.779
 for now we will remove 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.270
 all its branches so the branches 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.149
 with future cynorrhodon the famous 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.010
 seeds to rozier if we leave them there 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.870
 could even be sown in the in 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.360
 the garden and then the summer we go in 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.800
 enjoy also in relation to this 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.180
 period since we can see if the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.400
 branches are still in full 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.829
 hesitations and if we have a little bit of 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.230
 dead wood we will enjoy this time 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.130
 there for the state is there and we do not hesitate 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.590
 you go on vacation 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.430
 Well we are going to make beautiful bouquets 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.380
 of roses since in resizing it is 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.700
 pink it's going to allow us by three 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.680
 weeks have future roses 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.939
 now we are going to carve the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.799
 varieties with large flowers 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.479
 be careful not to be confused at 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.100
 climbing roses with a rosebush 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.469
 climbing to rosir a post to rosicky 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.929
 climbs to rosy amount it's a rosebush 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.399
 which gives several bloom in the 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.560
 same year it's true for all 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.530
 rising plants and here we see it 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.810
 well since we have different pushes 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.850
 see the old rose that bloomed 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.359
 few weeks ago so the goal is 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.280
 to cut his old rose to see 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.020
 reappear the new shoots 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.289
 wife who will give us flowers 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.179
 within 15 days or even three weeks to 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.609
 art by cutting the buttons is ok 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.810
 also allow roses to favor 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.270
 new shoots are young 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.889
 shoots that are at the base and that are going 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.639
 emerge so this one we will not know 

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:48.829
 before a month 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:53.029
 and there we see clearly we see of course 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.859
 rose bush the old flowers the flower of our 

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:56.509
 superstar because he's a super star 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.899
 and the buttons that emerge 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.659
 that's the real up and coming varieties 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.569
 we cut here just at the level of the 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.950
 new rare flower also enjoy the 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.929
 summer size to cast off our 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.770
 roses if they are a little bit so 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.770
 here we have a big branch 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.810
 we go the cut is a little bit more 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.150
 severely and in principle within a month 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.400
 we will start to see future button 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.420
 a month and a half of blooming that we 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.220
 will make an autumn bloom 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.870
 concerning rose bushes roses 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.520
 landscape like wicker decorations here he 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.890
 this is a water is there but ross 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.960
 still a lot easier to do 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.220
 to bloom our roses it is enough to 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.220
 cut with shears 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.430
 here we do not take care of the essentials if 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.080
 to put them a little bit in shape 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.150
 everything about varieties 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.520
 we can leave 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.870
 rose hip that will allow you why 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.860
 not to make good jams 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.880
 jams 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.880
 rich in vitamin c
