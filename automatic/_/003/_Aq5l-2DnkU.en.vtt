00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello this will be a little surprise 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.000
 video lena has birthday today 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.170
 and unfortunately I can not be with her 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 because I mean last week 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.769
 got wisdom teeth out and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.269
 I did not let that happen in Cologne 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.500
 but in Karlsruhe and now one 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.660
 week later I still get the threads 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.760
 pulled and I wanted anyway 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.220
 somehow personally congratulate and 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.539
 that's why there is this little video and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.189
 so that is not so boring 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.410
 I thought I'll show you what I'm leaning on 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.660
 give and that includes a small one 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.130
 do it yourself and the people now then 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.920
 here in connection and indeed it is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.090
 That's why it's a chocolate and will 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.460
 I may have on instagram folk 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.559
 already seen that at the moment at aldi 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.110
 a limited chocolate is out so 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.300
 a gourmet series and that is 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.460
 a delicate chocolate with roasted 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.989
 split almonds and sea ​​salt and if 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.059
 there is one thing that makes it totally total 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.190
 then it's the combination of love 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.020
 salty and sweet and above all things 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.090
 Chocolate chocolate with salt is like that 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.370
 full of our thing and because the same 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.780
 limited I thought I 'll do it 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.219
 just yourself as that can yes 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.109
 actually relatively easy to do yourself 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.340
 and now I just show 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.530
 how I did it 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.689
 You need to first couverture me 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.520
 bought 400 grams had 200 grams 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.479
 but easy enough then you need 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.299
 man muffin the cores and shape 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.000
 sea ​​salt, namely coarse-grained sea salt 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.439
 i bought bitter couverture for a while 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.759
 just because I know that lena that 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.500
 dear market of course you can also 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.630
 take full milk or white chocolate 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.360
 depending on what you like best 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.710
 the almond kernels are still very simple 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.229
 because I believe that almondsplitter 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.610
 are more expensive and you can so meinel 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.570
 It's easy to do that later 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.610
 I'll show you the same as me 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.290
 have made and the muffin form the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.000
 I have silicone but it works 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.680
 I also have paper television 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.079
 also tried so just take this 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.210
 what you have there about the almond kernels 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.890
 you simply boil and boil water 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.189
 then give her the almond kernels for two 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.880
 to three minutes pure 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.009
 then you can do that with one 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.320
 get out spoon and then leaves the 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.710
 simply peel the almonds 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.710
 to solve 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.240
 When all of you peeled you give them 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.979
 just in a mixer and has the sun 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.810
 Small as you like in your chocolate 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.429
 could have been careful that the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.320
 not to be too fine if you want the 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.360
 already recognize splitter and 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.709
 can taste 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.420
 The finished later , it is easy 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.440
 Put in a pan and prepare it for so long 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.440
 until they are golden brown 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.359
 then the chocolate would have to go over one 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.129
 Melting water bath is the best way to do it 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.049
 that what he does not cook there 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.430
 but only gets very hot and then give 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.049
 just a bowl on the water 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.219
 and the chocolate in there and then 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.219
 It melts by itself 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.620
 next you have to do that 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.939
 Put the chocolate into the muffin 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.719
 I did not fill them completely 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:54.799
 but only a centimeter high and 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.109
 then you give the almonds shards 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.769
 on it and the sea salt and that was it 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.769
 then actually 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.810
 then you have to have the chocolate for 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.159
 Allow to cool for several hours 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.939
 Best she put in a while 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.750
 the refrigerator 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.579
 and then you can do that 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.780
 chocolate bars very simply 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.700
 loosen the muffin and then that 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.109
 the end result i 've tried her 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.329
 but tastes even better than the 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.739
 I think so original chocolate 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.510
 I'm curious what he says I think 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.370
 absolutely delicious I will definitely 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.370
 make yourself more often in the near future 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.790
 the woman early 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.670
 early 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.670
 the woman
