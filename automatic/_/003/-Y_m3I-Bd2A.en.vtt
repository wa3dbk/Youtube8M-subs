00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.690

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.189

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.080
 How to play the simplified version 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.189
 music just for the night charlie brown 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.529
 junior 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.450
 this song is played half-tone below me 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.580
 I'm going to play the standard tuning 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.529
 Do you want to play along with cb? 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.850
 who tuned his guitar half marched the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:43.290
 chords of the first part are there minor 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:47.239
 B flat major and F major said 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.900
 I sought one of the gifts to shorten you 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.629
 European night, do not you talk to me? 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.960
 problem was killing but kidnapping is 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.960
 all wrong moderated 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.230
 I know lake traveling that killed a guy 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.810
 I 'm going to take a tire, I'll forget you. 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:15.160
 nor took fire very slowly and 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.160
 explain how you do it 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.630
 I will split this rhythm into three parts in 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.530
 first part we'll play two 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.530
 times down 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.200
 in the second part we will play place 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.800
 there for up to bottom up but 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.250
 the first and second part with 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.250
 Following 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.880
 in the third part we'll play 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.340
 double bass nuno k up as down 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.170
 in another class 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.490
 We'll play the first part of the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.490
 rhythm in the first chord 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:04.890
 we play to the next court and playing 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.930
 rest of the pace and I did not think now 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.320
 I'm gaining full rhythm from this. 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.320
 form 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.420
 the chords and france are the same as the 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.959
 first part that one night only for them 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:31.200
 one night only for one night 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:33.620
 the samu but now is the second action is 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.100
 smaller 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:46.420
 the largest and the smallest 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:49.270
 It hurts desing but just to hear your voice I 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.350
 I already feel good but it 's hard for you it is 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.870
 okay 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.870
 A lot of people have fun with those who come alone. 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.930
 to hear your voice I already feel good 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.990
 but it's hard for you to come when 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.490
 people are amused that neither these 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.440
 victories are based on the simple 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.440
 are on the site any doubt that you 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.440
 have just access the sector with it 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.440
 seized
