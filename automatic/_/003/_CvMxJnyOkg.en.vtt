00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.179 
Flex did I swear this is tracking more
accurately<00:04:08.030> than<00:04:08.239> my<00:04:08.359> Flex<00:04:08.659> was<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:09.259> the<00:04:09.919> flex

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
accurately than my Flex was and the flex

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.670 
accurately than my Flex was and the flex
for<00:04:10.519> the<00:04:10.579> first<00:04:10.759> few<00:04:11.060> weeks<00:04:11.329> I<00:04:11.599> had<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.989> seemed

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
for the first few weeks I had it seemed

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.009 
for the first few weeks I had it seemed
like<00:04:12.859> it<00:04:13.009> was<00:04:13.549> doing<00:04:14.030> great<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.599> then<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:14.870> just

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
like it was doing great and then it just

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.599 
like it was doing great and then it just
started<00:04:15.290> being<00:04:15.500> wacky<00:04:15.799> and<00:04:16.099> everything<00:04:16.489> got

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
started being wacky and everything got

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.490 
started being wacky and everything got
all<00:04:16.789> messed<00:04:17.060> up<00:04:17.239> I'm<00:04:17.479> sure<00:04:17.840> if<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.139> had<00:04:18.320> done<00:04:18.440> a

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
all messed up I'm sure if I had done a

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.289 
all messed up I'm sure if I had done a
complete<00:04:18.799> reset<00:04:19.340> on<00:04:19.459> it<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:19.729> would<00:04:19.849> be<00:04:19.880> back<00:04:20.120> to

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
complete reset on it it would be back to

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.759 
complete reset on it it would be back to
normal<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:20.630> fine<00:04:20.930> but<00:04:21.440> after

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
normal and fine but after

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.230 
normal and fine but after
seeing<00:04:21.979> what<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.370> charge<00:04:22.639> does<00:04:22.910> is<00:04:23.120> my
