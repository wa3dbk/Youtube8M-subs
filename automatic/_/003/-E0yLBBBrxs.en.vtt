00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
that bad it's pretty fast especially

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.509 
that bad it's pretty fast especially
with<00:02:23.810> extended<00:02:24.290> clip<00:02:24.379> now<00:02:24.769> this<00:02:25.010> weapon<00:02:25.340> is

my opinion and this is just my opinion
on<00:03:06.019> this<00:03:06.349> weapon<00:03:06.829> after<00:03:07.189> you<00:03:08.060> start<00:03:08.480> ranking

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
on this weapon after you start ranking

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.710 
on this weapon after you start ranking
up<00:03:09.079> maybe<00:03:09.470> right<00:03:09.769> ten<00:03:10.159> to<00:03:10.700> rank<00:03:11.239> twenty<00:03:11.599> you

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
up maybe right ten to rank twenty you

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.089 
up maybe right ten to rank twenty you
shouldn't<00:03:12.049> really<00:03:12.260> be<00:03:12.349> using<00:03:12.680> this<00:03:12.859> weapon

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
shouldn't really be using this weapon

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.890 
shouldn't really be using this weapon
all<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:13.639> often<00:03:14.060> you'll<00:03:14.239> get<00:03:14.389> way<00:03:14.689> better

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
all that often you'll get way better

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.319 
all that often you'll get way better
pistols<00:03:15.409> early<00:03:15.799> on<00:03:15.980> you'll<00:03:16.370> get<00:03:16.639> way<00:03:17.030> better

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
pistols early on you'll get way better

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.899 
pistols early on you'll get way better
weapons<00:03:17.989> early<00:03:18.530> on<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:18.919> this<00:03:19.430> weapon<00:03:19.790> just

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
weapons early on and this weapon just

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.180 
weapons early on and this weapon just
falls<00:03:20.299> behind<00:03:20.540> it's<00:03:20.989> not<00:03:21.349> all<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:21.590> great<00:03:21.949> and

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
falls behind it's not all that great and

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.159 
falls behind it's not all that great and
we'll<00:03:22.370> be<00:03:22.489> talking<00:03:22.669> about<00:03:23.060> new<00:03:23.329> pistols<00:03:23.900> and

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.409 
we'll be talking about new pistols and
other<00:03:24.560> weapons<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.159> you<00:03:25.340> all<00:03:25.519> lock<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:26.000> this

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
other weapons that you all lock in this

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.390 
other weapons that you all lock in this
series<00:03:26.810> now<00:03:27.139> there<00:03:27.680> is<00:03:27.769> one<00:03:27.979> thing<00:03:28.010> that's

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
series now there is one thing that's

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.830 
series now there is one thing that's
good<00:03:28.579> about<00:03:28.609> this<00:03:28.879> weapon<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:29.359> that's<00:03:29.510> in

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
good about this weapon and that's in

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.409 
good about this weapon and that's in
survival's<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.799> can<00:03:31.069> be<00:03:31.280> used<00:03:31.519> pretty<00:03:31.909> well<00:03:32.209> in

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
survival's it can be used pretty well in

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.219 
survival's it can be used pretty well in
survivals

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:33.229 
survivals

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.080 
survivals
because<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:33.650> will<00:03:33.799> actually<00:03:33.979> be<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.310> one<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.940> two

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
because it will actually be a one to two

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.689 
because it will actually be a one to two
hit<00:03:35.299> kill<00:03:35.599> early<00:03:36.409> on<00:03:36.590> in<00:03:36.799> survivals<00:03:37.400> until

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:37.699 
hit kill early on in survivals until

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:39.909 
hit kill early on in survivals until
about<00:03:37.940> wave<00:03:38.269> three<00:03:38.720> or<00:03:38.870> four<00:03:39.139> but<00:03:39.409> after<00:03:39.709> then

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
about wave three or four but after then

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.099 
about wave three or four but after then
once<00:03:40.190> they<00:03:40.340> call<00:03:40.519> in<00:03:40.639> vehicles<00:03:41.150> and<00:03:41.419> choppers

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
once they call in vehicles and choppers

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.330 
once they call in vehicles and choppers
and<00:03:42.139> stuff<00:03:42.470> you're<00:03:42.620> not<00:03:42.769> really<00:03:43.010> going<00:03:43.250> to

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
and stuff you're not really going to

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.530 
and stuff you're not really going to
want<00:03:43.549> to<00:03:43.609> be<00:03:43.669> using<00:03:43.849> this<00:03:44.090> weapon<00:03:44.269> in

want to be using this weapon in

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.659 
want to be using this weapon in
survivals<00:03:45.229> it's<00:03:45.620> also<00:03:45.799> a<00:03:45.919> pretty<00:03:46.159> bad<00:03:46.340> weapon

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
survivals it's also a pretty bad weapon

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:47.949 
survivals it's also a pretty bad weapon
for<00:03:46.849> gang<00:03:47.000> attacks<00:03:47.329> especially<00:03:47.449> if<00:03:47.780> you're<00:03:47.930> a

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
for gang attacks especially if you're a

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.629 
for gang attacks especially if you're a
high<00:03:48.199> rank<00:03:48.560> because<00:03:48.799> they'll<00:03:48.979> start<00:03:49.099> hat<00:03:49.370> like

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
high rank because they'll start hat like

high rank because they'll start hat like
once<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.060> get<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.239> high<00:03:50.419> rank<00:03:50.780> they'll<00:03:50.959> have

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
once you get a high rank they'll have

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.710 
once you get a high rank they'll have
mini<00:03:51.349> guns<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:51.979> heavy<00:03:52.819> weapons<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.659> you

mini guns and heavy weapons and you

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.629 
mini guns and heavy weapons and you
don't<00:03:53.900> want<00:03:54.139> that<00:03:54.199> you<00:03:54.530> don't<00:03:54.560> want<00:03:54.919> to<00:03:55.250> have

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
don't want that you don't want to have

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.920

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
to deal with that now one of the

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.929 
to deal with that now one of the
redeeming<00:03:57.260> factors<00:03:57.739> of<00:03:57.859> this<00:03:57.979> weapon<00:03:58.159> is<00:03:58.459> that

00:03:58.929 --> 00:03:58.939 
redeeming factors of this weapon is that

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.849 
redeeming factors of this weapon is that
it<00:03:59.090> is<00:03:59.239> a<00:03:59.269> one-hit<00:03:59.810> kill<00:04:00.109> to<00:04:00.379> the<00:04:00.470> head<00:04:00.650> but

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
it is a one-hit kill to the head but

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.770 
it is a one-hit kill to the head but
most<00:04:01.099> weapons<00:04:01.370> are<00:04:01.699> that<00:04:01.939> way<00:04:02.180> unless<00:04:02.599> an

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
most weapons are that way unless an

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.629 
most weapons are that way unless an
enemy<00:04:03.109> is<00:04:03.319> using<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.739> bulletproof<00:04:04.099> helmet<00:04:04.250> you

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
will actually get a 1 1 hit kill

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.710 
will actually get a 1 1 hit kill
headshot<00:04:07.099> but<00:04:07.639> with<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:07.970> rate<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.269> fire<00:04:08.449> that

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
headshot but with the rate of fire that

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.499 
headshot but with the rate of fire that
it<00:04:08.870> has<00:04:09.049> it's<00:04:09.439> not<00:04:09.530> all<00:04:10.009> that<00:04:10.040> great<00:04:10.489> to<00:04:11.120> go

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:11.509 
it has it's not all that great to go

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.659
