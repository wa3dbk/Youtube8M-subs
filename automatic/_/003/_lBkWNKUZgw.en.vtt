great<00:02:04.310> hobbyists<00:02:04.970> one<00:02:05.330> thing<00:02:05.540> we've<00:02:05.690> learned

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
great hobbyists one thing we've learned

great hobbyists one thing we've learned
from<00:02:06.080> building<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:06.590> chalk<00:02:06.860> is<00:02:07.070> we're<00:02:07.760> not

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
from building this chalk is we're not

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.030 
from building this chalk is we're not
necessarily<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.810> greatest<00:02:09.110> dumpster

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
necessarily the greatest dumpster

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:18.700 
necessarily the greatest dumpster
drivers<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:17.420> I'm<00:02:17.540> going<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.750> use<00:02:18.230> my<00:02:18.410> hand<00:02:18.620> a

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
drivers so I'm going to use my hand a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.650 
drivers so I'm going to use my hand a
little<00:02:18.740> bit<00:02:19.100> give<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.970> helping<00:02:20.150> start<00:02:20.540> in

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
little bit give it a helping start in

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:43.070 
little bit give it a helping start in
the<00:02:20.750> proper<00:02:21.170> way<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.410> do<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:28.450> there<00:02:29.450> we<00:02:29.600> go

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.350 

and<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.170> dumpster<00:02:44.650> has<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.220> hook<00:02:45.520> on<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.940> which

we can unlatch and then if we want to

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.560 
we can unlatch and then if we want to
bring<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.290> back<00:02:50.320> on<00:02:50.850> simply<00:02:51.850> repeat<00:02:52.210> the<00:02:52.240> same

so<00:04:03.909> that<00:04:03.940> when<00:04:04.269> we<00:04:04.390> drive<00:04:04.599> the<00:04:04.840> truck<00:04:07.019> at

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
so that when we drive the truck at

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.410 
so that when we drive the truck at
second<00:04:08.530> speed<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:11.609> first<00:04:12.609> feeder<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.180> ice

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
low crawler speed third speeds a little

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.340 
low crawler speed third speeds a little
faster<00:04:16.239> that<00:04:16.419> I'm<00:04:16.539> going<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.750> go<00:04:16.870> on<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.169> rough

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
faster that I'm going to go on the rough

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.289 
faster that I'm going to go on the rough
terrain<00:04:17.530> right<00:04:17.949> now<00:04:18.130> but<00:04:18.820> gives<00:04:19.030> us<00:04:19.180> a

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
terrain right now but gives us a

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.379 
terrain right now but gives us a
realistic<00:04:19.959> look<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.560> truck

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
realistic look to the truck

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.969 
realistic look to the truck
that's<00:04:22.389> another<00:04:22.750> custom<00:04:23.289> build<00:04:23.500> from<00:04:23.710> Holley

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979
