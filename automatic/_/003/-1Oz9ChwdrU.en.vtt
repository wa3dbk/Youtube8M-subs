real motor parts in pretty rough shape
so<00:00:36.030> I've<00:00:36.180> detach<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.899> engine<00:00:37.460> from<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.230> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
so I've detach the engine from it and it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.319 
so I've detach the engine from it and it
does<00:00:40.440> run<00:00:40.969> you<00:00:43.250> know<00:00:44.250> carburetors<00:00:45.030> shall<00:00:45.210> be

some<00:00:45.570> cleaning<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.579> had<00:00:47.579> good<00:00:47.730> cleaning<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
some cleaning and had good cleaning and

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.990 
some cleaning and had good cleaning and
stuff<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:49.039> it's<00:00:50.039> not<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> bad<00:00:50.520> round<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.789> little

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
stuff but it's not a bad round a little

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.779 
stuff but it's not a bad round a little
engine<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.910> tags<00:00:54.149> missing<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.430> but<00:00:56.430> it's

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
engine the tags missing on it but it's

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:06.219

either aw i WR WM b or model I Briggs

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:13.670 
either aw i WR WM b or model I Briggs
I'm<00:01:07.229> thinking<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.770> WI<00:01:11.390> but<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.409> from

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
I'm thinking it's WI but just just from

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.940 
I'm thinking it's WI but just just from
doing<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.549> short<00:01:15.619> short<00:01:16.619> amount<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.860> time

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
doing just a short short amount of time

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.270 
doing just a short short amount of time
our<00:01:17.340> research<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.500> has<00:01:19.500> aluminum<00:01:19.920> shroud

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
our research on it has aluminum shroud

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:30.200 
our research on it has aluminum shroud
instead<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:23.330> steel<00:01:25.640> shroud<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> let's<00:01:30.000> give

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
instead of a steel shroud so let's give

00:01:30.210 --> 00:03:22.979 
instead of a steel shroud so let's give
her<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> start

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.690 

I<00:03:23.989> had<00:03:24.829> put<00:03:25.069> some<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:27.159> little<00:03:28.159> bit<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.340> mixed

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
I had put some a little bit of mixed

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.309 
I had put some a little bit of mixed
fuel<00:03:29.409> in<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:31.549> fuel<00:03:31.790> tank<00:03:31.819> initially<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:35.319> think

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
fuel in the fuel tank initially I think

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.970 
fuel in the fuel tank initially I think
on<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.470> motor<00:03:36.709> that<00:03:36.890> that's<00:03:37.310> it's<00:03:37.790> at<00:03:38.090> four<00:03:38.420> and

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
on a motor that that's it's at four and

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.190 
on a motor that that's it's at four and
an<00:03:39.980> extended<00:03:40.640> period<00:03:41.090> of<00:03:41.299> time<00:03:41.360> an<00:03:41.780> old<00:03:41.900> engine

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
an extended period of time an old engine

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.110 
an extended period of time an old engine
like<00:03:42.379> this<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:45.590> know<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.950> usually<00:03:46.549> put<00:03:46.849> just<00:03:47.030> a

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
like this you know I usually put just a

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.500 
like this you know I usually put just a
little<00:03:47.150> bit<00:03:47.510> of<00:03:48.310> gas<00:03:49.310> oil<00:03:49.489> mix<00:03:49.670> in<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.090> at<00:03:50.269> first

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
little bit of gas oil mix in it at first

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.399 
little bit of gas oil mix in it at first
and<00:03:51.049> then<00:03:51.500> some<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:52.840> then<00:03:53.840> some<00:03:53.930> regular

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
and then some and then some regular

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.750 
and then some and then some regular
fuels<00:03:54.709> regular<00:03:55.190> gasoline<00:03:57.250> as<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.370> could<00:03:58.519> set

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
fuels regular gasoline as you could set

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.430 
fuels regular gasoline as you could set
up<00:03:58.849> to<00:03:58.970> how<00:03:59.030> it<00:03:59.180> was<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.359> smoking<00:04:00.109> a<00:04:00.139> little<00:04:00.230> bit

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
up to how it was a smoking a little bit

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.680 
up to how it was a smoking a little bit
i'm<00:04:00.590> thinking<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.069> was<00:04:01.159> probably<00:04:02.120> mostly<00:04:02.420> from

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
i'm thinking it was probably mostly from

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.160 
i'm thinking it was probably mostly from
that<00:04:02.870> initial<00:04:03.650> fuel<00:04:04.040> mix<00:04:04.280> i<00:04:04.430> put<00:04:04.639> in<00:04:04.730> there<00:04:05.739> but

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
that initial fuel mix i put in there but

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.490 
that initial fuel mix i put in there but
not<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.230> bad<00:04:09.440> run<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.680> little<00:04:09.859> engine<00:04:10.340> oh<00:04:11.500> there

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
not a bad run a little engine oh there

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.650 
not a bad run a little engine oh there
we<00:04:12.620> go
