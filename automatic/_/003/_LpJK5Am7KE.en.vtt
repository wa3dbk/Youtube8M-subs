from 1182 1182 and change eleven eighty

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.590 
from 1182 1182 and change eleven eighty
to<00:01:01.980> ninety<00:01:02.489> three<00:01:03.409> significant<00:01:04.409> yes<00:01:05.420> almost<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
to ninety three significant yes almost a

to ninety three significant yes almost a
triple<00:01:06.930> bottom<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.680> place<00:01:08.040> there

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
triple bottom in the in place there

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.179 
triple bottom in the in place there
they're<00:01:09.270> spread<00:01:09.600> apart<00:01:09.960> six<00:01:10.650> months<00:01:10.920> maybe

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
against this trendline we failed on the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.850 
against this trendline we failed on the
break<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.330> this<00:02:31.510> trend<00:02:31.930> line<00:02:32.140> on<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.440> move<00:02:32.710> to

break of this trend line on a move to
the<00:02:32.950> downside<00:02:33.100> but<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:33.760> broke<00:02:34.000> back<00:02:34.270> above<00:02:34.600> it

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
the downside but we broke back above it

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.290 
the downside but we broke back above it
around<00:02:34.900> eleven<00:02:35.560> ninety<00:02:36.070> level<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.940> we<00:02:37.090> moved

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
around eleven ninety level and we moved

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.390 
around eleven ninety level and we moved
higher<00:02:37.570> we<00:02:37.870> closed<00:02:38.110> near<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.860> high<00:02:39.010> for<00:02:39.310> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
higher we closed near the high for the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.810 
higher we closed near the high for the
day<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.090> if<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.360> daily<00:02:40.720> chart<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:41.230> showing

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
day so if the daily chart it's showing

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.490 
day so if the daily chart it's showing
reasons<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:43.030> think<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.600> bottom<00:02:44.080> might<00:02:44.320> be

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
reasons to think that a bottom might be

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.890 
reasons to think that a bottom might be
in<00:02:44.620> place<00:02:44.920> isn't<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:46.240> answer<00:02:46.570> is<00:02:46.810> yes

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
in place isn't it the answer is yes

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.930 
in place isn't it the answer is yes
let's<00:02:47.590> take<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.770> look<00:02:47.920> at<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.100> hours<00:02:48.460> hourly

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
let's take a look at the hours hourly

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.790 
let's take a look at the hours hourly
chart<00:02:49.240> and<00:02:49.360> see<00:02:49.510> what<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:50.020> is<00:02:50.260> telling<00:02:50.650> us

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
chart and see what that is telling us

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.980 
chart and see what that is telling us
and<00:02:51.670> we<00:02:51.790> take<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:51.970> look<00:02:52.090> at<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.300> hourly<00:02:52.690> chart

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
and we take a look at the hourly chart

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.230 
and we take a look at the hourly chart
we<00:02:53.110> put<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.290> line<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:53.620> around<00:02:54.070> eleven<00:02:54.700> ninety

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
we put a line in around eleven ninety

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.000 
we put a line in around eleven ninety
level<00:02:55.570> remember<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.990> eleven<00:02:56.230> ninety<00:02:56.680> level

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
level remember the eleven ninety level

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.910 
level remember the eleven ninety level
was<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.580> not<00:02:58.300> only<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.630> low<00:02:58.840> from<00:02:59.230> on<00:02:59.440> Fridays

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
was the not only the low from on Fridays

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.910 
was the not only the low from on Fridays
tray<00:03:00.160> but<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.460> also<00:03:00.640> where<00:03:00.910> we<00:03:01.030> broke<00:03:01.390> back

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
tray but is also where we broke back

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.800 
tray but is also where we broke back
above<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:03.190> trend<00:03:03.700> line<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.120> bottom<00:03:04.480> trend

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
above that trend line that bottom trend

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.900 
above that trend line that bottom trend
line<00:03:04.960> on<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.200> daily<00:03:05.380> chart<00:03:05.560> right<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:06.790> we

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
line on the daily chart right and so we

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.640 
line on the daily chart right and so we
went<00:03:07.060> up<00:03:07.210> to<00:03:07.240> around<00:03:07.600> eleven<00:03:08.020> ninety<00:03:08.380> level

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
went up to around eleven ninety level

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.870 
went up to around eleven ninety level
retrace<00:03:09.370> we<00:03:09.640> gathered<00:03:10.120> some<00:03:10.390> ourselves

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880

that<00:07:15.979> 200<00:07:16.639> our<00:07:16.759> moving<00:07:17.119> average<00:07:17.360> it's<00:07:17.899> able<00:07:18.199> to

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:18.289 
that 200 our moving average it's able to

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:20.079 
that 200 our moving average it's able to

stay above that 200 our moving average I

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:22.119 
stay above that 200 our moving average I
think<00:07:20.269> we<00:07:20.360> have<00:07:20.389> further<00:07:20.749> momentum<00:07:21.319> that

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:22.129 
think we have further momentum that

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:24.459 
think we have further momentum that
could<00:07:22.309> take<00:07:22.489> this<00:07:22.699> up<00:07:22.939> price<00:07:23.239> to<00:07:23.419> a<00:07:23.449> minimum<00:07:23.959> up

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:24.469 
could take this up price to a minimum up

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:27.189 
could take this up price to a minimum up
to<00:07:24.860> the<00:07:24.979> 12<00:07:25.249> 36<00:07:25.689> 2020<00:07:26.689> level<00:07:26.959> that's<00:07:27.049> a
