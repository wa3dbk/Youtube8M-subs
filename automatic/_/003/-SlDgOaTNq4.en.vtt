00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.509
 companion that will greatly help the

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.479
 A news that now that I 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.149
 It's lively enough, I do not know if I'm going.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.659
 It's a new character proposing the game. 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.250
 are other main characters and 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.410
 each one counts 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.260
 It will show a little bit in this passage 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.660

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.420

 Assigning a shot there to power. 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.090
 I think to record a little more 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.209

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.480

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.970
 interesting is worth 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.550
 beauty people have a game that was 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.590
 Expecting a lot, it 's actually him. 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.430
 showed a little of it in e3 of the year 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.650
 past that the 10th is a game of fps 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.540
 he will remember and remember a little of what 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.600
 when I saw it there it reminded me of 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.730
 little king lot is but he was well 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.310
 different had a one drive 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.550
 quick and I do not know, I do not know how to speak 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.590
 But the deficit is right but it is not 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.510
 coming here with a beta that will arrive 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.340
 now in July she can wait and 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.239
 It's going to be cool, it's going to have to 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.820
 activision confirmed this there during 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.940
 the first quarter that now in July 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.769
 who will have access to the first beta are 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.820
 users playstation 3 playstation 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.790
 4 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.640
 then the people who are shareholders and can 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.760
 vibrate enough and guys I stayed 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.670
 also impressed with the budget that 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.230
 if these people do to 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.239
 to develop the game he has to go 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.370
 500 million dollars 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.290
 This is not a low amount, it's a lot. 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.209
 So I'll wait there and see a 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.019
 spectacular sensational game 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.040
 Ok, well let's go to the next one. 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.919
 news 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.820
 only now this news I'm 'tô' 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.430
 looking a little glimpse at the tail and me 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.870
 I was very excited, that's okay, I'll talk 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.760
 now for you the last of remaster 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.830
 director neil drumond said that the 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.800
 version of the new sony console that the ps4 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.260
 he will take advantage of a new model 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.450
 lighting and that this will bring a 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.830
 significant difference to the game was 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.160
 lighting is in the graphic part 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.080
 often in the picture game 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.840
 you may realize that when you are 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.390
 has a drawing and you work at 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.970
 eliminating it for photoshop gives a 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.250
 another dimension to another face to 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.580
 that drawing you create life you give 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.870
 one is the ambiance but it is three-dimensional 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.280
 for him 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.680
 So I guess this is going to be one thing. 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.290
 very positive and will greatly improve 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.450
 people will have a new grass will have a 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.330
 absurd difference because of the graphs 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.220
 however the new characters 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.850
 they will replace the characters in the 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.880
 ps3 and put new characters with 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.010
 a better definition better worked 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.950
 I think it will be just like with the 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.760
 tombo king né of the ultimate there I think 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.470
 I forgot the name of the version where they are 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.600
 brought a little better malaria 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.700
 they brought a better atmosphere then 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.370
 I think it's going to be the same way it is 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.160
 cool in all this is that the characters 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.770
 Are they going to be the same as the cat sine? 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.270
 at the time you have played inside the 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.190
 game or in game 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.720
 So I think this is going to be a 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.830
 very cool experience 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.270
 so I think it will be worth it for 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.450
 whoever has played again because it is a 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.550
 fucking a game and I really want to see 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.050
 How is it going to be in this setting? 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.630
 part of online 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.180
 I can not wait for this and people 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.540
 cutscenes is forgetting to talk 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.230
 they will switch to 1080p at 60 frames per 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.720
 second, then they were all 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:20.870
 remastered were not performed 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.110
 new is wrong speech is remastered is 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.370
 were held again then you 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.170
 can expect quality too. 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:32.060
 spend a lot better time than we do 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:34.760
 I see that was 720 and good tone 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.680
 super anxious for this one last beauty 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.290
 information for those who were waiting 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.870
 game daylight it has been delayed 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.990
 unfortunately for February 2015 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.970
 This game was promising me there. 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.070
 nigeria last year team was very 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:52.180
 cool a game of a guide that will be 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:55.460
 fantastic is going to be that thing of 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.260
 apocalypse is that you run you have to 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.490
 jump without doing it for healing and at first 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.300
 person is well 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:05.180
 I'm really anxious to see it's actually the 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:09.110
 warner and onerous and until they are still 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.880
 claiming they want to give one is one 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.610
 refined in the game they want 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.490
 improve the quality of those 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.569
 they promised then it is unfortunately they 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.310
 had to postpone 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:21.620
 I think this is a good point for the 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.110
 game I think it's going to be really cool I 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.150
 I do not see in a way until I get upset 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.580
 because the better the bigger the game 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:32.210
 experience that we will have and will 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:34.699
 being the gameplay will be good right? 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.259
 she is this, I brought the news that I 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:38.509
