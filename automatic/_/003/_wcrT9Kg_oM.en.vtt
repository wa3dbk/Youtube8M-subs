00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
each with a specific purpose and from

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.820 
each with a specific purpose and from
that<00:00:20.689> you<00:00:20.839> can<00:00:20.960> draw<00:00:21.109> your<00:00:21.259> own<00:00:21.320> opinion<00:00:21.769> on

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830
