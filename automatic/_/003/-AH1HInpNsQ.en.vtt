direction what we've done is designed to
mechanism<00:01:11.420> allow<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:12.990> bit<00:01:13.170> we

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
mechanism allow it a little bit we

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.999 
mechanism allow it a little bit we
redirect<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.180> energy<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.990> changes<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
redirect that energy and changes the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.070 
redirect that energy and changes the
angle<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.880> seat<00:01:18.060> back<00:01:18.299> that's<00:01:18.630> amazing

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
angle of the seat back that's amazing

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.929 
angle of the seat back that's amazing
I've<00:01:19.229> never<00:01:19.470> seen<00:01:19.680> anything<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
I've never seen anything like that the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.030 
I've never seen anything like that the
only<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.330> its<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:21.479> only<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:21.990> aren't<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
only one of its kind only one aren't you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.880 
only one of its kind only one aren't you
proud<00:01:23.250> yes<00:01:23.729> yes<00:01:24.090> I'm<00:01:24.810> proud<00:01:25.080> too<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.409> love<00:01:25.740> it

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
proud yes yes I'm proud too I love it

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.060 
proud yes yes I'm proud too I love it
now<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.610> only<00:01:26.790> does<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> seat<00:01:27.860> provide<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
now not only does the seat provide that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.069 
now not only does the seat provide that
function<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.790> also<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.270> installed<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
function it can also be installed at a

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.380 
function it can also be installed at a
more<00:01:32.009> upright<00:01:32.340> angle<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:32.970> older<00:01:33.210> children

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
more upright angle for older children

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.940 
more upright angle for older children
there's<00:01:33.659> an<00:01:33.780> adjust<00:01:34.079> recline<00:01:34.439> adjustment

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
there's an adjust recline adjustment

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.649 
there's an adjust recline adjustment
mechanism<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.460> back<00:01:35.640> what's<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.509> they

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
mechanism in the back what's that they

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.210 
mechanism in the back what's that they
will<00:01:36.810> still<00:01:37.020> benefit<00:01:37.500> from<00:01:37.530> some<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
will still benefit from some of the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.710 
will still benefit from some of the
controlled<00:01:38.610> motion<00:01:38.970> only<00:01:39.150> less<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.600> it's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
controlled motion only less of it's

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.999 
controlled motion only less of it's
because<00:01:40.020> they've<00:01:40.200> started<00:01:40.409> off<00:01:40.650> now<00:01:40.860> oh
