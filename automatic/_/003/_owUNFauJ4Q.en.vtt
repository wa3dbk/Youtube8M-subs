00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.300
 some passages 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.839
 I asked him 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.820
 the debt crisis 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.980
 for me guys 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.900
 it's today 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.920
 the canucks have won the change not lose 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.580
 the perla losing seven points of the head and in their head 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.880
 we do not qualify to go by winning all the cards in hand to do it 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.010
 speak that's why this morning that the game had revealed to the afp the young 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.700
 woman with voice 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 the first place 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.460
 tusk 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.690
 for boys for the job then 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.190
 the cavalry fanfare 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.150
 tactically I'm taped 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.110
 series 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.300
 his advice 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.960
 yes because not to miss 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.800
 the greens go by the head 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.300
 I paid him the electronic bill hair of the form on the ground 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.300
 if all the guys hide me 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.600
 with this money 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.430
 otherwise I think Parisians and police 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.290
 to bring their attention guys 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.450
 the follow-up news fashionable these were young people from 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.050
 motivated and determined 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.640
 I do not know Parisians 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.830
 on the 85 years 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.830
 yes that's true sometimes as a form of concession 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.310
 here is the program 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.310
 she's been coming for three years 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.340
 you really have to win this match 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.360
 necessarily we have to send back 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.090
 p for following in the ideas 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.660
 as early as March and April 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.000
 and that's the problem 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 we will be behind you 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.249
 already on the ground 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:11.409
 timone 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.029
 the pope has never been hurt more 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.549
 it's about 20 years old 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.549
 since many domains here are 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.579
 the leaders for the football match 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.669
 that's our problem 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.669
 strange idea crushed and broke from crushing 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.899
 if you are comfortable anywhere 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.899
 the most sensitive 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.179
 I already know
