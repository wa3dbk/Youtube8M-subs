methods that have been tested about
recently<00:00:20.970> but<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.750> 2007<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.980> was<00:00:23.010> decided<00:00:23.670> that

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
recently but in 2007 it was decided that

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.660 
recently but in 2007 it was decided that
nukes<00:00:24.600> might<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> answer<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.160> just

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
nukes might have the answer and just

spacecraft to first smash a hole in the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.630 
spacecraft to first smash a hole in the
asteroid<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.930> then<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.860> dump<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.250> nuclear

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
asteroid and then to dump a nuclear

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
now blowing up an asteroid like this or

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310 
now blowing up an asteroid like this or
at<00:00:50.700> least<00:00:50.850> blowing<00:00:51.149> an<00:00:51.210> asteroid<00:00:51.539> away<00:00:51.989> from

at least blowing an asteroid away from
the<00:00:52.379> direction<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> earth<00:00:53.100> could<00:00:54.030> solve

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the direction of the earth could solve

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
the direction of the earth could solve
the<00:00:54.930> answer<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.559> age-old<00:00:56.070> doomsday

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the answer to this age-old doomsday

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
the answer to this age-old doomsday
problem<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:57.809> with<00:00:57.960> an<00:00:58.050> asteroid

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
problem of what to do with an asteroid

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.770 
problem of what to do with an asteroid
that<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:59.129> coming<00:00:59.579> towards<00:01:00.000> us<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.539> at<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that is coming towards us but at the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450 
that is coming towards us but at the
same<00:01:00.930> time<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.440> quite<00:01:01.649> controversial

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
same time it's quite controversial

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.729 
same time it's quite controversial
because<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> amount<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.539> energy<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.320> is

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
because the amount of energy that is

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.800 
because the amount of energy that is
released<00:01:04.920> by<00:01:05.369> something<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
released by something like this and the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.270 
released by something like this and the
fragments<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.409> rock<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.770> could<00:01:08.159> be

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
fragments of rock that could be

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.800 
fragments of rock that could be
displaced<00:01:08.700> could<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.210> make<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
displaced could actually make the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.620 
displaced could actually make the
situation<00:01:09.960> possibly<00:01:10.890> worse<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:12.240> over<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
situation possibly worse just over a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.280 
situation possibly worse just over a
year<00:01:12.720> ago<00:01:13.229> an<00:01:14.189> asteroid<00:01:14.610> exploded<00:01:15.600> high<00:01:15.869> above

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
year ago an asteroid exploded high above

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.740 
year ago an asteroid exploded high above
Russia<00:01:16.830> now<00:01:17.520> luckily<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.450> high<00:01:18.689> enough

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
Russia now luckily it was high enough

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.620 
Russia now luckily it was high enough
not<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.619> tremendous<00:01:20.549> damage<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:21.390> around

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
not to do tremendous damage but around

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.649 
not to do tremendous damage but around
1500<00:01:22.500> people<00:01:22.650> were<00:01:23.070> hurt<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.549> 7,000<00:01:24.390> people

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
1500 people were hurt and 7,000 people

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.320 
1500 people were hurt and 7,000 people
were<00:01:25.140> 7,000<00:01:25.950> buildings<00:01:26.100> were<00:01:26.820> damaged

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
were 7,000 buildings were damaged

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.630 
were 7,000 buildings were damaged
because<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.960> energy<00:01:28.470> released<00:01:29.189> by<00:01:29.490> this

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
because the energy released by this

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.480 
because the energy released by this
explosion<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.720> asteroid<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.680> around<00:01:31.979> 20

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
explosion of this asteroid was around 20

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.090 
explosion of this asteroid was around 20
to<00:01:32.729> 30<00:01:32.970> times<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.869> Hiroshima<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.979> when

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
to 30 times that of Hiroshima so when

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.499 
to 30 times that of Hiroshima so when
you're<00:01:35.220> looking<00:01:35.340> at<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.850> amount<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.270> energy

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
you're looking at this amount of energy

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.740 
you're looking at this amount of energy
from<00:01:37.170> an<00:01:37.320> asteroid<00:01:37.729> exploding<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.540> is

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
from an asteroid exploding you know is

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.560 
from an asteroid exploding you know is
putting<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.439> nuclear<00:01:41.130> weapon<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.150> surface

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
putting a nuclear weapon on the surface

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.929 
putting a nuclear weapon on the surface
of<00:01:42.689> an<00:01:42.840> asteroid<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> right<00:01:43.829> answer

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
of an asteroid really the right answer

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.310 
of an asteroid really the right answer
sounds<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.030> something<00:01:45.420> from<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.869> film<00:01:46.110> you're

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
sounds like something from a film you're

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.100 
sounds like something from a film you're
right<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.649> mean<00:01:46.710> look<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:48.000> probably<00:01:48.509> our<00:01:49.079> only

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
right I mean look it's probably our only

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.399 
right I mean look it's probably our only
choice<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.979> at<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.189> point<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:51.600> asteroid

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
choice as at this point a asteroid

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
choice as at this point a asteroid
hitting<00:01:52.680> Earth<00:01:52.950> could<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> huge<00:01:54.570> impact

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
hitting Earth could have a huge impact

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.920 
hitting Earth could have a huge impact
no<00:01:55.619> pun<00:01:55.829> intended<00:01:56.090> but<00:01:57.090> look<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> mean<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.689> of

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
no pun intended but look I mean as of

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.420 
no pun intended but look I mean as of
now<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.290> still<00:01:58.500> believe<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.979> comment<00:01:59.340> that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
now we still believe it's a comment that

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.340 
now we still believe it's a comment that
hits<00:01:59.610> 66<00:02:00.119> million<00:02:00.390> years<00:02:00.450> ago<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.840> wiped<00:02:01.110> out

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
hits 66 million years ago that wiped out

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.499 
hits 66 million years ago that wiped out
almost<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.280> dinosaurs<00:02:02.759> existing<00:02:03.360> so

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
almost all of the dinosaurs existing so

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.120 
almost all of the dinosaurs existing so
I<00:02:03.540> mean<00:02:03.719> yeah<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.110> huge<00:02:04.290> thing<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.770> always

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
I mean yeah it's a huge thing I always

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.069 
I mean yeah it's a huge thing I always
imagined<00:02:05.640> us<00:02:05.759> using<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> laser<00:02:06.390> something

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
imagined us using a laser something

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.930 
imagined us using a laser something
cooler<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.710> hey<00:02:07.890> got<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.550> do<00:02:08.640> what<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.789> got<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
cooler but hey got to do what you got to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.570 
cooler but hey got to do what you got to
do<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.270> well<00:02:09.569> lasers<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.349> been<00:02:10.590> one<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
do right well lasers have been one of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.530 
do right well lasers have been one of
the<00:02:11.760> methods<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.270> have<00:02:12.420> been<00:02:12.540> thought<00:02:12.690> about

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
the methods that have been thought about

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.800 
the methods that have been thought about
burning<00:02:14.129> burning<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.459> asteroid<00:02:15.939> using<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
burning burning the asteroid using the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.199 
burning burning the asteroid using the
heat<00:02:17.170> from<00:02:17.469> sunlight<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.459> another<00:02:18.760> method

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
heat from sunlight is another method

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.849 
heat from sunlight is another method
that's<00:02:19.239> been<00:02:19.540> thought<00:02:20.049> of<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:20.439> apparently

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
that's been thought of but apparently

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.860 
that's been thought of but apparently
they've<00:02:21.370> now<00:02:21.519> decided<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:22.209> nuclear<00:02:22.719> weapons

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
they've now decided that nuclear weapons

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.780 
they've now decided that nuclear weapons
nukes<00:02:23.469> could<00:02:23.920> be<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.159> answer<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.549> we're

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
nukes could be the answer and we're

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.630 
nukes could be the answer and we're
talking<00:02:25.120> about<00:02:25.290> medium<00:02:26.290> sized<00:02:26.739> asteroids

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
talking about medium sized asteroids

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.160 
talking about medium sized asteroids
apparently<00:02:28.180> maybe<00:02:28.359> if<00:02:28.569> there<00:02:28.780> are<00:02:28.930> large

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
apparently maybe if there are large

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.259 
apparently maybe if there are large
asteroids<00:02:29.709> we<00:02:29.920> might<00:02:30.099> not<00:02:30.250> have<00:02:30.730> any<00:02:30.939> hope<00:02:31.120> at

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
asteroids we might not have any hope at

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.449 
asteroids we might not have any hope at
all<00:02:31.359> but<00:02:31.810> medium<00:02:32.349> sized<00:02:32.590> asteroids<00:02:33.099> which<00:02:33.310> are

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
all but medium sized asteroids which are

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.220 
all but medium sized asteroids which are
known<00:02:33.609> as<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.760> dinosaur<00:02:34.480> killers<00:02:34.810> are<00:02:34.989> what

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
known as the dinosaur killers are what

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.009 
known as the dinosaur killers are what
these<00:02:35.409> methods<00:02:35.799> are<00:02:36.010> targeting<00:02:36.730> now<00:02:37.269> just

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
these methods are targeting now just

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.440 
these methods are targeting now just
next<00:02:38.349> week<00:02:38.500> June<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.069> 30th<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:40.000> world's

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
next week June the 30th the world's

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.619 
next week June the 30th the world's
first<00:02:40.810> asteroid<00:02:41.620> day<00:02:42.159> is<00:02:42.400> happening<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.209> June

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
first asteroid day is happening and June

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.349 
first asteroid day is happening and June
30th<00:02:44.109> is<00:02:44.200> actually<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.250> anniversary<00:02:45.639> of<00:02:46.120> the

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
30th is actually the anniversary of the

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.190 
30th is actually the anniversary of the
1908<00:02:47.250> asteroid<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.459> hit<00:02:48.870> Siberia<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.109> it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
1908 asteroid that hit Siberia and it

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.699 
1908 asteroid that hit Siberia and it
wiped<00:02:50.439> out<00:02:50.680> around<00:02:51.180> 800<00:02:52.180> square<00:02:52.540> miles<00:02:53.049> so

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
wiped out around 800 square miles so

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.039 
wiped out around 800 square miles so
that<00:02:53.950> was<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.340> last<00:02:54.459> time<00:02:54.730> 1908<00:02:55.599> that<00:02:55.629> we<00:02:55.840> had

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
that was the last time 1908 that we had

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.080 
that was the last time 1908 that we had
a<00:02:56.079> major<00:02:56.349> impact<00:02:56.799> from<00:02:56.980> an<00:02:57.129> asteroid<00:02:57.430> but<00:02:58.000> the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
a major impact from an asteroid but the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.000 
a major impact from an asteroid but the
problem<00:02:58.419> is<00:02:58.599> is<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.290> when<00:02:59.590> we<00:02:59.739> finally

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
problem is is that when we finally

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.250 
problem is is that when we finally
detect<00:03:00.549> one<00:03:00.819> coming<00:03:01.239> towards<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.629> earth<00:03:01.750> we

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
detect one coming towards the earth we

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.770 
detect one coming towards the earth we
might<00:03:02.560> not<00:03:02.680> have<00:03:02.739> very<00:03:03.189> long<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.970> decide<00:03:04.329> what

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
might not have very long to decide what

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.909 
might not have very long to decide what
method<00:03:05.079> to<00:03:05.409> use

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
method to use

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.559 
method to use
so<00:03:06.220> asteroid<00:03:06.790> day<00:03:06.939> has<00:03:07.060> been<00:03:07.150> created<00:03:07.480> this

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
so asteroid day has been created this

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.479 
so asteroid day has been created this
year<00:03:07.780> June<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.200> 30th<00:03:08.590> in<00:03:08.799> order<00:03:09.129> to<00:03:09.280> just

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
year June the 30th in order to just

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.729 
year June the 30th in order to just
raise<00:03:09.760> government<00:03:10.419> awareness<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.109> to<00:03:11.500> try

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
raise government awareness and to try

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.800 
raise government awareness and to try
and<00:03:11.950> call<00:03:12.519> for<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.819> government<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.359> put<00:03:13.510> more

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
and call for the government to put more

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.129 
and call for the government to put more
funding<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:14.470> more<00:03:14.560> time<00:03:15.069> into<00:03:16.030> detecting<00:03:16.900> and

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
funding and more time into detecting and

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.680 
funding and more time into detecting and
trying<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:17.949> deflect<00:03:18.129> these<00:03:18.370> asteroids<00:03:18.760> really

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
trying to deflect these asteroids really

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.909 
trying to deflect these asteroids really
kind<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.019> shows<00:03:20.199> you<00:03:20.319> how<00:03:20.409> small<00:03:20.709> and

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
kind of shows you how small and

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.189 
kind of shows you how small and
insignificant<00:03:21.430> we<00:03:22.030> are<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.389> know<00:03:22.479> that<00:03:22.659> any

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:23.199 
insignificant we are you know that any

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:25.649 
insignificant we are you know that any
day<00:03:23.440> now<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.650> big<00:03:24.190> rock<00:03:24.519> could<00:03:24.819> come<00:03:25.359> and<00:03:25.510> wipe

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
day now a big rock could come and wipe

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:26.969 
day now a big rock could come and wipe
us<00:03:25.870> all<00:03:25.989> out<00:03:26.019> there's<00:03:26.349> nothing<00:03:26.650> we<00:03:26.739> could<00:03:26.859> do

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:26.979 
us all out there's nothing we could do

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.170 
us all out there's nothing we could do
about<00:03:27.099> it<00:03:27.310> if<00:03:27.400> it's<00:03:27.549> big<00:03:27.699> enough<00:03:27.729> we're<00:03:28.060> all

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
about it if it's big enough we're all

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.460 
about it if it's big enough we're all
just<00:03:28.389> gonna<00:03:28.479> sit<00:03:28.720> there<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.900> say<00:03:29.019> up<00:03:29.229> we're

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
just gonna sit there and say up we're

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.729 
just gonna sit there and say up we're
screwed

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
screwed

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.469 
screwed
but<00:03:30.280> yeah<00:03:30.400> again<00:03:30.729> we're<00:03:31.090> all<00:03:31.180> too<00:03:31.329> busy

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:31.479 
but yeah again we're all too busy

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:32.819 
but yeah again we're all too busy
fighting<00:03:31.720> each<00:03:31.930> other<00:03:32.139> anyway<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.620> don't

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
fighting each other anyway so I don't

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.379 
fighting each other anyway so I don't
think<00:03:32.979> people<00:03:33.099> are<00:03:33.190> gonna<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.879> know<00:03:34.000> put<00:03:34.209> much

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
think people are gonna you know put much

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.069 
think people are gonna you know put much
thought<00:03:34.419> into<00:03:34.599> this

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
thought into this
