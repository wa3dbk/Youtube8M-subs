pieces I feel like some more cliff sides
or<00:03:45.849> rock<00:03:46.030> sides<00:03:46.359> would<00:03:46.510> have<00:03:46.660> made<00:03:46.810> more<00:03:46.959> sense

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
or rock sides would have made more sense

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.960 
or rock sides would have made more sense
because<00:03:47.739> why<00:03:48.040> are<00:03:48.069> you<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.669> might<00:03:48.790> as<00:03:48.849> well

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
because why are you you might as well

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.909 
because why are you you might as well
not<00:03:49.120> even<00:03:49.150> include<00:03:49.599> this<00:03:49.810> but<00:03:50.560> they<00:03:50.709> are

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
not even include this but they are

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.220

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
because you need somewhere for Gollum to

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.650 
because you need somewhere for Gollum to
hide<00:03:54.069> in<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:55.169> be<00:03:56.169> watching<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:57.480> things<00:03:58.480> that
