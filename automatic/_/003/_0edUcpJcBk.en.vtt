00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.140 
think we got that from everybody so it
gives<00:01:25.830> us<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> lot<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.189> momentum<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.850> think

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
gives us a lot of momentum and I think

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.640 
gives us a lot of momentum and I think
you<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> lot<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.810> people<00:01:28.200> individual

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
you know a lot of people individual

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
you know a lot of people individual
people<00:01:28.920> played<00:01:29.400> really<00:01:29.610> well<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.299> think

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
people played really well so I think

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.420 
people played really well so I think
everyone<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.560> think<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> next

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
everyone I think is going to the next

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.740 
everyone I think is going to the next
game<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> lot<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.000> confidence<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.659> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
game with a lot of confidence and I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.090 
game with a lot of confidence and I
think<00:01:33.780> that's<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> biggest<00:01:34.680> thing<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:34.979> you're

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
think that's the biggest thing if you're

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.499 
think that's the biggest thing if you're
confident<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.610> yourself<00:01:35.700> that's<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.390> we'll

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
confident in yourself that's it we'll

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.090 
confident in yourself that's it we'll
play<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:36.750> well<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.680> midst<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.979> it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
play really well and in the midst of it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.859 
play really well and in the midst of it

some more I think it's awesome and I'm

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.649 
some more I think it's awesome and I'm
I<00:02:09.619> think<00:02:10.099> he's<00:02:10.310> bad<00:02:10.519> it<00:02:10.700> was<00:02:10.939> how<00:02:11.180> was<00:02:11.390> today

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
I think he's bad it was how was today

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.119 
I think he's bad it was how was today
you<00:02:11.720> know<00:02:11.930> he<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.680> know<00:02:12.799> pretty<00:02:13.010> much

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129
