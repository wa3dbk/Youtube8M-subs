that reservoir it's all that water
that's<00:01:13.970> underground<00:01:14.390> how<00:01:14.689> much<00:01:14.869> what<00:01:15.590> size

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
that's underground how much what size

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.320 
that's underground how much what size
basically<00:01:16.040> putting<00:01:16.460> here<00:01:16.670> if<00:01:16.909> we<00:01:17.030> went<00:01:17.180> over

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
basically putting here if we went over

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.120 
basically putting here if we went over
just<00:01:17.360> six<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.140> seven<00:01:18.380> or<00:01:18.470> in<00:01:18.560> gallon<00:01:18.799> basin

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
just six to seven or in gallon basin

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.710 
just six to seven or in gallon basin
under<00:01:19.250> underground<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.180> you<00:01:20.240> only<00:01:20.420> see<00:01:20.600> in<00:01:20.659> a

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
under underground so you only see in a

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.420 
under underground so you only see in a
portion<00:01:21.049> of<00:01:21.140> water<00:01:21.350> yeah<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.040> it's<00:01:22.159> all<00:01:22.250> going

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
portion of water yeah so it's all going

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.830 
portion of water yeah so it's all going
underground<00:01:22.729> where<00:01:23.090> it's<00:01:23.210> shaded<00:01:23.420> where<00:01:23.720> it's

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
underground where it's shaded where it's

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.240 
underground where it's shaded where it's
cool<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.380> majority<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.100> water

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
cool the majority of the water

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.070 
cool the majority of the water
underground<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:25.939> that's<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.299> key<00:01:26.509> because<00:01:26.990> the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
underground and that's a key because the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.020 
underground and that's a key because the
fact<00:01:27.290> that<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.470> is<00:01:27.650> shade<00:01:27.890> gouge<00:01:28.400> is<00:01:28.670> not<00:01:28.820> going

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
fact that it is shade gouge is not going

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.609 
fact that it is shade gouge is not going
to<00:01:29.090> grow<00:01:29.270> how<00:01:29.630> many<00:01:29.780> aqua<00:01:29.960> blocks<00:01:30.259> are<00:01:30.380> used

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
to grow how many aqua blocks are used

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.100 
to grow how many aqua blocks are used
here<00:01:30.740> sixteen<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:32.299> about<00:01:32.450> five<00:01:32.689> hundred<00:01:32.990> in

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
here sixteen so about five hundred in

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.510 
here sixteen so about five hundred in
the<00:01:33.200> reservoir<00:01:33.680> you<00:01:33.860> know<00:01:33.979> plus<00:01:34.280> another

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
the reservoir you know plus another

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.190 
the reservoir you know plus another
hundred<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.210> know<00:01:35.360> just<00:01:35.600> rocks<00:01:35.840> around

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
hundred and you know just rocks around

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.840 
hundred and you know just rocks around
it<00:01:36.439> in<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.710> vault<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.310> things<00:01:37.610> like<00:01:37.700> that's

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
it in the vault and things like that's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.210 
it in the vault and things like that's
about<00:01:38.119> 600<00:01:38.390> total<00:01:38.840> gallons<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.799> one

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
about 600 total gallons and that one

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.429 
about 600 total gallons and that one
time<00:01:40.579> has<00:01:41.240> just<00:01:41.270> been<00:01:41.600> filled<00:01:41.960> there's<00:01:42.350> not

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
time has just been filled there's not

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.999 
time has just been filled there's not
one<00:01:42.619> time<00:01:42.829> that<00:01:43.579> that<00:01:44.270> is<00:01:44.600> awesome<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.439> to

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
one time that that is awesome and to

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.649 
one time that that is awesome and to
think<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.369> fact<00:01:46.579> that<00:01:46.670> this<00:01:46.850> was<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:47.060> built

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
think the fact that this was just built

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.120 
think the fact that this was just built
six<00:01:47.960> months<00:01:48.200> ago<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.619> it's<00:01:48.740> looking<00:01:48.979> this

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
six months ago and it's looking this

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.420 
six months ago and it's looking this
good

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
good

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.469 
good
yeah<00:01:49.700> I'm<00:01:49.820> it<00:01:49.909> looks<00:01:50.090> like<00:01:50.210> it's<00:01:50.329> been<00:01:50.420> there

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
yeah I'm it looks like it's been there

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.999 
yeah I'm it looks like it's been there
ten<00:01:50.720> years<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.259> that's<00:01:51.500> will<00:01:51.649> fit<00:01:51.829> to<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
ten years and that's will fit to the

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.260 
ten years and that's will fit to the
landscape<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.520> imagine<00:01:52.970> what<00:01:53.090> its<00:01:53.180> gonna

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
landscape and imagine what its gonna

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.910 
landscape and imagine what its gonna
look<00:01:53.390> like<00:01:53.509> a<00:01:53.659> year<00:01:53.899> from<00:01:53.930> now<00:01:54.110> let<00:01:54.439> alone<00:01:54.619> two

wow this is spectacular man so what what
size<00:01:59.360> pumps<00:01:59.719> are<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.840> ease<00:02:00.049> again<00:02:00.350> so<00:02:00.590> anyone

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
size pumps are the ease again so anyone

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.459 
size pumps are the ease again so anyone
with<00:02:00.979> two<00:02:01.460> aqua<00:02:01.790> surge<00:02:02.060> five<00:02:02.810> thousands<00:02:03.320> which

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
with two aqua surge five thousands which

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.780 
with two aqua surge five thousands which
are<00:02:03.619> one<00:02:03.740> of<00:02:03.829> my<00:02:03.920> favorite<00:02:04.250> pump<00:02:04.460> because

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
are one of my favorite pump because

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.910 
are one of my favorite pump because
their<00:02:04.939> energy<00:02:05.240> consumption<00:02:05.630> 360<00:02:06.560> watch<00:02:06.740> and

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
their energy consumption 360 watch and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.830 
their energy consumption 360 watch and
you<00:02:06.979> get<00:02:07.130> so<00:02:07.310> much<00:02:07.460> so<00:02:08.119> much<00:02:08.239> flow<00:02:08.540> for<00:02:08.810> that

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
you get so much so much flow for that

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.440 
you get so much so much flow for that
360<00:02:09.679> watts<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.100> unlike<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.640> sump<00:02:11.000> pump<00:02:11.060> it's

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
360 watts and unlike a sump pump it's

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.059 
360 watts and unlike a sump pump it's
made<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.690> go<00:02:11.900> all<00:02:12.110> they're<00:02:12.349> made<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.830> run<00:02:12.950> all

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
made to go all they're made to run all

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.949 
made to go all they're made to run all
the<00:02:13.190> time

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
the time

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.140 
the time
so<00:02:14.290> we're<00:02:14.409> using<00:02:14.560> two<00:02:14.769> five<00:02:15.010> thousands<00:02:15.579> down

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
so we're using two five thousands down

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.729 
so we're using two five thousands down
in<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.329> vault<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.900> we've<00:02:17.110> got<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.349> spillways

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
in the vault and we've got the spillways

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.280 
in the vault and we've got the spillways
up<00:02:17.920> above<00:02:18.159> two-inch<00:02:18.670> pipe<00:02:18.909> up<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.269> top<00:02:19.480> we

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
up above two-inch pipe up to the top we

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.250 
up above two-inch pipe up to the top we
used<00:02:20.439> about<00:02:20.590> 26<00:02:21.280> tons<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.760> rock<00:02:21.939> yeah<00:02:22.299> so<00:02:23.140> it's

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
used about 26 tons of rock yeah so it's

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.449 
used about 26 tons of rock yeah so it's
a<00:02:23.319> lot<00:02:23.439> of<00:02:23.470> rock<00:02:23.680> but<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.040> lot<00:02:24.159> of<00:02:24.280> big

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
pieces you know the fewer rocks you can

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.270 
pieces you know the fewer rocks you can
use<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.319> we're<00:02:26.409> now<00:02:26.530> just<00:02:26.739> gonna<00:02:26.890> look<00:02:27.010> well<00:02:27.220> I

and<00:02:55.599> each<00:02:55.720> one<00:02:55.930> holds<00:02:56.049> 32<00:02:56.799> gallons<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.519> water

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
and each one holds 32 gallons of water

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.729 
and each one holds 32 gallons of water
so<00:02:57.879> just<00:02:58.030> over<00:02:58.389> 500<00:02:58.930> ounces<00:02:59.019> total<00:02:59.290> in<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.620> off

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
so just over 500 ounces total in the off

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.229 
so just over 500 ounces total in the off
the<00:02:59.889> block<00:03:00.099> yeah<00:03:00.310> now<00:03:00.730> what<00:03:00.879> people<00:03:00.970> don't

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
the block yeah now what people don't

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.000 
the block yeah now what people don't
understand<00:03:01.689> is<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:02.109> would<00:03:02.319> hold<00:03:02.439> zero

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
understand is this would hold zero

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.580 
understand is this would hold zero
amount<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.670> water<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.540> how<00:03:04.659> does<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.870> work<00:03:04.989> well

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
amount of water so how does it work well

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.929 
amount of water so how does it work well
I<00:03:05.620> mean<00:03:05.829> it's<00:03:05.950> just<00:03:05.980> basically<00:03:06.549> a<00:03:06.670> shell

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
I mean it's just basically a shell

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.849 
I mean it's just basically a shell
that's<00:03:07.209> designed<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:08.319> take<00:03:08.439> the<00:03:08.590> weight<00:03:08.739> of

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
that's designed to take the weight of

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.080 
that's designed to take the weight of
the<00:03:08.920> rock<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:09.370> not<00:03:09.459> like<00:03:09.579> a<00:03:09.670> melt<00:03:09.909> gray

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
the rock so it's not like a melt gray

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.550 
the rock so it's not like a melt gray
that's<00:03:10.299> just<00:03:10.540> real<00:03:10.720> cleanser<00:03:11.049> this<00:03:11.170> can<00:03:11.379> take

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
that's just real cleanser this can take

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.740 
that's just real cleanser this can take
you<00:03:12.220> know<00:03:12.340> weight<00:03:12.609> and<00:03:12.970> rocks<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.510> people

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
you know weight and rocks and people

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.649 
you know weight and rocks and people
standing<00:03:14.049> on<00:03:14.139> it<00:03:14.290> people<00:03:14.439> driving<00:03:14.980> over<00:03:15.189> it<00:03:15.659> so

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
standing on it people driving over it so

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.900 
standing on it people driving over it so
it's<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.840> great<00:03:17.170> void<00:03:17.590> space<00:03:18.010> over<00:03:18.459> top<00:03:18.639> of<00:03:18.849> the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
it's a great void space over top of the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.210 
it's a great void space over top of the
liner<00:03:19.449> exactly<00:03:20.410> yeah<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:20.829> there's<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.069> void

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
liner exactly yeah so there's a void

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.280 
liner exactly yeah so there's a void
space<00:03:21.459> rather<00:03:21.699> than<00:03:21.849> using<00:03:22.120> heavy<00:03:22.389> gravel<00:03:22.870> you

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
space rather than using heavy gravel you

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.629 
space rather than using heavy gravel you
can<00:03:23.410> put<00:03:23.530> these<00:03:23.650> blocks<00:03:23.889> and<00:03:24.160> sitting<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.459> save

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
can put these blocks and sitting to save

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.640 
can put these blocks and sitting to save
time<00:03:24.910> save<00:03:25.510> money<00:03:25.569> and<00:03:26.319> you're<00:03:26.410> gonna<00:03:26.470> be<00:03:26.590> able

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
time save money and you're gonna be able

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.869 
time save money and you're gonna be able
to<00:03:26.799> hold<00:03:26.919> more<00:03:27.069> water<00:03:27.280> in<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.579> end

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
to hold more water in the end

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.879 
to hold more water in the end
yeah<00:03:28.120> aquabox<00:03:28.660> are<00:03:28.870> fantastic<00:03:29.379> now<00:03:29.500> here's<00:03:29.769> an

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
yeah aquabox are fantastic now here's an

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.089 
yeah aquabox are fantastic now here's an
actual<00:03:30.159> pump<00:03:31.120> vault<00:03:31.359> easy<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.709> this<00:03:32.859> works

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
actual pump vault easy so this works

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.800 
actual pump vault easy so this works
this<00:03:33.310> is<00:03:33.489> great<00:03:33.669> so<00:03:33.879> there's<00:03:34.239> two<00:03:34.419> pumps<00:03:34.690> in

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
this is great so there's two pumps in

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.180 
this is great so there's two pumps in
this<00:03:34.900> pond<00:03:35.139> there<00:03:35.379> is<00:03:35.470> more<00:03:35.680> than<00:03:35.919> enough<00:03:36.069> room

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
this pond there is more than enough room

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.830 
this pond there is more than enough room
for<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.430> two<00:03:36.579> pumps<00:03:36.849> to<00:03:36.940> fit<00:03:37.090> in<00:03:37.180> there<00:03:37.329> so

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
for the two pumps to fit in there so

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.479 
for the two pumps to fit in there so
they're<00:03:37.959> protected<00:03:38.500> with<00:03:38.650> all<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.280> rocks

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
they're protected with all the rocks

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.159 
they're protected with all the rocks
obviously<00:03:40.000> it's<00:03:40.090> disguised<00:03:40.540> into<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:40.989> water

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
obviously it's disguised into the water

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.360 
obviously it's disguised into the water
feature<00:03:41.530> show<00:03:41.739> us<00:03:41.859> what<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.099> looks<00:03:42.129> like

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
feature show us what it looks like

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.589 
feature show us what it looks like
actually<00:03:42.819> in<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.239> water

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
actually in the water

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.750 
actually in the water
sure<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.709> top<00:03:47.919> is<00:03:47.949> hidden<00:03:48.430> here<00:03:48.459> at<00:03:48.669> the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
sure so the top is hidden here at the

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.729 
sure so the top is hidden here at the
ball

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.500 

so<00:03:52.739> this<00:03:52.890> section<00:03:53.099> of<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.370> pump<00:03:53.879> bulk<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.269> is

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
so this section of the pump bulk is is

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.030 
so this section of the pump bulk is is
neat<00:03:54.750> comes<00:03:55.290> in<00:03:55.379> handy<00:03:55.500> just<00:03:55.739> for<00:03:55.890> checking

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
neat comes in handy just for checking

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.100 
neat comes in handy just for checking
the<00:03:56.280> water<00:03:56.370> level<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.030> vault<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.870> stick<00:03:58.080> a

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
the water level of the vault and stick a

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.390 
the water level of the vault and stick a
dipstick<00:03:58.500> down<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.830> measuring<00:03:59.190> tape

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
dipstick down that measuring tape

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.190 
dipstick down that measuring tape
without<00:04:00.150> having<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.540> take<00:04:00.629> the<00:04:00.780> whole<00:04:00.810> lid<00:04:01.080> off

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
without having to take the whole lid off

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.780 
without having to take the whole lid off
and<00:04:01.410> move<00:04:01.530> our<00:04:01.680> oxide<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.340> just<00:04:02.489> got<00:04:02.640> this

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
and move our oxide and just got this

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.880 
and move our oxide and just got this
little<00:04:03.290> little<00:04:04.290> hole<00:04:04.379> you<00:04:04.470> can<00:04:04.620> check<00:04:04.769> the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
little little hole you can check the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.589 
little little hole you can check the
water<00:04:05.040> level<00:04:05.129> with<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.239> pumps<00:04:06.480> are

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
water level with that so the pumps are

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.750 
water level with that so the pumps are
house<00:04:06.720> down<00:04:06.989> in<00:04:07.110> there<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.799> so<00:04:07.980> forth<00:04:08.400> is<00:04:08.549> very

it's well through the baffle system
yeah<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.790> baffle<00:04:39.120> system<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:40.050> then<00:04:40.139> spill<00:04:40.380> at

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
yeah the baffle system and then spill at

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.560 
yeah the baffle system and then spill at
the<00:04:40.590> 26<00:04:41.100> inch<00:04:41.669> spillway<00:04:42.120> you're<00:04:42.270> in<00:04:42.360> a<00:04:42.389> real
