00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 all good guys that orgasms that I am 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.080
 here with a new video of a new one 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.620
 series that I had set for myself 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.090
 at the end of fifa 14 I tell you in advance 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.269
 that if you hear me this voice a little 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.279
 nasal because I have a little cold a little 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.310
 I'm not good I saw these changes of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.170
 atrocious temperature that they are being 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.420
 checking in these last days 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.590
 therefore I propose this seat in you 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.759
 called top five bronze top five bronze 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.410
 player that will have so where it will be divided into 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.000
 three episodes where I will talk about 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.239
 bronze players and then the other two 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.219
 silver and silver players is a series 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.320
 where I show you those who were i 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.180
 top level players 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.120
 precisely what I treat 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.260
 after all after months and months spent at 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.840
 play this game 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.120
 so i hope this this 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.800
 small series is very very short there 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.329
 may in this case please 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.039
 immediately to write it in the comments to 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.780
 I still like to leave a lot 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.960
 let's talk about five players right away 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.080
 bronze we are talking about today is the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.880
 first player surely or para ike 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.860
 opara central defender who 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.750
 I loved using it 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.960
 I think it's the bronze player 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.610
 central bronze defender better than 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.159
 play because he is a player who knows 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.530
 practically everything has excellent speed 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.329
 absurd speed for a defender 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.310
 central with 86 to 64 defense then 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.340
 very good considering a 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.850
 bronze player is also a 74 hit 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.020
 of head 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.820
 more specifically, it is 188 high 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.390
 in itself quite high as a player 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.000
 more 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.979
 93 jump this means that of 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.759
 head takes them all doesn't miss either 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.460
 one I think is a great player 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.470
 now the price has risen a lot though 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.390
 anyway if at the beginning maybe anyway 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.729
 a couple of months ago he was also a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.680
 something less now turns around 15,000 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.649
 credits however holds true from the first 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.590
 at the last I recommend it 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:10.950
 a thing that perhaps to be improved though 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.390
 oh well it is the physical strength he at 74 of 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.090
 physical strength if he had 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.310
 80 would be impassable would be one thing 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.100
 absurd this player where we will see 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.590
 then next year how will we go 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.310
 with the fourth player who is me 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.780
 liked the most 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.110
 it is bright dyck too of the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.970
 mls 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.610
 let's talk about this giant guy 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.500
 Nigerian with 72 speeds than of per 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.420
 itself is a fairly low value then 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.260
 for a striker their very attacker 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.940
 physical and I liked it a lot though both in 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.820
 attack one that in attack 2 dir 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.610
 truth because it is not very fast but has a 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.850
 absolutely powerful shot with 83 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.620
 of power I pull however on the 60 or more 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.410
 on paper for a bronze it really is 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.560
 very good and is also very good 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.170
 of head does not have a very high jump and not 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.269
 it's not even absolutely extremely 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.880
 very high is 185 anyway a good one 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.500
 height however to the 91 of physical strength that 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.700
 allows him to push any 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.950
 opponent 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.570
 everywhere and always arrive first 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.760
 on balloons and this is the greatest 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.410
 what for him in addition to 62 of 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.120
 finalization which is quite good 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.560
 for a player he is a player 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.120
 obviously that you can't put yourself at 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.360
 do dribbling etc. and so on 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.000
 because then to a ball check not 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.269
 absolute not extremely good though 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.530
 however it is for the type of game therefore 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.989
 of physical strength 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.940
 he is perfect in addition to five stars 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.640
 weak foot and then pulled is different 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.450
 that of left much very often the 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.030
 goals 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.610
 let's go with the third player this is 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.250
 by mitchell duke miceli duke is a 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.380
 player that many do not know 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.299
 because I've really seen it a few times 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.060
 use this player but it is a 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:00.180
 absurd attacker has excellent speed 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.010
 with 84 a good acceleration a good one 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.030
 agility that is not always found in 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.720
 61 strikers for shooting which therefore as I have 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.239
 said before with 60 or more it's great has one 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.060
 absurd finalization with 68 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.380
 consider that it is a bronze and a 61 of 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.870
 finalization is a statistic 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.080
 quite high so very very good 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.870
 it doesn't have a great shooting power though if 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.940
 do the throws anyway 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.290
 inside the area any kind of shot 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.770
 enter because of his 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.810
 achievement has a good jump 79 is a 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.639
 82 is not very high, however, with his head 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.220
 however the goals make them also thanks to 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.110
 his physical strength which is 80 is therefore a 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.440
 good player the only bad thing is 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.880
 that two skill two star skills e 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.280
 so it's not the best so not 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.580
 you can do the skills with him but you 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.130
 I assure you that it is a real area bomber 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.949
 rigor to define it at its best is true 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.250
 the second area striker 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:01.400
 player this is wesley wesley is 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.789
 a Brazilian striker who plays in the 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.710
 Korea League is a player who if not 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.210
 have you tried I suggest you try it 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.970
 both in attack one and in attack to two 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.070
 because really absurd it is very fast and 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.020
 indeed speed and its statistics 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.440
 absolutely better with the 90's 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.680
 shutter acceleration 92 does not have one 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.240
 good agility with 78 and above is 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.470
 also very strong in his head anyway 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.110
 it is not very high 179 but with strength 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.169
 physics and jump 87 takes them 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.599
 practically all its finalization 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.520
 so let's talk about shooting at 55 on 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.560
 card that is a fairly discreet shot 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.720
 but it does not have great qualities we say power 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.599
 long shot shot but no finalization either 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.580
 of 50 but I do not know why i 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.800
 his shots are excellent I don't know for which 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.990
 reason though his team are very good 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.849
 only bad thing about this player 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.849
 it's his 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.099
 it is weak where two stars skill two 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.560
 weak foot stars excuse him now 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.870
 so I don't advise you not to 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.479
 I advise you to play with or to play 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.000
 however with the left but we go with the 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.910
 player number one first in this 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.580
 ranking and we're talking about football 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.560
 which is the player in my opinion and 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.070
 bronze stronger than this game then 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.800
 obviously things are subjective 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.780
 soccer is an absurd player 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.919
 last year I used it as a coc 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.440
 because it was there it seems its role 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.229
 originally this year they put it 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.719
 striker is absolutely a player 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:36.030
 formidable with a speed 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:38.550
 extremely high with 90 90d ecl 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.670
 a great agility, a great shot 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.520
 nice physical strength with 77 war kate 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.890
 perfect with the top down to four stars 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.990
 skill a great shot don't mind that 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.840
 53 seems much much more 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.450
 also the finalization 51 but it seems 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.070
 much more I assure you it is a 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.900
 absurd player even with four 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.480
 star skill you have a casino fun a 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.400
 pull out and score goals because I assure you 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.070
 which is a player who also marks a 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.600
 70 of aggressiveness and therefore means 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.250
 that every time you lose the ball o 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.720
 however it is nearby 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.580
 of the opponent with the ball he 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.460
 attack to steal it and this is one 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.840
 very important because if there was a 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.860
 defender at the door he gave it to her 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.080
 steal try to score 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.490
 anyway these guys are mine 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.220
 five players in I invite you to 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.410
 write to you in the comments to write me in 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.060
 comments which players are you 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.850
 obviously prefer bronze ones then 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.930
 we will treat the silver and the ol 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.960
 student me your players 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.970
 favorite bronze so I will try them 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.420
 if you like this video when I finish 

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:43.800
 the silver and the gold will do another run 

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:46.680
 of another the other top five bronze then 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.200
 also silver and gold before beginning fifa 

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.670
 15 if you like it enough that it is 

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.630
 scripts and comments with others 

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.880
 players obviously 

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.890
 so guys, I hope the video for this 

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.110
 I enjoyed it as usual at milito 

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.980
 his name I like 300 I like will come out a 

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.360
 new video 

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.580
 thank you for listening to me too 

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.080
 this nasal voice but I can't do it 

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.960
 nothing I didn't want to leave the canal 

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.760
 without videos subscribed to the page channel 

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.320
 facebook twitter in the festival all the links 

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:14.090
