00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello now hears fears that access to the game 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.149
 the minustah in the regional park des vosges du nord I want 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.630
 to meet christine spotlight who created a material 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.629
 apathetic 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.930
 fully play in the secondary and even with Iran after this 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.580
 question two years ago you made a real life change 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.580
 with this dental protest 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.490
 today 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.680
 you take care of the production and processing 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.800
 the medicinal plant edgar in attic 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920
 Why such a change 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.510
 because it's a passion 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.350
 punctuated by lectures are a passion for me but I would always 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.200
 grown at parties 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.930
 mistake and changed his mind because it had to be m 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.839
 finally came out of my lab to that m where I feel best actually 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.949
 it was outside outside agriculture in nature 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.949
 our production and not in conversion 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.530
 biological who burned 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.570
 what does it mean what does it want to give 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.570
 this is the case for the specifications launched on organic farming 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.860
 I started in 2007 with all the plants in place 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.100
 so I had three kids converting to party 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.190
 it's a security% level of tourcoing land 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 for the plants are really 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.430
 devoid of chemical flames and both tests here so come 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.640
 argue rock a chemical fertilizer no pesticide has no shading at all 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.640
 South student alone since it's aromatic plants it's all 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.830
 plants that grow spontaneously is based on very poor land so 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.420
 we will not add we do not need to add to the fact in beautiful things 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.480
 like that 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.509
 the work of the earth essilor she settles the most important 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.430
 of course 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.299
 the break has a little more with the iphone 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.090
 then prepare to do it better 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.020
 and if it happens to me the biggest job actually is weeding 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.349
 that is to say of Palestine and culture passing by invade what 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.950
 and to impregnate a pre-contract more well with the rest so the same 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.770
 value that the finality she is lucky is to reap donations 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.050
 implanted in good conditions ie among them no time to 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.369
 rain always full sun well 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.929
 we also respect there is a percent and light calendar 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:26.139
 she paid a part of the euro plants that we go to the dryer our 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.069
 accounts and aromatic herbal teas something like that for cooking 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.169
 in all that is things that are dried 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.279
 then we have a part that we use to make syrups or not 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.499
 we will use the fresh plant 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.989
 we can find all your products then in a market that you have created and 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.159
 the wilanow coping 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.159
 in all the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.400
 it worked 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.689
 laminated cccp to market products 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.499
 10% closer to home 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:55.499
 already 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.169
 in a club like I do a lot of the markets 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.869
 we proposed on the commune of life do not even have it even further we created 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:03.319
 a sluggish market says 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.169
 nor exhibitors so we have a part in video and part of the hours 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.369
 conventional m 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:13.569
 a local shop attacked with high quality products here 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.999
 kristina frye but I beg you by damas bernanke theater for the
