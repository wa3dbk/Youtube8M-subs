you<00:02:08.510> can<00:02:08.660> put<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:09.020> car<00:02:09.290> anywhere<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.310> want

it on this handling track we turn it
hard<00:02:13.400> enough<00:02:13.640> you'll<00:02:14.030> go<00:02:14.330> into<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.570> drift<00:02:14.960> but

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
hard enough you'll go into a drift but

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.750 
hard enough you'll go into a drift but
because<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.830> cars<00:02:16.010> front-wheel<00:02:16.370> drive<00:02:16.400> you

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
because the cars front-wheel drive you

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.130 
because the cars front-wheel drive you

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
can just keep your steering angle set

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.650 
can just keep your steering angle set
and<00:02:18.620> balance<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.340> throttle<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.360> keeps

spinning if you're too aggressive it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.390

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.300 

you<00:03:10.740> don't<00:03:10.890> think<00:03:11.040> much<00:03:11.280> about

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
you don't think much about

countersteering a front-wheel drive car
this<00:03:13.920> makes<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.280> consider<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.730> sometimes

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.160 

so<00:03:28.909> the<00:03:29.030> first<00:03:29.299> thing<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:29.599> notice<00:03:29.900> about<00:03:29.959> the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
so the first thing you notice about the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.710 
so the first thing you notice about the
Focus<00:03:30.500> ST<00:03:30.620> on<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.099> road<00:03:31.310> is<00:03:31.549> one<00:03:31.879> it<00:03:32.120> sounds

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
Focus ST on the road is one it sounds

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.460 
Focus ST on the road is one it sounds

inside<00:03:34.689> the<00:03:35.689> second<00:03:36.140> thing<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.379> notice<00:03:36.739> is

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
inside the second thing you notice is

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.759 
inside the second thing you notice is
torque<00:03:37.849> steer<00:03:38.150> it's<00:03:38.480> especially<00:03:39.110> apparent<00:03:39.409> in

the lower gears first and second
particularly<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.920> it's<00:03:43.430> kind<00:03:43.819> of<00:03:43.909> funny

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
particularly and it's kind of funny

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.699 
particularly and it's kind of funny
they've<00:03:44.629> done<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.870> lot<00:03:44.930> of<00:03:45.200> work<00:03:45.349> to<00:03:45.500> try<00:03:45.680> to

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
they've done a lot of work to try to

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.190 
they've done a lot of work to try to
quell<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:46.099> torque<00:03:46.579> steer<00:03:46.879> with<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.900> brakes

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
quell the torque steer with the brakes

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.140 
quell the torque steer with the brakes
with<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.129> steering<00:03:49.370> system<00:03:49.760> which<00:03:49.879> I'll<00:03:50.000> come

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
with the steering system which I'll come

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.390 
with the steering system which I'll come
back<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.329> in<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.569> second<00:03:50.959> but<00:03:51.470> it's<00:03:51.709> still<00:03:52.069> there

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
back to in a second but it's still there

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.130 
back to in a second but it's still there
it's<00:03:52.849> such<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.359> it'll<00:03:53.569> actually<00:03:53.599> turn<00:03:53.959> the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
it's such that it'll actually turn the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.839 
it's such that it'll actually turn the
car<00:03:54.349> to<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.500> right<00:03:54.560> pretty<00:03:54.980> aggressively<00:03:55.549> if

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
car to the right pretty aggressively if

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.460 
car to the right pretty aggressively if
you're<00:03:56.269> not<00:03:56.390> careful<00:03:56.629> with<00:03:56.930> your<00:03:57.049> throttle

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
you're not careful with your throttle

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.490 
you're not careful with your throttle
now<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:58.579> think<00:03:59.090> that's<00:03:59.359> okay<00:03:59.840> because<00:04:00.109> when<00:04:00.440> you

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
now I think that's okay because when you

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.319 
now I think that's okay because when you
have<00:04:00.680> two<00:04:00.950> hundred<00:04:01.129> and<00:04:01.340> seventy<00:04:01.819> pound<00:04:02.060> feet

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
have two hundred and seventy pound feet

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.210 
have two hundred and seventy pound feet
of<00:04:02.390> torque<00:04:02.450> driving<00:04:03.049> the<00:04:03.109> front<00:04:03.319> tires<00:04:03.560> you

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
of torque driving the front tires you

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.550 
of torque driving the front tires you
probably<00:04:04.519> should<00:04:04.730> know<00:04:04.849> that's<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.269> case

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
probably should know that's the case

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.809 
probably should know that's the case
fortunately<00:04:06.560> when<00:04:06.859> you're<00:04:06.980> in<00:04:07.099> third<00:04:07.340> gear<00:04:07.670> or

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
fortunately when you're in third gear or

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.879 
fortunately when you're in third gear or
so<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.239> you're<00:04:08.329> charging<00:04:08.510> hard<00:04:08.930> it's<00:04:09.739> not

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
so and you're charging hard it's not

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.180 
so and you're charging hard it's not
that<00:04:10.069> big<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.280> an<00:04:10.459> issue<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:12.560> work<00:04:12.799> we've<00:04:13.159> done

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
that big of an issue the work we've done

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.020 
that big of an issue the work we've done
though<00:04:13.790> on<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.720> steering<00:04:15.019> system<00:04:15.500> which<00:04:15.739> is

though on the steering system which is
electronically<00:04:17.030> assisted<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.109> think<00:04:18.979> what

electronically assisted I think what

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.560 
electronically assisted I think what
they've<00:04:19.579> done<00:04:19.729> to<00:04:19.789> try<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.060> get<00:04:20.239> rid<00:04:20.269> of<00:04:20.510> the

they've done to try to get rid of the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
torque steer might have also taken a bit

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.659 
torque steer might have also taken a bit

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
of a feel out of the wheel itself that's

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.760 
of a feel out of the wheel itself that's
not<00:04:25.820> to<00:04:25.910> say<00:04:26.150> this<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:26.389> a<00:04:26.510> bad<00:04:26.810> steering<00:04:27.350> system

not to say this is a bad steering system

we<00:04:33.349> talked<00:04:33.620> about<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.949> steering<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.460> what

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
we talked about the steering and what

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.580 
we talked about the steering and what
it's<00:04:34.729> doing<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.210> help<00:04:35.720> get<00:04:36.110> rid<00:04:36.139> of<00:04:36.289> torque

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
it's doing to help get rid of torque

aggressive you can lift off this car and
it'll<00:04:55.880> actually<00:04:56.000> do<00:04:56.720> a<00:04:56.750> little<00:04:56.930> bit<00:04:57.110> of<00:04:57.229> yaw

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
it'll actually do a little bit of yaw

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.020 
it'll actually do a little bit of yaw
that<00:04:57.770> helps<00:04:58.039> you<00:04:58.130> turn<00:04:58.370> in<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.729> change<00:04:58.970> your

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
of feel through this steering wheel it's

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.610 
of feel through this steering wheel it's
still<00:05:08.510> nice<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:08.720> throw<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.080> car<00:05:09.289> around<00:05:09.470> and
