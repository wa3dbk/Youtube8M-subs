since<00:00:23.100> then<00:00:23.279> I've<00:00:23.519> done<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.090> 7<00:00:24.630> update<00:00:24.900> and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
since then I've done the 7 update and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.130 
since then I've done the 7 update and
the<00:00:25.980> 8<00:00:26.250> without<00:00:26.699> wiping<00:00:27.029> everything<00:00:27.750> is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
the 8 without wiping everything is

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.939 
the 8 without wiping everything is
running<00:00:28.380> fine<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.580> far<00:00:30.619> one<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> major

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
running fine so far one of the major

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.569 
running fine so far one of the major
things<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.820> noticed<00:00:33.380> going<00:00:34.380> from<00:00:34.620> six<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.160> seven

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
things I noticed going from six to seven

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.260 
things I noticed going from six to seven
was<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.540> changed<00:00:37.410> status<00:00:38.219> bar<00:00:38.640> here<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.090> got

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
was the changed status bar here you got

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.479 
was the changed status bar here you got
all<00:00:39.420> these<00:00:40.100> different<00:00:41.480> toggles<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:43.399> think<00:00:44.399> they

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
all these different toggles I think they

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.119 
all these different toggles I think they
were<00:00:44.550> aligned<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.360> different<00:00:45.750> manner<00:00:45.870> than

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
were aligned in a different manner than

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.740 
were aligned in a different manner than
six<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.610> really<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.719> I

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
six was I really like this right here I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.889 
six was I really like this right here I
mean<00:00:48.899> pretty<00:00:49.289> much<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.860> access<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.899> just

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
mean pretty much you have access to just

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.500 
mean pretty much you have access to just
about<00:00:52.309> everything<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> device<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.059> can

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
about everything in the device that can

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.810 
about everything in the device that can
be<00:00:54.660> toggled<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.320> seems<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.699> also

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
be toggled it seems like you can also

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.160 
be toggled it seems like you can also
control<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> brightness<00:00:57.960> right<00:00:58.829> there

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
control the brightness right there

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.619 
control the brightness right there

including auto also has the brightness
up<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:05.129> timeout<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.510> be<00:01:06.630> set<00:01:07.460> just

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
up there and the timeout can be set just

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.440 
up there and the timeout can be set just
by<00:01:08.670> tapping<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:10.460> know<00:01:11.460> when<00:01:11.700> I'm<00:01:11.790> laying
