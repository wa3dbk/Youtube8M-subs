because there's no one that I'm in love

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.380 
because there's no one that I'm in love
with<00:01:41.140> it's<00:01:41.979> called<00:01:42.280> making<00:01:42.670> love<00:01:42.940> isn't<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.330> I

with it's called making love isn't it I

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.690

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
maybe I'm old-fashioned but I I think

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.430 
maybe I'm old-fashioned but I I think
that<00:01:46.270> means<00:01:46.479> that<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:46.810> do<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.080> with<00:01:47.259> someone

that means that you do it with someone

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.609 
that means that you do it with someone
you<00:01:47.530> love<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.750> preferably<00:01:50.229> when<00:01:50.470> you're

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
you love and preferably when you're
