00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.480
 héloïse friends I propose you today 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.780
 to draw this boat hn1 video games from 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.570
 nintendo for this drawing i need to 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.150
 manga paper drives a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.150
 blood clot eventually an eraser 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.240
 precision liner 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.369
 sizes of some spades to the color of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.890
 colored pencils and finally a roller 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.250
 dear I begin by schematizing the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.590
 face by a circle then I go along and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.870
 I detail the risk little by little 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.149
 so this is a series of pico drawings 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.040
 tenders most constructions 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.350
 will be pretty much always the same thing 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.410
 I 'll let you watch the videos for 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.690
 see the nuances there are between 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.120
 different designs in this design 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.850
 I use imports brand min shaker 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.500
 Japanese mono if you're interested 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.010
 we made a presentation on this 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.649
 produced then this platoon is a game of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.140
 nintendo on wii ue coming out today 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.960
 even the principle of the game is very simple 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.390
 there are two teams are a field 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.740
 the goal is to paint the ground to 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.689
 colors of his team 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.280
 the winning team will be the one who will have 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.100
 by the maximum of surface 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.840
 each team can have weapons having 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.210
 different characteristics 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.610
 we can slow down his opponent 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.159
 sprinkling it with pastures and then a 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.020
 moment it'll bring him back to the beginning of his 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.150
 area of ​​play and what makes it that will have to 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.780
 cross all the late to repaint of 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.369
 new surfaces 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.740
 it's a game with a grip 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.990
 immediate a strategic depth and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.360
 as fabulous it's a game that is played 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.490
 endless it's really fun inimits 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.770
 it's probably the game that transforms 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.950
 the wiiu as the console it takes 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.170
 to have 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.850
 this game will probably be a cardboard on 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.649
 should probably see it in the 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.240
 shows and it will be a bit like the just 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.030
 dance an attraction a little 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.130
 must-have once the fake that 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.340
 ends and I attack I rawline 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.350
 use the neo picot line 3 it's a 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.520
 Japanese liner that has a lot of 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.159
 cut 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.360
 I start with the frame with the line up 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.610
 the biggest 2.0 then I realize the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.869
 line of the character with a liner of 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.269
 straw 0.5 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.140
 it's not the finest liner that 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:20.140
 exist there are even more liners 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.209
 purposes like the 0.03 so I chose 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.950
 euro5 because I found that 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.349
 braids see a lot better about 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.250
 videos or play to order the size 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.410
 0 2 where size 0 3 if you are new to 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.150
 otherwise if you have more means the top 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.950
 it's still having a set of 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.660
 several sizes of liner is 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.880
 always useful 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.549
 once the finished line I erase thanks 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.430
 to a bulk range I advise you to 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.670
 faber castell's free gum or the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.139
 japanese range mono the mask of the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.139
 character is black 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:57.790
 I do not use felted to color it 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:03:00.459
 but a liner like that at the black level 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.350
 it will be the same black level of the outline 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.569
 and the mask there will be no 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.410
 contrasts different since it's 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.970
 the same 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.420
 I follow the new colorization 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.270
 two colors then it is a Japanese felt 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.490
 with a brush tip in fine po 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.780
 it's a felt pen that I really like 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.320
 because it's a little too much that does not have the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.990
 big mi bevels let's be honest is 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.800
 not often used separately in 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.870
 highly experienced designers for the 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.540
 most have used it quite seldom 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.240
 the fine tip is very useful for 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.190
 details and the brush tip is more 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.840
 for supermarkets and make 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.830
 effects we also made a presentation 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.540
 of this product if you're interested 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.790
 click on this framework the coalization of 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.620
 this drawing is pretty basic 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.270
 the game design is very simple 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.060
 Besides, it's really a success 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.520
 I find that the visual impact is very 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.320
 strong the idea of squid is really very 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.290
 interesting and it sticks pile hair with 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.670
 the gameplay in any case the coffee team this 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.980
 game must be pretty proud of their 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.720
 work then usually I you 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.580
 advise to take paper the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.320
 height for felt work in 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.420
 may for this series of drawings at 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.520
 level that colors I will use the 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.220
 director monga paper so that's 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.060
 advantages and disadvantages 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.280
 I will start with the disadvantages 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.799
 so this is a type of paper that drinks 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.830
 a little more than paper the arc aw 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.169
 So if you want to use 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.670
 your longer and better 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.160
 return to the laird 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.300
 otherwise it also benefits gold on the 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.920
 awt paper we have to do the 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.440
 contours last because otherwise it 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.090
 mavs and this is not the case of this paper 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.550
 that you can do the outlines 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.140
 first of all, that's what we do 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.630
 and polo after what is still 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.070
 much more practical and natural 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.260
 for beginners 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.220
 keep in mind that in this video 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.160
 we use deleter paper given to 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.100
 pics online 3 and lne and pimples 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.160
 color in this configuration the 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.380
 black contours do not drool if you 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.020
 take other products it's other 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.920
 conditions and so at the level of the rendering that 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.290
 will not be the same 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.600
 will have to test whether the colors mavs or 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.970
 not once the colors place and 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.160
 I add shades to the created in colors 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.900
 there's only the white pencil that should be 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.310
 rather dagger mozart or otherwise you 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.010
 can also take a pencil document 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.850
 white I finalize the drawing with 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.590
 light touches gold their chains 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.840
 thank you for watching this video until 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.250

 the moment the count seat tvh landes

 meanwhile drawn well
