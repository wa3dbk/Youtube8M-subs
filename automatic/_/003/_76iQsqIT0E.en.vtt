what we have here is a plywood it's
specifically<00:00:30.310> engineered<00:00:30.640> to<00:00:31.030> bend<00:00:31.330> when

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
specifically engineered to bend when

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.720 
specifically engineered to bend when
they<00:00:32.080> put<00:00:32.290> all<00:00:32.470> these<00:00:32.619> laminate<00:00:33.250> pieces

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
they put all these laminate pieces

they put all these laminate pieces
together<00:00:33.910> a<00:00:34.390> they<00:00:35.020> put<00:00:35.230> all<00:00:35.410> the<00:00:35.590> wood<00:00:35.800> grain

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
together a they put all the wood grain

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.250 
together a they put all the wood grain
in<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.460> same<00:00:36.670> direction<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.480> be<00:00:38.050> they

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
in the same direction and be they

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.440 
in the same direction and be they
installed<00:00:38.680> what<00:00:38.890> looks<00:00:39.130> like<00:00:39.220> a<00:00:39.400> fiber<00:00:40.030> wood

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450

spots where I just can't come up with
another<00:01:11.860> material<00:01:12.250> that'll<00:01:12.670> give<00:01:12.880> me<00:01:12.909> a<00:01:13.030> nice

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
another material that'll give me a nice

another material that'll give me a nice
uniform<00:01:13.810> nailing<00:01:14.470> surface<00:01:14.950> this<00:01:15.790> is<00:01:15.970> the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
uniform nailing surface this is the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.390 
uniform nailing surface this is the
stuff<00:01:16.330> I<00:01:16.510> always<00:01:16.840> go<00:01:17.020> with<00:01:17.049> it's<00:01:17.830> probably

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
stuff I always go with it's probably

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.250 
stuff I always go with it's probably
three<00:01:18.760> times<00:01:19.030> more<00:01:19.330> expensive<00:01:19.540> than<00:01:19.960> your

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
three times more expensive than your

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.920 
three times more expensive than your
typical<00:01:20.470> half-inch<00:01:21.220> plywood<00:01:21.520> but<00:01:22.479> it's<00:01:22.690> worth

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
typical half-inch plywood but it's worth

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.630 
typical half-inch plywood but it's worth
every<00:01:23.260> penny<00:01:23.290> in<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:23.890> in<00:01:24.010> the<00:01:24.100> amount<00:01:24.340> of<00:01:24.460> time

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
every penny in it in the amount of time

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.969 
every penny in it in the amount of time
you<00:01:24.820> save<00:01:25.060> this<00:01:25.570> plywood<00:01:25.900> can<00:01:26.200> be<00:01:26.350> ordered<00:01:26.740> so

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
you save this plywood can be ordered so

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.710 
you save this plywood can be ordered so
that<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.250> bends<00:01:27.520> in<00:01:27.729> either<00:01:27.909> direction<00:01:28.330> either

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
that it bends in either direction either

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.390 
that it bends in either direction either
you<00:01:29.110> can<00:01:29.260> order<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.650> so<00:01:29.800> it<00:01:30.010> bends<00:01:30.190> the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
you can order it so it bends the

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.340 
you can order it so it bends the
forefoot<00:01:30.880> direction<00:01:31.450> or<00:01:31.840> if<00:01:31.990> you<00:01:32.140> have<00:01:32.320> a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
forefoot direction or if you have a

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.320 
forefoot direction or if you have a
large<00:01:32.620> barrel<00:01:33.100> ceiling<00:01:33.700> or<00:01:33.850> something<00:01:33.880> that

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
large barrel ceiling or something that

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.760 
large barrel ceiling or something that
you're<00:01:34.450> building<00:01:34.660> you<00:01:34.960> can<00:01:35.110> order<00:01:35.410> it<00:01:35.470> so<00:01:35.620> that

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
you're building you can order it so that

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.620 
you're building you can order it so that
it<00:01:36.130> bends<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.610> eight-foot<00:01:37.030> direction<00:01:37.510> it

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
it bends the eight-foot direction it

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.150 
it bends the eight-foot direction it
can't<00:01:37.840> bend<00:01:38.080> both<00:01:38.320> if<00:01:38.620> you<00:01:38.710> want<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:38.950> hang<00:01:39.100> a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
can't bend both if you want to hang a

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.860 
can't bend both if you want to hang a
potato<00:01:39.490> chip<00:01:39.580> you're<00:01:40.300> gonna<00:01:40.420> have<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.720> get

potato chip you're gonna have to get

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.870 
potato chip you're gonna have to get
something<00:01:41.230> else<00:01:41.350> but<00:01:42.130> this<00:01:42.340> will<00:01:42.490> really<00:01:42.520> help

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
something else but this will really help

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.670 
something else but this will really help
you<00:01:43.210> out<00:01:43.240> in<00:01:43.540> those<00:01:43.660> situations<00:01:44.380> where<00:01:44.560> you

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
you out in those situations where you
