it reminds me a lot of Leeds United it's

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.600 
it reminds me a lot of Leeds United it's
capable<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.420> giving<00:04:06.600> everybody<00:04:07.020> a<00:04:07.260> game

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
because it's a surprisingly good

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.990 
because it's a surprisingly good
all-rounder<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:11.610> good<00:04:11.790> news<00:04:11.970> for

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
all-rounder and the good news for

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.420 
all-rounder and the good news for
Citroen<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:13.290> doesn't<00:04:13.770> have<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.100> win<00:04:14.220> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
Citroen is it doesn't have to win the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.290 
Citroen is it doesn't have to win the
championship

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
championship

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.199 
championship
it<00:04:15.690> just<00:04:16.019> has<00:04:16.200> to<00:04:16.230> compete<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:17.730> I<00:04:17.910> think<00:04:18.120> it

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
it just has to compete and I think it

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.830 
it just has to compete and I think it
will

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.840 

so<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.019> c5<00:04:22.500> needs<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.950> combine<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.460> comfort

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
so the c5 needs to combine the comfort

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.730 
so the c5 needs to combine the comfort
and<00:04:24.030> refinement<00:04:24.600> of<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.750> saloon<00:04:25.080> car<00:04:25.380> with<00:04:25.650> the
