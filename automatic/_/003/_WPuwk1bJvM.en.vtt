well this house is over 20 years old and
as<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.820> see<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.329> concrete<00:00:42.570> has<00:00:43.079> been

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
as you can see the concrete has been

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.770 
as you can see the concrete has been
exposed<00:00:44.100> they<00:00:44.399> remove<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> flooring<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
exposed they remove the flooring and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.209 
exposed they remove the flooring and
we're<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.079> that's<00:00:46.320> right<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.010> pretty

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
we're out that's right and it's pretty

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.240 
we're out that's right and it's pretty
ugly<00:00:47.399> right<00:00:47.989> but<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.140> us<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> blank

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
ugly right but to us it's like a blank

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.850 
ugly right but to us it's like a blank
canvas<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> painter<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.770> do

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
canvas to a painter and so we can do

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.860 
canvas to a painter and so we can do
lots<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.370> different<00:00:53.670> things<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.329> more<00:00:54.690> than

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
lots of different things for more than

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.600 
lots of different things for more than
most<00:00:55.079> people<00:00:55.410> could<00:00:55.500> even<00:00:55.620> imagine<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.460> that

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
most people could even imagine or that

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.010 
most people could even imagine or that
they<00:00:56.699> could<00:00:56.850> actually<00:00:57.000> finish<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> concrete

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
they could actually finish the concrete

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.060 
they could actually finish the concrete
right<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.500> what<00:00:58.649> are<00:00:58.739> some<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
right so what are some of the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.410 
right so what are some of the
possibilities<00:00:59.489> because<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.300> me

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
possibilities because you know for me

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.910 
possibilities because you know for me
like<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.870> would<00:01:01.020> probably<00:01:01.109> maybe<00:01:01.469> throw<00:01:01.739> down<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
like I would probably maybe throw down a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.470 
like I would probably maybe throw down a
rug<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.370> carpet<00:01:02.430> or<00:01:02.910> something<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.270> that

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
rug or carpet or something like that

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.679 
rug or carpet or something like that
right<00:01:03.690> well<00:01:04.580> what's<00:01:05.580> your<00:01:05.640> imagination<00:01:06.420> yeah

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
right well what's your imagination yeah

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.240 
right well what's your imagination yeah
because<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:07.979> pause

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
because what we can do is we can pause

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.460 
because what we can do is we can pause
the<00:01:08.490> cream<00:01:08.820> that's<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> surface<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:10.380> can

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the cream that's on the surface we can

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.899 
the cream that's on the surface we can
actually<00:01:10.740> start<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:10.979> cut<00:01:11.220> into<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> concrete

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
actually start to cut into the concrete

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.090 
actually start to cut into the concrete
to<00:01:12.090> expose<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> aggregate<00:01:13.110> now<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:13.950> even

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
to expose the aggregate now we can even

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.280 
to expose the aggregate now we can even
color<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> concrete<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:15.659> add<00:01:15.780> images

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
color the concrete and we can add images

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.859 
color the concrete and we can add images
into<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.619> concrete<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> few<00:01:17.280> items<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.759> wait<00:01:18.509> so

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.409 
have high tech epoxies to help us deal
with<00:04:35.290> these<00:04:35.560> things<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.130> what<00:04:36.820> they<00:04:36.940> do<00:04:37.000> is

when<00:04:37.540> we<00:04:37.720> mix<00:04:37.930> that<00:04:38.050> epoxy<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.740> cures<00:04:38.979> very

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
when we mix that epoxy and it cures very

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.580 
when we mix that epoxy and it cures very
quickly<00:04:39.669> but<00:04:40.360> we<00:04:40.479> use<00:04:40.630> some<00:04:40.870> of<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.050> dust<00:04:41.290> that

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
quickly but we use some of the dust that

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.680 
quickly but we use some of the dust that
we'll<00:04:41.950> get<00:04:42.160> from<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.490> floor<00:04:42.760> you<00:04:43.240> can<00:04:43.510> see

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
we'll get from the floor you can see

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.450 
we'll get from the floor you can see
this<00:04:43.870> we<00:04:44.080> collect<00:04:44.440> it<00:04:44.620> we<00:04:44.710> mix<00:04:45.040> it<00:04:45.130> in<00:04:45.250> there

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
this we collect it we mix it in there

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.610 
this we collect it we mix it in there
and<00:04:45.640> we'll<00:04:46.120> put<00:04:46.300> it<00:04:46.419> in<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:46.810> we<00:04:47.020> also<00:04:47.169> mix<00:04:47.500> it

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
and we'll put it in and we also mix it

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.710 
and we'll put it in and we also mix it
with<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.860> low<00:04:47.979> sand<00:04:48.370> me<00:04:48.760> well<00:04:49.390> that's<00:04:49.570> awesome

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
with the low sand me well that's awesome

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:57.030 
with the low sand me well that's awesome
I'd<00:04:49.960> love<00:04:50.140> to<00:04:50.229> see<00:04:50.380> how<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.500> do<00:04:50.710> it

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.430 

so<00:04:58.040> they<00:04:58.430> have<00:04:58.730> in<00:04:59.180> some<00:04:59.360> sense<00:04:59.440> andronica

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
so they have in some sense andronica

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.110 
so they have in some sense andronica
it's<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:00.740> thin<00:05:01.040> that<00:05:01.070> it<00:05:01.250> gets<00:05:01.730> into<00:05:02.030> the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
it's so thin that it gets into the

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.750 
it's so thin that it gets into the
concrete<00:05:02.510> he<00:05:02.720> finds<00:05:03.050> with<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.260> poorest<00:05:03.680> in<00:05:04.520> it

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
concrete he finds with the poorest in it

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.700 
concrete he finds with the poorest in it
when<00:05:04.940> there<00:05:05.090> hardens<00:05:05.480> it's<00:05:05.720> as<00:05:05.900> strong<00:05:06.290> and

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
when there hardens it's as strong and

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.890 
when there hardens it's as strong and
hard<00:05:07.040> as<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.280> confluence<00:05:07.910> now<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:08.360> notice<00:05:08.690> it's

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
hard as the confluence now I notice it's

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.360 
hard as the confluence now I notice it's
kind<00:05:09.050> of<00:05:09.080> going<00:05:09.260> up<00:05:09.500> and<00:05:09.650> over<00:05:10.010> I<00:05:10.040> mean<00:05:10.190> how<00:05:10.280> do

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
kind of going up and over I mean how do

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.830 
kind of going up and over I mean how do
you<00:05:10.460> deal<00:05:11.120> with<00:05:11.150> hope

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
you deal with hope

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.690 
you deal with hope
once<00:05:12.260> this<00:05:12.410> heart<00:05:12.680> is<00:05:12.830> and<00:05:13.160> it<00:05:13.250> only<00:05:13.370> take<00:05:13.669> a

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
once this heart is and it only take a

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.659 
once this heart is and it only take a
couple<00:05:13.940> of<00:05:14.150> minutes<00:05:14.980> we<00:05:15.980> will<00:05:16.130> take<00:05:16.340> a<00:05:16.370> hand

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
couple of minutes we will take a hand

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.440 
couple of minutes we will take a hand
grinder<00:05:17.090> with<00:05:17.330> some<00:05:17.540> bindings<00:05:18.730> and<00:05:19.730> we<00:05:20.360> will

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
grinder with some bindings and we will

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.140 
grinder with some bindings and we will
grind<00:05:20.660> it<00:05:20.810> flush<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:21.800> smooth<00:05:22.130> with<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:22.910> floor

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
grind it flush and smooth with the floor

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.720 
grind it flush and smooth with the floor
so<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:23.960> way<00:05:24.080> to<00:05:24.139> be<00:05:24.290> done<00:05:24.500> your<00:05:25.220> grades<00:05:25.430> back

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
so the way to be done your grades back

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.240 
so the way to be done your grades back
so<00:05:26.419> the<00:05:26.540> color<00:05:26.750> itself<00:05:27.169> is<00:05:27.410> ultimately<00:05:28.100> going

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
so the color itself is ultimately going

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.650 
so the color itself is ultimately going
to<00:05:28.310> match<00:05:28.520> me<00:05:28.760> right<00:05:28.970> now<00:05:29.120> it's<00:05:29.270> just<00:05:29.330> wet

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
to match me right now it's just wet

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.810 
to match me right now it's just wet
right<00:05:30.050> well<00:05:30.290> is<00:05:30.500> whether<00:05:30.889> that<00:05:31.010> actually<00:05:31.520> will

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
right well is whether that actually will

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.940 
right well is whether that actually will
drive<00:05:32.150> just<00:05:32.479> that<00:05:32.630> color<00:05:32.840> just<00:05:33.200> like<00:05:33.320> this<00:05:33.500> you

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
drive just that color just like this you

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.590 
drive just that color just like this you
have<00:05:34.070> to<00:05:34.130> picture<00:05:34.729> that<00:05:34.760> the<00:05:34.970> concrete<00:05:35.240> also

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
have to picture that the concrete also

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.969 
have to picture that the concrete also
is<00:05:35.840> not<00:05:36.020> going<00:05:36.200> to<00:05:36.260> be<00:05:36.320> this<00:05:36.440> color<00:05:36.710> when<00:05:36.889> we're

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
is not going to be this color when we're

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.010 
is not going to be this color when we're
done<00:05:37.130> right<00:05:37.639> now<00:05:38.000> I<00:05:38.030> notice<00:05:38.600> it's<00:05:38.750> getting<00:05:38.960> a

second get grief from there a series of
several<00:05:59.030> different<00:05:59.540> cuts<00:05:59.810> were<00:06:00.110> done<00:06:00.380> using

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
several different cuts were done using

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.430 
several different cuts were done using
finer<00:06:01.160> and<00:06:01.430> finer<00:06:01.490> diamond<00:06:02.150> coated<00:06:02.450> tips<00:06:02.690> with
