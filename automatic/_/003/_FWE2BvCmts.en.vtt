you blend it out and you're blending
really<00:04:33.520> hard<00:04:33.880> to<00:04:34.090> get<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.389> harsh<00:04:34.600> edges<00:04:34.870> out

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
really hard to get the harsh edges out

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.100 
really hard to get the harsh edges out
or<00:04:35.470> whatever<00:04:35.729> you'll<00:04:36.729> end<00:04:37.000> up<00:04:37.120> wiping<00:04:37.389> all<00:04:37.840> of

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
or whatever you'll end up wiping all of

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.800 
or whatever you'll end up wiping all of
the<00:04:38.380> products<00:04:38.919> off<00:04:39.039> of<00:04:39.490> your<00:04:39.639> face<00:04:39.940> I<00:04:40.180> don't

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
the products off of your face I don't

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.840 
the products off of your face I don't
know<00:04:41.080> why<00:04:41.350> this<00:04:41.919> has<00:04:42.100> never<00:04:42.250> happened<00:04:42.400> before

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
know why this has never happened before

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.730 
know why this has never happened before
with<00:04:43.240> any<00:04:43.449> other<00:04:43.630> concealers<00:04:44.139> that<00:04:44.289> I've<00:04:44.410> used

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
with any other concealers that I've used

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.430 
with any other concealers that I've used
I<00:04:45.180> don't<00:04:46.180> know<00:04:46.360> maybe<00:04:46.570> because<00:04:46.720> it's<00:04:47.199> so

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
I don't know maybe because it's so

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.689 
I don't know maybe because it's so
creamy<00:04:47.860> because<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.490> formula<00:04:49.000> is<00:04:49.120> it<00:04:49.690> um<00:04:50.699> very

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
creamy because the formula is it um very

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.189 
creamy because the formula is it um very
creamy<00:04:52.090> and<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:53.530> goes<00:04:53.800> on<00:04:54.010> really<00:04:54.070> nicely<00:04:55.199> now

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
creamy and it goes on really nicely now

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.409 
creamy and it goes on really nicely now
I<00:04:56.699> honestly<00:04:58.169> don't<00:04:59.169> really<00:04:59.910> recommend<00:05:00.910> this

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
I honestly don't really recommend this

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.860 
I honestly don't really recommend this
for<00:05:01.860> spot<00:05:02.860> concealing<00:05:03.550> just<00:05:03.849> because<00:05:04.270> it<00:05:04.539> does

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
for spot concealing just because it does

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.190 
for spot concealing just because it does
move<00:05:05.789> but<00:05:06.789> I<00:05:06.820> mean<00:05:07.090> once<00:05:07.360> you<00:05:07.539> set<00:05:07.870> it<00:05:07.900> with<00:05:08.139> a

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
move but I mean once you set it with a

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.580 
move but I mean once you set it with a
powder<00:05:08.729> like<00:05:09.840> you<00:05:10.840> know<00:05:10.990> once<00:05:11.229> you<00:05:11.349> set<00:05:11.560> it

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
powder like you know once you set it

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.930 
powder like you know once you set it
with<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.919> powder<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:12.639> is<00:05:14.250> set<00:05:15.250> but<00:05:15.669> i<00:05:15.849> don't

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
with the powder it is set but i don't

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.339 
with the powder it is set but i don't
know<00:05:16.210> i<00:05:16.240> don't<00:05:16.330> want<00:05:16.570> to<00:05:16.660> take<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:16.930> chance<00:05:16.960> of

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
know i don't want to take the chance of

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.560 
know i don't want to take the chance of
putting<00:05:17.560> this<00:05:17.800> all<00:05:18.039> over<00:05:18.310> my<00:05:18.430> face<00:05:18.729> on<00:05:19.090> spots

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
putting this all over my face on spots

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.219 
putting this all over my face on spots
and<00:05:19.900> it<00:05:20.530> ends<00:05:21.099> up<00:05:21.190> coming<00:05:21.580> off<00:05:21.760> but<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:22.330> really

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
and it ends up coming off but I really

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.409 
and it ends up coming off but I really
really<00:05:23.470> recommend<00:05:24.010> this<00:05:24.070> for<00:05:24.220> under<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.210> eyes

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
really recommend this for under the eyes

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.960 
really recommend this for under the eyes
because<00:05:26.229> it<00:05:26.380> gives<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:26.830> that<00:05:27.130> really<00:05:27.639> nice

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
because it gives you that really nice

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.860 
because it gives you that really nice
