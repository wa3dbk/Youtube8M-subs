00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
very interesting day one of the rather

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.380 
very interesting day one of the rather
strange<00:00:23.340> things<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.939> no<00:00:24.060> one's<00:00:24.240> really

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
strange things is that no one's really

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.500 
strange things is that no one's really
brought<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> major<00:00:25.140> upgrade<00:00:26.510> everyone's

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
brought a major upgrade everyone's

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.000 
brought a major upgrade everyone's
brought<00:00:27.750> something<00:00:28.230> everyone's<00:00:28.619> got<00:00:28.769> little

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
brought something everyone's got little

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.220 
brought something everyone's got little
details<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.300> were<00:00:30.390> expecting<00:00:30.929> someone<00:00:31.170> to

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
details but we were expecting someone to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.540 
details but we were expecting someone to
do<00:00:31.380> something<00:00:31.590> or<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> sort<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.040> hero<00:00:32.250> wants<00:00:32.460> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
do something or a sort of hero wants to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.420 
do something or a sort of hero wants to
be<00:00:32.700> specification<00:00:33.540> car<00:00:33.750> big<00:00:34.170> changes<00:00:34.739> and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
be specification car big changes and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.520 
be specification car big changes and
let's<00:00:35.670> not<00:00:35.730> turned<00:00:36.090> up<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> think<00:00:36.989> probably

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
let's not turned up so I think probably

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.650 
let's not turned up so I think probably
because<00:00:38.010> we've<00:00:38.430> got<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.700> test<00:00:38.940> coming<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
because we've got the test coming up and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.940 
because we've got the test coming up and
with<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.020> technology<00:00:40.410> will<00:00:40.710> being

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
with the technology will being

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.389 
with the technology will being
relatively<00:00:41.610> immature<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.989> cars

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
relatively immature on the cars

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.440 
relatively immature on the cars
everyone's<00:00:44.399> hell<00:00:44.610> would<00:00:44.730> off<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.059> they're

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
everyone's hell would off that they're

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.790 
everyone's hell would off that they're
probably<00:00:45.660> their<00:00:45.870> big<00:00:46.020> guns<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> next

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
probably their big guns for the next

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.840 
probably their big guns for the next
test<00:00:47.010> well<00:00:48.530> difficult<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.770> say<00:00:50.280> difficult

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
test well difficult I say difficult

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.760 
test well difficult I say difficult
times<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.270> Mercedes<00:00:51.719> not<00:00:51.899> difficult<00:00:52.140> at<00:00:52.500> all

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
times for Mercedes not difficult at all

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.639 
times for Mercedes not difficult at all
although<00:00:53.640> when<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.629> winning<00:00:54.930> races<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
although when you are winning races that

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.330 
although when you are winning races that
way<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.460> kind<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.329> difficult<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.469> know<00:00:58.710> what

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
way it's kind of difficult to know what

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.250 
way it's kind of difficult to know what
areas<00:00:59.699> you're<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> develop<00:01:00.300> into<00:01:01.050> what

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
areas you're going to develop into what

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.110 
areas you're going to develop into what
what<00:01:01.680> do<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> Mercedes<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:02.910> in

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
what do we see on the Mercedes here in

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.810 
what do we see on the Mercedes here in
Barcelona<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.860> areas<00:01:05.129> are<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:05.339> working<00:01:05.549> on

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
Barcelona what areas are they working on

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.030 
Barcelona what areas are they working on
there<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.810> probably<00:01:06.960> two<00:01:07.170> key<00:01:07.409> areas<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
there are probably two key areas on the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
there are probably two key areas on the
Mercedes<00:01:08.549> first<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.510> all<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.900> probably<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
Mercedes first of all the probably the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.649 
Mercedes first of all the probably the
bigger<00:01:10.560> changes<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> side<00:01:11.520> pods<00:01:11.790> they

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
bigger changes on the side pods they

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.270 
bigger changes on the side pods they
don't<00:01:12.930> look<00:01:13.110> much<00:01:13.350> different<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.130> look

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
don't look much different when you look

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.850 
don't look much different when you look
at<00:01:14.400> them<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.000> isolation<00:01:15.869> but<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.710> whole

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
at them in as isolation but the whole

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.190 
at them in as isolation but the whole

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
body work around side pod package has

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.350 
body work around side pod package has
changed<00:01:19.740> where<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.640> inlets<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
changed where the the inlets are a

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.670 
changed where the the inlets are a
little<00:01:21.479> bit<00:01:21.659> smaller<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.259> bit<00:01:22.560> more

little bit smaller a little bit more

kind of had two big outlets flanking the

much smaller outlet the very tail of the
side<00:01:39.270> pod<00:01:39.540> very<00:01:39.810> similar<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.290> some<00:01:40.500> respects

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
side pod very similar in some respects

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.249 
side pod very similar in some respects
to<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> Red<00:01:41.280> Bull<00:01:41.460> solution<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.479> don't<00:01:43.140> believe

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
to the Red Bull solution I don't believe

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.380 
to the Red Bull solution I don't believe
they've<00:01:43.590> changed<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.040> coolers<00:01:44.490> underneath

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
they've changed the coolers underneath

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.789 
they've changed the coolers underneath
the<00:01:45.570> body<00:01:45.720> work<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.290> that's<00:01:46.439> probably<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
the body work but that's probably the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.620 
the body work but that's probably the
biggest<00:01:46.920> single<00:01:47.430> change<00:01:47.729> they've<00:01:48.479> also

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
biggest single change they've also

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.300 
biggest single change they've also
tweaked<00:01:49.110> some<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> veins<00:01:49.890> around<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
tweaked some of the veins around the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.679 
tweaked some of the veins around the
side<00:01:50.490> pods<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:50.970> well<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.479> kind<00:01:51.659> of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
side pods as well just to kind of

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.960 
side pods as well just to kind of
package<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.320> together<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.520> then<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
package that all together and then the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.450 
package that all together and then the
other<00:01:54.000> thing<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.750> front<00:01:54.990> wing<00:01:55.200> again<00:01:56.189> it's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
other thing is the front wing again it's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.490 
other thing is the front wing again it's
really<00:01:57.060> tiny<00:01:57.299> little<00:01:57.570> details<00:01:58.110> there's<00:01:58.320> no

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
really tiny little details there's no

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.670 
really tiny little details there's no
big<00:01:58.799> changes<00:01:59.100> here<00:01:59.780> but<00:02:00.780> they've<00:02:00.960> added<00:02:01.560> an

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
big changes here but they've added an

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.030 
big changes here but they've added an
extra<00:02:01.799> vain<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.479> end<00:02:04.020> plate<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.619> both<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.410 
inside and the outside of the front wing
and<00:02:06.780> plate<00:02:07.020> they've<00:02:07.680> put<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> slot<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
and plate they've put a slot in the the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.890 
and plate they've put a slot in the the
footplate<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.879> on<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.940> front<00:02:12.420> wing<00:02:12.599> it's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
footplate on the on the front wing it's

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.790 
footplate on the on the front wing it's
all<00:02:13.140> tied

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
all tied

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.710 
all tied
details<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.430> if<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:15.030> looked<00:02:15.210> at<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.360> car

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
details and if you looked at that car

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.270 
details and if you looked at that car
you<00:02:15.750> would<00:02:16.020> probably<00:02:16.320> say<00:02:16.470> yes<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:16.860> exactly

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
you would probably say yes it's exactly

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.760 
you would probably say yes it's exactly
the<00:02:17.430> same<00:02:17.580> car<00:02:17.850> as<00:02:17.880> they<00:02:18.090> ran<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.870> China<00:02:19.410> but

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
the same car as they ran in China but

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.960 
the same car as they ran in China but
when<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.130> when<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.370> sort<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.730> stop<00:02:20.940> and

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
when you when you sort of stop and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.090 
when you when you sort of stop and
compare<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:22.230> race<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.800> previous

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
compare this this race in the previous

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.220 
compare this this race in the previous
race<00:02:23.370> these<00:02:24.060> little<00:02:24.330> things<00:02:24.360> become<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> parent

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
race these little things become a parent

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.780 
race these little things become a parent
so<00:02:25.380> they<00:02:25.470> are<00:02:25.590> working<00:02:25.860> hard<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.460> mean<00:02:26.640> these

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
so they are working hard I mean these

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.480 
so they are working hard I mean these
aren't<00:02:27.060> work<00:02:27.780> yeah<00:02:28.110> these<00:02:28.500> are<00:02:28.650> big<00:02:28.950> pieces<00:02:29.310> of

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
aren't work yeah these are big pieces of

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.430 
aren't work yeah these are big pieces of
development<00:02:30.060> they've<00:02:30.240> had<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.510> do<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> even

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
development they've had to do to a even

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.650 
development they've had to do to a even
appear<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.310> be<00:02:32.370> very<00:02:32.400> small<00:02:32.880> visual<00:02:33.210> changes

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
appear to be very small visual changes

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.650 
appear to be very small visual changes
so<00:02:34.430> Mercedes<00:02:35.430> are<00:02:35.520> pushing<00:02:35.730> quite<00:02:35.910> hard<00:02:36.150> yes

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
so Mercedes are pushing quite hard yes

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.390 
so Mercedes are pushing quite hard yes
when<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:36.960> winning<00:02:37.200> Grand<00:02:37.440> Prix<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.740> way<00:02:37.860> they

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
when you winning Grand Prix the way they

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.010 
when you winning Grand Prix the way they
are<00:02:38.430> nothing<00:02:39.060> like<00:02:39.210> an<00:02:39.360> extra<00:02:39.540> vein<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:39.840> a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
are nothing like an extra vein on a

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.900 
are nothing like an extra vein on a
front<00:02:40.290> wing<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.590> plate<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.220> psych<00:02:41.640> out<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
front wing in plate to psych out the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.960 
front wing in plate to psych out the
opposition<00:02:42.480> well<00:02:43.200> exactly<00:02:43.700> when<00:02:44.700> everyone

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
opposition well exactly when everyone

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.460 
opposition well exactly when everyone
else<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.210> producing<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.840> same<00:02:45.990> level<00:02:46.380> of

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
else is producing the same level of

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.860 
else is producing the same level of
updates<00:02:46.890> um<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.700> think<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.210> ladies<00:02:48.540> could<00:02:48.690> feel

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
updates um I think you ladies could feel

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.270 
updates um I think you ladies could feel
fairly<00:02:49.110> sure<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.590> they've<00:02:49.800> still<00:02:50.010> got<00:02:50.250> a

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
fairly sure that they've still got a

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.820 
fairly sure that they've still got a
clear<00:02:50.790> second<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.270> everybody<00:02:51.660> else<00:02:51.900> indeed

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
clear second on everybody else indeed

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.160 
clear second on everybody else indeed
big<00:02:53.820> publicity<00:02:54.120> around<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.720> new<00:02:54.870> chassis

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
big publicity around the new chassis

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.320 
big publicity around the new chassis
that<00:02:55.380> Sebastian<00:02:56.220> Vettel<00:02:56.580> has<00:02:56.760> whether<00:02:57.120> that

he's going to change things for him or

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.430 
he's going to change things for him or
not<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.300> we<00:03:00.360> know<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.570> they<00:03:00.870> had<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.170> loom

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
not and we know that they had that loom

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.830 
not and we know that they had that loom
problem<00:03:01.980> today<00:03:02.190> yeah<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.420> chatting<00:03:03.780> to

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
problem today yeah and chatting to

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.410 
problem today yeah and chatting to
Jonathan<00:03:04.230> Wheatley<00:03:04.560> he<00:03:04.680> was<00:03:04.830> saying<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.420> had

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
Jonathan Wheatley he was saying that had

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.420 
Jonathan Wheatley he was saying that had
this<00:03:06.570> been<00:03:06.840> an<00:03:07.140> are<00:03:07.290> benign<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.280> was

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
this been an are benign and this was

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.590 
this been an are benign and this was
last<00:03:08.610> year<00:03:08.880> they<00:03:09.000> wouldn't<00:03:09.300> got<00:03:09.390> him<00:03:09.480> out

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
last year they wouldn't got him out

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.240 
last year they wouldn't got him out
again<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:10.350> shows<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.530> complexity

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
again and that just shows the complexity

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.730 
again and that just shows the complexity
of<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.460> 2014<00:03:12.120> car<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.110> loom<00:03:13.290> as<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.590> know

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
of a 2014 car and the loom as you know

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.920 
of a 2014 car and the loom as you know
something<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.520> is<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.300> probably<00:03:15.840> the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
something that is that probably the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.780 
something that is that probably the
first<00:03:16.170> thing<00:03:16.470> they<00:03:16.650> put<00:03:16.860> on<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.130> monocoque<00:03:17.580> a

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
first thing they put on the monocoque a

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.180 
first thing they put on the monocoque a
and<00:03:18.270> B<00:03:18.480> they're<00:03:19.290> becoming<00:03:19.620> more<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:20.010> more

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
and B they're becoming more and more

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.490 
and B they're becoming more and more
difficult<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:21.570> replacing<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.290> there<00:03:22.410> were

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
difficult to replacing that there were

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.590 
difficult to replacing that there were
one<00:03:22.709> piece<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.400> save<00:03:23.610> weight<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:23.880> that's<00:03:24.540> a

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
one piece to save weight and that's a

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.479 
one piece to save weight and that's a
very<00:03:24.780> complicated<00:03:25.140> structure<00:03:25.920> now<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.250> loom

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
very complicated structure now that loom

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.400 
very complicated structure now that loom
and<00:03:26.760> I'm<00:03:26.880> sure<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.180> know<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.570> lot<00:03:28.110> more<00:03:28.140> about

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
and I'm sure you know a lot more about

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.740 
and I'm sure you know a lot more about
that<00:03:28.770> than<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.430> do<00:03:29.489> but<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:29.940> guess<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.510> were<00:03:30.600> not

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
that than I do but I guess you were not

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.380 
that than I do but I guess you were not
surprised<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.290> he<00:03:31.380> never<00:03:31.500> got<00:03:31.709> out<00:03:31.830> again

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
surprised that he never got out again

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.479 
surprised that he never got out again
once<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.600> was<00:03:33.720> clear<00:03:33.980> what<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.100> problem<00:03:35.370> was

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
once it was clear what the problem was

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.920 
once it was clear what the problem was
because<00:03:35.640> at<00:03:35.820> first<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.270> assumed<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.690> was<00:03:36.780> maybe

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
because at first I assumed it was maybe

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.750 
because at first I assumed it was maybe
one<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.830> power<00:03:38.040> box<00:03:38.250> which<00:03:38.520> is<00:03:38.550> the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
one of the the power box which is the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.760 
one of the the power box which is the
big<00:03:38.970> piece<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.270> electronic<00:03:39.750> kit<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.110> serves

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
big piece of electronic kit that serves

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.229 
big piece of electronic kit that serves
power<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.459> whole<00:03:41.580> car<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:42.060> would<00:03:42.120> have

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
power to the whole car that would have

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.090 
power to the whole car that would have
made<00:03:42.360> an<00:03:42.660> obvious<00:03:43.080> that<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.410> would<00:03:43.980> have

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
made an obvious that that would have

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.410 
made an obvious that that would have
caused<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.489> once<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.760> said<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.030> was<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.150> loom

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
caused it once I said it was the loom

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.570 
caused it once I said it was the loom
yeah<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.350> mean<00:03:46.500> it's<00:03:46.560> kind<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.950> game<00:03:47.130> over<00:03:47.430> for

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
yeah I mean it's kind of game over for

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.490 
yeah I mean it's kind of game over for
the<00:03:47.670> day<00:03:47.820> really<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.780> I've<00:03:48.900> got<00:03:49.050> this<00:03:49.110> picture

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
the day really and I've got this picture

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.500 
the day really and I've got this picture
here<00:03:49.739> you<00:03:50.370> can<00:03:50.520> have<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.760> look<00:03:50.820> at<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.270> you<00:03:51.330> can

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
here you can have a look at and you can

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.720 
here you can have a look at and you can
just<00:03:51.660> see<00:03:51.900> there<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.709> spaghetti<00:03:53.130> hanging<00:03:53.610> out

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
just see there the spaghetti hanging out

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.370 
just see there the spaghetti hanging out
from<00:03:53.940> underneath<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.450> chassis<00:03:54.660> with<00:03:55.050> all<00:03:55.170> the

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
from underneath the chassis with all the

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.500 
from underneath the chassis with all the
cabling<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.130> they<00:03:56.610> had<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.910> take<00:03:57.090> off<00:03:57.270> the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
cabling and they had to take off the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.080 
cabling and they had to take off the
gearbox<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.200> floor<00:03:58.500> pretty<00:03:59.430> much<00:03:59.610> disconnect

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
gearbox the floor pretty much disconnect

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.850 
gearbox the floor pretty much disconnect
everything<00:04:00.270> apart<00:04:01.140> from<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.440> engine<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.739> the

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
everything apart from the engine to the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.710 
everything apart from the engine to the
chassis<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.489> get<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.880> this<00:04:03.000> loom<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.450> pull<00:04:03.600> it

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
chassis to get to this loom and pull it

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.660 
chassis to get to this loom and pull it
out<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:03.870> as<00:04:04.110> you<00:04:04.230> say<00:04:04.410> it's<00:04:05.100> one<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.520> few

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
out and as you say it's one of the few

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.100 
out and as you say it's one of the few
parts<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.330> car<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.690> doesn't<00:04:06.840> actually

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
parts of the car that doesn't actually

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.229 
parts of the car that doesn't actually
get<00:04:07.440> pulled<00:04:07.739> out<00:04:07.920> every<00:04:08.190> time<00:04:08.610> they<00:04:08.820> rebuild

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
get pulled out every time they rebuild

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.390 
get pulled out every time they rebuild
it<00:04:09.450> it's<00:04:09.630> much<00:04:09.840> like<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.080> road<00:04:10.350> car<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:11.160> last

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
it it's much like a road car the last

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.590 
it it's much like a road car the last
thing<00:04:11.580> you<00:04:11.700> ever<00:04:11.730> want<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.060> do<00:04:12.209> is<00:04:12.239> pull<00:04:12.570> the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
thing you ever want to do is pull the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.020 
thing you ever want to do is pull the
core<00:04:12.959> part<00:04:13.290> of<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.560> loom<00:04:13.739> out<00:04:14.430> from<00:04:14.880> all<00:04:15.000> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
core part of the loom out from all the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.820 
core part of the loom out from all the
little<00:04:15.390> ducks<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.840> conduits<00:04:16.230> that<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.530> has<00:04:16.680> to

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
little ducks and conduits that it has to

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.970 
little ducks and conduits that it has to
run<00:04:17.010> through<00:04:17.220> inside<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.820> car<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.500> yea<00:04:19.500> big

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
run through inside the car and yea big

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.770 
run through inside the car and yea big
problem<00:04:20.310> for<00:04:20.489> rubble<00:04:20.970> today<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.480> they<00:04:21.600> don't

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
problem for rubble today and they don't

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.500 
problem for rubble today and they don't
want<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.080> segment<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:23.460> enable<00:04:23.940> quick

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
want to segment it to enable quick

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.870 
want to segment it to enable quick
change<00:04:24.810> because<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.169> just<00:04:25.200> adds<00:04:25.500> weight

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
change because that just adds weight

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.710 
change because that just adds weight
yeah<00:04:26.880> well<00:04:27.060> its<00:04:27.419> kind

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
yeah well its kind

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.150 
yeah well its kind
comes<00:04:27.900> down<00:04:28.110> there's<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.440> part<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:28.980> you

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
comes down there's a part of it you

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.710 
comes down there's a part of it you
can't<00:04:29.400> really<00:04:29.490> segment<00:04:29.970> anymore<00:04:30.390> it's<00:04:30.570> almost

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
can't really segment anymore it's almost

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.510 
can't really segment anymore it's almost
like<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.020> bit<00:04:31.200> that<00:04:31.230> connects<00:04:31.980> with<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.310> core

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
like the bit that connects with the core

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.370 
like the bit that connects with the core
ECU's<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.420> then<00:04:33.510> goes<00:04:33.690> off<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.990> all<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.170> sub

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
ECU's and then goes off to all the sub

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.800 
ECU's and then goes off to all the sub
looms<00:04:34.680> around<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.640> engine<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:36.060> gearbox<00:04:36.090> and

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
looms around the engine the gearbox and

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.410 
looms around the engine the gearbox and
other<00:04:37.260> areas<00:04:37.710> around<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:38.100> car<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.270> comes

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
other areas around the car so it comes

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.090 
other areas around the car so it comes
to<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.660> stage<00:04:39.870> where<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:40.380> just<00:04:40.530> simply<00:04:40.740> can't

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
to the stage where you just simply can't

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.860 
to the stage where you just simply can't
break<00:04:41.340> it<00:04:41.520> up<00:04:41.610> anymore<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.300> has<00:04:42.540> to<00:04:42.720> go

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
break it up anymore and it has to go

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.960 
break it up anymore and it has to go
through<00:04:43.250> fairly<00:04:44.250> small<00:04:44.460> holes<00:04:44.700> in<00:04:44.910> the

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
through fairly small holes in the

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.330 
through fairly small holes in the
monocoque<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:45.540> get<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.810> other<00:04:45.930> areas<00:04:46.200> so<00:04:46.860> it's

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
monocoque to get to other areas so it's

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.490 
monocoque to get to other areas so it's
the<00:04:47.460> worst<00:04:47.730> possible<00:04:48.230> probably<00:04:49.230> one<00:04:49.350> of<00:04:49.380> the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
the worst possible probably one of the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.320 
the worst possible probably one of the
worst<00:04:49.620> possible<00:04:49.980> in<00:04:50.280> terms<00:04:50.340> of<00:04:50.580> time<00:04:51.300> and

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
worst possible in terms of time and

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.490 
worst possible in terms of time and
effort<00:04:51.540> to<00:04:51.780> repair<00:04:52.050> one<00:04:52.200> of<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.350> worst

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
effort to repair one of the worst

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.530 
effort to repair one of the worst
possible<00:04:52.830> things<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.340> go<00:04:53.850> wrong<00:04:54.060> with<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.330> car

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
possible things to go wrong with the car

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.120 
possible things to go wrong with the car
probably<00:04:54.750> short<00:04:55.050> of<00:04:55.170> the<00:04:55.260> fuel<00:04:55.500> tank<00:04:55.740> leaking

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
probably short of the fuel tank leaking

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.910 
probably short of the fuel tank leaking
yeah<00:04:56.900> so<00:04:57.900> what<00:04:58.260> else<00:04:58.410> will<00:04:58.530> be<00:04:58.590> seen<00:04:58.740> on<00:04:58.890> the

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
yeah so what else will be seen on the

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.580 
yeah so what else will be seen on the
Red<00:04:59.070> Bulls<00:04:59.280> Cubs<00:04:59.750> well<00:05:00.750> interestingly<00:05:01.050> I<00:05:01.440> mean

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
Red Bulls Cubs well interestingly I mean

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.620 
Red Bulls Cubs well interestingly I mean
we<00:05:01.920> didn't<00:05:02.160> really<00:05:02.370> get<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:02.700> see<00:05:02.910> much<00:05:03.090> of<00:05:03.150> red

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
we didn't really get to see much of red

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.290 
we didn't really get to see much of red
bulls<00:05:03.840> at<00:05:04.050> all<00:05:04.380> today<00:05:04.760> that's<00:05:05.760> a<00:05:05.910> way<00:05:06.060> out<00:05:06.210> this

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
bulls at all today that's a way out this

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.030 
bulls at all today that's a way out this
morning<00:05:06.660> with<00:05:06.810> some<00:05:06.960> flow<00:05:07.200> viz<00:05:07.470> on<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.860> on<00:05:08.010> the

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
morning with some flow viz on the on the

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.800 
morning with some flow viz on the on the
bodywork<00:05:08.400> around<00:05:08.910> underneath<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.390> rear<00:05:09.570> wing

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
bodywork around underneath the rear wing

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.110 
bodywork around underneath the rear wing
so<00:05:10.110> we<00:05:10.890> could<00:05:11.130> guess<00:05:11.370> that<00:05:11.400> they<00:05:11.670> probably<00:05:11.910> had

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
so we could guess that they probably had

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.390 
so we could guess that they probably had
something<00:05:12.330> new<00:05:12.600> around<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:13.050> area<00:05:13.470> but<00:05:14.220> when

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
something new around the area but when

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.830 
something new around the area but when
we<00:05:14.550> actually<00:05:14.850> you<00:05:15.060> know<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.360> car<00:05:15.600> wasn't

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
we actually you know the car wasn't

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.690 
we actually you know the car wasn't
running<00:05:16.140> long<00:05:16.260> enough<00:05:16.290> for<00:05:17.130> us<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:17.310> really

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
running long enough for us to really

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.250 
running long enough for us to really
stop<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.090> understand<00:05:18.660> as<00:05:18.810> you<00:05:18.930> said<00:05:19.110> they've

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
stop and understand as you said they've

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.710 
stop and understand as you said they've
got<00:05:19.290> a<00:05:19.440> new<00:05:19.590> chassis<00:05:19.860> for<00:05:20.250> that<00:05:20.400> cell<00:05:20.720> they

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
got a new chassis for that cell they

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.530 
got a new chassis for that cell they
didn't<00:05:21.960> say<00:05:22.140> that<00:05:22.410> this<00:05:22.530> was<00:05:22.770> for<00:05:23.010> any<00:05:23.540> weight

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
didn't say that this was for any weight

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.900 
didn't say that this was for any weight
saving<00:05:24.990> remains<00:05:25.380> specification<00:05:26.130> change<00:05:26.400> we

saving remains specification change we

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.120 
saving remains specification change we
know<00:05:27.060> that<00:05:27.090> they<00:05:27.390> did<00:05:27.570> put<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.840> tubs<00:05:28.800> together

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
may just be a chance for them to have

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.510 
may just be a chance for them to have
remoulded<00:05:33.840> a<00:05:33.900> tub<00:05:34.110> that<00:05:34.350> fits<00:05:35.070> in<00:05:35.250> all<00:05:35.370> the

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
remoulded a tub that fits in all the

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.650 
remoulded a tub that fits in all the
little<00:05:35.700> details<00:05:35.850> that<00:05:36.300> they<00:05:36.419> never<00:05:36.570> really

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
little details that they never really

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.870 
little details that they never really
had<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:36.930> chance<00:05:36.990> to<00:05:37.380> do<00:05:37.530> and<00:05:38.130> before<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.669> car

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
had the chance to do and before the car

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.850 
had the chance to do and before the car
was<00:05:38.910> launched<00:05:39.390> probably<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.350> one<00:05:40.530> biggest

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
was launched probably the one biggest

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.770 
was launched probably the one biggest
thing<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.280> red<00:05:41.850> bull<00:05:42.000> have<00:05:42.240> done<00:05:42.480> is<00:05:42.630> they've

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
thing that red bull have done is they've

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.760 
thing that red bull have done is they've
got<00:05:42.960> this<00:05:43.080> new<00:05:43.760> Renault<00:05:44.760> power<00:05:45.060> unit<00:05:45.479> and

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
got this new Renault power unit and

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.020 
got this new Renault power unit and
obviously<00:05:46.770> not<00:05:46.919> the<00:05:46.979> entire<00:05:47.250> new<00:05:47.430> power<00:05:47.700> unit

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
obviously not the entire new power unit

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.060 
obviously not the entire new power unit
but<00:05:48.150> they<00:05:48.300> have<00:05:48.540> a<00:05:49.080> few<00:05:49.500> pieces<00:05:49.710> of<00:05:49.950> hardware

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
but they have a few pieces of hardware

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.500 
but they have a few pieces of hardware
on<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.490> car<00:05:50.669> but<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:50.910> main<00:05:51.090> thing<00:05:51.120> is<00:05:51.390> that

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
on the car but the main thing is that

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.570 
on the car but the main thing is that
have<00:05:51.660> changed<00:05:51.960> a<00:05:51.990> lot<00:05:52.050> of<00:05:52.169> software<00:05:52.620> between

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
have changed a lot of software between

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.400 
have changed a lot of software between
the<00:05:53.790> energy<00:05:54.180> recovery<00:05:54.419> systems<00:05:55.050> and<00:05:55.290> the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
the energy recovery systems and the

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.590 
the energy recovery systems and the
internal<00:05:55.800> combustion<00:05:56.220> engine<00:05:56.760> and<00:05:56.940> this<00:05:57.450> is

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
internal combustion engine and this is

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.930 
internal combustion engine and this is
really<00:05:57.900> worked<00:05:58.260> so<00:05:58.950> we<00:05:59.070> understand<00:05:59.520> very<00:05:59.640> well

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
really worked so we understand very well

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.460 
really worked so we understand very well
which<00:06:00.210> I'm<00:06:00.330> not<00:06:00.419> just<00:06:00.630> boost<00:06:00.840> peak<00:06:01.169> power

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
which I'm not just boost peak power

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.110 
which I'm not just boost peak power
which<00:06:01.830> probably<00:06:02.040> isn't<00:06:02.220> quite<00:06:02.430> so<00:06:02.460> important

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
which probably isn't quite so important

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.120 
which probably isn't quite so important
but<00:06:03.660> certainly<00:06:03.840> to<00:06:04.080> boost<00:06:04.290> the<00:06:04.410> drivability

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
but certainly to boost the drivability

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.550 
but certainly to boost the drivability
of<00:06:05.160> the<00:06:05.520> the<00:06:05.910> run<00:06:06.060> 0<00:06:06.090> power<00:06:06.360> unit<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.020> it's

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
of the the run 0 power unit and it's

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.200 
of the the run 0 power unit and it's
increasingly<00:06:08.070> becoming<00:06:08.370> clear<00:06:08.729> that<00:06:08.760> one<00:06:09.090> of

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
increasingly becoming clear that one of

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.670 
increasingly becoming clear that one of
the<00:06:09.270> key<00:06:09.419> advantages<00:06:09.990> that<00:06:10.050> Mercedes<00:06:10.590> have

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
the key advantages that Mercedes have

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.440 
the key advantages that Mercedes have
got<00:06:10.830> is<00:06:10.950> that<00:06:11.040> their<00:06:11.220> own<00:06:11.340> power<00:06:11.640> unit<00:06:12.000> is<00:06:12.090> very

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
got is that their own power unit is very

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.170 
got is that their own power unit is very
drivable<00:06:12.890> whereas<00:06:13.890> you<00:06:14.010> see<00:06:14.040> people<00:06:14.850> took<00:06:15.060> you

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
drivable whereas you see people took you

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.600 
drivable whereas you see people took you
with<00:06:15.300> the<00:06:15.419> rail<00:06:16.020> and<00:06:16.350> with<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:16.860> Ferrari<00:06:17.280> power

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
with the rail and with the Ferrari power

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.550 
with the rail and with the Ferrari power
units<00:06:17.940> coming<00:06:18.150> out<00:06:18.330> of<00:06:18.419> turns<00:06:18.660> trying<00:06:19.320> to<00:06:19.470> get

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
units coming out of turns trying to get

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.350 
units coming out of turns trying to get
this<00:06:19.680> power<00:06:20.010> down<00:06:20.310> there's<00:06:20.580> a<00:06:20.669> huge<00:06:20.970> amount<00:06:21.270> of

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
this power down there's a huge amount of

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.790 
this power down there's a huge amount of
talk<00:06:21.600> you<00:06:21.780> know<00:06:21.870> a<00:06:21.900> thousand<00:06:22.350> newton<00:06:22.560> meters

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
talk you know a thousand newton meters

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.170 
talk you know a thousand newton meters
of<00:06:22.830> torque<00:06:22.950> trying<00:06:23.400> to<00:06:23.460> get<00:06:23.580> that<00:06:23.669> down<00:06:23.880> to<00:06:23.940> the

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
of torque trying to get that down to the

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.510 
of torque trying to get that down to the
track<00:06:24.360> is<00:06:24.990> very<00:06:25.440> difficult<00:06:25.680> when<00:06:25.919> it<00:06:26.130> comes<00:06:26.340> in

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
track is very difficult when it comes in

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.580 
track is very difficult when it comes in
with<00:06:26.669> such<00:06:26.940> a<00:06:26.970> bang<00:06:27.330> because<00:06:28.169> of<00:06:28.290> the<00:06:28.380> nature

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
with such a bang because of the nature

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.370 
with such a bang because of the nature
of<00:06:28.740> electronic<00:06:29.370> motors<00:06:29.729> so<00:06:30.360> some<00:06:31.020> work<00:06:31.200> around

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
of electronic motors so some work around

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.950 
of electronic motors so some work around
the<00:06:31.590> aerial<00:06:31.950> should<00:06:32.419> should<00:06:33.419> improve<00:06:33.750> their

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
the aerial should should improve their

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.020 
the aerial should should improve their
general<00:06:34.350> power<00:06:34.680> unit<00:06:35.040> reliability<00:06:35.700> but<00:06:35.880> it

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
general power unit reliability but it

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.580 
general power unit reliability but it
should<00:06:36.210> also<00:06:36.330> bring<00:06:36.599> lap<00:06:36.900> time<00:06:37.169> with<00:06:37.380> it<00:06:37.500> as

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
should also bring lap time with it as

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.770 
should also bring lap time with it as
well
