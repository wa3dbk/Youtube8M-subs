and everything will be like it is in a
giant<00:00:25.080> pot<00:00:25.519> the<00:00:26.519> first<00:00:26.730> thing<00:00:26.910> we're<00:00:27.090> going<00:00:27.240> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
giant pot the first thing we're going to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.359 
giant pot the first thing we're going to
do<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.570> prepare<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.960> soil<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.859> we're<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.279> to

soil<00:00:33.690> from<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> place<00:00:34.559> where<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.160> want<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
soil from the place where we want the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.310 
soil from the place where we want the
raised<00:00:35.579> bed<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.030> we'll<00:00:36.300> put<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> soil<00:00:36.870> aside

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
raised bed and we'll put the soil aside

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.040 
raised bed and we'll put the soil aside
in<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.890> little<00:00:38.129> mountain<00:00:38.250> over<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:39.120> okay<00:00:39.600> so

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
in a little mountain over here okay so

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.830 
in a little mountain over here okay so
the<00:00:40.260> terrain<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.010> be<00:00:41.129> flat<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.450> next

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
the terrain is going to be flat the next

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.560 
the terrain is going to be flat the next
step<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.440> will<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.460> start<00:00:44.789> placing<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
step is will be to start placing the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.380 
step is will be to start placing the
thin<00:00:45.809> hollow<00:00:46.320> bricks<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> right<00:00:47.850> place<00:00:48.090> so

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
thin hollow bricks in the right place so

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.029 
thin hollow bricks in the right place so
we're<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> leave<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> hallway<00:00:49.530> here

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
we're going to leave a hallway here

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.470 
we're going to leave a hallway here
let's<00:00:50.340> take<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> measuring<00:00:50.910> tape<00:00:51.090> we're<00:00:51.449> going

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
let's take a measuring tape we're going

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.049 
let's take a measuring tape we're going
to<00:00:51.660> measure<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.559> width<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.520> hallway<00:00:53.879> it's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to measure the width of the hallway it's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.020 
to measure the width of the hallway it's
going<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.570> 70<00:00:55.199> centimeters<00:00:55.980> or<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.460> couple

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
going to be 70 centimeters or a couple

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.080 
going to be 70 centimeters or a couple
of<00:00:57.180> feet<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> bit<00:00:57.480> more<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:59.460> bed<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.910> going

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
of feet a bit more and the bed is going

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.540 
of feet a bit more and the bed is going
to<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.449> about<00:01:00.840> three<00:01:01.530> feet<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:02.010> about<00:01:02.250> one

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
to be about three feet or about one

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.010 
to be about three feet or about one
meter<00:01:02.789> wide<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.650> will<00:01:04.920> use<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> level<00:01:05.400> to

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
meter wide so we will use a level to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.560 
meter wide so we will use a level to
place<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.680> hollow<00:01:07.890> break<00:01:08.340> as<00:01:08.610> leveled<00:01:09.450> as

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
place the hollow break as leveled as

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.480 
place the hollow break as leveled as
possible<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.350> once<00:01:10.590> everything<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.280> place

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
possible and once everything is in place

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.090 
possible and once everything is in place
and<00:01:11.820> well<00:01:12.030> measured<00:01:12.420> we'll<00:01:13.080> drive<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and well measured we'll drive in the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.820 
and well measured we'll drive in the
rebars<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> outside<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
rebars to on the outside one on the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:32.090 
rebars to on the outside one on the
inside<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> brick<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.150> nice<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.990> tight

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.340 

if<00:01:33.100> we<00:01:33.250> see<00:01:33.430> one<00:01:33.670> break<00:01:34.330> is<00:01:34.480> not<00:01:34.630> perfectly

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
if we see one break is not perfectly

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.330 
if we see one break is not perfectly
leveled<00:01:35.980> we<00:01:36.280> can't<00:01:36.490> remove<00:01:36.730> some<00:01:37.180> soil<00:01:37.930> from

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
leveled we can't remove some soil from

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.490 
leveled we can't remove some soil from
under<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:43.210> might<00:01:43.450> look<00:01:43.690> like<00:01:43.750> hard<00:01:44.260> work

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
under it this might look like hard work

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.310 
under it this might look like hard work
but<00:01:45.280> it<00:01:45.820> is<00:01:45.880> very<00:01:46.090> satisfying<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:47.080> see<00:01:47.110> it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
but it is very satisfying to see it

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.790 
but it is very satisfying to see it
perfectly<00:01:47.920> straight<00:01:48.340> later<00:01:49.030> on<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:50.230> it<00:01:50.530> will

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
perfectly straight later on so it will

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.170 
perfectly straight later on so it will
keep<00:01:51.300> placing<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.900> rebars<00:01:53.430> 2<00:01:54.430> on<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.760> outside

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
keep placing the rebars 2 on the outside

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.390 
keep placing the rebars 2 on the outside
one<00:01:55.660> on<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.930> inside<00:01:56.350> here<00:01:56.830> I<00:01:56.860> have<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.130> helper

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
one on the inside here I have a helper

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.330 
one on the inside here I have a helper
but<00:01:57.910> kind<00:01:58.900> of<00:01:58.960> having<00:01:59.260> trouble<00:01:59.680> removing<00:02:00.250> the

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
but kind of having trouble removing the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:14.540 
but kind of having trouble removing the
soil<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:06.990> subsequently<00:02:07.990> just<00:02:08.470> like<00:02:08.590> that

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.630 

once<00:02:15.330> half<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.140> raised<00:02:16.410> bed<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.430> place

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
once half of the raised bed is in place

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.690 
once half of the raised bed is in place
we<00:02:18.270> can<00:02:18.390> do<00:02:19.130> is<00:02:20.130> take<00:02:21.000> some<00:02:21.210> manure<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.700> spread

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
we can do is take some manure and spread

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.180 
we can do is take some manure and spread
it<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.330> botton<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.260> raised<00:02:25.500> bed<00:02:25.710> and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
it on the botton of the raised bed and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.280 
it on the botton of the raised bed and
from<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.880> other<00:02:27.030> side<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.840> raised<00:02:28.050> leg

from the other side of the raised leg
where<00:02:28.920> we<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:29.400> not<00:02:29.610> removed<00:02:29.910> any<00:02:30.180> soil<00:02:30.510> we

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
where we have not removed any soil we

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.440 
where we have not removed any soil we
can<00:02:31.050> take<00:02:31.290> soil<00:02:31.620> from<00:02:32.040> there<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.490> come<00:02:33.210> and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
can take soil from there and come and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.080 
can take soil from there and come and
cover<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.900> manure<00:02:34.170> with<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.680> half<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.820> the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
cover the manure with it so half of the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.070 
cover the manure with it so half of the
soil<00:02:36.330> we<00:02:36.750> will<00:02:37.020> only<00:02:37.320> be<00:02:37.530> moving<00:02:38.520> once<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.930> take

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
soil we will only be moving once to take

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.990 
soil we will only be moving once to take
the<00:02:40.290> soil<00:02:42.020> and<00:02:43.020> place<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.190> at<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.610> beginning

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
the soil and place it at the beginning

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.410 
the soil and place it at the beginning
of<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.270> raised<00:02:45.450> bed<00:02:45.480> okay<00:02:46.640> we<00:02:47.640> can<00:02:47.970> loosen<00:02:48.240> it

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
of the raised bed okay we can loosen it

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.560 
of the raised bed okay we can loosen it
a<00:02:48.480> bit<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:49.020> continue<00:02:49.620> with<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.040> process<00:02:50.570> some

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
a bit and continue with the process some

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.790 
a bit and continue with the process some
manure<00:02:51.990> for<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.620> bottom<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.130> soil<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:54.090> top

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
manure for the bottom and soil on top

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.370 
manure for the bottom and soil on top
and<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:56.250> way<00:02:56.460> we'll<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.380> fertilizer

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
and this way we'll have a fertilizer

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
and this way we'll have a fertilizer
that's<00:02:58.800> deep<00:02:59.370> down<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:04.380> remaining<00:03:04.710> process

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
that's deep down the remaining process

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.400 
that's deep down the remaining process
for<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.700> raised<00:03:05.910> bed<00:03:06.210> is<00:03:06.510> just<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.230> same

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
for the raised bed is just the same

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.780 
for the raised bed is just the same
thing<00:03:07.740> in<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.220> case<00:03:08.520> I<00:03:09.080> made<00:03:10.080> an<00:03:10.380> 18<00:03:11.370> feet

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
thing in this case I made an 18 feet

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.930 
thing in this case I made an 18 feet
long<00:03:12.090> raised<00:03:12.600> bed<00:03:12.900> each<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:14.250> these<00:03:14.400> bricks<00:03:14.760> and

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
long raised bed each of these bricks and

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.180 
long raised bed each of these bricks and
using<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.540> one<00:03:16.080> meter<00:03:16.260> long<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:16.860> it's<00:03:16.980> about

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
using is one meter long so it's about

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.870 
using is one meter long so it's about
six<00:03:17.490> meters<00:03:17.990> and<00:03:18.990> then<00:03:19.260> 30<00:03:19.920> centimeters<00:03:20.730> or

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
six meters and then 30 centimeters or

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.820 
six meters and then 30 centimeters or
one<00:03:21.180> feet<00:03:21.450> deep<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:23.209> remember<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.810> rebar<00:03:25.440> on

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
one feet deep so remember to rebar on

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.400 
one feet deep so remember to rebar on
the<00:03:26.010> outside<00:03:26.370> one<00:03:26.820> inside<00:03:27.270> then<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.140> cover

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
the outside one inside then you cover

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.440 
the outside one inside then you cover
the<00:03:28.680> bottom<00:03:29.010> part<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.670> lower<00:03:29.850> part<00:03:30.240> with

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
the bottom part the lower part with

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.370 
the bottom part the lower part with
manure<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.500> then<00:03:31.830> soil<00:03:32.490> on<00:03:32.880> top<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.720> soil<00:03:34.050> you

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
manure and then soil on top the soil you

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.010 
manure and then soil on top the soil you
already<00:03:34.800> removed<00:03:35.220> previously<00:03:38.720> we<00:03:39.720> keep

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
already removed previously we keep

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.140 
already removed previously we keep
covering<00:03:40.380> with<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:40.890> soil<00:03:41.160> we<00:03:41.550> cover<00:03:41.790> the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
covering with the soil we cover the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.110 
covering with the soil we cover the
manure<00:03:42.680> we<00:03:44.300> loosen<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.390> soil<00:03:45.570> if<00:03:45.959> necessary

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
manure we loosen the soil if necessary

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.310 
manure we loosen the soil if necessary
it<00:03:48.120> takes<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.810> while<00:03:48.990> take<00:03:49.830> some<00:03:50.040> work<00:03:50.250> but<00:03:51.320> then

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
it takes a while take some work but then

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.870 
it takes a while take some work but then
later<00:03:52.740> on<00:03:53.010> you're<00:03:53.130> going<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.430> be<00:03:53.490> very<00:03:53.760> happy

later on you're going to be very happy

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.530 
later on you're going to be very happy
with<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:55.010> if<00:03:56.010> we<00:03:56.190> need<00:03:56.220> some<00:03:56.490> help<00:03:56.760> or<00:03:56.940> somebody

with it if we need some help or somebody

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.449 
with it if we need some help or somebody
can<00:03:57.720> give<00:03:57.870> us<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.020> hand<00:03:58.050> so<00:03:58.530> even<00:03:59.070> better<00:03:59.190> of

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
can give us a hand so even better of

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.380 
can give us a hand so even better of
course<00:03:59.760> always<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:03.209> we<00:04:03.750> drive<00:04:04.290> some<00:04:04.770> regard<00:04:05.100> in

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
course always so we drive some regard in

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.250 
course always so we drive some regard in
then<00:04:06.650> hollow<00:04:07.650> bricks<00:04:08.130> then<00:04:09.000> manure<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.959> soil

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
then hollow bricks then manure and soil

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.490 
then hollow bricks then manure and soil
and<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:11.100> raised<00:04:11.310> bed<00:04:11.610> will<00:04:12.030> be<00:04:12.209> complete<00:04:12.540> this

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
and the raised bed will be complete this

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.280 
and the raised bed will be complete this
is<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.830> end<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.550> it<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.360> final<00:04:15.720> part<00:04:15.989> we

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
is the end of it the final part we

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.909 
is the end of it the final part we
remove<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.130> soil<00:04:17.370> that's<00:04:17.910> still<00:04:18.720> there<00:04:18.959> this

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
remove the soil that's still there this

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.180 
remove the soil that's still there this
is<00:04:20.459> usually<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:21.030> hardest<00:04:21.480> thing<00:04:22.260> hardest

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
is usually the hardest thing hardest

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.090 
is usually the hardest thing hardest
part<00:04:23.430> because<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:24.419> has<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.840> fit<00:04:25.020> perfectly<00:04:25.710> so

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
part because it has to fit perfectly so

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:35.070 
part because it has to fit perfectly so
it<00:04:27.370> is<00:04:27.550> very<00:04:27.850> straight<00:04:28.210> in<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:28.600> end<00:04:34.080> once

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
it is very straight in the end once

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.250 
it is very straight in the end once
everything<00:04:35.500> is<00:04:35.560> in<00:04:35.710> place<00:04:36.390> we<00:04:37.390> keep<00:04:37.630> covering

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
everything is in place we keep covering

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.840 
everything is in place we keep covering
with<00:04:38.530> soil<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:40.710> we<00:04:41.710> have<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.190> raised<00:04:42.460> bed

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
with soil and we have the raised bed

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:49.620 
with soil and we have the raised bed
complete<00:04:45.840> if<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:47.170> see<00:04:47.350> some<00:04:47.590> weed<00:04:47.860> in<00:04:48.630> the

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
complete if you see some weed in the

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.360 
complete if you see some weed in the
soil<00:04:49.900> don't<00:04:50.290> worry<00:04:50.470> we<00:04:50.740> are<00:04:50.770> going<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.220> cover

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
soil don't worry we are going to cover

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.810 
soil don't worry we are going to cover
that<00:04:52.740> we<00:04:53.740> keep<00:04:53.980> putting<00:04:54.820> soil<00:04:55.090> on<00:04:55.390> top<00:04:56.820> it's

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
that we keep putting soil on top it's

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.910 
that we keep putting soil on top it's
going<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.090> rise<00:04:58.330> a<00:04:58.630> bit<00:04:58.660> over<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.470> break<00:04:59.680> so

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
going to rise a bit over the break so

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.290 
going to rise a bit over the break so
don't<00:05:00.130> worry<00:05:00.280> about<00:05:00.490> it<00:05:00.760> because<00:05:00.880> that's

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
don't worry about it because that's

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.070 
don't worry about it because that's
going<00:05:01.510> to<00:05:01.600> firm<00:05:01.870> down<00:05:03.300> so<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.480> level<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.900> going

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
going to firm down so the level is going

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:12.450 
going to firm down so the level is going
to<00:05:05.170> be<00:05:05.230> perfect<00:05:09.720> once<00:05:10.720> all<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.260> soil<00:05:11.470> has<00:05:12.430> been

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
to be perfect once all the soil has been
