00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.910
 A small overview of our Chinese trash 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.940
 which is sold on the market now doing 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.949

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.890

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.849
 twenty five thousand almost 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.400
 there was a small frame with her broken off 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.340
 there was no lard bolt standing 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.600
 Bolted bit inside will less 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.309

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.489
 It turned out a little nuis went and hurt 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.530
 inside in this stud oil channel in 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.780
 common with them oil she ran to the scrap and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.910
 went threw bought a new head 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.800
 This trick I drove somewhere I do not know 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.430
 about 7,000 I want to say this 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.350
 I use the old trick as a spare 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.689
 parts of me went but you can actually 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.670
 say that everything went with it all here 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.830
 because see this situation from 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.530
 valve 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.130
 this one is the valve of the bed our rays 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:23.430
 made this valve stood on the old 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:25.200
 heads went over twenty thousand on 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.750
 there is not even a trace of wear 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.890
 actually 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.400
 inserting a guide I do not know whether 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.350
 You can see it on the camera but the backlash is generally on 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:42.150
 ask for a report there is no missing from the elevator and 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:44.310
 quality quality that is not a leg not 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.829
 the magnet cap is not taken 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:56.479
 now see what we sell 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:02:00.079
 the head sticks together with the head 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:04.380
 will click that is completely raw metal and 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:06.890
 See what happened to him for 7,000 to see 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.890
 or only 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.430
 here so here you can see it is covered in potholes 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.420
 he burned down completely burned 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:32.050
 valve and normal wear and tear on it 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:35.560
 good new cleverly insert play 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:42.870
 and pretty decently put old 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:51.670
 there is no backlash valve but here we have it 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:52.260
 raw as the same rocker the same 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.930
 the most 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.720
 the same wear on the old can be seen that 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.910
 and holes there are potholes themselves 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.210
 adjusting bolts too when new 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.580
 I put the head on them completely 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.950
 cut the thread that is survived the gap 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.200
 pulled me and flew away right away but 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.420
 raw we are raw metal and by the way it is not 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.300
 one such head is already pieces 2 or 3 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.660
 I was repairing exactly the same 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:24.490
 a picture that alas, but in the market we have each 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:28.300
 the year is getting worse and worse and by the way the springs 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.990
 valves are the same here are those that have 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:35.920
 new heads are now being sold here 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:40.900

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.890
 moped the same were included I her 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.100
 you know, I can't squeeze it so hard 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.460
 only outer inner small 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:04:02.350
