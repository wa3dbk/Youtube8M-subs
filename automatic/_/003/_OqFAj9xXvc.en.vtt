begin there are three steps to follow
when<00:01:02.730> calculating<00:01:03.359> drainage<00:01:03.750> first<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:05.070> need

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
when calculating drainage first we need

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.450 
when calculating drainage first we need
to<00:01:05.400> calculate<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.060> storm<00:01:06.360> runoff<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:06.960> flow

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
to calculate the storm runoff or flow

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.510 
to calculate the storm runoff or flow
runoff<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.640> given<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> symbol<00:01:09.360> Q<00:01:10.250> second<00:01:11.250> we

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
runoff is given the symbol Q second we

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.490 
runoff is given the symbol Q second we
convert<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> storm<00:01:12.420> runoff<00:01:12.689> into<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> volume

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
convert the storm runoff into a volume

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.609 
convert the storm runoff into a volume
of<00:01:13.740> water<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.280> finally<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.840> determine<00:01:16.350> how<00:01:16.560> we

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
of water and finally we determine how we

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.160 
of water and finally we determine how we
are<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.280> store<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.880> runoff<00:01:18.240> volume

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
are going to store the runoff volume

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.570 
are going to store the runoff volume

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.100 

now<00:03:26.799> let's<00:03:27.159> put<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.489> all<00:03:27.579> together<00:03:27.810> again<00:03:28.810> the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
now let's put it all together again the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.140 
now let's put it all together again the
rational<00:03:29.650> method<00:03:29.769> equation<00:03:30.430> says<00:03:30.760> that<00:03:30.970> our

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
rational method equation says that our

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.449 
rational method equation says that our
storm<00:03:31.629> runoff<00:03:31.900> is<00:03:32.290> equal<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.129> runoff

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
storm runoff is equal to the runoff

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.000 
storm runoff is equal to the runoff
coefficient<00:03:33.670> C<00:03:34.569> times<00:03:35.349> the<00:03:35.560> rainfall

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
coefficient C times the rainfall

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.449 
coefficient C times the rainfall
intensity<00:03:36.489> I<00:03:36.819> times<00:03:37.689> the<00:03:37.900> runoff<00:03:38.230> area<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.799> all

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
intensity I times the runoff area a all

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.929 
intensity I times the runoff area a all
divided<00:03:40.120> by<00:03:40.150> 96<00:03:40.689> point<00:03:41.349> two<00:03:41.560> three<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.579> runoff

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
divided by 96 point two three the runoff

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.420 
divided by 96 point two three the runoff
is<00:03:42.970> coming<00:03:43.450> from<00:03:43.599> the<00:03:43.780> roof<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.650> C<00:03:45.010> value

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
is coming from the roof so the C value

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.119 
is coming from the roof so the C value
in<00:03:45.609> our<00:03:45.760> equation<00:03:46.239> is<00:03:46.420> one<00:03:46.659> point<00:03:46.959> zero<00:03:47.129> let's

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
in our equation is one point zero let's

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.800 
in our equation is one point zero let's
pretend<00:03:48.549> this<00:03:48.700> house<00:03:48.909> is<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.239> Atlanta<00:03:49.390> Georgia

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
pretend this house is in Atlanta Georgia

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.009 
pretend this house is in Atlanta Georgia
the<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:50.680> value<00:03:51.310> is<00:03:51.519> three<00:03:51.879> point<00:03:52.209> five<00:03:52.420> inches

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
the I value is three point five inches

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.770 
the I value is three point five inches
per<00:03:53.230> hour<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.280> value<00:03:54.849> is<00:03:55.030> 800<00:03:55.750> square

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780

feet<00:03:56.640> multiplying<00:03:57.640> this<00:03:57.819> out<00:03:58.000> we<00:03:58.420> can<00:03:58.599> expect

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
feet multiplying this out we can expect

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.649 
feet multiplying this out we can expect
to<00:03:59.200> get<00:03:59.319> twenty<00:03:59.769> nine<00:03:59.950> point<00:04:00.400> ten<00:04:00.730> gallons<00:04:01.389> per

minute of water from this portion of the
roof<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.450> 100-year<00:04:05.079> storm<00:04:05.409> event<00:04:06.690> let's

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
roof and the 100-year storm event let's

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.410 
roof and the 100-year storm event let's
do<00:04:07.959> another<00:04:08.109> example<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:09.519> time<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:10.150> surface

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
do another example this time the surface

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.670 
do another example this time the surface
is<00:04:10.780> sand<00:04:11.079> so<00:04:11.829> the<00:04:11.950> C<00:04:12.189> value<00:04:12.430> is<00:04:12.760> 0.5<00:04:13.659> the<00:04:14.470> house

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
is sand so the C value is 0.5 the house

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.069
