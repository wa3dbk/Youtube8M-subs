00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:09.370
 good this 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:12.300
 it is a simple assembly because of an engine 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.370
 of cee in this case of permanent magnet 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.490
 please leave it in our moment of 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.619
 without working here we have the magnet 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.490
 permanent generated by two magnets that 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.470
 I show you here 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.269
 this side and the side here 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.919
 here in the center we have a little 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.660
 let's turn the four of the over here 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.489
 we have in the center the coil the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.489
 collects but look a little coil 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.120
 the rotor coil 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.829
 and here we have this is to be 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.660
 doing these corners are doing 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.510
 the times 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.500
 of the bearings or bearings here in 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.500
 this end too 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.870
 and in this part yes please explain me 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.870
 the roberts 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.510
 here is part of here as this is 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.510
 do 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.510
 she 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.260
 a kind of sign connector 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:17.190
 two plates there you can see the half part 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.350
 and the other half is the collector 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.330
 and put him better so he places the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.720
 attention from one source and in two 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.060
 cables all the cables come here 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.240
 Y 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.640
 we would have there the power breathe 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.420
 without need of impulse let's go back to 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.420
 drop it please 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.220
 there the impulse give the impulse without 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.900
 momentum observe the release release what 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.500
 brings out there stands 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.140
 plug it in 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.320
 and he is already generating the same force 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.820
 to start watching spectacular 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.070
 this engine that permanent magnet 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.430
 in this this work was done in the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.410
 Matter machines 2 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.950
 directed by who is speaking to them 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.950
 properties and members edwin 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.510
 and roberts robert kahn cute and whoever 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.370
 his teacher is talking here 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.379
 thank you very much 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.849
 the boys have 5 and there you see the 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.849
 effort and dedication
