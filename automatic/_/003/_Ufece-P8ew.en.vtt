00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170 

Bing<00:00:00.240> I<00:00:01.909> brought<00:00:02.909> in<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.179> field<00:00:04.700> all<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:05.879> think

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
Bing I brought in the field all I think

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.299 
Bing I brought in the field all I think
got<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.420> technique<00:00:07.049> side<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.890> fielding

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
got the technique side of fielding

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.830 
got the technique side of fielding
something<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:08.910> they've<00:00:09.120> really<00:00:09.540> got<00:00:09.750> to

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
something that they've really got to

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.919 
something that they've really got to
work<00:00:10.019> on<00:00:10.670> I'm<00:00:11.670> sure<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.179> feeling<00:00:12.540> coach<00:00:12.780> would

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
work on I'm sure the feeling coach would

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.090 
work on I'm sure the feeling coach would
ever<00:00:13.110> notice<00:00:13.799> all<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:15.859> took<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
ever notice all that I took on the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.060 
ever notice all that I took on the
sidelines<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:17.940> spinner<00:00:18.660> always<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> dangerous

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
sidelines so spinner always a dangerous

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.340 
sidelines so spinner always a dangerous
proposition<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:23.730> stage<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> innings<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
proposition the stage of the innings and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.630 
proposition the stage of the innings and
I<00:00:25.439> think<00:00:25.650> that's<00:00:25.800> been<00:00:26.010> their<00:00:26.189> strength<00:00:26.490> in

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
I think that's been their strength in

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.009 
I think that's been their strength in
the<00:00:26.699> polling<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.119> split<00:00:27.359> us<00:00:27.480> more<00:00:27.720> than<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the polling to split us more than the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.759 
the polling to split us more than the
CMAs<00:00:28.849> yes<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.000> has<00:00:30.179> Sanjay<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.990> also<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
CMAs yes it has Sanjay and also the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.319 
CMAs yes it has Sanjay and also the
pitch<00:00:31.949> hasn't<00:00:32.250> paid<00:00:32.460> its<00:00:32.669> role<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
pitch hasn't paid its role for the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.209 
pitch hasn't paid its role for the
spinners<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.989> hasn't<00:00:34.290> turned<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.710> lot

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
spinners it hasn't turned a lot

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.150 
spinners it hasn't turned a lot
it<00:00:35.760> isn't<00:00:36.540> slow<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.170> got<00:00:37.350> good<00:00:37.590> pacing<00:00:37.890> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
it isn't slow it's got good pacing that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.540 
it isn't slow it's got good pacing that
it<00:00:38.309> comes<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.730> nasty<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.739> you<00:00:40.739> can't<00:00:41.010> hit<00:00:41.190> the

they chase along with the tiller at
square<00:01:41.740> leg<00:01:41.920> yeah<00:01:42.899> let's<00:01:43.899> see<00:01:44.080> again<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:44.649> the

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
square leg yeah let's see again and the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.919 
square leg yeah let's see again and the
kind<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.250> fold<00:01:45.580> Simon<00:01:46.210> there's<00:01:46.420> this<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:46.869> the

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
kind of fold Simon there's this and the

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.809 
kind of fold Simon there's this and the
field<00:01:47.229> three<00:01:47.619> field<00:01:47.979> is<00:01:48.130> going<00:01:48.340> for<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.520> ball

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
field three field is going for the ball

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.539 
field three field is going for the ball
I<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:52.750> everyone<00:01:53.080> needs<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.500> just<00:01:53.530> develop<00:01:54.429> a

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
I think everyone needs to just develop a

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.059 
I think everyone needs to just develop a
strong<00:01:55.060> throwing<00:01:55.569> arm<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:56.020> think<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.679> one

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
strong throwing arm I think that is one

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:04.070 
strong throwing arm I think that is one
important<00:01:57.580> lesson<00:01:57.729> that<00:01:58.119> they've<00:01:58.270> learned

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.280 

can<00:02:05.080> come<00:02:05.320> with<00:02:05.590> frequent<00:02:06.190> throw<00:02:06.400> dolls<00:02:06.670> or

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
can come with frequent throw dolls or

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.749 
can come with frequent throw dolls or
few<00:02:08.290> minutes<00:02:08.619> at<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.830> gym<00:02:09.100> cause<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.610> does

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
few minutes at the gym cause it does

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.150 
few minutes at the gym cause it does
help

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.190

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
who was the main player if he didn't

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.860

took a lot of heart out of it how the
surface<00:02:41.650> was<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.190> but<00:02:42.400> if<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.580> surface<00:02:42.970> was

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
surface was like but if the surface was

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.510 
surface was like but if the surface was
anything<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.570> was<00:02:43.840> confusing<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.440> spin<00:02:44.770> yes

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
anything that was confusing to spin yes

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.360 
anything that was confusing to spin yes
they'd<00:02:45.760> be<00:02:45.880> more<00:02:46.090> in<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.420> game<00:02:47.220> clearly<00:02:48.220> these

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
they'd be more in the game clearly these

00:02:48.370 --> 00:03:25.620 
they'd be more in the game clearly these
conditions<00:02:48.850> aren't<00:02:49.000> ideal<00:02:49.120> 266<00:02:50.020> for<00:02:50.140> five
