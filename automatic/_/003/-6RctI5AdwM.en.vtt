here<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.299> see<00:01:09.450> me<00:01:09.570> creating<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> eyeballs

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
here you see me creating the eyeballs

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.330 
here you see me creating the eyeballs
off<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.250> her<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.869> all<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.680> eyeballs<00:01:13.830> in

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
off of her so I got all the eyeballs in

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.460 
off of her so I got all the eyeballs in
one<00:01:14.850> run<00:01:15.450> through<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.229> definitely

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
one run through there it's definitely

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.160 
one run through there it's definitely
good<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.189> try<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.330> all<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:19.110> away

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
good to try and get them all right away

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.620 
good to try and get them all right away
so<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.060> repeat<00:01:21.420> that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
so that you do not have to repeat that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.859 
so that you do not have to repeat that
first<00:01:22.229> pattern<00:01:22.740> over<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.100> over<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.869> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
first pattern over and over and this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.800 
first pattern over and over and this
part<00:01:25.229> gets<00:01:25.799> relatively<00:01:26.430> easier<00:01:27.000> as<00:01:27.270> all<00:01:27.689> you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
part gets relatively easier as all you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.719 
part gets relatively easier as all you
have<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.320> wait<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:28.829> her<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.159> dip<00:01:29.460> her

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
have to do is wait for her to dip her

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.240 
have to do is wait for her to dip her
right<00:01:30.000> arm<00:01:30.270> into<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> lava<00:01:31.020> twice<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.740> then

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that is on her left forearm and then pop

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.310 
that is on her left forearm and then pop
the<00:01:38.189> mother<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.640> all<00:01:38.850> boils<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.600> watch<00:01:40.140> her
