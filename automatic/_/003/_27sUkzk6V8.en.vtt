00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.300
 flour to make pancakes without 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.700
 lumps must first be done 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.710
 thick dough like pancakes that is 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.320
 mix the kefir with flour and then 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.450
 dilute his milk in the meantime 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.850
 milk has become hot it is desirable not 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.130
 bring to a boil so that there is no wenge 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.200
 which may appear now 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.420
 pour in a small trickle 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.880
 milk in the dough is constantly stirring 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.660
 whisk and rush choux dough on 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.810
 pancakes 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.390
 if the dough turned out too thin not 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 sprinkle flour immediately low and 3 part 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.160
 dough in sept there flour thoroughly 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.130
 stir to avoid lumps and 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.110
 connect with the remaining dough and in 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.899
 when finished add two tablespoons 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.550
 vegetable oil and carefully 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.170
 stir in the dough should definitely 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.300
 add vegetable oil 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.459
 then your pancakes won't stick 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.590
 pan and in turn you 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.850
 much less oil is needed when 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.700
 you will fry pancakes 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.430
 dough for pancakes on emptiness should 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.160
 be like liquid sour cream or 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.780
 fatty cream but in any case not as 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.100
 water 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.690
 fry pancakes on both sides to 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.910
 Rosy golden color 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.220
 you need to turn the pancakes gently 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.170
 so as not to tear them you can use 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.590
 special 3 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.349
 spatula or knife I used to do with a knife 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.530
 edges and turn over my hands but this is already 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.360
 if your fingers are used to hot ready 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.140
 pancakes can be served immediately with 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.069
 sour cream 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:45.110
 berries and honey jam or syrup 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.110
