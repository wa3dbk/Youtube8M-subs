00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello dear friends of curiosity know 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.109
 you actually giraffe what loud 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.120
 make what loud foxes do 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.120
 We know after this song at the latest 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.060
 but my serious about this song you have 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.080
 more often heard which loud foxes 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.779
 really do that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.609
 7 and already endangered which noisy 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.390
 make giraffes will hardly be 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.369
 waves 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.420
 but we clarify the answer today 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:40.950
 will surprise you 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:42.629
 Let's go first, you have to say 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.910
 that the tires are not really 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.739
 talkative when they are loud by yourself 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.629
 then mostly give when worried 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.760
 but then they manage to do so 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.840
 several dozen kilometers away but 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.309
 how do you do that? 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.719
 I mean you do not listen to him yes 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.859
 Any giraffes shouting loudly 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.989
 quite simply they communicate in the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.140
 so-called infrasound area is the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.210
 inaudible to the human ear 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.710
 Sounds have to oscillate at 60 hertz 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.780
 the human ear can hear it 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.030
 the giraffe sounds though 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.090
 much lower it is a kind 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.890
 extreme what infrasonic sounds have 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.810
 advantage that you both through the air 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.130
 as well as through the earth extremely far 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.439
 can be worn 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.450
 with it humans infrasound tones 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.350
 they should be able to perceive extreme 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.180
 be loud 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.250
 but then we would only be a kind 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.290
 vibration as perceived by a bass 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.060
 but the giraffes are a lot 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.630
 much quieter thus it could also 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.189
 do not listen 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.049
 not only do we communicate openly in the 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.420
 Infrasound area also for example 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.950
 blue tub and elephants trumpeting 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.020
 For example, the elephant is only 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.060
 extremely rarely used in normal 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.850
 use it is as if almost 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.770
 the elephants grumble 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.570
 But you are not quite there now 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.670
 looks empty and never a giraffe 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.530
 I have shown you now 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.190
 what sounds young boys the weapons 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.190
 sometimes do it 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.580

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.330
 was interesting find me thumbs 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.770
