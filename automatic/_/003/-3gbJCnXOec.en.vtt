00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello everybody today because to give 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.279
 you a quick tip on a video 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.200
 very quick 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.150
 Today's tip on how to apply the mask 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.700
 of eyelashes pro if they stay longer 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.920
 bulky ones come crooked 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.049
 then this tip will not have anything too much 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.359
 nothing much of a revolution is just 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.830
 small tips small details but that 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.869
 make all the difference at the time of 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.740
 application of the French mark so let's 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.740
 There we start the month. 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.100
 so we always before applying the 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.110
 Eyelash Mascara It 's good for us to make a 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.600
 black trace he well understands the root 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.120
 eyelashes no longer masks 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.470
 even if you do not go to use shadow 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.270
 will use the eyeliner 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.150
 You have to do a good dash. 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.680
 thin not to blur as well in the 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.620
 root of lashes when you pass 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.850
 mask people root lashes end up 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.590
 dying a little then in this 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.510
 makeup I'm wearing today is a 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.000
 makeup for day to day I spent a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.520
 brown umbrella and now I'll get it with the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.260
 shadow even a black shade like 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.479
 dino bevelled brush 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.100
 I'll take some of the shade and make 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.060
 a trace of the environment 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.060
 the root of eyelashes 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.970
 So, look, it 's just a good drive. 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.790
 does not even mean that it is 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.830
 drawn is just a little detail and extra 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.270
 Just like I said will not 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.220
 wear the mask because we're going to 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.260
 apply the mascara from the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.270
 root of eyelashes and extra so too 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.980
 serves to give an effect of lashes more 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.350
 elongated eyelashes larger 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.900
 I have three favorite masks is the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.430
 maybelline colossal is a mask 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.860
 super famous 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.160
 only that the applicator of it is very big 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.260
 so it's easier to erase using 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.800
 because the applicator is 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.800
 great 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.770
 leaves and beautiful children well 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.280
 bulky other mask I like 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.860
 this is the very dior show my look this 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.540
 so has the very tiny applicator 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.620
 so it makes it much easier at the time of 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.570
 application 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.320
 I really like this idea and the dollar is 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.600
 max best east her pain is also well 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.840
 cool he is not the coarse applicator 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.210
 is equal to the colossal and it gives an effect 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.010
 Gorgeous on the lashes is the mask that most 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.320
 my day to day and today I'm going to make 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.870
 video application with it I have a 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.209
 nice tip also that this machine 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.220
 that declines that it comes complicating well 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.739
 Little boy but here's to do. 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.020
 application in the nooks and crannies in the corner 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.640
 and also in the outer corner and 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.709
 here on the lower eyelashes yesterday several 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.080
 ways to apply the mask a lot 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.870
 people apply only so with these 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.480
 normal movements a lot of people explain 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.130
 that the movement was said to be gonzague but I 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.510
 I'll teach you a good way. 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.310
 cool to apply that leaves the eyelashes 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.709
 books a while back I applied 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.570
 five normal design moves her now 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.430
 I learned a new little detail that changes 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.290
 all the effect of the mask that leaves the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.940
 Well extended lashes leaves the eyelashes 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.010
 well but sinned at the time of application to 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.650
 instead of only doing the movements of 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.640
 zig zag you give a close in yours 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.980
 I now take a close look and then the 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.550
 children will have a more 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.050
 curved and more elongated then it is only this 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.220
 detail may seem that there is no 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.019
 no difference 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.390
 but it makes a lot of difference you put the 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.440
 much more of the children gives a 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.440
 closed in the eye 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:03.319
 This lock on the eye leaves the children. 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.580
 very curved and always with movement 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.670
 design 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.900
 they are getting goods and stop them 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.560
 do not stick together 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.820
 if your kids stick together, you'll get 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.840
 with tweezers and peeling off is another small 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.340
 detail that makes all the difference 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.070
 especially for those who have children 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.770
 very bright little blondes like mine 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.410
 if you do the application here in 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.040
 upper eyelashes you pass the 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.450
 here from top to bottom 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.430
 so it's interesting to do that 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.290
 black back 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.930
 before making the application that 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.620
 small outlined there not to erase 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.410
 At that time look you do the application 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:51.260
 All down now comes back with that 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:54.470
 movement in the beginning and white guy and 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.750
 make the movement slide 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.910
 so we may even appear to be useless 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.070
 these tips are small tips are 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.810
 small details that make the whole 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.400
 difference in application time like me 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.740
 I said a while ago I did not do it. 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.990
 this method and I could not have a 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.550
 son so beautiful looked at the children 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.290
 of other people think I have 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.350
 it not to apply a mask is 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.240
 so beautiful and with these techniques I 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.890
 I managed to leave my children well nets 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.650
 well the way I wanted it and the lashes 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.260
 very little to apply a 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.419
 brush very light 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.890
 I do not get too loaded aids 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.530
 not to get one paw aspect 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.550
 spider even as well as only light 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.550
 women tapping the 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.919
 So these people were mine. 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.540
 small tips when applying the 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.610
