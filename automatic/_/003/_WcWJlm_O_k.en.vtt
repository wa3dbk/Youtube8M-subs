programs that you're using regularly now

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.259 
programs that you're using regularly now
there<00:00:23.189> are<00:00:23.310> different<00:00:23.580> ways<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.910> doing<00:00:24.060> this

there are different ways of doing this

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.630 
there are different ways of doing this
through<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> task<00:00:24.869> scheduler<00:00:25.199> but<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.310> not

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
always guaranteed to work in this way

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.389 
always guaranteed to work in this way
we'll<00:00:28.910> so<00:00:29.910> we're<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.240> bypass<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.949> USA

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
we'll so we're going to bypass the USA

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.330 
we'll so we're going to bypass the USA
with<00:00:32.520> Revo<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.680> program<00:00:35.010> we're<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.219> to

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
with Revo so the program we're going to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.139 
with Revo so the program we're going to
use<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:36.210> program<00:00:37.200> called<00:00:37.230> Microsoft

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
use is a program called Microsoft

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.380 
use is a program called Microsoft

you'll<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.320> after<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:44.010> from

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
you'll see here what after you get from

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.860 
you'll see here what after you get from
the<00:00:44.399> internet<00:00:44.520> or<00:00:45.030> Google<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.450> you'll<00:00:45.629> find

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the internet or Google and you'll find

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.700 
the internet or Google and you'll find
it<00:00:47.120> what<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.450> do<00:00:48.570> here<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.020> simply<00:00:49.350> go<00:00:49.530> into

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it what we can do here is simply go into

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.830 
it what we can do here is simply go into
the<00:00:49.829> 64-bit<00:00:50.489> because<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.420> Revo<00:00:51.660> Uninstaller

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the 64-bit because the Revo Uninstaller

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.220 
the 64-bit because the Revo Uninstaller
is<00:00:52.410> 64-bit<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.360> open<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.750> our<00:00:54.960> thing

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
is 64-bit so it just open up our thing

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.529 
is 64-bit so it just open up our thing
and<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.500> will<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> USC<00:00:56.309> asking<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.969> can

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
and you will get the USC asking you can

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.220 
and you will get the USC asking you can
we<00:00:57.690> run<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:59.070> that

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
we run it on this you have to have that

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.219 
we run it on this you have to have that

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
can do a test run just to make sure that

can do a test run just to make sure that
it's<00:02:00.360> running<00:02:00.450> without<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.020> UAC<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> just

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
it's running without the UAC so just

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.770 
it's running without the UAC so just
just<00:02:04.050> run<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.350> ok<00:02:04.800> and<00:02:08.630> there<00:02:09.630> it<00:02:09.750> comes

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
just run it ok and there it comes

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.400 
just run it ok and there it comes
