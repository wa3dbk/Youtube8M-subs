00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello everyone, Tashir, does this mean 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.830
 it's time to talk about clash of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.560
 clans 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.389
 this is a twist yes you understood correctly 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.849
 our clan is already the fourth level 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.040
 means more new privileges are available 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.220
 gave us a super power and gave a great bonus 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.010
 form of double x pawns in honor of the past 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.289
 one year after seeing clan-war a and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.300
 so on the fourth level we will remove 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.490
 donations of 6 warriors and of course 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.369
 extra space for military booty 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.890
 they alternate that extra military 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.110
 mining is a place for it 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.059
 a limit of donations of 6 warriors is 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.969
 means that now we can fully 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.000
 close request for 25 places with the same 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.040
 magicians for example and thus faster 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.110
 I donâ€™t know why to raise my level 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:57.090
 high level is needed in the game but brandon 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:01:01.350
 definitely appreciate everything but random 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.729
 chose the chinese one hundred and nine wins and 4 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.670
 clan level and we won we won 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.900
 the Chinese with the fourth level of the clan also 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.970
 spent at 5 so less than 9990 and 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.150
 traditions i would like to show you three 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.640
 attacks from this to in unfortunately among you 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.509
 x10 there were no interesting specimens but I 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.570
 can show 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.640
 not successful attack on this base I tried 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.950
 take three stars and let's see what 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.590
 I got all the air out of it 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.070
 critically bad and i consider this scope 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.850
 one of the hardest and who is real and and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.810
 got hold of 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.540
 and you blows x10 at 3 stars 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.759
 really mastered the game here I 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.549
 a little late with the release of the heroes and 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.670
 Clank ass and my golem quickly dies 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.530
 from enemy mages and bows I take the jump 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.110
 which replaces quite a lot 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.840
 bombers especially there is an inferno 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.210
 who quickly fries it here my king 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.820
 went a little bit unpredictable he went to 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.610
 the center was waiting for him a great surprise from 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.970
 a large cluster of damage and there he 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.820
 Of course, quickly dies without even having time 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.240
 kill enemy warriors according to plan I have to 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.700
 was from this place my troops should have been 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.760
 disperse friend directions queen on 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.910
 bottom and a king on top but how 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.950
 see everything happened a little bit wrong and 1p 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.240
 remained untouched and that meant 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.100
 the failure of the same so I do not know 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.400
 trial programs 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.310
 and so predict what will happen 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.570
 it was impossible but I still hoped 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.209
 that 2 Ali was captured however I became 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.880
 act on the situation 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.209
 hoped to still get my reach 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.300
 troops on 3 stars but 1 of course 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.700
 prevented this from doing the hounds die 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.730
 plan on was supposed to fly through 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.620
 the center would not have killed the balls and the whole 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.870
 my army would meet successfully in 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.660
 center from where they finished off the remainder of the guns 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.820
 of this region but the wizard also behaved 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.800
 sufficient aggressive and literally with 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.739
 several shots 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.370
 ruined a whole bunch of balls will i 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.800
 a little bit 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.060
 hurried with the release of minions I could 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.910
 take 2 stars here 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.860
 but since it was still a drop of hope 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:28.320
 that the balls will fly to the top sings a 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.290
 I decided to release them in time to finish 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.570
 three stars attack let them go in a circle they 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.019
 accordingly flew around the base and not 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:40.070
 turned on the town hall and from this we have 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:44.310
 quite a few percent almost all 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.230
 demolished edition but didn't get to town 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.989
 hall and not finished off the first 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.900
 put combat would have won the attack here 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.570
 so sometimes the way this release 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.890
 hit all the attacks of NATO base this is the top 3 x 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.989
 10 top you are x8 and top tx 9 rivals here 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.519
 this base is very famous it exists 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.480
 almost mid 2014 it is more 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.909
 spread out 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.120
 multiplayer them we and closer to the master 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.930
 such guys will see or what she is cunning 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.070
 seemingly 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.650
 hogom and its easy to demolish and double boom in 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.530
 there is no center especially here generally it seems 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.990
 would not have double bombs but she is cunning by 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.080
 two reasons for them about gamma and and not to demolish 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.110
 Well, firstly, this is the maximum pumping 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.770
 the most rival but the list goes on 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.010
 it acervuline buildings and it means a lot 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.930
 damage and the next reason is that a lot 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.699
 The building stands on the edges so hoke 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.860
 will run one for each 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.289
 the building and of course perish one by one 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.919
 in the end and in the amount they are not enough for 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.530
 development 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.410
 but he is not a husband acting in a different way 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.570
 he takes this base by air too 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.350
 it was difficult to do it because 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.780
 the buildings 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.840
 I repeat is from the edge and the balls will be 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.930
 fly off on them but he thought it all out 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.630
 to touch the side buildings let 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.630
 respectively hounds and balls behind them 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.870
 they flew the exact trajectory in advance 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.650
 calculated so there are many 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.669
 balls left by the racer themselves small 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.630
 these sunny 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:24.000
 flying birds and a lot of time very 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.760
 long enough for even the same 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.760
 the air that employs such a supply 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:45.200
 and we have a question what a surprise can we 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:47.390
 expect on the way there are those layers 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.000
 have to spend a lot of hogov for and 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.950
 from the nose and further you we tilt the castle 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.100
 together with the disposal of a large bomb 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.380
 so as not to waste too much and had time 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.040
 the horse of glory main is the time to lead him 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.120
 on the edge 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.240
 there stands mordor not a very good edge 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.000
 chose 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.250
 our loop is a novice however also please 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.880
 pay attention to the base so well 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.670
 some kind of wonderful arrangement than you 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.740
 it went like a choice here very much 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.170
 complex and for the hogas there is a lot 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.140
 obstacles in the form of video traps such 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:24.680
 hidden bombs that will stand in 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:27.950
 absolutely do not predict their locations or 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.020
 the same dragons where the 3rd will melt 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.930
 not in the center but in completely different parts 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.600
 bases there are very difficult to decide but 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.150
 the base, after all, must be demolished and he took the risk 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.150
 go hog and especially 22 pieces 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.540
 pre-drain it a little from this edge 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.250
 lets his clan caste in which he was 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.040
 extra stock of hogs and another 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.650
 go here this edge is all done 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.660
 so again that the course did not go 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.070
 around the base so as not one by one 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.570
 distracted by the same single guns and 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.820
 accordingly ran crowd like this 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.910
 must make the same balls when attacking with 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.850
 Toby hounds should do it and hoge on 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.650
 the eighth and ninth holly coupon all the more 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.990
 spell have limited both 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.300
 actions and therefore efficiency will be the most 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.430
 high in this case 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.740
 I defused the bomb beforehand 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.660
 save extra hilka which 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.630
 allowed to spread this base to a hundred 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:26.680
 percent and not allow the king to kill 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.680
 all pigs 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.620
 Well, here came the release end of me very 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.960
 liked the results impose war 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.360
 and I hope that you have learned for yourself 

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.370
