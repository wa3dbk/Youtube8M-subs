always try to do is picture how would
the<00:00:54.579> glass<00:00:54.760> look<00:00:55.380> if<00:00:56.520> once<00:00:57.520> it's<00:00:57.700> mounted<00:00:57.880> on

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
the glass look if once it's mounted on

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.060 
the glass look if once it's mounted on
it<00:00:58.480> so<00:00:59.020> I<00:00:59.050> think<00:00:59.230> I'm<00:00:59.470> going<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.620> go<00:00:59.770> ahead<00:00:59.890> and

you can use a bigger file you can use

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.719 
you can use a bigger file you can use
just<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.530> edge<00:01:27.250> of<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:28.860> regular<00:01:29.860> fine

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
just the edge of a regular fine

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.850 
just the edge of a regular fine
file<00:01:30.940> you<00:01:31.540> want<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.810> have<00:01:31.930> a<00:01:31.960> fairly<00:01:32.470> fine

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
tooth on it now I know that from looking

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.140 
tooth on it now I know that from looking
at<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.570> depth<00:01:38.159> down<00:01:39.159> in<00:01:39.430> here<00:01:39.790> and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
at the the depth down in here and

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.140 
at the the depth down in here and
comparing<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.810> two<00:01:40.990> side-by-side<00:01:41.290> I<00:01:42.150> know

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
comparing the two side-by-side I know

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.550 
comparing the two side-by-side I know
that<00:01:43.450> I'm<00:01:43.510> going<00:01:43.600> to<00:01:43.659> want<00:01:43.900> to<00:01:43.930> cut<00:01:44.140> this<00:01:44.320> one

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
that I'm going to want to cut this one

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.240 
that I'm going to want to cut this one
right<00:01:45.430> about<00:01:45.850> here

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
right about here

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.530 
right about here
so<00:01:48.250> what<00:01:48.340> I'm<00:01:48.400> going<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.580> do<00:01:48.759> you<00:01:49.090> just<00:01:49.299> take<00:01:49.509> it

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
so what I'm going to do you just take it

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.460 
so what I'm going to do you just take it
and<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:50.350> just<00:01:50.380> simply<00:01:50.860> score<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:52.380> we'll<00:01:53.380> go

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
and you just simply score it we'll go

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.490 
and you just simply score it we'll go
ahead<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:53.799> do<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:56.020> reason<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.290> use<00:01:56.320> a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
ahead and do that and the reason I use a

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.920 
ahead and do that and the reason I use a
towel<00:01:56.799> down<00:01:56.979> here<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.280> because<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.670> does

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
towel down here is because it does

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.319 
towel down here is because it does
generate<00:01:58.930> some<00:01:59.259> some<00:01:59.740> very<00:02:00.369> fine<00:02:00.700> glass

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
generate some some very fine glass

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:08.490 
generate some some very fine glass
particles<00:02:04.079> once<00:02:05.079> we<00:02:05.229> score<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:08.290> take

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
particles once we score it I just take

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.759 
particles once we score it I just take
and<00:02:08.679> just<00:02:08.739> work<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.130> right<00:02:09.700> on<00:02:09.880> around<00:02:10.769> making

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
and just work it right on around making

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.069 
and just work it right on around making
sure<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.250> can<00:02:12.400> hear<00:02:12.579> the<00:02:12.730> graph<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.810> glass

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
sure you can hear the graph the glass

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:23.060 
sure you can hear the graph the glass
that<00:02:15.570> gritty<00:02:16.570> sound<00:02:16.930> underneath<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:17.980> it

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.200 

they<00:02:24.070> put<00:02:24.280> my<00:02:24.400> thumb<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.790> way<00:02:24.910> but<00:02:25.090> that's

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
they put my thumb in the way but that's

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.480 
they put my thumb in the way but that's
the<00:02:25.360> way<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.540> usually<00:02:25.840> will<00:02:26.200> get<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.890> around<00:02:27.190> is

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
the way I usually will get it around is

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.950 
the way I usually will get it around is
let<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.820> ride<00:02:28.000> against<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.540> edge<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.870> my

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
let it ride against the edge of my

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.590 
let it ride against the edge of my
thumbnail<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:30.460> I'm<00:02:30.580> not<00:02:30.730> trying<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.120> solve

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
thumbnail and I'm not trying to solve

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.530 
thumbnail and I'm not trying to solve
through<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.230> just<00:02:32.410> simply<00:02:32.560> want<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:32.980> score

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
through it you just simply want to score

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.570 
through it you just simply want to score
have<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.570> good<00:02:34.840> clean<00:02:35.200> score<00:02:35.620> mark<00:02:35.920> on<00:02:36.100> the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
have a good clean score mark on the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.970 
have a good clean score mark on the
glass<00:02:36.790> now<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.240> stem<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.890> actually<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:38.950> think

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
glass now this stem is actually I think

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.380 
glass now this stem is actually I think
it's<00:02:39.250> some<00:02:39.610> like<00:02:40.330> eight<00:02:40.630> sided<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.790> I've<00:02:43.150> got

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
it's some like eight sided so I've got

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.960 
it's some like eight sided so I've got
the<00:02:43.660> flats<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:44.680> score<00:02:45.010> through<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.700> I've<00:02:45.820> also

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
the flats to score through and I've also

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.700 
the flats to score through and I've also
got<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.450> angles<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.140> score<00:02:49.050> now<00:02:50.050> unlike

got the angles to score now unlike

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.480 
got the angles to score now unlike
cutting<00:02:51.220> regular<00:02:51.850> glass<00:02:52.800> where<00:02:53.800> they<00:02:54.250> say

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
once you use a glass cutter and go

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.710 
once you use a glass cutter and go
through<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:58.000> never<00:02:58.180> want<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.420> go<00:02:58.540> back

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
a score mark all the way around it now

for<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:43.070> usually<00:04:43.250> just<00:04:43.760> once<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.210> once<00:04:44.450> I

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
for and it usually just once that once I

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.510 
for and it usually just once that once I
have<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:44.900> lined<00:04:45.110> up<00:04:45.290> and<00:04:45.440> I<00:04:45.470> know<00:04:45.530> that<00:04:45.680> when<00:04:46.430> it

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
have it lined up and I know that when it

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.040 
have it lined up and I know that when it

slides off my fingernail it's going to

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.570 
slides off my fingernail it's going to
hit<00:04:48.169> that<00:04:48.350> score<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:51.220> that's<00:04:52.220> all<00:04:52.400> there<00:04:52.550> is

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
hit that score and that's all there is

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.390 
hit that score and that's all there is
to<00:04:52.850> it<00:04:53.050> even<00:04:54.050> though<00:04:54.350> this<00:04:54.530> fracture<00:04:55.130> is<00:04:55.160> out

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
to it even though this fracture is out

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.030 
to it even though this fracture is out
just<00:04:55.729> a<00:04:55.880> little<00:04:56.270> bit<00:04:56.450> right<00:04:56.479> here<00:04:56.690> that<00:04:57.620> is<00:04:57.830> not

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
just a little bit right here that is not

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.770 
just a little bit right here that is not
a<00:04:58.070> big<00:04:58.460> issue<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.900> reason<00:05:00.290> being<00:05:00.530> is<00:05:00.860> that

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
a big issue the reason being is that

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.140 
a big issue the reason being is that
when<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:02.960> use<00:05:03.669> well<00:05:04.669> I<00:05:04.850> use<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:07.150> three-ton

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
when you use well I use a three-ton

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.060 
when you use well I use a three-ton
5-minute<00:05:08.960> waterproof<00:05:09.410> epoxy<00:05:10.070> to<00:05:10.940> mount<00:05:12.070> the

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
5-minute waterproof epoxy to mount the

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.050 
5-minute waterproof epoxy to mount the
stem<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:13.520> base<00:05:13.700> together<00:05:15.490> when<00:05:16.490> I<00:05:16.520> do<00:05:16.640> that

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
stem and base together when I do that

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.340 
stem and base together when I do that
the<00:05:17.810> epoxy<00:05:18.500> is<00:05:18.740> going<00:05:19.190> to<00:05:19.400> take<00:05:19.640> care<00:05:19.940> of

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
the epoxy is going to take care of

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.110 
the epoxy is going to take care of
covering<00:05:21.350> and<00:05:21.530> filling<00:05:21.950> all<00:05:22.220> of<00:05:22.250> this<00:05:22.550> end<00:05:22.850> so

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
covering and filling all of this end so

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.400 
covering and filling all of this end so
that<00:05:23.270> when<00:05:23.390> you<00:05:23.479> look<00:05:23.690> through<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:24.020> bottom<00:05:24.350> of

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
that when you look through the bottom of

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.409 
that when you look through the bottom of
the<00:05:24.500> glass<00:05:24.740> you<00:05:25.400> literally<00:05:25.700> will<00:05:25.970> not<00:05:26.030> see
