and essentially what it does is it makes

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.150 
and essentially what it does is it makes
you<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> baby<00:00:15.599> when<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.080> spawn<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.680> as<00:00:16.830> thang

you a baby when you spawn and as thang

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.210 
you a baby when you spawn and as thang
progresses<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.240> will<00:00:18.270> get<00:00:18.660> older<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.529> bigger

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
about how laggy my minecraft was so I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.120 
about how laggy my minecraft was so I
decided<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.600> look<00:00:33.719> into<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.950> was

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
decided to look into that and it was

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.340 
decided to look into that and it was
actually<00:00:35.670> not<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:36.809> actually<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.230> my

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
actually not it's not actually on my

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.369 
actually not it's not actually on my
part<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:38.000> because<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.239> Sony<00:00:39.450> Vegas<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:40.200> some

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
part it's because of Sony Vegas for some

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.139 
part it's because of Sony Vegas for some
reason<00:00:40.710> I'll<00:00:40.829> try<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> fix<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:42.000> this

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
reason I'll try to fix it but if this

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.209 
reason I'll try to fix it but if this
video<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.780> laggy<00:00:43.020> then<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.649> probably

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
video is so laggy then I probably

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.040 
video is so laggy then I probably
