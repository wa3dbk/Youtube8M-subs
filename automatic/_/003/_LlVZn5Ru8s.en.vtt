okay<00:00:05.970> so<00:00:06.029> at<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.390> point<00:00:06.600> our<00:00:06.839> characters

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
okay so at this point our characters

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.200 
okay so at this point our characters
moving<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.400> next<00:00:08.610> thing<00:00:08.730> we<00:00:08.790> want<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.000> do

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
moving and the next thing we want to do

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.480 
moving and the next thing we want to do
is<00:00:09.450> set<00:00:09.719> up<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.050> animation<00:00:10.530> system<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.309> will

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
is set up the animation system that will

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.089 
is set up the animation system that will
allow<00:00:11.670> him<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.230> move<00:00:13.230> around<00:00:13.500> but<00:00:13.799> I'm<00:00:13.920> gonna

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
allow him to move around but I'm gonna

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.499 
allow him to move around but I'm gonna
give<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.340> kind<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.610> heads<00:00:14.639> up<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.179> between

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
give you kind of a heads up in between

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.060 
give you kind of a heads up in between
videos<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.139> was<00:00:16.260> playing<00:00:16.560> around<00:00:16.740> with<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
videos I was playing around with the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.070 
videos I was playing around with the
level<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.580> made<00:00:18.240> things<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.510> little<00:00:18.600> bit<00:00:18.779> bigger

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
level I made things a little bit bigger

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.689 
level I made things a little bit bigger
I<00:00:19.439> made<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> couple<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.189> copies<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
I made a couple of copies of the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.970 
I made a couple of copies of the
platform<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.840> if<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.990> play<00:00:22.199> real<00:00:22.410> quick<00:00:22.619> you'll

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
platform so if I play real quick you'll

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.470 
platform so if I play real quick you'll
see<00:00:23.160> things<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.910> little<00:00:24.330> bit

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
see things are just a little bit

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.269 
see things are just a little bit
different<00:00:24.869> than<00:00:24.990> they<00:00:25.080> were<00:00:25.160> we've<00:00:26.160> got

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
different than they were we've got

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.910 
different than they were we've got
something<00:00:26.490> now<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:27.000> jump<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.680> so<00:00:28.680> what

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
something now we can jump up on so what

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.560 
something now we can jump up on so what
we're<00:00:29.010> gonna<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.279> now<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.640> set<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
we're gonna do now is set up the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.669 
we're gonna do now is set up the
animation<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.080> we'll<00:00:31.199> go<00:00:31.289> ahead<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.439> add<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
animation and we'll go ahead and add a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.590 
animation and we'll go ahead and add a
jump<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.160> here<00:00:32.309> as<00:00:32.399> well<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.759> fact<00:00:33.000> I'm

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
jump in here as well in fact I'm

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.930 
jump in here as well in fact I'm
probably<00:00:33.690> easier<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.260> do<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.590> first<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.670> here

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
probably easier to do that first so here

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.459 
probably easier to do that first so here
we<00:00:36.030> are<00:00:36.059> back<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.630> character<00:00:36.960> blueprint

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
we are back in the character blueprint

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.729 
we are back in the character blueprint
and<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.399> jump<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.910> really<00:00:39.510> easy<00:00:39.780> because

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
and the jump is really easy because

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.479 
and the jump is really easy because
earlier<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.280> our<00:00:41.340> inputs<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.940> added<00:00:42.360> an<00:00:43.170> action

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
earlier in our inputs we added an action

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.740 
earlier in our inputs we added an action
input<00:00:44.489> action<00:00:44.730> for<00:00:44.940> jumping<00:00:45.239> all<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.480> got<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.690> do

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
input action for jumping all I got to do

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.350 
input action for jumping all I got to do
is<00:00:45.870> type<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.260> jump<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.070> if<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:47.940> take<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> look

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
is type in jump and if you take a look

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.729 
is type in jump and if you take a look
in<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.600> you'll<00:00:48.780> see<00:00:48.960> action<00:00:49.289> events<00:00:49.559> for

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
in here you'll see action events for

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.459 
in here you'll see action events for
jumping<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.879> create<00:00:51.180> one<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.390> those<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.020> I'll

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
jumping so create one of those and I'll

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.220 
jumping so create one of those and I'll
drag<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> wire<00:00:52.949> off<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.699> type<00:00:53.940> in

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
drag a wire off this and just type in

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.540 
drag a wire off this and just type in
jump<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.800> see<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.070> comes<00:00:56.219> right<00:00:56.430> in

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
jump and you see that comes right in

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.760 
jump and you see that comes right in
with<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> character<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.390> boom<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.620> go

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
with the character so boom there we go

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.160 
with the character so boom there we go
that's<00:00:59.039> really<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.850> need<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.989> could

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that's really all we need to do we could

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.360 
that's really all we need to do we could
go<00:01:01.289> ahead<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.469> put<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> comment<00:01:01.890> block<00:01:02.190> around

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
go ahead and put a comment block around

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.440 
go ahead and put a comment block around
that<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.789> consistency<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.570> call<00:01:04.379> this

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
that for consistency and call this

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.500 
that for consistency and call this
jumping<00:01:06.799> okay<00:01:07.799> now<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.189> want<00:01:08.790> our<00:01:09.030> character

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
jumping okay now we want our character

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.320 
jumping okay now we want our character
to<00:01:10.280> animate<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.640> way<00:01:12.119> we're<00:01:12.270> gonna

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
to animate and the way we're gonna

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.200 
to animate and the way we're gonna
handle<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.170> by<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.220> custom<00:01:14.820> event

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
handle that is by way of a custom event

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
handle that is by way of a custom event
with<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> little<00:01:16.049> bit<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.229> blueprint<00:01:16.590> logic

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
with a little bit of blueprint logic

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.850 
with a little bit of blueprint logic
it's<00:01:17.280> important<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> note<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:18.119> now

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
it's important to note that right now

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.320 
it's important to note that right now
animation<00:01:19.860> blueprints<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:20.759> work<00:01:21.119> with

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
animation blueprints do not work with

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.510 
animation blueprints do not work with
paper<00:01:21.540> 2d<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.560> really<00:01:23.070> what<00:01:23.189> we're<00:01:23.280> gonna<00:01:23.369> do

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
paper 2d so really what we're gonna do

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.310 
paper 2d so really what we're gonna do
is<00:01:23.670> create<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> logic<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.659> will<00:01:24.780> swap<00:01:25.080> out

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
is create the logic that will swap out

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.530 
is create the logic that will swap out
between<00:01:26.009> our<00:01:26.400> different<00:01:26.970> character<00:01:27.330> flip

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
between our different character flip

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.190 
between our different character flip
books<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:28.829> from<00:01:28.920> there<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:30.200> let's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
books and just go from there so let's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.390 
books and just go from there so let's
start<00:01:32.100> off<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.579> our<00:01:32.729> own<00:01:32.939> custom<00:01:33.360> events<00:01:34.400> now

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
start off with our own custom events now

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.039 
start off with our own custom events now
this<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.700> essentially<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> exact<00:01:36.540> same<00:01:36.750> setup

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
this is essentially the exact same setup

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.130 
this is essentially the exact same setup
that<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.890> created<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> template<00:01:39.150> once<00:01:39.930> we

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that is created in the template once we

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.569 
that is created in the template once we
get<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.500> done<00:01:40.770> I'll<00:01:41.100> show<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.400> how<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
get this done I'll show you how to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.280 
get this done I'll show you how to
change<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:41.970> over<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.270> something<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.630> bit<00:01:42.780> more

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
change this over to something a bit more

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.109 
change this over to something a bit more
like<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> state<00:01:43.860> machine<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.369> will<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
like a state machine that will be a

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.030 
like a state machine that will be a
little<00:01:45.329> more<00:01:45.570> extensible<00:01:46.470> later<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:46.950> you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
little more extensible later on if you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.649 
little more extensible later on if you
wanted<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.280> add<00:01:47.369> your<00:01:47.549> own<00:01:47.700> animations<00:01:48.240> I'm

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
wanted to add your own animations I'm

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.210 
wanted to add your own animations I'm
gonna<00:01:48.840> call<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.460> update<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.850> animation

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
gonna call this update and animation

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.910 
gonna call this update and animation
like<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.659> what's<00:01:55.229> gonna<00:01:55.320> happen<00:01:55.439> on

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
like so and then what's gonna happen on

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.649 
like so and then what's gonna happen on
update<00:01:56.460> animation<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.119> we're<00:01:57.450> essentially

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
update animation is we're essentially

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.120 
update animation is we're essentially
just<00:01:57.930> gonna<00:01:58.110> get<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> velocity<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
just gonna get the velocity of the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.069 
just gonna get the velocity of the
character<00:01:59.490> we're<00:02:00.030> gonna<00:02:00.119> convert<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.750> over

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
character we're gonna convert that over

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.230 
character we're gonna convert that over
to<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> boolean<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.219> basically<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.850> he<00:02:03.090> moving

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
to a boolean so basically is he moving

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.420 
to a boolean so basically is he moving
or<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.780> he<00:02:03.899> not<00:02:03.930> moving<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:04.979> we're<00:02:05.159> going

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
or is he not moving and then we're going

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.800 
or is he not moving and then we're going
to<00:02:05.460> perform<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.689> select<00:02:07.320> between<00:02:07.649> our<00:02:08.340> two<00:02:08.970> our

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
to perform a select between our two our

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.440 
to perform a select between our two our
two<00:02:10.379> animation<00:02:10.860> flip<00:02:11.039> books<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.670> control

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
two animation flip books to control

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.180 
two animation flip books to control
the<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:13.020> character<00:02:13.379> either<00:02:13.620> running<00:02:14.040> or

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the the character either running or

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.970 
the the character either running or
standing<00:02:14.879> in<00:02:14.940> his<00:02:15.060> idle<00:02:15.420> pose<00:02:15.629> so<00:02:16.410> first<00:02:16.709> let's

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
standing in his idle pose so first let's

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.309 
standing in his idle pose so first let's
go<00:02:17.040> ahead<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.310> get<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.459> velocity<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.390> now

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
go ahead and get that velocity so now

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.720 
go ahead and get that velocity so now
let's<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.620> type<00:02:20.160> in<00:02:20.840> velocity<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:23.489> boom

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
let's just type in velocity so boom

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.970 
let's just type in velocity so boom
we'll<00:02:23.970> get<00:02:24.060> velocity<00:02:24.300> let's<00:02:24.840> get<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.590> length

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
we'll get velocity let's get the length

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.280 
we'll get velocity let's get the length
of<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.459> velocity<00:02:26.970> vector<00:02:27.300> now<00:02:27.870> by<00:02:28.050> getting

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
of the velocity vector now by getting

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.479 
of the velocity vector now by getting
the<00:02:28.349> length<00:02:28.530> we're<00:02:28.739> essentially<00:02:29.069> doing<00:02:29.310> a

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
the length we're essentially doing a

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.339 
the length we're essentially doing a
speed<00:02:29.730> calculation<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.569> if<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:30.930> type<00:02:31.140> in

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
speed calculation so if you just type in

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.160 
speed calculation so if you just type in
length<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.400> grab<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.640> vector<00:02:32.880> length<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
length and grab the vector length the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.570 
length and grab the vector length the
length<00:02:34.349> of<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.560> velocity<00:02:34.950> vector<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.370> same

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
length of a velocity vector is the same

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.460 
length of a velocity vector is the same
as<00:02:35.760> speed<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.239> what<00:02:36.360> we're<00:02:36.480> gonna<00:02:36.569> do<00:02:36.840> here<00:02:37.290> is

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
as speed and what we're gonna do here is

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.339 
as speed and what we're gonna do here is
essentially<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:38.790> see<00:02:39.030> if<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.299> is<00:02:39.840> greater

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
essentially just see if that is greater

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.780 
essentially just see if that is greater
than<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:41.069> value<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:42.150> zero<00:02:43.099> and<00:02:44.099> that's<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.580> that

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
than a value of zero and that's it that

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.000 
than a value of zero and that's it that
just<00:02:44.970> basically<00:02:45.269> says<00:02:45.569> is<00:02:45.780> he<00:02:46.080> moving<00:02:46.290> yes<00:02:46.860> or

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
just basically says is he moving yes or

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.479 
just basically says is he moving yes or
no<00:02:47.220> true<00:02:48.150> means<00:02:48.750> he's<00:02:48.930> moving<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.500> false

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
no true means he's moving and false

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.789 
no true means he's moving and false
means<00:02:50.790> he's<00:02:51.000> not<00:02:51.150> now<00:02:51.840> we're<00:02:52.230> going<00:02:52.349> to<00:02:52.470> use

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
means he's not now we're going to use

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.220 
means he's not now we're going to use
this<00:02:53.160> as<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.489> way<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.760> select<00:02:54.420> between<00:02:54.720> our

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
this as a way to select between our

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.350 
this as a way to select between our
different<00:02:55.799> flip<00:02:56.040> books<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.849> I'm<00:02:57.000> gonna<00:02:57.120> right

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
different flip books so I'm gonna right

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.600 
different flip books so I'm gonna right
click<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.780> just<00:02:57.959> create<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> select<00:02:58.950> node<00:02:59.310> now

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
click and just create a select node now

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.000 
click and just create a select node now
notice<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.180> am<00:03:00.269> not<00:03:00.510> creating<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.260> from<00:03:01.860> any

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
notice I am not creating this from any

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.339 
notice I am not creating this from any
existing<00:03:02.610> wire<00:03:02.880> that's<00:03:03.660> gonna<00:03:03.810> be<00:03:03.959> important

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
existing wire that's gonna be important

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.900 
existing wire that's gonna be important
and<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.739> select<00:03:05.010> node<00:03:05.160> is<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> kind<00:03:05.819> of<00:03:05.849> a

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
and the select node is a kind of a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.759 
and the select node is a kind of a
special<00:03:06.239> note<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:06.810> really<00:03:07.230> made<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.620> whole

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
special note it's really made of a whole

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.530 
special note it's really made of a whole
lot<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.099> different<00:03:08.370> wildcards<00:03:09.150> meaning<00:03:09.480> you

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
lot of different wildcards meaning you

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.839 
lot of different wildcards meaning you
can<00:03:09.720> plug<00:03:09.959> just<00:03:10.349> about<00:03:10.590> anything<00:03:10.980> into<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.549> and

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
can plug just about anything into it and

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.780 
can plug just about anything into it and
it<00:03:12.780> will<00:03:13.049> select<00:03:13.890> between<00:03:14.040> whatever<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.579> plug

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
it will select between whatever you plug

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.059 
it will select between whatever you plug
in<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.599> what<00:03:15.690> we're<00:03:15.780> gonna<00:03:15.840> do<00:03:16.110> is<00:03:16.290> take<00:03:16.920> this

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
in so what we're gonna do is take this

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.620 
in so what we're gonna do is take this
boolean<00:03:17.459> value<00:03:17.910> for<00:03:18.120> whether<00:03:18.299> or<00:03:18.359> not<00:03:18.450> we're

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
boolean value for whether or not we're

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.059 
boolean value for whether or not we're
moving<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.079> we'll<00:03:19.319> plug<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.709> into<00:03:19.920> the

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
moving and we'll plug that into the

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.559 
moving and we'll plug that into the
index<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:20.609> see<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.850> index<00:03:21.120> immediately

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
index and you see the index immediately

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.620 
index and you see the index immediately
updates<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.200> boolean<00:03:22.880> now<00:03:23.880> we<00:03:23.940> have<00:03:24.180> option

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
updates to a boolean now we have option

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.470 
updates to a boolean now we have option
0<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.200> option<00:03:26.130> 1<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.700> what<00:03:27.000> I'm<00:03:27.090> gonna<00:03:27.180> do<00:03:27.359> is

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
0 and option 1 and what I'm gonna do is

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.940

data<00:03:37.950> that<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.340> want<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.790> select<00:03:39.150> between<00:03:39.299> and

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
data that you want to select between and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.360 
data that you want to select between and
what<00:03:40.019> we<00:03:40.109> want<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.319> select<00:03:40.500> between<00:03:40.829> is<00:03:40.980> a

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
what we want to select between is a

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.670 
what we want to select between is a
flipbook<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.810> we'll<00:03:42.930> type<00:03:43.079> in<00:03:43.260> flipbook<00:03:43.590> and

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
flipbook so we'll type in flipbook and

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.960 
flipbook so we'll type in flipbook and
you'll<00:03:43.769> see<00:03:43.889> a<00:03:43.920> paper<00:03:44.130> flip<00:03:44.430> book<00:03:44.609> right<00:03:44.819> here

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
you'll see a paper flip book right here

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.509 
you'll see a paper flip book right here
so<00:03:45.630> click<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.280> so<00:03:47.280> we're<00:03:47.430> choosing

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
so click on that so we're choosing

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.890 
so click on that so we're choosing
between<00:03:47.760> two<00:03:48.030> different<00:03:48.239> flip<00:03:48.510> books<00:03:48.690> which

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
between two different flip books which

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.599 
between two different flip books which
is<00:03:48.989> perfect<00:03:49.470> if<00:03:49.950> we<00:03:50.100> click<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.400> drop<00:03:50.579> down

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
is perfect if we click the drop down

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.080 
is perfect if we click the drop down
here<00:03:50.819> we<00:03:51.329> should<00:03:51.389> see<00:03:51.630> idle<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:52.769> run<00:03:53.579> now

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
here we should see idle and run now

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.309 
here we should see idle and run now
here's<00:03:54.690> how<00:03:54.810> this<00:03:54.930> works

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
here's how this works

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.430 
here's how this works
0<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.310> going<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.489> be<00:03:56.639> for<00:03:56.790> false<00:03:57.030> 1<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:58.049> going<00:03:58.349> to

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
0 is going to be for false 1 is going to

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.610 
0 is going to be for false 1 is going to
be<00:03:58.560> for<00:03:58.889> true<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.819> for<00:04:00.090> 0<00:04:00.329> we<00:04:00.660> want<00:04:00.989> idle<00:04:01.349> and

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
be for true so for 0 we want idle and

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.220 
be for true so for 0 we want idle and
for<00:04:02.400> true<00:04:02.790> we<00:04:03.030> want<00:04:03.180> run<00:04:03.510> we're<00:04:03.900> going<00:04:04.139> to

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
for true we want run we're going to

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.319 
for true we want run we're going to
ignore<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.739> fact<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.370> there<00:04:05.609> is<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.849> jump<00:04:06.120> in

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
ignore the fact that there is a jump in

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.699 
ignore the fact that there is a jump in
there<00:04:06.510> we're<00:04:06.660> actually<00:04:06.750> going<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.200> set<00:04:07.530> that

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
there we're actually going to set that

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.150 
there we're actually going to set that
up<00:04:07.769> in<00:04:08.579> a<00:04:08.700> different<00:04:08.819> video<00:04:09.200> okay<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.260> here's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
up in a different video okay so here's

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.280 
up in a different video okay so here's
our<00:04:11.310> update<00:04:11.790> animation<00:04:12.359> it's<00:04:12.630> going<00:04:13.019> to

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
our update animation it's going to

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.319 
our update animation it's going to
select<00:04:13.980> between<00:04:14.430> these<00:04:14.549> two<00:04:14.669> flip<00:04:14.940> books<00:04:15.120> now

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
select between these two flip books now

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.539 
select between these two flip books now
we<00:04:15.389> just<00:04:15.569> need<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.870> assign<00:04:16.349> that<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:17.010> our

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
we just need to assign that to our

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.339 
we just need to assign that to our
sprite<00:04:17.970> now<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.359> get<00:04:18.510> access<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.810> our<00:04:18.989> sprite

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
sprite now to get access to our sprite

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.229 
sprite now to get access to our sprite
over<00:04:19.650> here<00:04:19.829> in<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:19.979> my<00:04:20.160> blueprint<00:04:20.609> panel<00:04:20.760> we

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
over here in the my blueprint panel we

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.890 
over here in the my blueprint panel we
need<00:04:21.390> to<00:04:21.539> check<00:04:21.870> on<00:04:22.140> show<00:04:22.560> inherited<00:04:23.370> variable

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
need to check on show inherited variable

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.290 
need to check on show inherited variable
that<00:04:24.680> allows<00:04:24.889> us<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:25.250> see<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.790> sprite<00:04:26.060> will

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
that allows us to see the sprite will

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.350 
that allows us to see the sprite will
drag<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:27.199> in<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:27.710> get<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:28.790> we<00:04:29.120> can<00:04:29.270> just

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
drag that in and get it and we can just

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.560 
drag that in and get it and we can just
drag<00:04:29.540> a<00:04:29.570> wire<00:04:29.810> off<00:04:29.870> that<00:04:30.229> and<00:04:30.470> say<00:04:30.680> set

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
drag a wire off that and say set

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.980 
drag a wire off that and say set
flipbook<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:35.150> we'll<00:04:35.360> just<00:04:35.539> connect<00:04:35.930> that

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
flipbook and we'll just connect that

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.779 
flipbook and we'll just connect that
over<00:04:36.350> like<00:04:36.470> so<00:04:36.710> in<00:04:36.889> a<00:04:36.979> flipbook<00:04:37.250> we<00:04:37.550> want<00:04:37.729> to

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
over like so in a flipbook we want to

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.550 
over like so in a flipbook we want to
choose<00:04:37.970> is<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.210> result<00:04:38.600> of<00:04:38.750> this<00:04:38.870> select<00:04:39.289> and

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
choose is the result of this select and

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.499 
choose is the result of this select and
I'll<00:04:39.710> kind<00:04:39.889> of<00:04:39.979> arrange<00:04:40.729> my<00:04:40.970> nodes<00:04:41.210> for<00:04:41.479> a

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
I'll kind of arrange my nodes for a

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.560 
I'll kind of arrange my nodes for a
little<00:04:41.810> bit<00:04:41.960> better<00:04:42.139> readability<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:43.570> scoot

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
little bit better readability and scoot

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.360 
little bit better readability and scoot
this<00:04:44.720> in<00:04:44.900> so<00:04:45.050> everybody<00:04:45.350> can<00:04:45.530> see<00:04:45.590> give<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.340> a

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
this in so everybody can see give it a

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.340 
this in so everybody can see give it a
nice<00:04:46.789> little<00:04:46.940> bit<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.270> screen<00:04:48.080> space

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
nice little bit of screen space

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.590 
nice little bit of screen space
adjustment<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:49.100> there<00:04:49.400> you<00:04:49.490> go<00:04:49.639> there<00:04:50.030> is<00:04:50.300> our

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
adjustment and there you go there is our

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.409 
adjustment and there you go there is our
basic<00:04:51.590> animation<00:04:52.100> set<00:04:52.340> up<00:04:52.490> essentially<00:04:53.240> the

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
basic animation set up essentially the

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.390 
basic animation set up essentially the
same<00:04:53.630> way<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:53.870> see<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:54.199> inside<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.860> paper<00:04:55.039> 2d

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
same way you see it inside the paper 2d

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.180 
same way you see it inside the paper 2d
template<00:04:55.820> so<00:04:56.270> let's<00:04:56.570> compile<00:04:57.050> this<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.650> we'll

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
template so let's compile this and we'll

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.580 
template so let's compile this and we'll
save<00:04:58.430> it<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:59.060> we<00:04:59.900> should<00:05:00.080> be<00:05:00.139> able<00:05:00.199> to<00:05:00.289> test

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
save it and we should be able to test

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.770 
save it and we should be able to test
our<00:05:00.770> jump<00:05:01.160> as<00:05:01.340> well<00:05:01.520> so<00:05:01.789> here<00:05:02.030> we<00:05:02.090> are

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
our jump as well so here we are

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.260 
our jump as well so here we are
looks<00:05:03.080> like<00:05:03.229> we're<00:05:03.350> actually<00:05:03.470> not<00:05:04.270> selecting

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
looks like we're actually not selecting

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.029 
looks like we're actually not selecting
through<00:05:05.479> this<00:05:05.600> right<00:05:05.750> now<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.080> there's<00:05:06.979> a

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
through this right now and there's a

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.310 
through this right now and there's a
really<00:05:07.340> healthy<00:05:07.520> his<00:05:07.789> reason<00:05:08.120> why<00:05:08.300> this<00:05:09.110> is<00:05:09.289> a

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
really healthy his reason why this is a

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.920 
really healthy his reason why this is a
custom<00:05:09.889> event<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.789> apparently<00:05:11.570> we<00:05:11.750> have

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
custom event and apparently we have

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.379 
custom event and apparently we have
never<00:05:12.710> made<00:05:12.919> a<00:05:12.979> call<00:05:13.250> to<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.669> so<00:05:13.910> let's<00:05:14.150> do<00:05:14.360> that

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
never made a call to it so let's do that

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.379 
never made a call to it so let's do that
now<00:05:15.169> the<00:05:15.229> question<00:05:15.949> that<00:05:16.729> comes<00:05:17.030> up<00:05:17.180> next

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
now the question that comes up next

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.210 
now the question that comes up next
would<00:05:17.599> be<00:05:17.720> what's<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.289> best<00:05:18.500> time<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:18.979> call

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
would be what's the best time to call

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.010 
would be what's the best time to call
this<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:19.699> may<00:05:19.849> be<00:05:19.910> inclined<00:05:20.389> to<00:05:20.479> call<00:05:20.690> this<00:05:20.840> on

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
this you may be inclined to call this on

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.469 
this you may be inclined to call this on
tick<00:05:21.320> which<00:05:22.280> is<00:05:22.460> it's<00:05:22.970> not<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.270> worst

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
tick which is it's not the worst

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.120 
tick which is it's not the worst
assumption<00:05:23.990> to<00:05:24.110> make<00:05:24.139> what<00:05:24.710> we're<00:05:24.860> gonna<00:05:24.979> do

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
assumption to make what we're gonna do

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.219 
assumption to make what we're gonna do
instead<00:05:25.280> though<00:05:25.669> is<00:05:25.940> call<00:05:26.539> it<00:05:26.720> when<00:05:27.050> the

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
instead though is call it when the

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.129 
instead though is call it when the
player<00:05:27.500> is<00:05:27.770> moving<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.610> character<00:05:28.940> around<00:05:29.599> so

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
player is moving the character around so

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.650 
player is moving the character around so
right<00:05:30.349> here<00:05:30.530> after<00:05:30.710> our<00:05:31.220> add<00:05:31.580> movement<00:05:32.030> input

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
right here after our add movement input

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.750 
right here after our add movement input
I'm<00:05:32.960> gonna<00:05:33.229> drag<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.500> wire<00:05:33.710> out<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:34.280> we'll<00:05:34.639> make

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
I'm gonna drag a wire out and we'll make

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.110 
I'm gonna drag a wire out and we'll make
a<00:05:34.789> call<00:05:35.060> to<00:05:35.360> update<00:05:36.190> animation<00:05:37.190> boom<00:05:37.940> you<00:05:38.060> see

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
a call to update animation boom you see

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.279 
a call to update animation boom you see
that<00:05:38.330> calls<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.720> function<00:05:38.870> so<00:05:39.169> that's

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
that calls the function so that's

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.260 
that calls the function so that's
actually<00:05:39.349> going<00:05:39.590> to<00:05:39.680> call<00:05:39.889> that<00:05:40.159> custom<00:05:41.000> event

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
actually going to call that custom event

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.730 
actually going to call that custom event
that<00:05:41.479> we<00:05:41.570> have<00:05:41.720> down<00:05:41.930> here<00:05:41.960> below<00:05:42.380> so<00:05:42.650> now

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
that we have down here below so now

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.909 
that we have down here below so now
let's<00:05:42.889> compile<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:43.340> save<00:05:43.580> one<00:05:43.909> more<00:05:44.060> time<00:05:44.919> and

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
let's compile and save one more time and

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.580 
let's compile and save one more time and
now<00:05:46.130> if<00:05:46.250> I<00:05:46.310> hit<00:05:46.430> play<00:05:46.490> oh<00:05:47.289> you<00:05:48.289> see<00:05:48.440> we're

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
now if I hit play oh you see we're

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.529 
now if I hit play oh you see we're
running<00:05:48.710> which<00:05:49.130> is<00:05:49.159> great<00:05:49.520> and<00:05:49.820> if<00:05:50.360> we<00:05:50.449> hit

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
running which is great and if we hit

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.279 
running which is great and if we hit
space<00:05:50.870> we<00:05:51.139> jump<00:05:51.440> just<00:05:51.860> perfect<00:05:52.330> so<00:05:53.330> we<00:05:53.690> have<00:05:53.930> a

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
space we jump just perfect so we have a

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.469 
space we jump just perfect so we have a
character<00:05:54.830> now<00:05:55.099> that<00:05:55.460> can<00:05:55.729> run<00:05:56.150> through<00:05:56.419> the

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
character now that can run through the

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.600 
character now that can run through the
scene<00:05:56.750> and<00:05:57.110> we<00:05:57.590> can<00:05:57.710> see<00:05:57.919> him<00:05:58.070> moving<00:05:58.280> we<00:05:58.580> have

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
scene and we can see him moving we have

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.700 
scene and we can see him moving we have
a<00:05:58.729> little<00:05:58.970> bit<00:05:59.060> of<00:05:59.090> jump<00:05:59.360> action<00:05:59.750> and<00:05:59.960> that's

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
a little bit of jump action and that's

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.020 
a little bit of jump action and that's
essentially<00:06:01.159> all<00:06:01.220> I<00:06:01.340> wanted<00:06:01.580> to<00:06:01.639> show<00:06:01.820> in<00:06:01.940> this

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
essentially all I wanted to show in this

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.270 
essentially all I wanted to show in this
video<00:06:02.270> now<00:06:02.539> in<00:06:02.630> the<00:06:02.720> next<00:06:03.020> video<00:06:03.260> we<00:06:03.830> will<00:06:04.010> come

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
video now in the next video we will come

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.760 
video now in the next video we will come
back<00:06:04.490> and<00:06:04.849> I<00:06:05.180> will<00:06:05.240> show<00:06:05.360> you<00:06:05.599> how<00:06:05.930> to<00:06:05.990> update

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
back and I will show you how to update

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.800 
back and I will show you how to update
this<00:06:07.280> animation<00:06:07.880> system<00:06:08.240> to<00:06:08.389> make<00:06:08.539> it<00:06:08.690> a

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
this animation system to make it a

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.450 
this animation system to make it a
little<00:06:09.020> bit<00:06:09.260> more<00:06:09.500> like<00:06:09.710> an<00:06:09.800> animation<00:06:10.130> state

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
little bit more like an animation state

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.760 
little bit more like an animation state
machine<00:06:10.820> will<00:06:11.539> build<00:06:11.750> a<00:06:11.810> custom<00:06:12.590> function

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
machine will build a custom function

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.800 
machine will build a custom function
that<00:06:13.099> will<00:06:13.190> take<00:06:13.430> in<00:06:13.610> an<00:06:13.820> amount<00:06:14.449> of<00:06:14.599> data

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
that will take in an amount of data

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.750 
that will take in an amount of data
we'll<00:06:15.169> apply<00:06:15.380> some<00:06:15.620> rules<00:06:15.860> to<00:06:16.159> that<00:06:16.310> data<00:06:16.520> and

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
we'll apply some rules to that data and

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.399 
we'll apply some rules to that data and
based<00:06:17.150> on<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.360> result<00:06:17.690> of<00:06:17.780> those<00:06:17.960> rules<00:06:18.199> and

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
based on the result of those rules and

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:19.960 
based on the result of those rules and
tests<00:06:18.889> will<00:06:19.340> output<00:06:19.760> the<00:06:19.820> appropriate

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
tests will output the appropriate

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.029 
tests will output the appropriate
flipbook<00:06:20.900> that<00:06:21.050> we<00:06:21.139> want<00:06:21.380> for<00:06:21.800> now<00:06:21.889> though

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
flipbook that we want for now though

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.560 
flipbook that we want for now though
that's<00:06:22.220> gonna<00:06:22.310> wrap<00:06:22.520> things<00:06:22.729> up<00:06:22.940> so<00:06:23.180> thanks<00:06:23.510> a

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
that's gonna wrap things up so thanks a

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.720 
that's gonna wrap things up so thanks a
lot
