done your color formulation in your head

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
done your color formulation in your head
you've<00:00:50.250> got<00:00:50.460> your<00:00:50.670> color<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.239> you're<00:00:51.930> going

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you've got your color and you're going

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.010 
you've got your color and you're going
to<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.800> apply<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> tube<00:00:53.579> key<00:00:53.879> or<00:00:54.149> some

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
to just apply a tube key or some

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.139 
to just apply a tube key or some
efficient<00:00:55.800> way<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> removing<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> color<00:00:56.940> from

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
efficient way of removing the color from

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
efficient way of removing the color from
the<00:00:57.329> tube<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.780> you're<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.020> wasting<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.800> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
the tube so you're not wasting and you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.849 
the tube so you're not wasting and you
get<00:00:59.100> accurate<00:00:59.340> measurements<00:01:00.079> each<00:01:01.079> tube<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
get accurate measurements each tube is

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.539 
get accurate measurements each tube is
two<00:01:02.250> ounces<00:01:02.960> that<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.019> use<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.129> broken<00:01:05.309> up

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
two ounces that I use so it's broken up

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.310 
two ounces that I use so it's broken up
into<00:01:05.700> increments<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.240> four<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.750> quarter<00:01:07.170> two

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
into increments of four a quarter two

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.120 
into increments of four a quarter two
times<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:08.040> each<00:01:08.250> u12<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.780> we're<00:01:10.500> gonna<00:01:10.650> use<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
times for each u12 so we're gonna use a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.440 
times for each u12 so we're gonna use a
half<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.430> tube<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.729> color<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.360> to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
half a tube of color which is going to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.750 
half a tube of color which is going to
be<00:01:12.570> 25<00:01:12.960> grams<00:01:13.350> we're<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> turn<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.580> our

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
be 25 grams we're going to turn on our

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
be 25 grams we're going to turn on our
scale<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.810> zeroed<00:01:16.229> out<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
scale so it's that zeroed out with the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.130 
scale so it's that zeroed out with the
weight<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.400> bowl<00:01:17.610> not<00:01:17.970> being<00:01:18.360> affected<00:01:18.930> by

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
weight of the bowl not being affected by

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.630 
weight of the bowl not being affected by
how<00:01:19.409> you're<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> mix<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.189> hair<00:01:20.340> color

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
how you're going to mix the hair color

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.920 
how you're going to mix the hair color
and<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:22.020> squeeze<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.560> your<00:01:22.729> 50<00:01:23.930> 25

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
and you will just squeeze in your 50 25

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.670 
and you will just squeeze in your 50 25
grams<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.500> color<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> half<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> tube<00:01:27.680> being

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
grams of color for a half a tube being

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.539 
grams of color for a half a tube being
neat<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.250> efficient<00:01:29.880> all<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> time

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
neat and efficient all the time

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.249 
neat and efficient all the time
you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> either<00:01:32.790> zero<00:01:33.180> out<00:01:33.420> your<00:01:33.630> scale<00:01:33.930> so

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
you can either zero out your scale so

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.260 
you can either zero out your scale so
it's<00:01:34.409> back<00:01:34.590> at<00:01:34.770> zero<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.939> pour<00:01:36.150> in

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
it's back at zero so you can pour in

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.679 
it's back at zero so you can pour in
twenty<00:01:36.659> five<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:37.979> add<00:01:38.159> 25<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.299> 25

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
twenty five or you can just add 25 to 25

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.670 
twenty five or you can just add 25 to 25
giving<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.380> 50<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.720> you're<00:01:42.720> adding<00:01:43.649> your

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
giving you 50 and you're adding your

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.160 
giving you 50 and you're adding your
developer<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.640> at<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.600> point<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.049> can

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
developer and at that point you can

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.830 
developer and at that point you can
either<00:01:46.290> use<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.649> whisk<00:01:46.860> or<00:01:47.220> your<00:01:47.720> tint<00:01:48.720> brush

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
either use your whisk or your tint brush

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.050
