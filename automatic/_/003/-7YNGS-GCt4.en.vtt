say<00:01:41.610> that's<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.909> bit<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.360> stretch<00:01:42.630> at<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.930> I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
say that's a bit of a stretch at this I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.410 
say that's a bit of a stretch at this I
don't<00:01:43.079> know<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.340> no<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.360> don't

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
don't know you know that no but I don't

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.990 
don't know you know that no but I don't
know<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.899> assume<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.229> he<00:01:46.649> will<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:47.159> based

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
know that assume that he will be based

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
know that assume that he will be based
on<00:01:48.210> all<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.509> information<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.470> some

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
on all the information we have some

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.920 
on all the information we have some
might<00:01:50.189> say<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.850> bit<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.270> indications

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
might say that's a bit the indications

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.679 
might say that's a bit the indications
from<00:01:52.140> Payton<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:53.549> consistently<00:01:54.270> been<00:01:54.479> I

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
from Payton have consistently been I

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.389 
from Payton have consistently been I
will<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> hundred<00:01:55.530> percent<00:01:55.710> right<00:01:56.130> maybe

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
will be a hundred percent right maybe

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.090 
will be a hundred percent right maybe
that's<00:01:56.579> Payton<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.210> being<00:01:57.780> Payton<00:01:58.229> sort<00:01:58.950> of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that's Payton just being Payton sort of

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.830 
that's Payton just being Payton sort of
hoping<00:01:59.579> against<00:01:59.909> hope<00:01:59.969> well<00:02:00.329> that's<00:02:00.540> where<00:02:00.719> we

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
hoping against hope well that's where we

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.330 
hoping against hope well that's where we
were<00:02:00.960> before<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.380> start<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.619> last<00:02:01.680> season<00:02:02.219> -

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
were before the start of last season -

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.399 
were before the start of last season -
let's<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.880> do<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> hypothetical<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:03.990> he<00:02:04.229> is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
let's just do the hypothetical if he is

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.310 
let's just do the hypothetical if he is
close<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.070> 100%<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.659> true<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:06.990> Jim

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
close to 100% and it's true that Jim

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.339 
close to 100% and it's true that Jim
Irsay<00:02:07.500> has<00:02:07.829> already<00:02:08.129> decided<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:09.479> cut<00:02:09.840> Peyton

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
Irsay has already decided to cut Peyton

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.640 
Irsay has already decided to cut Peyton
Manning<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.950> say<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.569> owner

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
Manning I say that the owner

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.130

the Indianapolis Colts young mystery or

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.740 
the Indianapolis Colts young mystery or
say<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.620> guess<00:02:16.829> he's<00:02:16.980> not<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.390> used<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.540> be<00:02:18.629> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
say I guess he's not so used to be the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
make a monumental mistake because if

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.710 
make a monumental mistake because if
healthy<00:02:31.319> Peyton<00:02:31.980> Manning<00:02:32.370> has<00:02:32.609> three<00:02:33.180> more

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
quarterback years and that means that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.539 
quarterback years and that means that

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
three years and they had a pretty good

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.339 
three years and they had a pretty good
idea<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.389> he<00:03:12.450> was<00:03:12.569> going<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:12.870> pretty<00:03:13.139> good
