class<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:50.170> way<00:00:51.170> funner<00:00:51.500> than<00:00:51.650> the<00:00:51.949> books<00:00:52.190> are

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
class is way funner than the books are

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:01.840 
class is way funner than the books are
because<00:00:55.510> we<00:00:56.510> engaged<00:00:56.979> more<00:00:58.330> into<00:00:59.330> it<00:00:59.500> then<00:01:00.850> we

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
because we engaged more into it then we

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.590 
because we engaged more into it then we
are<00:01:02.260> with<00:01:03.400> the<00:01:04.400> math<00:01:04.610> books<00:01:04.970> all<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.510> teachers

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
are with the math books all the teachers

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.270 
are with the math books all the teachers
here<00:01:08.600> told<00:01:08.960> my<00:01:09.140> straw<00:01:09.470> that<00:01:09.740> she<00:01:09.979> has<00:01:10.100> to

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
here told my straw that she has to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.320 
here told my straw that she has to
modify<00:01:10.730> it<00:01:10.790> a<00:01:11.240> little<00:01:12.110> bit<00:01:12.590> for<00:01:12.980> us<00:01:13.330> because

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
modify it a little bit for us because

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.690 
modify it a little bit for us because
we're<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.810> special<00:01:15.290> needs<00:01:15.470> class<00:01:15.800> and<00:01:16.160> she

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
we're a special needs class and she

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.680 
we're a special needs class and she
hasn't<00:01:16.850> modified<00:01:17.740> pretty<00:01:18.740> close<00:01:18.980> to<00:01:19.160> anything

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
hasn't modified pretty close to anything

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.960 
hasn't modified pretty close to anything

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
here think oh they can't do that math

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.520 
here think oh they can't do that math
because<00:01:43.580> it's<00:01:43.760> too<00:01:44.030> hard<00:01:44.330> they<00:01:44.990> love<00:01:45.230> it<00:01:45.350> I

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.650 
Kirk Hinrich yeah all right chillon do
you<00:02:14.420> trust<00:02:14.810> Kelvin<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:15.980> Barr

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
you trust Kelvin and Barr

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.770 
you trust Kelvin and Barr
all<00:02:17.660> right<00:02:17.900> okay<00:02:18.590> let's<00:02:18.920> make<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.250> tree

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
all right okay let's make the tree

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.270 
all right okay let's make the tree
reason<00:02:20.780> why<00:02:20.900> they<00:02:21.110> like<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.650> do<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:21.920> if<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.130> was

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
reason why they like to do it if I was

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.800 
reason why they like to do it if I was
just<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.550> give<00:02:22.790> them<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.120> textbook<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.690> say

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
just to give them a textbook and say

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.480 
just to give them a textbook and say
we're<00:02:23.960> gonna<00:02:24.050> draw<00:02:24.320> angles<00:02:24.530> or<00:02:25.040> we're<00:02:25.430> gonna

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
we're gonna draw angles or we're gonna

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.080 
we're gonna draw angles or we're gonna
find<00:02:25.850> percentage<00:02:26.840> they<00:02:27.050> don't<00:02:27.230> care<00:02:27.640> but<00:02:28.640> when

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
find percentage they don't care but when

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.940 
find percentage they don't care but when
I<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.540> know<00:02:29.570> say<00:02:30.080> well<00:02:30.380> we're<00:02:30.560> gonna<00:02:30.650> come<00:02:30.920> up

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.090 
there he can
yeah<00:05:53.880> challenging<00:05:54.690> so<00:05:54.900> to<00:05:54.990> speak<00:05:55.259> as<00:05:55.620> far<00:05:55.919> as

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
yeah challenging so to speak as far as

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.820 
yeah challenging so to speak as far as
his<00:05:56.460> behavior<00:05:57.030> he<00:05:57.539> was<00:05:57.750> so<00:05:58.319> focused<00:05:58.530> the

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
his behavior he was so focused the

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.740 
his behavior he was so focused the
entire<00:05:58.949> time<00:05:59.400> one<00:05:59.729> because<00:06:00.240> he<00:06:00.509> loves

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
entire time one because he loves

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.659 
entire time one because he loves
basketball<00:06:00.930> -<00:06:01.560> I<00:06:01.590> think<00:06:01.830> his<00:06:02.099> team<00:06:02.280> is<00:06:02.460> doing

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
basketball - I think his team is doing

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.909 
basketball - I think his team is doing
very<00:06:02.849> well<00:06:02.970> and<00:06:03.300> three<00:06:03.930> his<00:06:04.530> leadership

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
very well and three his leadership

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.710 
very well and three his leadership
skills<00:06:05.220> have<00:06:05.699> just<00:06:05.940> risen<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.569> the<00:06:06.690> top

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
skills have just risen to the top

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.020 
skills have just risen to the top
because<00:06:07.349> he<00:06:07.919> is<00:06:08.009> familiar<00:06:08.190> with<00:06:08.430> basketball

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
because he is familiar with basketball

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.339 
because he is familiar with basketball
and<00:06:09.210> so<00:06:09.300> now<00:06:09.419> you<00:06:09.539> put<00:06:09.870> him<00:06:10.050> in<00:06:10.110> a<00:06:10.199> position

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
and so now you put him in a position

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.290 
and so now you put him in a position
that<00:06:10.620> he<00:06:10.889> probably<00:06:11.280> hasn't<00:06:11.669> been<00:06:11.849> in<00:06:12.120> before

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
that he probably hasn't been in before

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.120 
that he probably hasn't been in before
now<00:06:12.750> all<00:06:12.840> of<00:06:12.900> a<00:06:12.960> sudden<00:06:12.990> he's<00:06:13.590> a<00:06:13.620> leader<00:06:13.889> in<00:06:14.069> the
