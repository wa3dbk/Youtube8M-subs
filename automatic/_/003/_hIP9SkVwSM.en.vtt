00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.870 
so pretty fast and I mean like them the
only<00:05:39.360> negative<00:05:39.750> thing<00:05:40.140> about<00:05:40.380> them<00:05:40.860> is<00:05:41.100> in

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
only negative thing about them is in

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.130 
only negative thing about them is in
power<00:05:42.780> adapter<00:05:43.490> it's<00:05:44.490> not<00:05:44.850> like<00:05:45.060> you<00:05:45.900> can<00:05:45.960> just

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
power adapter it's not like you can just

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:56.020 
power adapter it's not like you can just
take<00:05:46.800> it<00:05:46.980> around<00:05:47.420> so<00:05:49.970> it's<00:05:50.970> really<00:05:51.180> good<00:05:51.450> fast
