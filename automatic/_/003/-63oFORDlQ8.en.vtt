frankly it angers me now how are we

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.890 
frankly it angers me now how are we
going<00:05:29.070> to<00:05:29.160> teach<00:05:29.310> students<00:05:29.760> about<00:05:29.970> freedom<00:05:30.840> of

right to express themselves freely

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.890 
right to express themselves freely
but<00:05:38.860> I<00:05:38.889> don't<00:05:39.100> think<00:05:39.160> it's<00:05:39.340> an<00:05:39.430> issue<00:05:39.490> about

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
but I don't think it's an issue about

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.020 
but I don't think it's an issue about
violence<00:05:40.900> in<00:05:41.050> schools<00:05:41.490> it<00:05:42.490> makes<00:05:42.760> some<00:05:42.940> people

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
violence in schools it makes some people

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.320 
violence in schools it makes some people
uncomfortable<00:05:44.040> it<00:05:45.040> undermined<00:05:45.580> their<00:05:45.880> view

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
uncomfortable it undermined their view

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.540 
uncomfortable it undermined their view
of<00:05:46.360> what<00:05:46.690> it<00:05:46.780> is<00:05:46.810> to<00:05:46.930> be<00:05:47.199> male<00:05:47.530> and<00:05:47.770> they<00:05:48.430> don't

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
of what it is to be male and they don't

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.150 
of what it is to be male and they don't
like<00:05:48.790> that<00:05:49.350> some<00:05:50.350> people<00:05:50.620> say<00:05:50.770> oh<00:05:50.800> that's<00:05:51.010> a

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
like that some people say oh that's a

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.189 
like that some people say oh that's a
good<00:05:51.280> excuse<00:05:51.639> for<00:05:51.669> school<00:05:52.090> uniforms<00:05:52.690> which<00:05:53.050> I

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
good excuse for school uniforms which I

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.500 
good excuse for school uniforms which I
assume<00:05:53.500> would<00:05:53.590> all<00:05:53.740> have<00:05:53.949> to<00:05:54.010> be<00:05:54.100> pants<00:05:54.699> based

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
assume would all have to be pants based

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.430 
assume would all have to be pants based
I<00:05:55.810> guess<00:05:57.360> that<00:05:58.360> I'm<00:05:58.449> against<00:05:58.720> school<00:05:58.990> uniforms

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
I guess that I'm against school uniforms

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.290 
I guess that I'm against school uniforms
again<00:05:59.979> I<00:06:00.190> think<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:00.490> limits<00:06:00.820> everyone's

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
again I think it limits everyone's

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.500 
again I think it limits everyone's
freedom<00:06:01.660> of<00:06:01.870> expression<00:06:02.850> completely<00:06:03.850> and<00:06:04.240> I

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
freedom of expression completely and I

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.000 
freedom of expression completely and I
don't<00:06:04.690> think<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:04.960> benefits<00:06:05.110> anyone<00:06:05.770> in<00:06:05.889> any

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
don't think it benefits anyone in any

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.189 
don't think it benefits anyone in any
way<00:06:06.210> particularly<00:06:07.210> not<00:06:07.360> if<00:06:07.510> you're<00:06:07.720> a

way particularly not if you're a
