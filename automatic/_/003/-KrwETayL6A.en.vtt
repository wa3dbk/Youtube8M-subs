about why it does it comes down to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
other side of the Sun from us we see it

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.230

the glow of the Sun it's a thin Crescent
just<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.630> how<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:30.870> see<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.410> moon<00:02:31.880> well<00:02:32.880> this

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
just like how we see the moon well this

just like how we see the moon well this
gives<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> better<00:02:33.480> understanding<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.200> why

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
gives you a better understanding of why

the<00:02:34.410> moon<00:02:34.800> goes<00:02:35.100> through<00:02:35.130> its<00:02:35.430> phases<00:02:35.670> every

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
the moon goes through its phases every

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.870 
the moon goes through its phases every
month<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.710> interesting<00:02:38.280> relationship

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
month and the interesting relationship

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.830 
month and the interesting relationship
between<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.360> earth<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:40.140> Sun<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.280> moon
