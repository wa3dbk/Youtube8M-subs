00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
about this nut board is that you can

about this nut board is that you can

than your average snowboard and you can
do<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.390> because<00:00:27.570> Burton<00:00:28.140> has<00:00:28.529> engineered

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
core profiling now it's a fun board

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.060 
core profiling now it's a fun board
because<00:00:39.329> when<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.629> ride<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.469> or<00:00:40.590> when<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.860> sit

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
because when you ride it or when you sit

because when you ride it or when you sit
on<00:00:41.190> top<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.520> hill<00:00:41.640> or<00:00:41.700> stand<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.149> top<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.329> the

on top of a hill or stand on top of the
hill<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.930> look<00:00:43.110> down<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> notice<00:00:43.920> that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
hill you look down and you notice that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.400 
hill you look down and you notice that
your<00:00:44.160> board<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.610> quite<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.329> shorter<00:00:45.510> but

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
your board is quite a bit shorter but

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.410 
your board is quite a bit shorter but
when<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.680> actually<00:00:46.950> start<00:00:47.280> riding<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:48.390> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
when you actually start riding and do a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.090 
when you actually start riding and do a
couple<00:00:48.690> laps<00:00:48.840> through<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> park<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.590> through

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
couple laps through the park or through

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.490 
couple laps through the park or through
the<00:00:50.160> groomers<00:00:50.629> it<00:00:51.629> actually<00:00:52.020> feels<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the groomers it actually feels like a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.049 
the groomers it actually feels like a
board<00:00:52.739> that's<00:00:52.890> eight<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.219> ten<00:00:53.430> centimetres

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
board that's eight to ten centimetres

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
board that's eight to ten centimetres
longer<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.780> even<00:00:54.960> though<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.170> quite<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.379> bit

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
longer so even though it's quite a bit

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.099 
longer so even though it's quite a bit
shorter<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:56.239> still<00:00:57.239> feels<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.690> normal

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
shorter it still feels like a normal

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.779 
shorter it still feels like a normal
length<00:00:58.469> snowboard<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.280> would<00:00:59.399> normally

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
length snowboard that you would normally

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.020 
length snowboard that you would normally
arrive<00:01:00.210> now<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.379> nug<00:01:01.649> does<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> flat<00:01:02.730> top

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
arrive now the nug does have a flat top

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.969 
arrive now the nug does have a flat top
profile<00:01:03.539> shape<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.140> year<00:01:04.379> Burton

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
profile shape for this year Burton

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.950 
profile shape for this year Burton
change<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.430> from<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.760> V<00:01:05.939> rocker<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> flat<00:01:06.689> top

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
change it from a V rocker to a flat top

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.929 
change it from a V rocker to a flat top
I<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.619> because<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.159> makes<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.729> board

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
I like that because it makes the board

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.940 
I like that because it makes the board
quite<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> bit<00:01:09.750> more<00:01:09.990> stable<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.680> there's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
quite a bit more stable because there's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.500 
quite a bit more stable because there's
a<00:01:11.010> flat<00:01:11.189> zone<00:01:11.460> underneath<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.360> between

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
a flat zone underneath and in between

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.109 
a flat zone underneath and in between
the<00:01:12.780> feet<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.830> outside<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> channel

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
the feet the outside of the channel

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
the feet the outside of the channel
system<00:01:15.299> towards<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> nose<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.259> tail<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
system towards the nose and the tail the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
system towards the nose and the tail the
board<00:01:17.220> will<00:01:17.340> actually<00:01:17.700> rocker<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.420> lift

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
board will actually rocker out to lift

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.410 
board will actually rocker out to lift
up<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> contact<00:01:19.380> points<00:01:19.830> now<00:01:20.310> they've<00:01:20.880> also

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
up the contact points now they've also

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.350 
up the contact points now they've also
have<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.960> scoop<00:01:22.770> nose<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.430> tail<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.880> a

have a scoop nose and tail and a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.260 
have a scoop nose and tail and a
centered<00:01:25.229> stance<00:01:25.400> but<00:01:26.400> what's<00:01:26.909> unique<00:01:27.180> about

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
centered stance but what's unique about

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.300 
centered stance but what's unique about
this<00:01:27.540> decks<00:01:27.810> though<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.259> even<00:01:28.950> though<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
this decks though is even though it's a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.670 
this decks though is even though it's a
little<00:01:29.400> bit<00:01:29.610> shorter<00:01:30.049> you<00:01:31.049> think<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
little bit shorter you think that it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.010 
little bit shorter you think that it
would<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:33.479> really<00:01:33.600> soft

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
would be you know really really soft

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.020 
would be you know really really soft
it's<00:01:34.229> really<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.890> soft<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.850> has<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
it's really not that soft it has a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.649 
it's really not that soft it has a
fluctuating<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.990> feel<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.680> overall<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.460> 4<00:01:39.000> but

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
fluctuating I feel of overall a 4 but

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.030 
fluctuating I feel of overall a 4 but
it's<00:01:39.810> gonna<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.110> little<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.560> softer<00:01:40.979> in

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it's gonna be a little bit softer in

it's<00:02:12.360> not<00:02:12.540> going<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:12.810> too<00:02:13.080> soft<00:02:13.379> because<00:02:13.800> of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it's not going to be too soft because of

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.339 
it's not going to be too soft because of
the<00:02:14.430> Triax<00:02:14.910> fiberglass<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.599> even<00:02:15.900> when<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.050> flex

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
the Triax fiberglass so even when I flex

this<00:02:16.530> board<00:02:16.830> out<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.580> know<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.879> see<00:02:18.030> you

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
this board out you know you can see you

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.360 
this board out you know you can see you
can<00:02:18.270> feel<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.900> flex<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:19.830> gonna<00:02:20.010> it's

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
can feel the flex but it's gonna it's

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.100 
can feel the flex but it's gonna it's
gonna<00:02:20.520> push<00:02:20.819> back<00:02:20.849> because<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.629> Triax

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
gonna push back because of that Triax

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.260 
gonna push back because of that Triax
class<00:02:22.410> now<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.069> nug<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.550> gonna<00:02:23.790> stay<00:02:24.000> fast

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
class now the nug is gonna stay fast

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.210 
class now the nug is gonna stay fast
because<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.870> sintered<00:02:25.260> base<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.980> base

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
because of the sintered base it's a base

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.520 
because of the sintered base it's a base
that<00:02:26.430> absorbs<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.330> lot<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.660> Wax<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.200> going<00:02:28.470> to

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
that absorbs a lot of Wax it's going to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.040 
that absorbs a lot of Wax it's going to
stay<00:02:28.680> fast<00:02:28.709> if<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.700> accent<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:30.450> wax<00:02:30.840> it

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
stay fast if you accent so just wax it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.410 
stay fast if you accent so just wax it
if<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:32.220> addition<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.849> all<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.209> that

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
if you can in addition to all of that

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.449 
if you can in addition to all of that
there's<00:02:33.870> gonna<00:02:33.959> be<00:02:34.110> frostbite<00:02:34.620> edges<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.160> just

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
there's gonna be frostbite edges I just

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.309 
there's gonna be frostbite edges I just
have<00:02:35.580> actually<00:02:35.910> protrude<00:02:36.360> out<00:02:36.510> where<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
have actually protrude out where the

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.800 
have actually protrude out where the
channel<00:02:37.769> system<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:39.180> actually<00:02:39.360> helps

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
channel system is and it actually helps

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.960 
channel system is and it actually helps
to<00:02:39.900> bite<00:02:40.319> down<00:02:40.349> on<00:02:40.739> really<00:02:41.220> firm<00:02:41.459> conditions

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
to bite down on really firm conditions

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.850 
to bite down on really firm conditions
this<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.450> an<00:02:42.720> awesome<00:02:43.140> board<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.530> nug<00:02:43.709> has

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
this is an awesome board the nug has

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.800 
this is an awesome board the nug has
been<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.310> great<00:02:44.730> board<00:02:45.000> for<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.209> lot<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.540> people

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
been a a great board for a lot of people

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.600 
been a a great board for a lot of people
it<00:02:46.230> does<00:02:46.440> feature<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.769> channel<00:02:47.190> system<00:02:47.489> so

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
it does feature the channel system so

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.830 
it does feature the channel system so
that<00:02:47.760> means<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.269> board<00:02:48.510> actually<00:02:48.690> has

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
that means that this board actually has

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.080 
that means that this board actually has
a<00:02:49.019> three<00:02:49.379> year<00:02:49.590> warranty<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.430> that's<00:02:50.610> that's

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
a three year warranty so that's that's

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.630 
a three year warranty so that's that's
good<00:02:51.300> -<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.410> Burton<00:02:52.709> nug<00:02:52.739> snowboard
