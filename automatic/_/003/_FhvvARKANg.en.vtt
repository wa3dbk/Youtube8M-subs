00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.910
 once a week I wash my hair 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.380
 what do I do when I do my 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.450
 hair I live a shampoo it's a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.239
 his corner which is intended for the hair 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.770
 crinkly 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.170
 ie nature and not crises and 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.960
 when i bought this product i got 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.140
 deceived I took the range intended for 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.250
 month covan games when i use i him 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.890
 do not say what I'm going to buy 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.230
 in addition I bought two boxes such as 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.940
 I will use the matca china and 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.920
 so when I use I do not use 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.670
 after shampoo because it is 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.370
 so much nouristan 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.379
 it just does not dry at all 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.409
 hair well once the shampoo 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.780
 fn have seen my hair is already 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.509
 they went dry space and are 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.289
 mails and as deep sound as I do to 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:24.939
 every week every week it's 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:27.880
 that the water is really the mas the 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.569
 deep sense that I love it really is 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.520
 in the top 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:38.229
 I use since I do not know a year and 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.909
 half or two years and then sometimes I him 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.399
 say he lives alone he is at he usually has 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.030
 very very well alone and sometimes I 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.670
 want to add a few drops of oil 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.549
 in it's him to read anything 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.399
 what city vegetable and coconut oil 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.599
 honey too sometimes I put in 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.929
 but really underground it is really 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:05.110
 at the top so that the product penetrates more 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:08.979
 easily and that they are more 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.810
 effective if you have a hat 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:18.220
 heating 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:22.150
 I have this component and I bought on said 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.769
 woods a point fr I do not know if you 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.890
 know 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:30.990
 so it's a bliss thing 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.910
 stuff in it problem so that in 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:38.660
 head you have to heat there are three and 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.660
 three pockets 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.950
 so that's all flat there is there three 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.620
 but I got out of this stuff where he 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.810
 had been boiling water a 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.000
 when you end up stopping the fire 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.660
 wait a minute and then you 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.090
 dive his little Swiss calls his 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.730
 little tricks in the water turn on timer 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.100
 especially and finally we must not leave them 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.989
 little breasts long so you put 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.420
 minutes to 4 minutes 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.670
 once that's got to take off wanted 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.140
 leave out a minute people that that 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.750
 really cool a chouÃ¯a 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.970
 minutes and then you put them in 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.500
 gloves cups logos of 12 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.690
 December to the hair and then I 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.200
 I keep doing this 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.120
 quine of minors 27 and if you do not 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.690
 no heating cap not leave you 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.580
 the product on your hair maximum of 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.720
 time it would be km / h so that's 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.549
 really it's really a lot 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.510
 much better 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.000
 no i really recommend it 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.670
 bring warmth into your hair 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.350
 when you put a deep care so 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.920
 I have such a thing the field for a 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.600
 after shampoo jorens really well 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.959
 spent so that nothing remains on your 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.250
 hair 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:57.200
 once my hair is fine 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.200
 wrung out i will use an ebe 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.940
 keratin and green tea for 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.270
 people who have relaxed hair 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.160
 or colored or discolored it's very very 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.180
 good to fix I want that after the 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:17.040
 shampoo I spray into my hair 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:19.160
 evenly root to tip game 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.510
 mass foot I feel good all that 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.070
 but then I let it air dry 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.870
 free 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.880
 once my hair is dried to 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:34.370
 the open air 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:37.020
 I applied the heat protector 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.230
 it would give me very little 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.290
 to put a lot you put a 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.520
 drop you divide it provident into 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.870
 same time a moment and then you 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.160
 apply on your hair from the root 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.340
 on the slopes 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.160
 it's not his wick by wick it's okay 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.480
 since the hair that we can not do too much 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.100
 you will invite too much what they will do 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:03.300
 it's because I make myself of course 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:07.120
 jeans spread in 1 and I do that 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:11.350
 george is an agent with first at first 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:17.310
 on the edges on the tip and then 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:17.310
 I go back in seven days show is 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:26.200
 grosso modo etc and that's enough for 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.980
 me for me in any case it's this 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.090
 that I do these scores still jean vitro 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.970
 the hair is less flexible and the 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.260
 hair is harder reindeer 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.430
 me it's not what I'm looking for so 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.430
 never really very little
