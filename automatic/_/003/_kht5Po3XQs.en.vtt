00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.550
 Y 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.570
 build my own did not open the night 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.700
 what are the lbs g or the games of the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.080
 hunger of those of Lisbon and good the 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.250
 server for minecraft pocket edition 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.990
 in the description I will give you the 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.020
 universal server because the universal being 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.880
 is the universal for this is play point 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.410
 the bcg dot net will be in the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.600
 description and everything else leave it 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.940
 how is it for the re directions to 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.790
 any server because because good 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.620
 the play point the dot point net or play 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.810
 whatever you want to say more than anything the 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.470
 redirect to any server is already 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.770
 that are like like 10 servers more than 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.340
 nothing 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.320
 in f1 f2 h 2 j I do not know what good thing or 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.820
 the 1 as you remember you had 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.520
 several servers this but this is 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.870
 the universal or this is what redirects 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.880
 directly to any of them well 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.400
 if there is one full, then send it to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.110
 be empty and that's how this works 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.580
 That's not why many tell you why 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.770
 a power with my friend because if they play 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.420
 here in the play lbs what point net goes 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.700
 to send to different servers and not 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.530
 they will end up in the same login or as 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.710
 want to call you, we are not going to enter here 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.210
 this is burdened slow in 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:31.170
 load but it's more 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.970
 let's say that a little more stable does not 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.050
 as to how they walk they continue 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.160
 walking like the 'show park' 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.510
 to see if a black comes in there 101 and 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.490
 good without walking started a couple but 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.600
 as he denied it is already fluid also a 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.700
 small mistake that I think is from 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.300
 minecraft when he tried to enter what 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.920
 is the server this votes me vote me the 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.690
 game he takes it out I do not know why I 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.460
 the game grew very ugly what I start to 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.770
 do is modify in any settings 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.260
 thing until he lets me in but then 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.570
 I do not know why that happens the truth a book 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.060
 Minecraft or whatever but because 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.619
 is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.790
 this is weird just that this did not come 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.399
 video so they can see what then 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.760
 the hunger games work again 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.770
 they already have no load well done 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.970
 you have your full service again 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.370
 so nobody can start between the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.900
 beach and see net point or some server 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.450
 specifically and make them the f1 f2 h 20 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.800
 punto de bcg punto net los de ella 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.239
 will know not those who already played in the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.780
 famous is that they will know what fart with 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.300
 this 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.090
 Remember this is the server that 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.549
 redirects others so it gets in 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.319
 play point the bcg dot net can that 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.620
 do not play with your friend with your friend 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.500
 sorry why 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.959
 he will send them to different and find 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.879
 direct servers or if right now I see that 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.040
 I'll put them on if I do not 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.450
 then simply enter here be here 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.709
 avoid so much of problems and if you want 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.099
 play with your friend so if you are looking for a 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.170
 server in particular be the h2o or the f2 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.849
 I do not remember very well stupid car 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.670
 giant that is happening and stupid 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.220
 trailer or whatever but I hope so 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.840
 it works for them guys and then there are the 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.400
 Hunger games out there I was 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.069
 waiting for some little things so 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.180
 well I do not say goodbye I'm the best 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.950
 we see in the next video maybe 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.810
 then play you know what notice when 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.750
 game with subscribers do not leave 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.510
 cheat by fake droid gamer and we 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.000

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.000
 one minute is missing
