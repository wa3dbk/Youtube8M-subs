00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
to change it again just to make it a bit

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.480 
to change it again just to make it a bit
more<00:00:27.060> balanced<00:00:27.480> because<00:00:28.410> i<00:00:28.740> did<00:00:29.010> get<00:00:29.160> blown<00:00:29.460> up

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
more balanced because i did get blown up

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.759 
more balanced because i did get blown up
in<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:30.240> by<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> creeper<00:00:30.840> over<00:00:31.019> there<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.500> we

in one by a creeper over there so we

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.810 
in one by a creeper over there so we
also<00:00:32.430> have<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:34.040> wooden<00:00:35.040> broad<00:00:35.250> shield<00:00:35.489> which

also have the wooden broad shield which
has<00:00:36.000> pretty<00:00:36.480> much<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> same<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:36.960> Chapman's

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
has pretty much the same in Chapman's

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.360 
has pretty much the same in Chapman's
just<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.430> lower<00:00:38.610> two<00:00:38.940> levels<00:00:39.239> lower<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:41.129> few

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
just to lower two levels lower and a few

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.860 
just to lower two levels lower and a few
buffs<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.850> debuffs<00:00:42.030> lower<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
buffs and debuffs lower like the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.270 
buffs and debuffs lower like the
knock-back<00:00:43.140> resistance<00:00:43.739> I'm<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> attack

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
knock-back resistance I'm the attack

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.729 
knock-back resistance I'm the attack
damage<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.329> finally<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.170> our<00:00:46.200> low<00:00:46.500> end

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
damage so finally we have our low end

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.130 
damage so finally we have our low end
one<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.789> basic<00:00:48.270> round<00:00:48.480> shield<00:00:48.780> which

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
one we have a basic round shield which

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.590 
one we have a basic round shield which
again<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.620> has<00:00:50.129> better<00:00:50.520> falling<00:00:50.910> added<00:00:51.329> for

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
again is has better falling added for

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.110 
again is has better falling added for
whatever<00:00:51.930> reason<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.460> two<00:00:53.820> levels

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
whatever reason but it just two levels

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.970 
whatever reason but it just two levels
lower<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.710> it<00:00:56.059> does<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.809> let's<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.859> go

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
lower and it does that so let's just go

down<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> good<00:01:42.210> bit<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> health<00:01:42.570> you'll<00:01:42.840> see

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
down to a good bit of health you'll see

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.719 
down to a good bit of health you'll see
the<00:01:43.079> shield<00:01:43.320> broke<00:01:43.710> she'll<00:01:44.220> broke<00:01:44.549> when<00:01:44.700> we

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the shield broke she'll broke when we

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.410 
the shield broke she'll broke when we
got<00:01:44.939> 20<00:01:45.390> minus<00:01:46.170> four<00:01:46.560> hearts<00:01:47.270> because<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
got 20 minus four hearts because the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.969 
got 20 minus four hearts because the
shield<00:01:48.630> takes<00:01:48.899> damage<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.710> something

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
shield takes damage and as something

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.399 
shield takes damage and as something
takes<00:01:50.159> time<00:01:50.340> takes<00:01:50.700> damage<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.210> breaks<00:01:51.479> so

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
takes time takes damage it breaks so

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.350 
takes time takes damage it breaks so
each<00:01:53.009> shield<00:01:53.369> breaks<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> different<00:01:54.240> level

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
each shield breaks at a different level

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.319 
each shield breaks at a different level
the<00:01:55.049> basic<00:01:55.950> round<00:01:56.159> shield<00:01:56.460> lasts<00:01:57.090> much<00:01:57.299> longer

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the basic round shield lasts much longer

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.770 
the basic round shield lasts much longer
for<00:01:58.079> some<00:01:58.710> reason<00:01:59.219> than<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.509> broad

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
for some reason than the the broad

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.330 
for some reason than the the broad
shield<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.229> don't<00:02:01.469> know<00:02:01.530> why<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> said<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.250> like

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
shield I don't know why I said it like

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.560 
shield I don't know why I said it like
that<00:02:02.490> because<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.880> think<00:02:03.030> an<00:02:03.119> iron<00:02:03.270> Mon<00:02:03.479> would

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
that because you think an iron Mon would

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.200 
that because you think an iron Mon would
last<00:02:03.780> longer<00:02:04.020> or<00:02:04.979> does<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.280> actually<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.939> don't

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
last longer or does it actually I don't

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.859 
last longer or does it actually I don't
think<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.390> does<00:02:06.649> I'm<00:02:07.649> gonna<00:02:07.770> check<00:02:07.860> this

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
think it does I'm gonna check this

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.949 
think it does I'm gonna check this
I<00:02:09.789> can't<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:11.060> can't<00:02:11.090> really<00:02:11.450> remember<00:02:11.599> what<00:02:11.810> I

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
I can't I can't really remember what I

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.860 
I can't I can't really remember what I
said<00:02:12.049> it<00:02:12.260> too<00:02:12.379> so<00:02:13.299> these<00:02:14.299> are<00:02:14.360> testing

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
said it too so these are testing

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.259 
said it too so these are testing
positive<00:02:15.549> because<00:02:16.549> we're<00:02:16.790> lower<00:02:16.909> hell<00:02:17.060> yeah

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
positive because we're lower hell yeah

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.149 
positive because we're lower hell yeah
okay<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:18.140> iron<00:02:18.260> broad<00:02:18.470> shield<00:02:18.709> breaks<00:02:18.920> first

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
okay the iron broad shield breaks first

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.369 
okay the iron broad shield breaks first
they<00:02:19.400> don't<00:02:19.549> last<00:02:19.730> very<00:02:19.940> long<00:02:20.090> so<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.870> need<00:02:21.200> to

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
they don't last very long so you need to

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.380 
they don't last very long so you need to
keep<00:02:22.250> make<00:02:22.489> sure<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.760> keep<00:02:22.879> your<00:02:22.940> health<00:02:23.180> up

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
keep make sure you keep your health up

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.119 
keep make sure you keep your health up
with<00:02:23.659> potions<00:02:23.959> or<00:02:24.409> golden<00:02:24.709> apples<00:02:25.010> or

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
with potions or golden apples or

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.190 
with potions or golden apples or
whatever<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.459> have<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.819> then<00:02:26.510> if<00:02:26.629> we<00:02:26.780> drink

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
whatever you have and then if we drink

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.199 
whatever you have and then if we drink
the<00:02:27.290> potion<00:02:27.440> oh<00:02:32.110> we<00:02:33.110> need<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.349> reset<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.209> test

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
the potion oh we need to reset the test

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.979 
the potion oh we need to reset the test
for<00:02:35.390> command<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.930> lot<00:02:37.329> so<00:02:38.329> we<00:02:38.390> reset<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.840> test

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
for command a lot so we reset the test

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.619 
for command a lot so we reset the test
for<00:02:39.140> command<00:02:39.409> and<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.620> starts<00:02:39.829> testing<00:02:40.159> again

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
for command and it starts testing again

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.569 
for command and it starts testing again
so<00:02:41.629> how<00:02:41.720> does<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.900> res<00:02:42.200> don't<00:02:42.500> work<00:02:42.709> well<00:02:43.489> it

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
so how does this res don't work well it

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:44.890 
so how does this res don't work well it
all<00:02:43.670> starts<00:02:44.000> over<00:02:44.180> here<00:02:44.329> with<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:44.629> clock

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
all starts over here with this clock

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.289 
all starts over here with this clock
this<00:02:45.379> is<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.950> command<00:02:46.310> or<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.609> redstone<00:02:46.940> block

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
this is a command or a redstone block

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.479 
this is a command or a redstone block
clock<00:02:47.510> which<00:02:47.959> this<00:02:48.560> command<00:02:48.890> block<00:02:49.040> here<00:02:49.220> sets

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
clock which this command block here sets

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.940 
clock which this command block here sets
these<00:02:49.700> blocks<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.269> one<00:02:50.450> removes<00:02:51.410> them<00:02:51.620> and

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
these blocks this one removes them and

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.559 
these blocks this one removes them and
these<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:52.310> activate<00:02:52.849> these<00:02:53.000> tests<00:02:53.359> for

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
these just activate these tests for

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.599 
these just activate these tests for
commands<00:02:54.079> which<00:02:54.349> test<00:02:54.739> for<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.340> knock-back

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
commands which test for the knock-back

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.849 
commands which test for the knock-back
resistance<00:02:56.450> that's<00:02:57.019> why<00:02:57.170> each<00:02:57.349> one<00:02:57.590> needs<00:02:57.620> to

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
resistance that's why each one needs to

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.530 
resistance that's why each one needs to
have<00:02:57.980> its<00:02:58.010> own<00:02:58.220> knockback<00:02:58.670> resistance<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.299> RM

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
have its own knockback resistance the RM

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.080 
have its own knockback resistance the RM
one<00:02:59.659> has<00:02:59.780> a<00:03:00.170> level<00:03:00.319> three<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:01.310> wood<00:03:01.819> one<00:03:01.970> has

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
one has a level three the wood one has

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.880 
one has a level three the wood one has
level<00:03:02.299> two<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.659> the<00:03:03.079> basic<00:03:03.319> round<00:03:03.470> shield<00:03:03.680> has

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
level two and the basic round shield has

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.300 
level two and the basic round shield has
a<00:03:03.920> level<00:03:04.159> one<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.750> that's<00:03:05.959> all<00:03:06.109> good<00:03:06.140> once<00:03:07.129> it

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
a level one so that's all good once it

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.440 
a level one so that's all good once it
finds<00:03:07.519> a<00:03:07.640> player<00:03:07.819> with<00:03:08.090> one<00:03:08.269> of<00:03:08.359> those

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
finds a player with one of those

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.140 
finds a player with one of those
attributes<00:03:08.959> it<00:03:09.680> comes<00:03:10.159> over<00:03:10.280> this<00:03:10.579> which<00:03:10.879> just

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
attributes it comes over this which just

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.210 
attributes it comes over this which just
sets<00:03:11.420> this<00:03:11.959> redstone<00:03:12.349> block<00:03:12.680> up<00:03:12.829> here<00:03:13.040> and

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
sets this redstone block up here and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.280 
sets this redstone block up here and
because<00:03:13.730> this<00:03:13.910> comparator<00:03:14.389> is<00:03:14.480> here<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.840> also

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
because this comparator is here it also

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.710 
because this comparator is here it also
d<00:03:15.620> powers<00:03:15.980> this<00:03:16.160> torch<00:03:16.489> which<00:03:17.150> which<00:03:17.690> is

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
d powers this torch which which is

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.949 
d powers this torch which which is
important<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:18.919> this<00:03:19.400> then<00:03:20.030> sets<00:03:20.389> this<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.810> air

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
important so this then sets this to air

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.809 
important so this then sets this to air
and<00:03:21.349> why<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.709> does<00:03:21.859> that<00:03:21.889> is<00:03:22.250> because<00:03:22.489> if<00:03:22.700> you

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
and why it does that is because if you

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.699 
and why it does that is because if you
see<00:03:22.970> we<00:03:23.480> take<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:23.810> out<00:03:24.049> it<00:03:24.200> sets<00:03:24.349> the<00:03:24.500> block

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
see we take this out it sets the block

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.680 
see we take this out it sets the block
and<00:03:24.859> sets<00:03:25.099> that<00:03:25.340> can<00:03:25.489> matter<00:03:25.639> that<00:03:26.030> clock<00:03:26.540> in

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
and sets that can matter that clock in

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.559 
and sets that can matter that clock in
motion<00:03:27.019> it<00:03:27.440> also<00:03:27.560> d<00:03:27.799> powers<00:03:28.190> this<00:03:28.400> this<00:03:28.910> torch

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
motion it also d powers this this torch

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.589 
motion it also d powers this this torch
which<00:03:30.079> will<00:03:30.430> when<00:03:31.430> we<00:03:31.519> take<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.819> off<00:03:31.940> repower

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
which will when we take it off repower

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.819 
which will when we take it off repower
that<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:32.930> empower<00:03:33.169> this<00:03:33.349> which<00:03:33.590> will<00:03:33.709> take

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
that and empower this which will take

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.289 
that and empower this which will take
away<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.040> redstone<00:03:34.430> block<00:03:34.669> which<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:35.000> great

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
away the redstone block which is great

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.330 
away the redstone block which is great
that's<00:03:35.569> what<00:03:35.690> we<00:03:35.750> need<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.620> this<00:03:36.799> is<00:03:36.829> this

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
that's what we need so this is this

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.460 
that's what we need so this is this
clock<00:03:38.090> is<00:03:38.120> pretty<00:03:38.480> much<00:03:38.569> similar<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.139> word

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
clock is pretty much similar to the word

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.530 
clock is pretty much similar to the word
the<00:03:39.590> same<00:03:39.709> as<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:39.919> one<00:03:40.040> down<00:03:40.220> here<00:03:40.329> this<00:03:41.329> one

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
the same as the one down here this one

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.539 
the same as the one down here this one
sets<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.169> one<00:03:42.349> takes<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.650> away<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.069> then

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
sets it this one takes it away and then

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:44.890 
sets it this one takes it away and then
these<00:03:43.699> are<00:03:43.760> running<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.180> test<00:03:44.389> for<00:03:44.629> with<00:03:44.870> a

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
these are running a test for with a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.140 
these are running a test for with a
health<00:03:45.079> score<00:03:45.379> of<00:03:45.470> 12<00:03:46.030> 6<00:03:47.030> 8<00:03:47.359> and<00:03:48.549> 16<00:03:49.549> so<00:03:49.879> this

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
health score of 12 6 8 and 16 so this

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.220 
health score of 12 6 8 and 16 so this
one<00:03:50.299> breaks<00:03:50.449> when<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:50.780> have<00:03:50.870> eight<00:03:51.049> hearts

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
one breaks when you have eight hearts

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.500 
one breaks when you have eight hearts
left<00:03:51.500> that's<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.949> round<00:03:52.549> shield<00:03:52.819> this<00:03:53.359> one

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
left that's the round shield this one

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.909 
left that's the round shield this one
breaks<00:03:53.629> may<00:03:53.870> have<00:03:53.989> four<00:03:54.290> hearts<00:03:54.560> left<00:03:54.739> they

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
breaks may have four hearts left they

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.750 
breaks may have four hearts left they
broke<00:03:55.160> early<00:03:55.639> though<00:03:55.790> for<00:03:55.819> for<00:03:56.419> some<00:03:56.780> reason<00:03:57.760> I

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
broke early though for for some reason I

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.869 
broke early though for for some reason I
think<00:03:59.660> it's<00:03:59.750> because<00:04:00.459> we<00:04:01.459> should<00:04:01.609> only<00:04:01.699> have

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
think it's because we should only have

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.699 
think it's because we should only have
those<00:04:02.060> like<00:04:02.239> that<00:04:02.449> but<00:04:02.900> then<00:04:03.049> these<00:04:03.199> won't<00:04:03.590> go

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
those like that but then these won't go

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.280 
those like that but then these won't go
off<00:04:03.859> but<00:04:04.519> anyway<00:04:04.760> when<00:04:05.329> you<00:04:05.359> get<00:04:05.599> to<00:04:05.720> hear<00:04:05.989> it

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
off but anyway when you get to hear it

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.420 
off but anyway when you get to hear it
clears<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.980> item<00:04:07.430> out<00:04:07.549> of<00:04:07.609> your<00:04:07.819> inventory<00:04:08.359> oh

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
clears the item out of your inventory oh

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.189 
clears the item out of your inventory oh
so<00:04:10.430> when<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.030> hit<00:04:11.150> a<00:04:11.389> score<00:04:11.780> of<00:04:11.870> health<00:04:12.019> which

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
so when you hit a score of health which

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.289 
so when you hit a score of health which
where<00:04:12.590> eight<00:04:12.829> which<00:04:13.010> is<00:04:13.040> four<00:04:13.340> hearts<00:04:13.579> clears

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
where eight which is four hearts clears

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.449 
where eight which is four hearts clears
the<00:04:14.389> item<00:04:14.660> out<00:04:14.720> of<00:04:14.780> your<00:04:14.930> inventory<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.530> then

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
the item out of your inventory and then

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.860 
the item out of your inventory and then
it<00:04:16.579> also<00:04:16.699> plays<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:16.969> particle<00:04:17.450> effects<00:04:17.719> for<00:04:17.810> a

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
it also plays the particle effects for a

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.550 
it also plays the particle effects for a
crit<00:04:18.140> hit<00:04:19.060> with<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.329> too<00:04:20.870> wide<00:04:21.079> radius<00:04:21.320> around

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
crit hit with a too wide radius around

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.340 
crit hit with a too wide radius around
new<00:04:21.769> 25

for<00:04:22.590> 25<00:04:22.890> ticks<00:04:23.700> a<00:04:23.970> thousand<00:04:24.840> times<00:04:24.960> so<00:04:25.320> it's

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
for 25 ticks a thousand times so it's

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.020 
for 25 ticks a thousand times so it's
quite<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.740> lot<00:04:25.920> and<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.220> plays<00:04:26.400> out<00:04:26.550> right<00:04:26.580> on<00:04:26.790> you

in the mini game that I talks about in

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.600 
in the mini game that I talks about in
my<00:04:36.630> last<00:04:36.660> video<00:04:37.080> there's<00:04:37.800> going<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.040> be<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.370> few

my last video there's going to be a few

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.920 
my last video there's going to be a few
different<00:04:38.670> kits<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.360> some<00:04:39.570> of<00:04:39.630> them<00:04:39.750> needed

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
different kits and some of them needed

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.540 
different kits and some of them needed
shields<00:04:40.530> so<00:04:40.800> I<00:04:40.860> need<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.160> come<00:04:41.310> up<00:04:41.340> with<00:04:41.400> a

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
shields so I need to come up with a

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.990 
shields so I need to come up with a
different<00:04:42.200> mechanism<00:04:43.200> for<00:04:43.890> different<00:04:44.700> levels

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
different mechanism for different levels

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.240 
different mechanism for different levels
of<00:04:45.120> shields<00:04:45.540> and<00:04:45.570> this<00:04:46.020> is<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.920> best<00:04:47.040> one<00:04:47.190> I

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
of shields and this is the best one I

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.400 
of shields and this is the best one I
came<00:04:47.490> up<00:04:47.610> with<00:04:47.730> it's<00:04:48.300> pretty<00:04:48.480> compact<00:04:48.990> as<00:04:49.230> well
