hey<00:00:06.690> guys<00:00:06.899> David<00:00:07.350> here<00:00:07.589> Bombo<00:00:08.040> calm<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.849> then

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
hey guys David here Bombo calm and then

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.970 
hey guys David here Bombo calm and then
this<00:00:09.179> what<00:00:09.330> I'm<00:00:09.420> doing<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.840> benchmarking<00:00:10.710> of

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
this what I'm doing a benchmarking of

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.669 
this what I'm doing a benchmarking of
the<00:00:11.370> Samsung<00:00:11.910> Galaxy<00:00:12.389> Note<00:00:12.420> 10.1<00:00:12.929> as<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.559> guys

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 as you guys

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.650 
the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 as you guys
can<00:00:13.830> see<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.009> have<00:00:14.250> here<00:00:14.519> I'm<00:00:14.820> gonna<00:00:15.150> be<00:00:15.240> doing<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
can see I have here I'm gonna be doing a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.760 
can see I have here I'm gonna be doing a
couple<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.080> benchmarks<00:00:16.470> will<00:00:16.590> be<00:00:16.650> doing

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
couple of benchmarks will be doing

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.939 
couple of benchmarks will be doing
quadrant<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.520> tune<00:00:17.940> -<00:00:18.210> Vellamo<00:00:18.810> CF<00:00:19.470> bench<00:00:19.710> and

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
quadrant and tune - Vellamo CF bench and

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.769 
quadrant and tune - Vellamo CF bench and
last<00:00:20.310> time<00:00:20.520> we're<00:00:20.670> doing<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:21.090> browser<00:00:21.480> mark

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
last time we're doing a browser mark

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.269 
last time we're doing a browser mark
benchmark<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.710> I'll<00:00:22.830> go<00:00:22.920> ahead<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.130> start

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
benchmark so I'll go ahead and start

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.009 
benchmark so I'll go ahead and start
with<00:00:23.460> quadrant<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.029> then<00:00:24.180> I'll<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.720> kind<00:00:24.900> of

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
with quadrant and then I'll just kind of

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.540 
with quadrant and then I'll just kind of
skip<00:00:25.230> through<00:00:25.260> each<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> benchmarks<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:26.519> I

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
skip through each of the benchmarks so I

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.599 
skip through each of the benchmarks so I
guess<00:00:26.699> could<00:00:26.880> get<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> results<00:00:28.039> so<00:00:29.039> I'm<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.220> run

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
guess could get the results so I'm a run

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.609 
guess could get the results so I'm a run
full<00:00:29.939> benchmark<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.960> said<00:00:31.140> I'll<00:00:31.289> skip

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
full benchmark and like I said I'll skip

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.440 
full benchmark and like I said I'll skip
to<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.250> result<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.759> then<00:00:32.969> show<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.180> guys<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
to the result and then show you guys the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.050 
to the result and then show you guys the
score<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.750> end

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.300 

all<00:00:40.060> right<00:00:40.210> so<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.810> benchmark<00:00:41.500> is<00:00:41.680> done<00:00:42.070> and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
all right so the benchmark is done and

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.000 
all right so the benchmark is done and
you<00:00:42.730> can<00:00:42.760> see<00:00:42.970> it<00:00:43.090> says<00:00:43.239> your<00:00:43.840> device<00:00:44.230> scored<00:00:44.860> a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
you can see it says your device scored a

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.330 
you can see it says your device scored a
five<00:00:45.580> thousand<00:00:46.120> 829<00:00:46.660> so<00:00:47.650> a<00:00:47.680> really<00:00:48.070> high

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
five thousand 829 so a really high

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.150 
five thousand 829 so a really high
benchmark<00:00:48.730> score<00:00:49.590> maybe<00:00:50.590> this<00:00:50.830> is<00:00:50.950> just<00:00:51.100> the

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
benchmark score maybe this is just the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.530 
benchmark score maybe this is just the
first<00:00:51.370> time<00:00:51.489> I<00:00:51.550> ever<00:00:51.610> run<00:00:51.760> it<00:00:51.910> maybe<00:00:52.090> it<00:00:52.420> could

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
first time I ever run it maybe it could

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.570 
first time I ever run it maybe it could
go<00:00:52.629> a<00:00:52.660> little<00:00:52.900> bit<00:00:53.050> higher<00:00:53.489> considering<00:00:54.489> the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
go a little bit higher considering the

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.520 
go a little bit higher considering the
fact<00:00:54.760> that<00:00:54.820> this<00:00:55.000> guy<00:00:55.180> does<00:00:55.600> have<00:00:55.809> a<00:00:55.870> 1.4

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
fact that this guy does have a 1.4

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.439 
fact that this guy does have a 1.4
gigahertz<00:00:56.890> quad-core<00:00:57.730> processors<00:00:58.330> to

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
gigahertz quad-core processors to

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.540 
gigahertz quad-core processors to
akeno's<00:00:58.780> for<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.019> quad<00:00:59.260> with<00:00:59.769> two<00:01:00.129> gigabytes<00:01:00.280> of

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
akeno's for a quad with two gigabytes of

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.790 
akeno's for a quad with two gigabytes of
RAM<00:01:00.730> but<00:01:01.000> for<00:01:01.390> now<00:01:01.510> we'll<00:01:02.140> just<00:01:02.170> accept<00:01:02.620> that

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
RAM but for now we'll just accept that

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.350 
RAM but for now we'll just accept that
result<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:03.340> go<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.850> next<00:01:04.030> one<00:01:04.180> which<00:01:04.330> is

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
result and go to the next one which is

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.050 
result and go to the next one which is
an<00:01:04.690> tune<00:01:04.960> -<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.410> again<00:01:05.950> i'ma<00:01:06.250> run<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.759> test

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
an tune - and again i'ma run the test

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.030 
an tune - and again i'ma run the test
and<00:01:07.240> then<00:01:07.450> just<00:01:07.750> kind<00:01:07.930> of<00:01:07.990> skip<00:01:08.259> through<00:01:08.290> the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
and then just kind of skip through the

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:18.380 
and then just kind of skip through the
whole<00:01:09.729> process

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:27.800 

you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.620 

all<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.890> benchmark<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.909> done<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
all right so the benchmark is done and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.889 
all right so the benchmark is done and
it<00:01:31.020> scored<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.740> twelve<00:01:32.670> thousand<00:01:33.180> six<00:01:33.540> hundred

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
it scored a twelve thousand six hundred

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.840 
it scored a twelve thousand six hundred
and<00:01:33.990> sixty<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.530> again<00:01:34.710> really<00:01:35.130> high<00:01:35.280> score<00:01:35.640> as

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and sixty so again really high score as

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.760 
and sixty so again really high score as
is<00:01:36.479> expected<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.380> power<00:01:37.560> this

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
is expected with all the power this

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.230 
is expected with all the power this
guy's<00:01:37.950> packing<00:01:38.250> let's<00:01:38.640> go<00:01:38.759> ahead<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
guy's packing let's go ahead and go to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.130 
guy's packing let's go ahead and go to
the<00:01:39.570> next<00:01:39.840> benchmark<00:01:40.409> which<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.860> CF<00:01:41.369> bench<00:01:42.140> all

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the next benchmark which is CF bench all

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.330 
the next benchmark which is CF bench all
right<00:01:43.289> so<00:01:43.380> I'll<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.590> hit<00:01:43.740> full<00:01:43.890> benchmark

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
right so I'll just hit full benchmark

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.669 
right so I'll just hit full benchmark
and<00:01:44.549> same<00:01:44.850> thing<00:01:44.880> I'll<00:01:45.179> skip<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.539> the<00:01:46.049> end<00:01:46.439> so

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
and same thing I'll skip to the end so

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.260 
and same thing I'll skip to the end so
you<00:01:46.710> guys<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.520> results

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.510 
you guys can see the results
alright<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> bench<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.740> done<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
