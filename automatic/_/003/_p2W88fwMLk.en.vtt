 to everyone new video today and it's about 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.040
 a video entirely dedicated as 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.679
 for the realities these days life that 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.599
 you will see a lot of videos because I am 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.820
 waiting for me to get several 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.070
 packets from the internet so I care 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.350
 then to show you what he thinks of you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.050
 see what I got though in general 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.570
 this video is dedicated to essence and in 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.599
 particular to the collection that just 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.480
 exit which is called good girl bad girl 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.560
 so he saw them good girl and girl 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.059
 bad 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.640
 you find it intact and I have to thank 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.820
 denise that she is a girl who follows me 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.469
 here aosta a kiss she asks me 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.649
 always a day when I find one 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.860
 collection always sends me an email or 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.250
 however a message on instagram 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.590
 I had already bet this collection 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.899
 in fact from the site if I had not found 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.180
 I would have met her directly from 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.359
 cosmetics for less because I liked it 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.609
 very much so in the end I was 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.379
 lucky because it is thanks to her and thanks 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.619
 to the fact that the stands here do not come 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.510
 never touched it I found it and I do it 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.640
 see all the hills I took 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.890
 obviously as I always tell you since 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.350
 a video then in the comments let me know 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.390
 which product you are most interested in 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.220
 you would like to see such a work at work 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.960
 ingenuity to make the video 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.869
 the first thing i took were i 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.740
 two glock arouse I took both this 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.770
 here that number 02 good guys were kitsch 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.020
 and it's really a transparent gloss 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.670
 this one here in blossoming is just one 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.280
 transparent gloss then actually 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.170
 I think they could avoid it in the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.570
 most cute packaging because it looks like that 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.180
 have golden specks but when 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.399
 go and roll it out at least from the watch 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.890
 it's nothing special I could 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.630
 avoid it but I took the other half e 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.590
 I like it very much and am looking forward to 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:00.509
 put it is 0 1 is sweet art 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.759
 surely it is almost pink in color 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.270
 pearl so I think it has an effect 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.250
 very particular on the lips and me 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.530
 really like the texture too 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.200
 biting it seemed good to me 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.540
 consistency so if you had to tell him the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.269
 first impression this no and yes 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.650
 then for charity it is just a first 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.810
 impression because I don't have it yet 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.790
 tried something else that I took on the site 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.269
 I had missed it but I saw the shop 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.099
 and I liked it was this blush 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.709
 I believe this here more than an arm 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.500
 which I will use as illuminating is 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.950
 beautiful because all the thumbs up 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.980
 little stars drawn inside is a color 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.319
 slightly clear so if you have the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.420
 complexion like mine anyway more 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.910
 dark I don't recommend it if not like 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.489
 enlightening if you are very clear 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.940
 this blush is beautiful here 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.370
 however it is 0 1 good guys were pitch 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.739
 I also took one of the two sticks 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.709
 come out and I chose this one here that is 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.579
 the one with the colors we say more intense 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:09.319
 darker in fact there is a very purple 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:13.049
 beautiful a violet bar fuchsia 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.840
 very intense a black mat is golden 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.540
 very merino skiing are all colors 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.940
 shimmer cran black mat and in my opinion 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.940
 this palette alone is perfect for 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.859
 create very very intense looks and 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.599
 at the same time much sought after 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.669
 in fact I hope you ask me the 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.680
 tutorial of that of this why 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.450
 otherwise I'm going to do it 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.250
 that is, in my opinion, this 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.260
 beautiful blades all right 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.239
 colors that I use more I took 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.819
 also the only perfume released with this 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.639
 collection I love these perfumes from 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.160
 this year 's essence handbag 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.290
 cute packaging that you throw yourself into 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.530
 bag does not bother you anymore 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.330
 but they give you 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.060
 the refreshed one when you're out and about 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.370
 I have bought so many in the many hours 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.120
 years and whenever they propose to 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:05.920
 new to buy this here is a lot 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.480
 sweet is a very youthful perfume not 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.450
 I know how to say a lot 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.610
 as a boy in my opinion very cool but 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.530
 at the same time sweet sweet so if 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.510
 you don't like sweet smells 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.669
 I don't know if this is for you 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.709
 obviously the thing I liked best 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.720
 of the collection were the lipsticks I have them 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.080
 found both of them and took them all 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.560
 and two 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.419
 this is a beautiful color I have it 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.090
 already tried because I couldn't resist it 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.450
 really something wonderful is a 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.450
 purple fuchsia as you see it in 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.790
 packaging is on the lips remains not 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:44.169
 totally matt but still enough 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:47.160
 opaque and remains very comfortable 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.570
 lips this is number 02 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.520
 compensation however I also put you 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.340
 names in addition to prices always in the info 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.550
 box and then luckily I also found 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.950
 the other aspect that has black lipstick 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.710
 so actually in the package is a 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.740
 very dark purple yes almost a black with 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.150
 this is some brown reflection here yes 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.280
 call 01 it was on tour and it is 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.229
 absolutely a violet once carla 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.500
 to spread it but a purple of those 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.780
 purple is just intent this is here for 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.390
 personico and major second but nonetheless 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.580
 for special occasions and for the 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.650
 evening but I liked the idea I have none 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.310
 of so strong I think I have only one 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.169
 of max is that of however it is not so purple 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.669
 this is really the prospect more 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.510
 intense that I have in all of mine 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.400
 collection 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.650
 the last two little things I took of 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.130
 this line were the two enamels in 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.160
 actually these are the art factories and ho 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.110
 taken both the clearest one and this one 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.500
 color 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.080
 very particular is called 01 Ã¨ lo 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.320
 sweet art and has inside all of the 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:59.460
 slightly long specks of hour for z 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.610
 the seas this color is rose gold bronze is 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.050
 very nice i'm looking forward to 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.580
 use it because I think this is here 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:10.380
 is one of those top coat that gives an effect 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.420
 elegant just lengthens immediately and 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.460
 the other one I took is always done 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.990
 similar to the one that operates in the layer 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.270
 is the 0 2 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:23.370
 once iwas range and instead of being on 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:28.230
 gilded bronze rose gold this is here 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:31.350
 all on black on gray on yes to 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.420
 own color in grays very much more 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.380
 intense much more in the evening according to me 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.700
 but even this to these flakes 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.130
 long rectangular shapes that attract me 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.570
 much to create these mail art 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.580
 so they were all the purchases I have 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.130
 made recently by essence e 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.080
 especially of the new collection not 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.640
 I got to try nothing if not 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.490
 the prospectus but I tried it once 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.920
 only then will I really let you know 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.840
 coming soon in other videos if you 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.850
 you have already found let me know what 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.860
 you took if there is a little something there 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.390
 attracts and I recommend you also let me 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.670
 know what you would like to see 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.860
 at work so I try to get the video 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:11.070
 because in my opinion it is a very collection 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.600
 very pretty this time it is outdated 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.580
 I hope the videos are done to you 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.040
 some useful way of keeping me 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.390
 company I send a big kiss and there 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.260
 see you at the next video 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.260
 Hello
