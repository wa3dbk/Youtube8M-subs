on<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.370> doesn't<00:02:34.760> feel<00:02:34.879> as<00:02:34.940> if<00:02:35.269> your<00:02:35.560> your<00:02:36.560> face

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
on it doesn't feel as if your your face

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.520 
on it doesn't feel as if your your face
is<00:02:37.129> like<00:02:37.430> heavy<00:02:37.730> with<00:02:38.209> makeup<00:02:38.629> instead<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.519> um

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
is like heavy with makeup instead and um

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.430 
is like heavy with makeup instead and um
what's<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.709> called<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:43.390> have<00:02:44.390> combination<00:02:44.750> to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
what's it called I have combination to

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.069 
what's it called I have combination to
oily<00:02:45.620> skin<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.209> just<00:02:47.359> depends<00:02:47.659> during<00:02:47.959> the

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
oily skin so it just depends during the

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.470 
oily skin so it just depends during the
year<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:49.900> but<00:02:51.220> when<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.250> first<00:02:52.819> you<00:02:53.060> say<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:53.299> was

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
year and but when I first you say I was

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.599 
year and but when I first you say I was
kind<00:02:53.690> of<00:02:53.720> like<00:02:53.840> iffy<00:02:54.440> about<00:02:54.470> if<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.250> was<00:02:55.430> gonna

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
kind of like iffy about if it was gonna

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.720 
kind of like iffy about if it was gonna
make<00:02:55.940> my<00:02:56.090> face<00:02:56.329> really<00:02:56.720> oily<00:02:57.319> or<00:02:57.889> breakout<00:02:58.700> or

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
make my face really oily or breakout or

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.539 
make my face really oily or breakout or
anything<00:02:59.120> but<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.780> doesn't<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.470> kind<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.829> well

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
anything but it doesn't it kind of well

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.280 
anything but it doesn't it kind of well
at<00:03:01.700> least<00:03:01.849> for<00:03:02.000> me<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.329> kind<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.690> keeps<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.260> oil

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
at least for me it kind of keeps the oil

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.240 
at least for me it kind of keeps the oil
um<00:03:04.510> kind<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.599> under<00:03:05.810> control<00:03:06.139> that<00:03:06.950> makes<00:03:07.129> any

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
um kind of under control that makes any

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.479 
um kind of under control that makes any
sense<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:09.019> doesn't<00:03:09.079> make<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.470> face<00:03:09.709> oily<00:03:10.159> at<00:03:10.280> all

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
sense it doesn't make a face oily at all

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.740 
sense it doesn't make a face oily at all
it<00:03:10.849> gives<00:03:11.659> it<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:12.260> nice<00:03:12.879> finish<00:03:13.879> like<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.150> satin

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
it gives it a nice finish like a satin

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.740 
it gives it a nice finish like a satin
finish<00:03:14.989> I<00:03:15.470> guess<00:03:16.340> that's<00:03:17.239> what<00:03:17.629> it'd<00:03:17.720> be

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
finish I guess that's what it'd be

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.509 
finish I guess that's what it'd be
called<00:03:17.989> I'm<00:03:18.230> wearing<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.470> tie<00:03:18.560> face<00:03:18.829> right<00:03:19.069> now

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
called I'm wearing a tie face right now

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.559 
called I'm wearing a tie face right now
so<00:03:20.000> if<00:03:20.299> my<00:03:20.660> face<00:03:20.900> doesn't<00:03:21.199> look<00:03:22.150> too<00:03:23.150> thick<00:03:23.389> at

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
so if my face doesn't look too thick at

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.030 
so if my face doesn't look too thick at
least<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:25.780> what's<00:03:26.780> cool<00:03:27.109> about<00:03:27.139> this<00:03:27.590> is<00:03:27.889> that

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
least and what's cool about this is that

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.750 
least and what's cool about this is that
like<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:29.060> can<00:03:29.269> use<00:03:29.449> this<00:03:29.660> foundation<00:03:31.299> or<00:03:32.299> yeah

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
like you can use this foundation or yeah

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.369 
like you can use this foundation or yeah
as<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.819> can<00:03:35.120> see<00:03:35.299> where<00:03:35.449> to<00:03:35.629> so<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:35.900> can<00:03:36.109> take

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
as I can see where to so you can take

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.770 
as I can see where to so you can take
like<00:03:36.410> your<00:03:36.799> little<00:03:36.949> concealer<00:03:37.540> brush<00:03:38.540> or

your your powder on and like it covers

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
it up really well and another cool thing

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.860 
it up really well and another cool thing
about<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.360> that<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:11.019> you<00:04:12.010> can<00:04:12.340> build<00:04:13.209> the

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
about this is that and you can build the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.409 
about this is that and you can build the
coverage<00:04:14.459> so<00:04:15.459> if<00:04:15.579> you<00:04:15.700> want<00:04:15.909> like<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.120> light

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
coverage so if you want like a light

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.870 
coverage so if you want like a light
coverage<00:04:16.930> just<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:17.410> know<00:04:17.560> lightly<00:04:18.430> sweep<00:04:18.699> it

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
coverage just you know lightly sweep it

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.120 
coverage just you know lightly sweep it
and<00:04:19.030> it<00:04:19.180> gives<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.690> fairly<00:04:20.500> decent<00:04:20.680> amount<00:04:21.039> of

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
and it gives a fairly decent amount of

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.490 
and it gives a fairly decent amount of
coverage<00:04:21.459> but<00:04:22.240> if<00:04:22.389> you<00:04:22.510> really<00:04:22.810> want<00:04:23.050> like

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
coverage but if you really want like

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.390 
coverage but if you really want like
that<00:04:25.650> really<00:04:27.960> dense<00:04:28.960> amount<00:04:29.410> of<00:04:29.530> coverage<00:04:29.919> for

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
that really dense amount of coverage for

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.060 
that really dense amount of coverage for
some<00:04:30.580> reason<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.180> I<00:04:31.240> guess<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:31.660> can<00:04:32.070> apply

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
some reason and I guess you can apply

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.020 
some reason and I guess you can apply
and<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:34.330> really<00:04:34.810> build<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.820> that's<00:04:36.820> another

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
and it really build that that's another

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.969 
and it really build that that's another
cool<00:04:37.270> thing<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:41.320> doesn't<00:04:41.530> make<00:04:41.710> your<00:04:41.800> face

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
cool thing and it doesn't make your face

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.469 
cool thing and it doesn't make your face
look<00:04:42.010> cakey<00:04:42.280> obviously<00:04:42.880> because<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.330> can

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
look cakey obviously because you can

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:44.790 
look cakey obviously because you can
tell<00:04:43.660> my<00:04:43.750> face<00:04:43.930> doesn't<00:04:44.110> look<00:04:44.320> cakey<00:04:44.470> at<00:04:44.680> all

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
tell my face doesn't look cakey at all

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.210 
tell my face doesn't look cakey at all

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
does it

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.520 
does it
I<00:04:45.400> hope<00:04:45.970> not<00:04:46.479> but<00:04:47.440> um<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:49.690> I'm<00:04:50.080> gonna<00:04:50.199> take<00:04:50.380> it

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
I hope not but um and I'm gonna take it

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.659 
I hope not but um and I'm gonna take it
looks<00:04:50.650> like<00:04:50.800> I'm<00:04:50.919> wearing<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.160> lot<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.310> makeup

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
looks like I'm wearing a lot of makeup

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.150 
looks like I'm wearing a lot of makeup
place<00:04:52.030> for<00:04:52.210> my<00:04:52.270> face<00:04:52.650> maybe<00:04:53.650> put<00:04:53.860> some<00:04:54.010> blush

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
place for my face maybe put some blush

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.180 
place for my face maybe put some blush
and<00:04:54.340> stuff<00:04:54.550> on<00:04:54.729> but<00:04:54.970> it's<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.210> sort<00:04:55.479> of<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.600> story

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
and stuff on but it's a sort of a story

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.920 
and stuff on but it's a sort of a story
but<00:04:57.190> overall<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:57.880> would<00:04:57.970> really<00:04:58.270> recommend<00:04:58.479> it

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
but overall I would really recommend it

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.189 
but overall I would really recommend it
but<00:04:59.620> the<00:05:00.099> downside<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:00.789> this<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.449> is<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.840> little

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
but the downside to this it is a little

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.909 
but the downside to this it is a little
bit<00:05:02.349> pricey<00:05:03.150> but<00:05:04.150> it<00:05:04.419> depends<00:05:04.930> on<00:05:05.020> who<00:05:05.289> the

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
bit pricey but it depends on who the

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.250

sixty<00:05:41.050> dollars<00:05:41.620> I<00:05:41.919> know<00:05:42.010> it's<00:05:42.280> a<00:05:42.310> little<00:05:42.520> bit

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
sixty dollars I know it's a little bit

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.529 
sixty dollars I know it's a little bit
pricey<00:05:42.870> but<00:05:43.870> I<00:05:44.199> think<00:05:44.530> it's<00:05:44.650> kind<00:05:44.830> of<00:05:44.889> worth<00:05:45.039> it

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
pricey but I think it's kind of worth it

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.510 
pricey but I think it's kind of worth it
I've<00:05:46.539> tried<00:05:46.870> the<00:05:47.020> other<00:05:47.250> what's<00:05:48.250> it<00:05:48.340> called

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
I've tried the other what's it called

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.839 
I've tried the other what's it called
bare<00:05:48.760> essentials<00:05:49.419> mineral<00:05:50.139> stuff<00:05:51.070> and<00:05:51.400> I<00:05:51.550> I

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
bare essentials mineral stuff and I I

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.000 
bare essentials mineral stuff and I I
don't<00:05:52.090> really<00:05:52.210> like<00:05:52.419> that<00:05:52.449> I<00:05:52.930> prefer<00:05:53.800> this

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
don't really like that I prefer this

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.640 
don't really like that I prefer this
over<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.400> other<00:05:54.550> one<00:05:54.849> better<00:05:55.090> I<00:05:55.510> think<00:05:56.320> this

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
over the other one better I think this

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.839 
over the other one better I think this
gives<00:05:56.800> a<00:05:57.010> little<00:05:57.190> bit<00:05:57.280> more<00:05:57.460> coverage<00:05:57.789> than

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
gives a little bit more coverage than

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.399 
gives a little bit more coverage than
the<00:05:58.030> other<00:05:58.240> one<00:05:58.479> but<00:05:58.780> then<00:05:58.930> again<00:05:59.020> that's<00:05:59.229> my

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
the other one but then again that's my

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.879 
the other one but then again that's my
opinion

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
opinion

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.780
