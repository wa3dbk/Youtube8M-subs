00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
issue I have with this is that the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.290 
issue I have with this is that the
standard<00:02:10.649> wire<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.220> get<00:02:11.459> with<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.640> isn't<00:02:12.120> very

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
standard wire you get with it isn't very

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.610 
standard wire you get with it isn't very
long<00:02:12.510> so

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
long so

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.009
