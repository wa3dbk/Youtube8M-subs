00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.380
 Abstract loves in narrow streets hugs from others, smiles in a round. 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:42.360
 Conscious rejection, conscious rejection minutes that mark a clear delay. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.200
 One goes out to look for what nobody has left. Another waits for the day and time to arrive. 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.550
 And it's hard for us to understand how beautiful life is 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:11.910
 when one also accepts that the other also smiles. 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.380
 And the head of the zoo that administers this is just as much a dinosaur as the one that works inside 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.500
 TODAY, a bacteria that multiplies even more 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.140
 making love for a consumer who dies in life ... 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:02:05.360
 Love for sale a sad exit. That is violence, although nobody says so. 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:30.740
 Love for sale a slow agony. A market protects what kills life. 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.220
 Mental repression, mental repression, mental repression ... 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.320
 Mental repression, mental repression ... 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.560
 Mental repression, mental repression, mental repression ... 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.200
 Mental repression, mental repression ... 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.300
 In Country of the blind, the one-eyed man is KING. 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:49.520
 Love for sale a sad exit. That is violence, although nobody says so. 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:05.340
 Love for sale a slow agony. A market protects what kills life. 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.400
 Mental repression, mental repression, mental repression ... 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.260
 Mental repression, mental repression ... 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.660
 Mental repression, mental repression, mental repression ... 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.860
 Mental repression, mental repression ... 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.220
 In Country of the blind, the one-eyed man is ... 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.140
 the one-eyed man is KING 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.380
 the one-eyed man is KING 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.100
 the one-eyed man is KING 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.040
 In Country of the blind, the one-eyed man is KING.
