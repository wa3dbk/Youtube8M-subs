00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
explaining to you what our fire cords

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.629 
explaining to you what our fire cords
not<00:00:10.320> really<00:00:10.590> sure<00:00:10.860> where<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.160> term<00:00:11.370> came

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
not really sure where that term came

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.120 
not really sure where that term came
from<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.120> think<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.480> started<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.889> jazz

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
from I think it started in a in the jazz

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.090 
from I think it started in a in the jazz
scene<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.969> more<00:00:15.780> recently<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.650> been<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.859> term

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
scene and more recently it's been a term

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.880 
scene and more recently it's been a term
used<00:00:17.400> by<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> lot<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:17.970> gospel<00:00:18.410> players<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.740> what

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
used by a lot of gospel players and what

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.390 
used by a lot of gospel players and what
it<00:00:19.980> basically<00:00:20.130> means<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.859> take<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> chord

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
it basically means is to take a chord

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.269 
it basically means is to take a chord
and<00:00:23.869> substitute<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.140> chord<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.830> has<00:00:26.010> more

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
and substitute a chord that has more

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.839 
and substitute a chord that has more
flavor<00:00:26.640> or<00:00:27.119> more<00:00:27.840> tension<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.340> place<00:00:29.580> of

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
flavor or more tension in the place of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.540 
flavor or more tension in the place of
that<00:00:29.880> normal<00:00:30.630> chord<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.500> will<00:00:32.099> take<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
that normal chord that will take you to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.360 
that normal chord that will take you to
you<00:00:33.090> know<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> your<00:00:33.600> root<00:00:33.870> chord<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.980> know<00:00:35.100> so

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
you know to your root chord you know so

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.220 
you know to your root chord you know so
for<00:00:35.579> example<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.690> know<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.840> could<00:00:37.050> play<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
for example you know I could play a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.549 
for example you know I could play a
simple<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:38.040> two<00:00:38.460> five<00:00:38.760> turnaround<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:40.020> see

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
simple a two five turnaround and see

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.779 
simple a two five turnaround and see
which<00:00:41.129> might<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.730> D<00:00:41.940> minor<00:00:43.219> to<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.370> G

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
which might be this D minor to this G

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.560 
which might be this D minor to this G
dominant<00:00:45.390> seven<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:47.489> then<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.850> resolves<00:00:48.390> on

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
dominant seven and then it resolves on

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.590 
dominant seven and then it resolves on
the<00:00:48.690> C

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
the C

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.360 
the C
you<00:00:50.899> know<00:00:51.019> that's<00:00:51.199> just<00:00:51.320> a<00:00:51.530> simple<00:00:51.859> turnaround

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
you know that's just a simple turnaround

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.790 
you know that's just a simple turnaround
now<00:00:53.030> what<00:00:53.269> we<00:00:53.420> do<00:00:53.629> when<00:00:54.230> we<00:00:54.410> want<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.649> add<00:00:54.769> a

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
now what we do when we want to add a

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.920 
now what we do when we want to add a
fire<00:00:55.129> cord<00:00:55.519> in<00:00:55.640> there<00:00:55.879> instead<00:00:56.539> of<00:00:56.750> playing

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
fire cord in there instead of playing

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.560 
fire cord in there instead of playing
that<00:00:57.199> G<00:00:57.469> dominant<00:00:57.680> seven<00:00:58.430> I'm<00:00:58.760> gonna<00:00:59.180> I'm

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
that G dominant seven I'm gonna I'm

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.569 
that G dominant seven I'm gonna I'm
gonna<00:00:59.750> place<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.079> fire<00:01:00.649> cord<00:01:01.010> in<00:01:01.159> place<00:01:01.370> of<00:01:01.550> that

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
gonna place a fire cord in place of that

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:11.789 
gonna place a fire cord in place of that
so<00:01:02.120> we<00:01:02.269> might<00:01:02.510> get<00:01:02.960> something<00:01:03.289> like<00:01:03.469> this

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.899 

so<00:01:12.430> on<00:01:12.579> that<00:01:12.880> G<00:01:13.210> I<00:01:13.509> hit<00:01:14.079> something<00:01:14.409> like<00:01:14.560> this

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
so on that G I hit something like this

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.880 
so on that G I hit something like this
which<00:01:15.909> I'm<00:01:16.719> sure<00:01:16.929> you<00:01:17.049> can<00:01:17.200> hear<00:01:17.380> it<00:01:17.469> has<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.619> lot

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
which I'm sure you can hear it has a lot

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.179 
which I'm sure you can hear it has a lot
more<00:01:18.100> color<00:01:18.369> a<00:01:18.490> lot<00:01:18.759> more<00:01:19.060> flavor<00:01:19.359> and<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
more color a lot more flavor and you

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.160 
more color a lot more flavor and you
know<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.490> kind<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:21.880> there's<00:01:22.630> some<00:01:22.780> tension

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
know it kind of there's some tension

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.319 
know it kind of there's some tension
there<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.770> that<00:01:23.979> chord<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.549> that's<00:01:24.819> why<00:01:25.090> we

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
there in that chord and that's why we

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:26.520 
there in that chord and that's why we
call<00:01:25.539> it<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.719> fire<00:01:25.990> Cort

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
call it a fire Cort

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.889 
call it a fire Cort
so<00:01:27.069> another<00:01:27.280> example<00:01:27.850> might<00:01:28.119> be<00:01:28.149> you<00:01:28.659> know<00:01:28.780> the

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
so another example might be you know the

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:36.370 
so another example might be you know the
d7<00:01:29.880> -<00:01:30.880> you<00:01:31.840> know<00:01:31.959> something<00:01:32.439> like<00:01:32.649> this

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.899 

you<00:01:36.770> know<00:01:36.829> that's<00:01:37.040> another<00:01:37.310> example<00:01:37.490> of

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
you know that's another example of

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.330 
you know that's another example of
something<00:01:38.119> I<00:01:38.360> would<00:01:38.960> call<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.200> fire<00:01:39.500> cord<00:01:39.890> that

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
something I would call a fire cord that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.179 
something I would call a fire cord that
leads<00:01:40.579> us<00:01:40.759> right<00:01:40.820> to<00:01:41.000> our<00:01:41.149> si

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
leads us right to our si

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.940 
leads us right to our si
and<00:01:43.670> actually<00:01:44.119> if<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:44.479> use<00:01:44.630> your<00:01:44.960> imagination

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
and actually if you use your imagination

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.919 
and actually if you use your imagination
we<00:01:46.249> can<00:01:46.460> lead<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:46.909> lot<00:01:47.149> of<00:01:47.179> different<00:01:47.420> chords

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
we can lead to a lot of different chords

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.050 
we can lead to a lot of different chords
from<00:01:48.079> there<00:01:48.350> but<00:01:48.799> just<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.429> be<00:01:49.579> simple<00:01:49.880> for

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
from there but just to be simple for

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.520 
from there but just to be simple for
right<00:01:50.179> now<00:01:50.210> we're<00:01:50.539> gonna<00:01:50.659> say<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.079> leads<00:01:51.289> to<00:01:51.409> a

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
right now we're gonna say it leads to a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.889 
right now we're gonna say it leads to a
C<00:01:51.829> so<00:01:52.369> I'm<00:01:52.429> gonna<00:01:52.520> do<00:01:52.729> one<00:01:52.909> more<00:01:52.939> example<00:01:53.149> how

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
C so I'm gonna do one more example how

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:00.350 
C so I'm gonna do one more example how
about<00:01:53.929> a<00:01:54.170> go<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.159> this<00:01:55.310> D

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.240 

right<00:02:00.510> there<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.410> then<00:02:01.590> we're<00:02:01.740> gonna<00:02:01.800> resolve

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
right there and then we're gonna resolve

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.330 
right there and then we're gonna resolve
that<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.120> C<00:02:03.450> minor<00:02:03.780> actually<00:02:04.440> with<00:02:04.650> uh<00:02:04.680> with

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
that to a C minor actually with uh with

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.210 
that to a C minor actually with uh with
a<00:02:05.370> major<00:02:05.580> seven<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:10.200> know<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.500> that's<00:02:10.710> just<00:02:11.040> a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
a major seven you know so that's just a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.010 
a major seven you know so that's just a
quick<00:02:11.400> example<00:02:11.850> of<00:02:12.030> how<00:02:12.120> we<00:02:12.270> use<00:02:12.390> these<00:02:12.720> fire

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
quick example of how we use these fire
