we're gonna take our main needle and
we're<00:00:57.100> going<00:00:57.340> to<00:00:57.370> insert<00:00:57.910> it<00:00:58.090> into<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.710> hole

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
we're going to insert it into this hole

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.199 
we're going to insert it into this hole
right<00:01:00.399> here<00:01:01.079> behind<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:03.129> main<00:01:03.370> stitch<00:01:06.209> so

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:07.209 
right here behind the main stitch so

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:10.050 
right here behind the main stitch so
step<00:01:07.509> two<00:01:07.749> we're<00:01:08.079> going<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.380> push<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:09.729> stitch

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
step two we're going to push the stitch

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.809 
step two we're going to push the stitch
that's<00:01:10.299> on<00:01:10.420> your<00:01:10.869> working<00:01:11.139> needle<00:01:11.560> off<00:01:12.130> and

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
pull it out okay and that's how you knit

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.529 
pull it out okay and that's how you knit
backwards<00:01:17.499> so<00:01:17.649> let's<00:01:17.829> do<00:01:18.729> that<00:01:18.939> again

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.559 
backwards so let's do that again
one<00:01:20.049> make<00:01:20.229> sure<00:01:20.259> that<00:01:20.590> it's<00:01:20.770> this<00:01:21.009> loop<00:01:21.569> that's

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
one make sure that it's this loop that's

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.529 
one make sure that it's this loop that's
right<00:01:22.929> behind<00:01:23.139> your<00:01:23.679> stitch<00:01:24.149> and<00:01:25.149> it<00:01:25.240> helps<00:01:25.450> to

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
right behind your stitch and it helps to

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.570 
right behind your stitch and it helps to
kind<00:01:25.659> of<00:01:25.749> pull<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.109> away<00:01:26.700> insert<00:01:27.700> your<00:01:27.819> needle
