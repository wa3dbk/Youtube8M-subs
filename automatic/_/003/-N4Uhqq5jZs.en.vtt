00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 did them so today I'm coming back 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.609
 with a little video about the best at 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.120
 this month's box that I just came from 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.919
 to receive 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.370
 you only speak last time I 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.250
 will you unpack it in laye out I 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.800
 apologize for my head it's not 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.390
 the series like facebook you know 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.640
 why and besides, thank you 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.480
 really for all your little words because 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:33.030
 that most desirable winter next to me 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:37.680
 but the teeth we still have the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.790
 little letter on behalf of gulliver and he 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.010
 we have the million mag 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.079
 yes so in fact this is the novelty 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.120
 this month in the night at the boks 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.039
 and in the boombox too if I do not 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.920
 wrong is that they decided to 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.809
 do a little magazine but that makes 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.059
 really full share of boxing 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:00.690
 since inside you actually go 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.879
 find out how to say products 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:10.049
 for your animals 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:12.170
 these are new features of the advises against 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.400
 so here you have the tip of the month 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.680
 so what to do balls of hair from 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.590
 of the cat's toilet at night in boxing 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.979
 of the month so the games that inside 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.409
 their partner pleasure treats 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.729
 yes in fact you're really going to have the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.189
 detail of all that is inside 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.079
 boxing with little tips and 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.340
 I also want the photo of the month not 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.509
 the time to unpack the mystic toy has 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.030
 already jumped on it so I find that 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.750
 comes from involving our little ones 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.920
 animals like that like we were not 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.700
 share your photos on facebook is there 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 we can send them to stone 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.220
 degoul boxing here if we can 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.180
 share and that she finds herself in the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.689
 mine or evil so I find that 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.880
 really nice for once 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.140
 something a little a little mag 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.110
 that serves something not like in 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.680
 boxes kicked for example so we have 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.939
 had we got the book 30 million friends 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.860
 so that's pretty cool 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.090
 I'm going to read it I look often 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.989
 the show but I find that there is 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.340
 always lots of great stuff 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.840
 interesting by christian when we like 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.000
 animals are always a pleasure 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.650
 to have some reading on it so that 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.860
 i like to keep it i'm going i'm going to the 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.209
 bookeen and that's it I find it 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.980
 really nice to have a magazine because 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.450
 that it's an animal box is a 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.170
 animal magazine bah yeah that's 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.790
 it really falls to say the magazine 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.940
 30 million friends cost 4 euros 50 in 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.989
 France for those so inclined we 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.350
 saw that France is not there 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:42.160
 others in luxembourg it costs 5 euros and 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.970
 in Switzerland note by the Swiss y'a not the 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.880
 Swiss alpiq wanted Swiss then 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.680
 we read pleasure valÃ©rie des 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.570
 tasty treats anti ball of 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.980
 hair so it looks like this 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.450
 so we always have small 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.700
 treats be treats 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.070
 sweets either prices risking a goal 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.049
 like the anti ball of hair I find 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.130
 that very well towards winter 52 has never 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.120
 but it's better to prevent than to cure 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.959
 as the other would say 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.530
 so that's pretty good then 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.870
 we had exercisers I did not choose 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.239
 like sami man that's pretty fun 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.930
 had already had a game like that I think 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.060
 that it's an active boxing it seems to me is 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.010
 in fact you put little tips 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.299
 rocket fire inside either 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.940
 treats on croquettes croquettes 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.170
 and is actually you launch it 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.540
 come forward a little bit of everywhere and 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.630
 your hunt if I malign them and well he 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.740
 go he goes with that not 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.570
 kicking in and it's going to sow some 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.730
 croquettes etc and that's pretty fun 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.140
 mongu the winter he understood that when 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.310
 it was me tapes and one of them came out 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.880
 so he wants to do more alone 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.340
 so good here's what 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.510
 then we had a little game it offers 4 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.510
 so in fact it's a small cushion 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.220
 like that with a little a string in 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.570
 plastic that you can shoot with 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.970
 little hairs so that I know that the 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.820
 kittens he adores completely 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.740
 gulliver I do not know if silversea amused 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.970
 all alone with but in any case when we 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.930
 made him I know they love run 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.210
 after and then that's what's a field 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.670
 then we had an anti scratch 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.050
 close anti scratch spray so it's 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.760
 present like that I did not know that 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.470
 it existed it can be useful I think 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.580
 so personally winter is a 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:24.030
 absolutely cat one pictures 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:28.850
 look at me it has not been slow 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.590
 Seriously sleeps good cat good 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.330
 sites at roncq universe no but look 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.830
 me that he has confidence in high performance 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.590
 who are there gives us back the smile 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.620
 still so that's so it's a 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.660
 anti scratch spray what are they in 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.190
 say the anti- scratch eye spray for the 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.600
 obvious flamingo cat that your cat 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.760
 gray your furniture your carpets your 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.580
 papers by trash bag repeat the 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.120
 treatment every two months is what 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.990
 so it can be pretty bad yeah I think 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.520
 it can not be bad for cats 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.790
 that heals frankly it's a product 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.050
 rather nice me I do not want to 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.430
 the moment I have that gulliver so I 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.050
 would not let go because there are some 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.000
 No need but if I have another charge 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.180
 the concern it's never since I want 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.280
 to have our cat so here and then 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.130
 we saw a cool thing it's a 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.010
 fleece blanket for animals 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.170
 with little fish bones 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.640
 so it looks like that 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.140
 big and that I know that the universe is going 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.420
 worship completely 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.660
 I'm going there him meters out of 100 out of 100 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.060
 armchairs and in my opinion 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.680
 to be super happy because he loves it 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.670
 self is behind me not let go if 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.340
 you realize in fact but 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.750
 it's a polar blanket and she's 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.520
 lined inside it's kind of 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.680
 pilou and he loves to party with his 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.320
 paws he kneads the trick so he's 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.460
 really good 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.620
 here are the cyber listening and I hope this 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.420
 video will have pleased you still reigned at the box 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.860
 october i want to say little ones 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.960
 games of small treats 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.550
 I say big plus for the plaid 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.290
 polar it's really a great thing 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.790
 much more is in season and then I 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.830
 find it really nice it is red and 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.590
 everything with small small stops 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.000
 poison I find it super cute 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.320
 this is the little game the little thing in 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.430
 Siberia were I would not have me 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.600
 serve for now but I find that 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.650
 I really did not have that at all 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.800
 existed so it's really super nice 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.990
 it's really nice so here I go 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.210
 read my 30 million friends and I'm going 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.300

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.640
 waiting for gulliver to face sierre 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.930
