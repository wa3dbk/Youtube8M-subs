 jump directly to zoom 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:24.200

 do my text here and it works 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.569
 really really superbly I'm going 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.829
 try also since what is 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.720
 really good is that we have everything 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.590
 shortcut keys that archos has 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.720
 set up so I'm going to start from that 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.780
 so let's imagine we press them here 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.370
 that's pretty awesome with that takes over the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.170
 reading where you left it cost 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.489
 wide so the valley but jacqueline / p 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.739
 I pause 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:03:02.319
 I want that surprised I can change from 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:02.319
 music there I change again said 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.870
 it's really good I can decrease 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:12.040
 they are also directly increase it 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.840
 here the stopped like these ci increase and 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.280
 shine directly on the keyboard 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.290
 I can also activate bluetooth 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.390
 directly with this little button there that 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.060
 is right there that allows me to put it 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.720
 in place direct the disabled wifi do 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.970
 a search 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.530
 here not really it's super complete 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.740
 it's really a very beautiful product 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.020
 and especially the keyboard yield brought 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.930
 a utility so as I told you the 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.240
 keyboard wanted to fix like these and 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.980
 you do not put there like that too 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.100
 and you have our little tablet 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.320
 archos very easy to carry and 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.550
 hyper practice with connectivity finally 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.130
 really it is a very very beautiful product 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.980
 which in my opinion is likely to 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.580
 archos has enough stock for them 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.580
 family celebrations
