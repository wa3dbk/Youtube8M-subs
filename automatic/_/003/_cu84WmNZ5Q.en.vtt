think<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.630> looks<00:01:38.780> better<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.200> his<00:01:39.320> left<00:01:39.650> hand

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
think it looks better in his left hand

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.080 
think it looks better in his left hand
though<00:01:40.159> you<00:01:40.250> could<00:01:40.370> see<00:01:40.400> how<00:01:40.549> it<00:01:40.610> fits<00:01:40.909> in

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
though you could see how it fits in

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.460 
though you could see how it fits in
there<00:01:41.240> all<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:41.690> way<00:01:41.810> man<00:01:42.080> comes<00:01:42.290> with<00:01:42.409> these

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
there all the way man comes with these

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.440 
there all the way man comes with these
two<00:01:42.530> swords<00:01:43.040> over<00:01:43.340> here<00:01:43.549> one<00:01:43.850> is<00:01:44.000> larger<00:01:44.330> than

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
two swords over here one is larger than

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.210 
two swords over here one is larger than
the<00:01:44.570> other<00:01:44.780> just<00:01:45.049> like<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.320> Wolverine<00:01:45.799> figure

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
the other just like the Wolverine figure

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.860 
the other just like the Wolverine figure
that<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.520> got<00:01:46.700> from<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.940> masher<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:47.600> you<00:01:47.659> got

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
that I got from the masher so you got

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.969 
that I got from the masher so you got
the<00:01:47.960> big<00:01:48.080> one<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.350> then<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.530> smaller<00:01:48.799> one

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
the big one and then the smaller one

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.350 
the big one and then the smaller one
right<00:01:49.010> over<00:01:49.159> here<00:01:49.370> and<00:01:49.640> they<00:01:49.700> have<00:01:49.850> pegs<00:01:50.120> right

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
right over here and they have pegs right

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.180 
right over here and they have pegs right
there<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.810> at<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.020> very<00:01:51.110> bottom<00:01:51.229> then<00:01:52.040> he

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
there and at the very bottom then he

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.530 
there and at the very bottom then he
comes<00:01:52.340> with<00:01:52.490> these<00:01:52.580> three<00:01:52.850> ninja<00:01:53.119> stars<00:01:53.360> which

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
comes with these three ninja stars which

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.390 
comes with these three ninja stars which
I<00:01:53.630> think<00:01:53.810> are<00:01:53.900> really<00:01:53.930> cool<00:01:54.650> they<00:01:55.159> have<00:01:55.190> these

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
I think are really cool they have these

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.800 
I think are really cool they have these
pegs<00:01:55.700> that<00:01:55.820> stick<00:01:56.060> out<00:01:56.150> of<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.299> back<00:01:56.510> of<00:01:56.690> them

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
pegs that stick out of the back of them

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.300 
pegs that stick out of the back of them
to<00:01:56.990> think<00:01:57.260> Master<00:01:57.470> has<00:01:57.560> made<00:01:57.650> a<00:01:57.680> great<00:01:58.130> head

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
to think Master has made a great head

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.950 
to think Master has made a great head
sculpt<00:01:58.640> for<00:01:58.790> this<00:01:58.909> Deadpool<00:01:59.150> toy<00:01:59.570> I<00:01:59.750> think

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
sculpt for this Deadpool toy I think

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.750 
sculpt for this Deadpool toy I think
it's<00:02:00.049> really<00:02:00.320> cool<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:01.130> black<00:02:01.340> paint<00:02:01.580> doesn't

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
it's really cool the black paint doesn't

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.460 
it's really cool the black paint doesn't
seem<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.180> go<00:02:02.330> all<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.750> way<00:02:02.780> up<00:02:03.110> where<00:02:03.320> that

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
seem to go all the way up where that

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.200 
seem to go all the way up where that
seam<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:03.979> but<00:02:04.159> it's<00:02:04.280> not<00:02:04.430> too<00:02:04.640> bad

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
seam is but it's not too bad

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.149 
seam is but it's not too bad
it<00:02:05.450> matches<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.869> seam<00:02:06.200> at<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.470> bottom<00:02:06.890> so

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
it matches the seam at the bottom so

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.740 
it matches the seam at the bottom so
it's<00:02:07.400> not<00:02:07.520> terrible<00:02:08.030> or<00:02:08.119> anything<00:02:08.179> but<00:02:08.689> I

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
it's not terrible or anything but I

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.789 
it's not terrible or anything but I
really<00:02:08.810> liked<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.170> sculpt<00:02:09.439> on<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:09.709> can

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
really liked the sculpt on it you can

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.500 
really liked the sculpt on it you can
see<00:02:09.920> his<00:02:10.039> nose<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.580> it's<00:02:10.819> really<00:02:11.090> tricky<00:02:11.390> to

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
see his nose and it's really tricky to

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.789 
see his nose and it's really tricky to
see<00:02:11.689> but<00:02:11.959> you<00:02:12.049> could<00:02:12.170> tell<00:02:12.290> there's<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.560> mouth

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
see but you could tell there's a mouth

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.910 
see but you could tell there's a mouth
underneath<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.459> mask<00:02:14.200> yeah<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:15.470> really

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
underneath that mask yeah it's really

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.229 
underneath that mask yeah it's really
really<00:02:16.220> tough<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.610> see<00:02:16.760> but<00:02:16.970> they<00:02:17.060> have<00:02:17.209> a

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
really tough to see but they have a

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.759 
really tough to see but they have a
little<00:02:17.569> bit<00:02:17.689> of<00:02:17.780> an<00:02:17.870> indentation<00:02:18.170> for<00:02:18.620> where

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
little bit of an indentation for where

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.410 
little bit of an indentation for where
that<00:02:18.920> mouth<00:02:19.069> is<00:02:19.280> supposed<00:02:19.519> to<00:02:19.580> go<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.390> I

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
that mouth is supposed to go and I

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.369 
that mouth is supposed to go and I
really<00:02:20.450> like<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.870> could<00:02:20.989> see<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.230> ear

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
really like you could see the ear

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.809 
really like you could see the ear
popping<00:02:21.650> out<00:02:21.860> over<00:02:22.040> there<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.400> get<00:02:22.610> that

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
popping out over there you get that

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.759 
popping out over there you get that
Deadpool<00:02:23.299> dip<00:02:23.689> right<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.260> back<00:02:24.439> of<00:02:24.680> the

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
Deadpool dip right in the back of the

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.130 
Deadpool dip right in the back of the
head<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.250> think<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.819> is<00:02:26.000> great<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.780> body<00:02:26.959> mode

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
head I think this is great the body mode

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.750 
head I think this is great the body mode
was<00:02:27.290> based<00:02:27.470> off<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.890> spider-man<00:02:28.250> masters

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
was based off of the spider-man masters

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.339 
was based off of the spider-man masters
figure<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.540> think<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.810> paint<00:02:30.019> apps<00:02:30.200> on

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
figure and I think the paint apps on

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.899 
figure and I think the paint apps on
this<00:02:30.470> came<00:02:30.650> out<00:02:30.739> really<00:02:31.189> clean<00:02:31.519> I<00:02:31.549> like<00:02:31.670> what

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
this came out really clean I like what

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.159 
this came out really clean I like what
they've<00:02:32.030> done<00:02:32.180> over<00:02:32.209> here<00:02:32.419> he<00:02:32.629> has<00:02:32.659> different

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:33.169 
they've done over here he has different

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:34.449 
they've done over here he has different
arms<00:02:33.469> from<00:02:33.739> what<00:02:33.889> we've<00:02:34.040> seen<00:02:34.069> on<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
arms from what we've seen on the

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.099 
arms from what we've seen on the
spider-man<00:02:34.819> but<00:02:35.419> everything<00:02:35.810> else<00:02:35.959> is<00:02:36.079> the

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
spider-man but everything else is the

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:37.200 
spider-man but everything else is the
same

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
same

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.760 
same
not<00:02:37.360> really<00:02:37.540> quite<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.020> Deadpool<00:02:38.230> logo<00:02:38.650> right

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
not really quite the Deadpool logo right

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.740 
not really quite the Deadpool logo right
there<00:02:38.830> on<00:02:39.130> his<00:02:39.220> belt<00:02:39.490> but<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.700> guess<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.360> works

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
there on his belt but I guess that works

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.200 
there on his belt but I guess that works
but<00:02:41.140> like<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.470> said<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:42.100> paint<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.550> very<00:02:42.700> clean

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
but like I said the paint is very clean

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.910 
but like I said the paint is very clean
