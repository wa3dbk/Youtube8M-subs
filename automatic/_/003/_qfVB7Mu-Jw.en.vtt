00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.070 

but<00:01:37.040> yes<00:01:37.250> I<00:01:39.370> did<00:01:40.370> once<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.360> actually<00:01:41.540> got<00:01:41.930> it

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
but yes I did once you actually got it

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.560 
but yes I did once you actually got it
say<00:01:42.950> 20<00:01:43.310> seconds<00:01:43.730> hood<00:01:45.550> all<00:01:46.550> right<00:01:46.670> let's

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
say 20 seconds hood all right let's

00:01:47.570 --> 00:02:03.850 
say 20 seconds hood all right let's
adjust<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:48.080> so<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:48.590> goes

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.950 

so<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.950> do<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:05.420> though<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> bottom<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.870> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
so you do it though the bottom of the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.270 
so you do it though the bottom of the
screen<00:02:07.230> of<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:07.560> program<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.040> would

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
screen of this program you would

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.070 
screen of this program you would
actually<00:02:08.399> see<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:09.090> little<00:02:10.050> gauge<00:02:11.780> which<00:02:12.780> will

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
actually see a little gauge which will

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.890 
actually see a little gauge which will
also<00:02:13.740> help<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.310> pinpoint<00:02:14.550> exactly<00:02:15.330> where<00:02:15.600> 20

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
also help you pinpoint exactly where 20

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.480 
also help you pinpoint exactly where 20
seconds<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:19.380> can't<00:02:19.620> see<00:02:19.890> on<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.100> footage

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490
