frostbites<00:00:06.240> been<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.540> development<00:00:06.660> since

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
frostbites been in development since

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.740 
frostbites been in development since
2006<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.370> there's<00:00:08.790> always<00:00:08.970> been<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.269> road<00:00:09.510> map

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
2006 and there's always been a road map

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.370 
2006 and there's always been a road map
and<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> plan<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:11.010> gen<00:00:11.429> 4<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.030> beyond<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.080> I

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
and a plan for gen 4 and beyond so I

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.169 
and a plan for gen 4 and beyond so I
like<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.650> think<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.099> frostbite<00:00:14.610> as<00:00:14.940> an

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
like to think of frostbite as an

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.750 
like to think of frostbite as an
evolutionary<00:00:15.960> process<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.800> frostbite<00:00:17.190> 3<00:00:17.430> is

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
evolutionary process and frostbite 3 is

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.640 
evolutionary process and frostbite 3 is
the<00:00:18.119> next<00:00:18.420> step<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:18.900> evolution

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the next step in that evolution

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.189 
the next step in that evolution
frostbite<00:00:20.580> 3<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> really<00:00:21.539> powerful<00:00:21.720> tool

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
frostbite 3 is a really powerful tool

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.259 
frostbite 3 is a really powerful tool

it's<00:01:54.270> really<00:01:54.510> about<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.780> concept<00:01:55.200> how<00:01:55.290> you

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
it's really about the concept how you

a jet crashes into the ocean you'll see

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.170 
a jet crashes into the ocean you'll see

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
the water reaction and the debris will

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.449 
the water reaction and the debris will
then<00:02:42.330> float<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.590> waves<00:02:43.769> it's<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.160> very<00:02:44.370> very

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
then float on the waves it's a very very

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.360 
then float on the waves it's a very very
cool<00:02:45.060> dynamic<00:02:45.720> engine<00:02:46.110> things<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:46.860> happen

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
cool dynamic engine things just happen

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.540 
cool dynamic engine things just happen
and<00:02:47.549> it<00:02:47.790> seems<00:02:48.090> right

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
and it seems right

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.280

parallax animation in the iris you'll

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.660 
parallax animation in the iris you'll
notice<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.900> looks<00:03:15.200> like<00:03:15.380> a<00:03:15.410> real<00:03:15.740> eye<00:03:15.980> you<00:03:16.490> back

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
me a break frostbite 3 is so much more

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.250 
me a break frostbite 3 is so much more

before we have the frostbite team we

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.420 
before we have the frostbite team we
were<00:03:32.690> building<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.350> new<00:03:33.500> engine<00:03:33.710> every<00:03:34.220> time

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
were building a new engine every time

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.160 
were building a new engine every time
and<00:03:34.730> we<00:03:34.820> were<00:03:34.910> kind<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.180> stumbling<00:03:35.630> constantly

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
and we were kind of stumbling constantly

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.190 
and we were kind of stumbling constantly
now<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:37.220> have<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.850> team<00:03:38.060> here<00:03:38.330> to<00:03:38.360> focus<00:03:38.840> on

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
now to have the team here to focus on

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.650 
now to have the team here to focus on

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
new releases with new good is it means

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.510 
new releases with new good is it means
that<00:03:41.900> we<00:03:42.080> as<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.470> team<00:03:42.710> can<00:03:42.950> focus<00:03:43.100> on<00:03:43.400> the
