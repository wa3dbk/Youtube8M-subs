00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
of your rubber strip is your cut line as

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.880 
of your rubber strip is your cut line as
is<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.939> other<00:01:24.180> manufacturers<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.710> when

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
is with other manufacturers but when

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
is with other manufacturers but when
you're<00:01:26.100> off<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.490> rail<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.570> tilt<00:01:27.900> your

you're off the rail and you tilt your

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.219 
you're off the rail and you tilt your
saw<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.860> cut<00:01:29.340> line<00:01:29.549> will<00:01:29.820> alter<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.079> well

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
saw that cut line will alter as it well

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.770 
saw that cut line will alter as it well
with<00:01:31.380> anybody<00:01:31.650> else's<00:01:32.159> saw<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.540> look

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
soft on the guide rail so what that will

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.170 
soft on the guide rail so what that will
do<00:03:19.989> that<00:03:20.139> allows<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.680> blade<00:03:20.919> to<00:03:21.000> glide<00:03:22.000> across

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
do that allows the blade to glide across

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.599 
do that allows the blade to glide across

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
so you don't get any splinters you're

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.050 
so you don't get any splinters you're
just<00:03:26.410> scoring<00:03:26.739> it<00:03:26.949> you<00:03:27.069> are<00:03:27.220> just<00:03:27.489> scoring<00:03:27.819> it

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
just scoring it you are just scoring it

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.689 
just scoring it you are just scoring it
