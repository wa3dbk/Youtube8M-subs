00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.420 
but now I'm like just torn they both
come<00:00:54.660> out<00:00:54.750> August<00:00:55.230> second<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.860> that's<00:00:56.100> why

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
come out August second and that's why

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.920 
come out August second and that's why
this<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.820> path<00:00:58.070> Rhino<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.789> Kamikaze<00:01:00.750> is

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
this is the path Rhino the Kamikaze is

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.349 
this is the path Rhino the Kamikaze is
going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> hundred<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.609> sixty<00:01:02.969> dollars

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
going to be a hundred and sixty dollars

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.289 
going to be a hundred and sixty dollars
which<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.470> pretty<00:01:05.400> steep<00:01:05.700> price<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
which is a pretty steep price for a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.570 
which is a pretty steep price for a
kamikaze<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> guess<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.340> look<00:01:08.490> at

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
kamikaze but I guess when you look at

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.690 
kamikaze but I guess when you look at
the<00:01:08.670> materials<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.590> back<00:01:11.340> story

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the materials and then the back story

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.760 
the materials and then the back story
behind<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.119> guess<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:13.080> all<00:01:13.290> right<00:01:13.500> i'm

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
behind it I guess it's all right i'm

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.950 
behind it I guess it's all right i'm
willing<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> pay<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.939> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.600> little

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
willing to pay it it's kind of a little

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.320 
willing to pay it it's kind of a little
bit<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:17.000> compared<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> other

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
bit up there compared to the other

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.179 
bit up there compared to the other
kamikazes<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.530> were<00:01:19.680> only<00:01:19.830> like<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.009> hundred

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
kamikazes which were only like a hundred

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.899 
kamikazes which were only like a hundred
bucks<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.840> duffel<00:01:24.840> mingoes<00:01:25.200> are

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
bucks and then the duffel mingoes are

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.580 
bucks and then the duffel mingoes are
there's<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.330> price<00:01:27.810> set<00:01:28.080> firm<00:01:28.350> yet

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
there's not really a price set firm yet

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.679 
there's not really a price set firm yet
but<00:01:29.189> judging<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.850> other<00:01:29.970> ones<00:01:30.119> i<00:01:30.240> think<00:01:30.270> like

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
but judging the other ones i think like

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.399 
but judging the other ones i think like
150<00:01:31.590> range<00:01:32.100> correct<00:01:32.790> me<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:32.970> i'm<00:01:33.119> wrong<00:01:33.409> i

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
150 range correct me if i'm wrong i

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.770 
150 range correct me if i'm wrong i
think<00:01:35.100> that's<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.490> other<00:01:35.610> gel<00:01:36.030> lights<00:01:36.210> go<00:01:36.450> for

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
think that's the other gel lights go for

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.609 
think that's the other gel lights go for
and<00:01:37.729> i<00:01:38.729> mean<00:01:39.299> i<00:01:39.600> think<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.079> looks<00:01:40.229> pretty<00:01:40.320> good

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and i mean i think it looks pretty good

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.410 
and i mean i think it looks pretty good
it's<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.860> nice<00:01:40.979> summer<00:01:41.280> call<00:01:41.579> away<00:01:41.729> i<00:01:41.880> mean<00:01:42.150> they

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
it's a nice summer call away i mean they

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.060 
it's a nice summer call away i mean they
both<00:01:42.600> are<00:01:42.810> definitely<00:01:43.259> summer<00:01:43.530> color<00:01:43.829> ways

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
both are definitely summer color ways

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.870 
both are definitely summer color ways
but<00:01:45.000> i<00:01:45.860> don't<00:01:46.860> know<00:01:46.890> i<00:01:46.950> feel<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> asics

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
but i don't know i feel like the asics

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.780 
but i don't know i feel like the asics
is<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.270> little<00:01:48.689> different<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.799> yet<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.280> Reebok

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
is a little different but yet the Reebok

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.359 
is a little different but yet the Reebok
is<00:01:51.149> kind<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.079> more<00:01:52.860> flashy<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:55.070> I<00:01:56.070> don't
