isn't the future actually so and we're
going<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.790> futures<00:01:02.180> to<00:01:02.329> get<00:01:02.540> it<00:01:02.660> in<00:01:02.780> from

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989

that<00:01:06.139> creates<00:01:06.439> a<00:01:06.530> dilemma<00:01:06.679> because<00:01:06.950> how<00:01:07.159> do

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:07.219 
that creates a dilemma because how do

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.069

that's<00:01:11.630> a<00:01:11.840> good<00:01:12.020> question<00:01:12.079> and<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.429> it<00:01:13.579> makes

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
that's a good question and and it makes

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.840 
that's a good question and and it makes
