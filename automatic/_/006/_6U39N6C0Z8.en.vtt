00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
tour of the magic to me and pretty much

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.580 
tour of the magic to me and pretty much
does<00:05:44.790> this<00:05:47.060> so<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.210> magic<00:05:48.390> tornado<00:05:48.990> is<00:05:49.380> the

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
does this so the magic tornado is the

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.810 
does this so the magic tornado is the
bomb<00:05:51.320> the<00:05:52.320> no<00:05:52.470> offense<00:05:52.740> to<00:05:52.890> my<00:05:53.010> viewers<00:05:53.310> but

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
bomb the no offense to my viewers but

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.770 
bomb the no offense to my viewers but
you're<00:05:54.090> not<00:05:54.950> not<00:05:55.950> compared<00:05:56.370> to<00:05:56.460> magic<00:05:56.790> tornado

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:06.380 

let's<00:06:01.970> see<00:06:04.340> not<00:06:05.340> always<00:06:05.610> the<00:06:05.790> bomb<00:06:05.940> at<00:06:06.180> using

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
let's see not always the bomb at using

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:13.010 
let's see not always the bomb at using
the<00:06:06.660> magic<00:06:06.990> tornado<00:06:09.320> but<00:06:10.320> sometimes<00:06:10.800> I<00:06:11.040> am<00:06:12.020> you

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
the magic tornado but sometimes I am you

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.010 
the magic tornado but sometimes I am you
can<00:06:13.170> pretty<00:06:13.350> much<00:06:13.440> go<00:06:13.770> on<00:06:13.920> infinitely<00:06:14.840> long<00:06:15.840> as

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
can pretty much go on infinitely long as

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.490 
can pretty much go on infinitely long as
you<00:06:16.140> time<00:06:16.410> things<00:06:16.740> correctly<00:06:17.990> with<00:06:18.990> the<00:06:19.200> magic

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
you time things correctly with the magic

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:27.800 
you time things correctly with the magic
tornado<00:06:23.870> and<00:06:24.870> that's<00:06:24.990> how<00:06:25.110> that<00:06:25.260> works<00:06:26.600> okay<00:06:27.600> i

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
tornado and that's how that works okay i

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.780 
tornado and that's how that works okay i
know<00:06:28.170> the<00:06:28.290> commentary<00:06:28.890> was<00:06:29.010> pretty<00:06:29.280> sparse<00:06:29.640> in
