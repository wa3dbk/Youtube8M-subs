00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.889 
these but yeah so that's another method
and<00:01:47.990> another<00:01:48.990> strategy<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.770> I've<00:01:50.220> been<00:01:50.430> told

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
and another strategy that I've been told

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:58.969 
and another strategy that I've been told
was<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:55.250> for<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.399> when<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.850> go<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.950> when<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
was that for you when you go to when you

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.800 
was that for you when you go to when you
are<00:01:59.189> playing<00:01:59.460> inside<00:01:59.700> of<00:02:00.000> my<00:02:00.119> biggest<00:02:00.299> let's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
are playing inside of my biggest let's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.490 
are playing inside of my biggest let's
go<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.469> window<00:02:02.630> it's<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.840> time<00:02:04.079> when

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
go back to that window it's a time when

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.429 
go back to that window it's a time when
you<00:02:04.829> build<00:02:05.100> your<00:02:05.189> buildings<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.939> find<00:02:06.210> that

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
you build your buildings but I find that

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.080 
you build your buildings but I find that
just<00:02:07.439> takes<00:02:07.590> too<00:02:07.680> much<00:02:07.770> effort<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.369> good<00:02:08.970> luck

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
just takes too much effort so good luck

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.959 
just takes too much effort so good luck
in<00:02:09.209> your<00:02:09.239> game<00:02:09.750> guys
