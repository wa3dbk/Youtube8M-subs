00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
which I believe we actually change the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.089 
which I believe we actually change the
formation<00:00:12.990> yet<00:00:13.200> again<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.830> like<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
formation yet again this is like the

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.620 
formation yet again this is like the
fourth<00:00:14.340> time<00:00:14.460> we've<00:00:14.790> changed<00:00:15.120> things<00:00:15.450> around

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
fourth time we've changed things around

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.320 
fourth time we've changed things around
