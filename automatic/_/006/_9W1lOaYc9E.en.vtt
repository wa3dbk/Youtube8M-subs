00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.099
 the heroes from Canada comes for the Nintendo DS is back 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.609
 two years have passed since then in her life fought big 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.609
 Adventure on the finance side 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.579
 she is now 16 years old 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.739
 again from her dad with whom she has not seen for over six months 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.100
 receive a letter 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.250
 although she has other plans 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.250
 she lets her aunt persuade her to visit her father 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.320
 but apparently he has important things with subscription rights 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.750
 It was only two years ago 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.430
 confess that 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.330
 why her mother was killed had a fix 3par and why her dad ever since 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.930
 was lost 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.160
 solved the mystery of the project nibble rail 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.929
 Oyster and a reason however 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:58.940
 like her father 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.400
 that decided to come visit this weekend 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.220
 after some persuasions 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.659
 she sits down in the bus 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.659
 and is on the way to study a crime 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.930
 but hardly arrived there 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.930
 the problems are already going on 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.880
 unknowingly he gets out 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.789
 is per woman 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.720
 when she is suddenly jostled from behind 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.330
 she loses her bag 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.640
 and they may be sued 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.640
 You have to have so much bad luck first 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.799
 the mysterious persons 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.370
 you stole the bag 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.530
 at the tables 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.310
 more complex derives 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.710
 without bag without cash 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.380
 without recourse 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 And of course her father is not 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.850
 but luckily 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.850
 The campground is not far away from the bus stop 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.599
 There she meets the helpful young Toni 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.109
 which clarified here immediately 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.109
 how her father camps and how to move 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.399
 So the step is on the way to confront the father 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.269
 Of course, the weekend did not look like it did 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.789
 that has presented 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.449
 give the 16-year-old 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:43.579
 but before she got another card LEG did not tell you 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:44.719
 how it goes 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.849
 The environment has grown significantly compared to 7 so far 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.019
 but still can not find a father that something strange 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.969
 she remembers being there before 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.969
 Well 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.399
 8th 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:17.169
 as they are 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.269
 Father finds it shortly afterwards 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.049
 and after naturally being kindly worried that it's not on good 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:23.569
 luck 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.619
 he returns here why she has invited 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.829
 she was actually writing with her mother 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.389
 as a quarrel 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.569
 they open up the task is now to call their hidden memory 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.489
 We searched today in a targeted and good way 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.429
 and 9 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:44.259
 and runs 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:47.089
 most from left to right 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:49.029
 mostly at one 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.709
 my friend support 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.709
 and on right to left 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.659
 but of course it's not all what the player is running these tactics novels 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.539
 has to do 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:02.859
 because what would be one 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.839
 benefit up 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.180
 the conversations patterns adorned these 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.299
 adventure 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.399
 with same age 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.399
 parents 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.499
 or with even older ones 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.180
 or with people who are not really any 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.610
 but next to that, of course, the player has to do something as well 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.610
 the spokesman speaks 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.170
 so paid laziness 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.180
 Once upon a time, a friend of splendid liners served 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:53.150
 but that does not work right away 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.150
 the clock is ticking 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:58.340
 what as a supporter 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.340
 and that the Board has developed the from 1 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.229
 one may one the system May 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:07.070
 with this little part 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.350
 the no less next new handheld DS Lite modeled after 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.279
 has been 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.610
 she can do so many things 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.939
 Received message from her father 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:20.589
 Take pictures and finally watch 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:24.479
 read which characters have been found in the game so far and in which ones 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.479
 Colors are around each other 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.699
 read the exciting story again if you ask him 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.699
 lost 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.689
 and of course you can also save with the small console 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:44.520
 There is another option 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.460
 but not clear 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.830
 At the end of each chapter comes the usual Aurich capitulating what you do 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.330
 already outside but knows code for the text 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.360
 There are three questions here as well as the events of the last one 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.360
 Chapter you have to answer correctly then 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.150
 however, not only is my work not mine 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.759
 a new attempt also in traffic 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.389
 The bottom line is Norbert Roth that is clearly an interactive to make 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.099
 essentially nothing done 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:18.760
 The following games are all great animated characters 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.259
 especially the movements of the characters convinced 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.259
 Music is great but unfortunately I miss a little talk 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.960
 on the circumference, the developers screwed most clearly Block a 15 

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:33.019
 One will need hours and crack all the secrets 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:36.770
 There is almost no reason to complain 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.710
 and I can only say that 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.870
 Werner Barcode PDAs had made it on the Wii 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.129
 and just have to strike 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:49.800
 a barcode gets 85 percent family 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.749
 and has really earned every point 

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:55.740
 more information is available in the written text
