somebody<00:00:23.029> slow<00:00:23.449> me<00:00:23.599> down<00:00:23.630> I<00:00:24.050> didn't<00:00:24.710> make<00:00:24.769> a

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:24.829 
somebody slow me down I didn't make a

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.319 
somebody slow me down I didn't make a
resolution<00:00:25.279> to<00:00:25.460> make<00:00:25.519> more<00:00:25.730> videos<00:00:25.999> this<00:00:26.150> year

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329 
resolution to make more videos this year

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.460 
resolution to make more videos this year
and<00:00:26.509> that's<00:00:26.929> probably<00:00:27.079> for<00:00:27.259> the<00:00:27.320> best

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
and that's probably for the best

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.839 
and that's probably for the best
actually<00:00:27.710> because<00:00:28.070> I<00:00:28.159> wouldn't<00:00:28.400> stick<00:00:28.640> to<00:00:28.759> it

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
actually because I wouldn't stick to it

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.790 
actually because I wouldn't stick to it
because<00:00:29.089> I'm<00:00:29.239> hopeless<00:00:30.019> like<00:00:30.169> that<00:00:30.380> but<00:00:30.589> I

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
because I'm hopeless like that but I

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.170 
because I'm hopeless like that but I
think<00:00:31.099> my<00:00:31.339> biggest<00:00:31.519> problem<00:00:31.640> was<00:00:31.999> that<00:00:32.029> I

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
think my biggest problem was that I

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.020 
think my biggest problem was that I
lacked<00:00:32.599> sufficient<00:00:33.260> gameplay<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:33.980> or<00:00:34.670> the

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
lacked sufficient gameplay to or the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.139 
lacked sufficient gameplay to or the
desired<00:00:35.420> gameplay<00:00:35.960> that<00:00:36.199> I<00:00:37.070> wanted<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:37.940> make<00:00:38.120> a

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
desired gameplay that I wanted to make a

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.549 
desired gameplay that I wanted to make a
video<00:00:38.359> which<00:00:38.570> would<00:00:38.719> be<00:00:38.840> either<00:00:39.050> a<00:00:39.170> Moab

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
video which would be either a Moab

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.759 
video which would be either a Moab
gameplay<00:00:39.980> or<00:00:40.489> a<00:00:41.379> combination<00:00:42.379> of<00:00:42.410> streaks

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
gameplay or a combination of streaks

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.740 
gameplay or a combination of streaks
with<00:00:42.920> a<00:00:42.949> strange<00:00:43.280> gun<00:00:43.550> which<00:00:43.760> is<00:00:43.789> my<00:00:44.420> favorite

get<00:02:17.749> the<00:02:17.870> idea<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.799> was<00:02:18.920> ranking<00:02:19.249> up<00:02:19.370> all

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
get the idea so I was ranking up all

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.069 
get the idea so I was ranking up all
these<00:02:19.639> guns<00:02:19.879> getting<00:02:20.150> all<00:02:20.299> the<00:02:20.389> unlocks<00:02:20.780> and

these guns getting all the unlocks and
getting<00:02:21.620> some<00:02:21.739> cool<00:02:21.889> footage<00:02:22.099> and<00:02:22.370> then

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
getting some cool footage and then

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.640 
getting some cool footage and then
eventually<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:23.659> be<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.019> time<00:02:24.200> again<00:02:24.439> I<00:02:24.469> hit

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
eventually it be that time again I hit

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.250 
eventually it be that time again I hit
the<00:02:24.739> limit<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.129> like<00:02:25.219> the<00:02:25.310> prestige<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:25.909> I

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.069 
I try and stay first prestige level 80 I
won't<00:02:32.480> be<00:02:32.599> able<00:02:32.689> to<00:02:32.780> do<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:32.989> because

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
won't be able to do it because

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.569 
won't be able to do it because
eventually<00:02:33.290> I'll<00:02:33.650> just<00:02:33.769> be<00:02:33.889> tempted<00:02:34.310> I'm<00:02:34.430> like

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
eventually I'll just be tempted I'm like

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.670 
eventually I'll just be tempted I'm like
I'll<00:02:35.450> go<00:02:35.780> on<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.109> I'll<00:02:36.200> do<00:02:36.379> it

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
I'll go on and I'll do it

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.589 
I'll go on and I'll do it
so<00:02:37.489> I'm<00:02:37.579> just<00:02:37.670> gonna<00:02:37.849> go<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.090> 10th<00:02:38.420> because

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
so I'm just gonna go to 10th because

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.909 
so I'm just gonna go to 10th because
I've<00:02:38.780> traditionally<00:02:39.200> done<00:02:39.349> it<00:02:39.439> with<00:02:39.560> pretty

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:39.919 
I've traditionally done it with pretty

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.740 
I've traditionally done it with pretty
much<00:02:40.010> all<00:02:40.159> the<00:02:40.280> cards<00:02:40.579> and<00:02:40.669> what<00:02:41.450> can<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.599> say

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
much all the cards and what can I say

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.259 
much all the cards and what can I say
I'm<00:02:42.139> addicted<00:02:42.379> to<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.680> game<00:02:42.829> and<00:02:43.099> I<00:02:43.879> like<00:02:44.150> to

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
I'm addicted to the game and I like to

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.199 
I'm addicted to the game and I like to
max<00:02:44.480> out<00:02:44.659> the<00:02:44.989> levels<00:02:45.319> so<00:02:45.950> when<00:02:46.849> I'm<00:02:46.969> 10th

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
max out the levels so when I'm 10th

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.550 
max out the levels so when I'm 10th
which<00:02:47.419> are<00:02:47.540> nearly<00:02:47.719> and<00:02:47.900> which<00:02:47.989> I've<00:02:48.139> just<00:02:48.439> hit

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
which are nearly and which I've just hit

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.470 
which are nearly and which I've just hit
ninth<00:02:48.829> when<00:02:49.400> I'm<00:02:49.519> tenth<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.030> won't<00:02:50.329> have<00:02:50.419> to

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
ninth when I'm tenth I won't have to

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.369 
ninth when I'm tenth I won't have to
worry<00:02:50.659> about<00:02:50.719> that<00:02:50.959> again<00:02:51.079> we<00:02:51.260> have

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
worry about that again we have

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.039 
worry about that again we have
everything<00:02:51.769> unlocked<00:02:52.099> and<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.340> think<00:02:52.579> I<00:02:53.049> think

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
everything unlocked and I think I think

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.869 
everything unlocked and I think I think
gameplay<00:02:54.379> will<00:02:54.500> come<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.829> me<00:02:54.889> a<00:02:54.919> lot<00:02:55.340> faster

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
gameplay will come to me a lot faster

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.420 
gameplay will come to me a lot faster
and<00:02:56.079> and<00:02:57.079> I<00:02:57.169> think<00:02:57.230> that'll<00:02:57.620> cover<00:02:57.799> my<00:02:58.040> tearing

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
and and I think that'll cover my tearing

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.979 
and and I think that'll cover my tearing
and<00:02:58.549> updates<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:58.969> as<00:02:59.060> for<00:02:59.209> my<00:02:59.329> more<00:02:59.870> I'm

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
and updates and as for my more I'm

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.920 
and updates and as for my more I'm
streaks<00:03:00.290> like<00:03:00.819> this<00:03:01.819> one<00:03:02.000> now<00:03:02.689> that<00:03:02.840> I'm

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
streaks like this one now that I'm

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.679 
streaks like this one now that I'm
starting<00:03:03.169> to<00:03:03.319> find<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.650> rhythm<00:03:03.829> and<00:03:04.069> a<00:03:04.099> groove<00:03:04.340> I

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
starting to find a rhythm and a groove I

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.490 
starting to find a rhythm and a groove I
think<00:03:05.689> I'll<00:03:05.810> be<00:03:05.900> able<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.109> keep<00:03:06.199> up<00:03:06.319> some

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
think I'll be able to keep up some

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.229 
think I'll be able to keep up some
pretty<00:03:06.650> consistent<00:03:07.219> uploads<00:03:07.579> I<00:03:07.760> hope<00:03:07.939> I'm<00:03:08.090> not

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
pretty consistent uploads I hope I'm not

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.289 
pretty consistent uploads I hope I'm not
jumping<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.719> gun<00:03:08.750> when<00:03:09.079> I<00:03:09.109> say<00:03:09.379> that<00:03:09.590> but<00:03:09.799> I

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
jumping the gun when I say that but I
