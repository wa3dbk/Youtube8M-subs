00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.560
 hello to all and all these notes offer a navigation ap 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.609
 for his day of fasting was presenting 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:07.800
 a little game 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.979
 the power 4 a former teacher 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:14.900
 in response from the expert I just want to say that yes I know that 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.349
 the internet survey with people well 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.730
 video queens at least one american with the senses we fell naked 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.660
 but in writing 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.660
 personally I do not like it too long 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.369
 Nowadays 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.570
 the co-prosecutors of misappropriation in judicious advice of their father 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.580
 however, he nuanced his autonomy 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.290
 try you will see that it is not so simple 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.620
 and second and second warrant a second picnic outside is in 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.610
 longest concert of any race all French must understand 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.310
 without 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.630
 the 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.570
 without having to produce external according to people 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.570
 I prefer to watch videos tutorials in France 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.240
 so how is played more at the head of the prefect of Corsica four takers 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.370
 after week in the east we saw the last 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.920
 and next to the great sound mate finally the pillar 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.920
 cya the few people who are purely fortuitous 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.380
 that's normal enough for the video 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.050
 these texts acts we did not all here so I had to be removed all 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.950
 which is sure we can perhaps 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.480
 so I worked hard so that we could know 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.030
 % the common to convince 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.330
 so many small quick games the player can play here 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.900
 ap 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.800
 m disables the day outside 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.630
 we have a few days of rest 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.610
 ap he had there no 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.939
 harp for him a little last 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.240
 the same day a day so no longer playing 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.610
 the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.110
 I can see that for a hundred simpsons what editions 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.030
 here 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.900
 so we will start 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.900
 to look behind the scenes that it's a little bit what's the funniest 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.590
 skiing skiing is more complex since the best personally I find 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.390
 so in vain 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.989
 simple tracks if I hold the poker room 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.519
 we have the criticism clicks the 28 year old man the stylists ans 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.400
 other statistics 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.969
 with sand gravel 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.609
 so in the first round 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.549
 how it works 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.019
 1 actually when the player Thursday who can we who activates the not 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:30.969
 the lever 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.339
 active 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.200
 they retaliate to access everywhere that can surprise 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.950
 who goes up he did not shoot it's somewhere it's typically fillon 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.350
 what sand bar 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.369
 over a year the pistons here 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:48.539
 to put it on top 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.679
 you see a 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.679
 dec not sure about these bar issues 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.549
 from there to move on a button 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.639
 and the jackal 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:01.939
 sheep 7 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.559
 - europa league 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.559
 each aerolia button on the track 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.279
 it was the end of the world of bill earlier and the fact that you will fall 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:15.779
 maybe he had played 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.799
 and after adeline disables so in fact when this pistons style 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.789
 the sand comes back 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:26.609
 Rome - so the relay to its original position site and the parties the guests 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.989
 to do this and so that replaces the block and many others 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.999
 and like that for me it's one of the titles like that is not everything 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.379
 since it allows to play 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.639
 next turn 24 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.209
 c he ancient with him the gravel one can once again 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:45.059
 and it is for the moment a plethora thorax tons connected by a caterer 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:46.299
 who is there 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.839
 which would allow him to lend himself to the game of peoples in their hall the goals 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.770
 Listen, however, the part is no longer busy writing 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.709
 more globally by aof 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.719
 the turn and business illustrations 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.749
 how 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:04.509
 that's it 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.699
 every circuit of retz tons maybe 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.699
 we have to go on without it 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.009
 on this one 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.389
 they will surely be decisive 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.419
 golden on its track but the thing is that it must not be that it is that 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.419
 these funds have me pcc hailed the local president after this bitter 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.080
 so in fact all I have 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.250
 armand we should not do much more but without this magnitude 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.099
 1 so we can take control of the sound 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.610
 but here's r I did not see I did not take a turn the kangaroo 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.050
 see how it should be five sleeves 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.050
 why I do not know I prefer 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:49.909
 on the other hand, if we do not know the content 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.360
 here is the circuit 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.110
 since a long time 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.830
 you have seen others that I do not understand too much but good after the crisis seems to be 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.330
 reduce we could see his escape 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.879
 two teams that will come down 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.169
 they are wrong 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.909
 - it's true what we like just like 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.449
 you can not understand anything 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.559
 how much is one python out of two 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:21.710
 and after the signal m flyers to bring it to 0 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.270
 the button 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.270
 parra when you fall contrite in a whirlwind 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.599
 deby itno if I had a little memory 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.730
 so in fact in the name of my support it will give in the final 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:46.629
 the course is 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:49.279
 the current tour on this block 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.389
 who will thus disable this portion who will have 0 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.719
 she's up with trying to show you 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.749
 the hamas islamist world 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:04.369
 and no other excellent 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:07.069
 quick who will send he signed up to 0 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.960
 who will do that piston while suarez ap 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.330
 for the actor it's next to 34 years that he had the opposite effect 

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:19.299
 that's all stupid in this case things seem that I think it 

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:20.999
 can be funny 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:24.989
 coach in the world was it fillon the care to fix the aisles we can do 

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:26.729
 it's fascinating 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.080
 the words it's always nice to evaluate 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.550
 so the fact that the power 4 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.830
 m 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.240
 tracked and provence the week later is to say that you lose if they 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.610
 will play 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.139
 the day 2 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.599
 to play here 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.119
 she embarrassed a lot 

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:52.179
 and especially 6 to play in it's true that nature 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.259
 whether it's a question on the one hand 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.610
 a mother to show pictures why 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:07.409
 the countries 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:10.409
 - I am wrong 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.349
 he agreed to play with 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:17.349
 according to afp 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.070
 illiteracy that we were young woman 

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.070
 easter to do this 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:27.289
 in vain what you have already used block 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:30.909
 so yes it works for 100 euros the man I discovered something 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:35.780
 and then here is my happiness I wanted a next time and who
