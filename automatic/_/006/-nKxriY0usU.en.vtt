00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.100
 tapping board presents 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.920
 consequences of the loss of a tooth 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.930
 the loss of a tooth generates 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.970
 alterations in the mouth that will be 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.220
 the greater the number of 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.190
 lost pieces and the elapsed time 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.379
 until its replacement in the absence of 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.839
 tooth food will damage the gum 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:43.180
 free during the ingestion making the 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.180
 chewing and producing irritations 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.950
 next the adjacent teeth and 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.500
 opposites will try to occupy the space 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.790
 empty and they will be inclining little by little 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.580
 until you find the lost contact 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.470
 that will make the interdental points 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.030
 open up, hindering hygiene and 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.550
 facilitating food retention 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.730
 between the teeth which will increase the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.030
 occurrence of caries and the formation of 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.640
 Salt 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.290
 in addition the packaged food also 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.980
 will favor the appearance of the disease 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.980
 periodontal 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.270
 and over time as the opposite tooth 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.069
 will try to find its opposite this one 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.069
 will be losing anchorage little by little 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.380
 there will be mobility and you can even get lost 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.280
 finally the change of position of the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.619
 teeth for this to be articulated 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.900
 incorrectly appearing contacts 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.570
 undue and overloads that will produce 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.580
 wear and pain tooth loss 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.070
 it also involves digestive alterations 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.070
 since the crushing of food will be 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.390
 incomplete 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.220
 also the articulation of the jaw 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.260
 will have to adapt to the new 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.300
 changes can appear noises during 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.300
 chewing and even pain 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.189
 in order to avoid the problems 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.530
 mentioned will need to be replaced 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.750
 the sooner the missing teeth and 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.790
 restore the bite position to your 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.250
 original point if you have lost 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.050
 some piece of teeth do not let it pass and 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.180
 save on long treatments and 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.989
 necessary complexes if it happens 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.989
 too much time
