00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.060
 hi everyone is saying that at 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.280
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.810
 new glitch video on gt5 online 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.430
 to be able to somehow have 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.020
 modern vehicles or rather everything 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.180
 simply vehicles the glitch is 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.010
 so this glitch is really super simple 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.600
 so for a start you will have to 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.890
 provide the buffalo that you can 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.780
 find in the street or just 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.610
 even of urate the author you go 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.070
 can buy on the internet at $ 6000 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.749
 so we will start there buffalo so 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.940
 you will have to find yourself in a los 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:37.510
 santos custom with this buffalo there and 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.800
 thereafter 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.909
 well, you and not how it is 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.949
 same in the rocker as it's 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.819
 the simpler you will have to buy the 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.859
 rocker that is not original 

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:46.539
 so the new one and once you 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.159
 bought it and well you will stay 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.170
 press the down arrow of your 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.879
 sick or the arrow jo and basically the game 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.469
 will not have time to load the tray 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.100
 is original and the new low of 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.269
 checkout 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.219
 normally so it's going to do them 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.929
 disappear and once the missing 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.519
 you will be strafed down the cross button 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.569
 of your joystick is normally you 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.429
 so go choose the rocker 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:05.140
 of origin is actually there will not be 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.780
 loaded and so you will have chosen 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.340
 a single rocker that does not make it 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.360
 of helmet has nothing will have and have 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.009
 once on the cougar you go 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.570
 able to make the rear bumper and the 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.869
 front bumper so for the bumper 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.159
 back 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.109
 you will find yourself in the 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.579
 category of bumpers and you are 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:20.320
 see again to fall the 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.759
 bumper not from syria but the new 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.350
 and not once do you have to buy 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.060
 well, you're going to go up 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.320
 and down arrows normally at the end 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.119
 of a moment and you will be able to 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.070
 see that the bumper will not have the 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.659
 time to load and after to the results 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.820
 then will refocus to validate and not that 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.229
 you will have no rear bumper and 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.590
 for the bumper before it's exactly 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.600
 the same 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.640
 you have to buy the new bumper 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.170
 not the one from syria once you 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.759
 bought it you will have to make arrow 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.170
 from the top and arrows at the bottom and at the end 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.359
 for a moment as I told you and 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.340
 well the bumper will disappear and you 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.320
 need to press at the right time increases or 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.539
 simply even stop you on the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.619
 serial bumper is normally and 20 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.100
 where you will be able to see that he has 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.689
 faded away 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.310
 and there you'll just have supported me 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.109
 extra to validate and to choose it 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.060
 and normally, well, you 're going to 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.409
 find with your buffalo who will have 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.880
 no bumper so I find that 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.929
 it's really a glitch really not 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.399
 bad at all cases rarely you will have 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.140
 really a unique vehicle 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.020
 now we will do it with the rac 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.300
 the author so 5 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.090
 not bad at all and it will allow you 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.490
 to remove the back tray and so 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.230
 as usual you will have to buy a 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.150
 plateau not the one of series but a 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.650
 again once you've bought one 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.260
 so it will be a little more difficult 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.580
 because you will have to stay ap on the arrow 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.320
 from the bottom of your controller is normally 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.480
 you will be able to see that the plateau 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.040
 will disappear or simply he will not have 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.020
 not helped that you'll see that the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.640
 plateau disappeared eh ben you will have to 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.260
 simply let go of the down arrow of 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.910
 your controller and if you have any 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.860
 luck you will stop at the good 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.720
 moment and normally the right time 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.880
 it is to stop on the plateau of 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.900
 series and have only once done that and 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.850
 well we made the power see 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.980
 that there will be no plateau after you 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.780
 just have to validate it and learn in 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.460
 would like more rear shelf so 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.290
 with their actors I advise you 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.950
 to hit the back of your 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.960
 vehicle 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.700
 another vehicle is basically you go 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.290
 to see that the back of the rac the author 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.150
 so where normally there is the plateau 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.630
 well, it'll go through the others 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.070
 vehicles 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.270
 and so that will allow you to 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.040
 albrecht just about every vehicle 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.680
 thanks to oracle height so that's enough 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.240
 funny and with the buffalo once you 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.680
 have to remove all the bumpers and 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.190
 ben advise you to make a style 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.780
 matte black as the fbi car is there 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.830
 well it's exactly the same so I 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.840
 advise you to do the same it can 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.430
 be nice enough so here is this video 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.080
 ends in any case I hope this 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.820
