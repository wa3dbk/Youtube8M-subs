 we already used earlier 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.070
 slightly modify the sleeve we do it 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.540
 in short 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.640
 Naturally the shoulder seam will not 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.590
 because if you make the shoulder seam on 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.640
 the billed fabric he's just 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.010
 spreading by its own weight 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.930
 draw around the contour 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.680

 we make out sikom we sew the side seams 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.270
 so that the edges of the boucle fabric are not 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.820
 stretched and not showered 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.680
 you need to flash them immediately with a strip 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:57.640
 chiffon now skirt chiffon around the edge 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:02:01.259
