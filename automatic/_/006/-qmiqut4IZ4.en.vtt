00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
where your seam on this it's just about

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.140 
where your seam on this it's just about
hitting<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.139> scene<00:04:28.560> that<00:04:29.160> you<00:04:29.220> originally<00:04:29.550> so

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
hitting the scene that you originally so

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.050 
hitting the scene that you originally so
done<00:04:30.440> as<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.620> can<00:04:31.800> tell<00:04:32.010> you<00:04:32.040> can<00:04:32.370> usually<00:04:32.550> lay

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
done as you can tell you can usually lay

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.909 
done as you can tell you can usually lay
your<00:04:33.419> piping<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.500> your<00:04:35.180> binding<00:04:36.180> together

your piping and your binding together

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.159 
your piping and your binding together
and<00:04:37.919> see<00:04:38.190> which<00:04:38.460> way<00:04:38.699> that<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.210> folds<00:04:39.630> best<00:04:39.900> and

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
and see which way that it folds best and

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.659 
and see which way that it folds best and
I<00:04:40.229> think<00:04:40.260> this<00:04:40.650> will<00:04:40.800> probably<00:04:41.040> be<00:04:41.190> my<00:04:41.400> best

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
I think this will probably be my best

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.920 
I think this will probably be my best
ball<00:04:42.740> right<00:04:43.740> here<00:04:43.919> once<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:45.030> do<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:45.540> once<00:04:45.780> I

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
ball right here once I do that once I

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.969 
ball right here once I do that once I
determine<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.860> try<00:04:47.669> it<00:04:47.729> this<00:04:47.970> way<00:04:48.030> to<00:04:48.770> see<00:04:49.770> if<00:04:49.830> it

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
determine I try it this way to see if it

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.520 
determine I try it this way to see if it
looks<00:04:50.100> any<00:04:50.400> better<00:04:50.669> I<00:04:50.940> think<00:04:51.930> that<00:04:52.289> looks<00:04:52.440> a

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
looks any better I think that looks a

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.860 
looks any better I think that looks a
little<00:04:52.590> bit<00:04:52.830> better<00:04:53.060> once<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.210> determine<00:04:54.389> how

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
little bit better once I determine how

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.870 
little bit better once I determine how
I'm<00:04:54.960> going<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.169> fold<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.620> then<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.919> open<00:04:56.460> this<00:04:56.610> up

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
I'm going to fold it then I open this up

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.930 
I'm going to fold it then I open this up
and<00:04:57.150> I<00:04:57.300> cut<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:59.280> cording<00:05:00.590> right<00:05:01.590> where<00:05:01.830> that

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
and I cut the cording right where that

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.980 
and I cut the cording right where that
fold<00:05:02.940> is<00:05:04.039> that<00:05:05.039> way<00:05:05.160> this<00:05:05.310> will<00:05:05.720> lay<00:05:06.720> it<00:05:06.960> a

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
fold is that way this will lay it a

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:15.510 
fold is that way this will lay it a
little<00:05:07.199> bit<00:05:07.440> easier<00:05:07.830> for<00:05:07.979> me

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.460 

so<00:05:16.520> now<00:05:16.729> I'm<00:05:16.910> just<00:05:17.210> going<00:05:17.539> to<00:05:17.630> go<00:05:17.840> back<00:05:18.050> to<00:05:18.080> the

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
so now I'm just going to go back to the

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.850 
so now I'm just going to go back to the
nylon<00:05:18.919> thread<00:05:20.350> and<00:05:21.350> my<00:05:21.650> fighting<00:05:22.160> said<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:24.710> as

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
nylon thread and my fighting said and as

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.100 
nylon thread and my fighting said and as
I<00:05:25.039> said<00:05:25.100> earlier<00:05:25.639> his<00:05:26.150> handedness<00:05:26.780> with<00:05:26.990> the

I said earlier his handedness with the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:49.240 
I said earlier his handedness with the
zippered<00:05:27.470> side<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.860> just<00:05:27.889> takes<00:05:28.310> a<00:05:28.490> lot

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.110 

that's<00:05:50.250> how<00:05:50.460> you<00:05:50.520> have<00:05:50.790> a<00:05:50.820> nice<00:05:51.120> pipe<00:05:51.720> edge
