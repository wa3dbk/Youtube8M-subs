the store so I mean I know it's just a
few<00:00:30.480> cents<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.349> really<00:00:32.250> prefer<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.329> my

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:31.970 

alright<00:03:26.849> it<00:03:27.849> looks<00:03:27.879> like<00:03:28.269> it's<00:03:28.450> going<00:03:30.389> it's<00:03:31.389> on

okay<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.010> think<00:03:33.219> it's<00:03:33.489> working

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
okay I think it's working

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.789 
okay I think it's working
oh<00:03:35.790> let<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:36.969> work<00:03:37.329> I<00:03:37.599> I<00:03:38.109> mean<00:03:38.379> it<00:03:38.530> might<00:03:38.650> be

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
oh let this work I I mean it might be

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.979 
oh let this work I I mean it might be
just<00:03:39.069> so<00:03:39.310> intuitive<00:03:39.909> that<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.389> is<00:03:40.569> so<00:03:40.720> simple

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
just so intuitive that this is so simple

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.289 
just so intuitive that this is so simple
that<00:03:41.169> I'm<00:03:41.560> overthinking<00:03:42.129> I<00:03:42.579> mean<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.909> says<00:03:43.090> on

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
that I'm overthinking I mean it says on

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.520 
that I'm overthinking I mean it says on
I<00:03:43.750> don't<00:03:44.379> see<00:03:44.889> the<00:03:45.819> timer<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.689> would<00:03:47.260> like<00:03:47.409> to

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
I don't see the timer I would like to

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.159 
I don't see the timer I would like to
see<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.709> timer<00:03:47.980> go<00:03:48.159> down<00:03:48.389> but<00:03:49.389> I<00:03:49.689> guess<00:03:49.840> I'll<00:03:49.989> put

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
see a timer go down but I guess I'll put

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.289 
see a timer go down but I guess I'll put
my<00:03:50.319> timeline<00:03:50.769> because<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.489> really<00:03:51.819> just<00:03:51.849> wanted

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
my timeline because I really just wanted

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.659 
my timeline because I really just wanted
something<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.599> can't<00:03:52.810> sit<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.530> leave<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.609> can

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
something I can't sit and leave so I can

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.849 
something I can't sit and leave so I can
get<00:03:54.909> some<00:03:55.090> stuff<00:03:55.180> done<00:03:55.329> so<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.200> guess<00:03:56.590> I'll<00:03:56.769> meet

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
get some stuff done so I guess I'll meet

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:58.440 
get some stuff done so I guess I'll meet
you<00:03:56.950> back<00:03:57.069> here<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.370> about<00:03:57.579> 40<00:03:57.969> minutes<00:03:58.000> I

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
you back here in about 40 minutes I

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.659 
you back here in about 40 minutes I
guess<00:03:58.810> I<00:03:58.930> had<00:03:59.139> to<00:03:59.319> gain<00:03:59.620> some<00:03:59.980> pressure<00:04:00.280> in

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
guess I had to gain some pressure in

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.099 
guess I had to gain some pressure in
order<00:04:00.939> to<00:04:01.090> start<00:04:01.359> to<00:04:01.480> do<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.689> countdown

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
order to start to do the countdown

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.250 
order to start to do the countdown
so<00:04:02.349> we're<00:04:02.500> we've<00:04:03.189> got<00:04:03.480> 13<00:04:04.480> minutes<00:04:04.659> to<00:04:04.870> go<00:04:04.900> and

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
so we're we've got 13 minutes to go and

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.709 
so we're we've got 13 minutes to go and
it<00:04:05.859> does<00:04:06.069> smelly<00:04:06.310> beans<00:04:06.609> in<00:04:06.819> here<00:04:06.969> the<00:04:07.299> beans

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:07.719 
it does smelly beans in here the beans

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.649 
it does smelly beans in here the beans
are<00:04:07.900> done<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:09.310> has<00:04:09.519> this<00:04:09.849> I<00:04:10.030> guess<00:04:10.239> it's<00:04:10.450> saying

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
are done it has this I guess it's saying

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.469 
are done it has this I guess it's saying
how<00:04:10.810> many<00:04:10.870> minutes<00:04:11.109> it's<00:04:11.439> been<00:04:11.650> on<00:04:12.060> warming<00:04:13.060> so

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:13.479 
how many minutes it's been on warming so

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.890 
how many minutes it's been on warming so
I'm<00:04:13.569> just<00:04:13.750> gonna<00:04:14.099> turn<00:04:15.099> it<00:04:15.310> up<00:04:15.400> there<00:04:15.900> pull

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
I'm just gonna turn it up there pull

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.930 
I'm just gonna turn it up there pull
that<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.320> can<00:04:17.620> slide<00:04:17.949> the<00:04:18.159> exhaust<00:04:18.430> valve<00:04:18.669> to

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
that I can slide the exhaust valve to

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.969 
that I can slide the exhaust valve to
the<00:04:19.120> release<00:04:19.419> section<00:04:19.959> put<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.289> wet<00:04:20.440> towel<00:04:20.650> over

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
the release section put a wet towel over

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.370 
the release section put a wet towel over
the<00:04:21.070> lid<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.549> cool<00:04:21.940> faster<00:04:22.419> until<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:23.139> float

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
the lid to cool faster until the float

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.550 
the lid to cool faster until the float
valve<00:04:23.650> Falls<00:04:24.220> or<00:04:24.760> normal<00:04:25.270> opening<00:04:25.840> allow<00:04:26.500> the

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
valve Falls or normal opening allow the

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.490 
valve Falls or normal opening allow the
cooker<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:28.090> cool<00:04:28.270> down<00:04:28.449> naturally<00:04:28.659> until<00:04:29.349> the

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
cooker to cool down naturally until the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.040 
cooker to cool down naturally until the
float<00:04:29.740> valve<00:04:30.070> drops<00:04:30.970> down<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:31.360> gather<00:04:31.780> that's

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
float valve drops down I gather that's

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.279 
float valve drops down I gather that's
the<00:04:32.289> float<00:04:32.830> valve<00:04:36.960> okay<00:04:37.960> I'm<00:04:38.050> just<00:04:38.139> gonna

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
the float valve okay I'm just gonna

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:46.140 
the float valve okay I'm just gonna
leave<00:04:38.470> it<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:44.009> let<00:04:45.009> this<00:04:45.190> sit<00:04:45.460> for<00:04:45.490> about<00:04:45.699> 20

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
leave it I let this sit for about 20

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.610 
leave it I let this sit for about 20
