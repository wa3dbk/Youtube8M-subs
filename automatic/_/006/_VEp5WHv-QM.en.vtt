I think it would happen without our

traditional Wars is to fight them now is

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.900 
traditional Wars is to fight them now is
going<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:49.620> kind<00:04:49.950> of<00:04:49.979> go<00:04:50.160> away<00:04:50.460> because

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
going to kind of go away because

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.750
