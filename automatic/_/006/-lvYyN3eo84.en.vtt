00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 at 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.260
 well it's actually his goals 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.629
 that they end up in January for 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.020
 episode 9 of my place where all this 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.150
 talent 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.490
 ibrahimovic today it was going very 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.950
 fast enough short or thin enough because 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.570
 that it was that evening I did not do 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.750
 to drink forget not and find 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.060
 a lot of players and yes it happens 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.970
 days or evenings where we do 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.559
 the resale purchase and where you wanted to do 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.300
 of the sales charge and you can not 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.890
 cost you a lot of players that's 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.210
 what happened to me that day so 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.530
 inevitably balès I will not do 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.090
 a lot of profits but I 'm going to 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.390
 do it anyway 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.880
 but here it happens that's it so it's 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.610
 for that if you are hopeful 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.980
 find less than usual that you 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.110
 do not find much that's usually 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.470
 I find more between each 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.350
 sitting between your 22 and 30 maximum 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.430
 she would like to 18 so that's why 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.820
 than 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.630
 here it takes a little more time 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.060
 times and now it is not much 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.940
 business to do is not worth it 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.220
 to insist we will leave like this and 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.860
 here we do not want to do a lot 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.930
 here for those who wanted to 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.900
 just a sum of money we count blood fifa 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.970
 the corner that I did for my return it 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.470
 was not the one where I play with so 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.900
 for those who would like to match on 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.060
 my main celtics account is written 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.649
 on the side of my chain and I have 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.360
 even played I tell you so that's the 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.970
 same fate as it is a youtube machine 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.190
 so right now I play little xbox 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.290
 I connect to our xbox to make 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.700
 resale buying sessions are mostly 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.130
 of the tan otherwise I do not log on 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.970
 my account I do not want to play anymore 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:54.920
 because of a lot of script 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.660
 I do not want you to have so that you 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.030
 do poles on you but that 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.740
 annoy me snap it you know more too 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.509
 play in a match and therefore make purchases 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.680
 or sales for this series there I 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.440
 will resume when I finish this 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.140
 series and to test particular basis of 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.090
 the anfac here is the bad I say 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.220
 breath so to dan knows who it is 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.709
 he is a silver goalkeeper who plays real 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.230
 from madrid to liga or mediaset he plays 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.769
 not the real de madrid real madrid 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.160
 anyway and that's why it's 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.620
 that's why it's not bad and for the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.940
 liga bbva money nor much used so 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.610
 that's why that's why I found a 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.930
 euro friends credit in 4-3-2-1 so the pasp 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.160
 have inspired when he will sell to 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.620
 1800 he watched 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.420
 look at a hitch and moss and had 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.460
 only one of haim also in all the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.700
 market and he's in 3 5 2 he just 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.810
 to be put on sale and at 3100 credit 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.300
 I hesitated for a long time but I have the prices 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.100
 is delivered without credit and I will try 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.320
 to believe it I put it back to 5000 there I 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.900
 here I am I put a g20 summit when 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.400
 even 4800 so that was so risky 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.590
 what I did but it paid 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.240
 I resold 4800 anyway so it took me 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.250
 does it pretty much way 1500 review 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.510
 benefits so here is to know how to take 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.420
 risks once it pays for it sometimes 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.250
 do not pay sometimes it's by armand he 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.980
 I often happen to do when I 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.450
 you say losses on players a 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.250
 day I bought a 2000 credit player 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.080
 choice I resold 1500 to 1400 so 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.170
 you have to be careful 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.560
 9 we see the war is not going to happen 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.900
 resell but good must this happens 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.970
 but that's the same thing you do not have 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.500
 serious at all from the moment that there are twelve 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.150
 players that you have resold a little 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.000
 more expensive to make up for it all 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.580
 happened not pass it's not 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.620
 dramatic in itself that m 'months 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.940
 I happened to do our episodes 30 me 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.930
 credits profits in episodes there 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.000
 liked to make losses too 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.980
 so that's why he looked at me 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.430
 will try to grab a juan in 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.780
 4-4-1-1 for less than 5000 credit because 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.690
 that he is going to about 7000 credit 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.860
 so I say good we'll put maximum to 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.030
 charge I set prices as I you 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.640
 say for the auction so the gym 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.700
 maximum I say I put wines over 5300 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.959
 pretty much and we'll see what it gives 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.380
 and I think I see her there I'm going 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.640
 have it at 5000 unicredit good let's say 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.070
 it's a very good deal I'm going 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.280
 resell 7200 is to tell you that 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.560
 it is not to be overlooked here they 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.670
 the Cécélès auctions I tell you the 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.150
 auction is where we do the most 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.489
 often profits 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.590
 certainly we have to wait we have to wait 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.479
 so me what me I am like that me 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.370
 I am looking for my players in immediate purchase 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.050
 and grain which is a reduced squad 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.800
 dear that it's cheap and that valued 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.050
 in a short time europe 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.900
 I am having fun priority is pending 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.789
 time goes by I'm looking for two players 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.720
 and after I come back on their research 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.639
 I happen sometimes has missed the 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.430
 auction one because I'm not doing a 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.750
 be careful and he will bet that there is a lot 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.430
 good business that goes under the nose 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.400
 but hey these screens good 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.380
 business there is all the time it's 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.030
 for that she's watching he's looking at 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.060
 parcel szczesny so a very good guard 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.760
 in Italian mls 82 there were 1,3900 I 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.740
 take direct that lets resell 4900 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.100
 I believe they credit more so that's 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.199
 it's not bad at all so here is 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.600
 also for those who only use them 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.650
 have a little trouble reselling their 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.570
 players is it be you put 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.639
 Too expensive or it amazes you 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.740
 bought a bit too expensive or that but 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.820
 to be careful that's why he 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.310
 must be silver solution revulsion 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.650
 because their prices are changing a lot 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.500
 but it is by dint of doing again 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.720
 ddc years as I call them so the 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.310
 sessions and it's a fair and me 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.660
 I call it an evening it's after a 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.860
 last hour or two hours 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.400
 in front of his screen to load players 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.620
 so that's me I call it a session 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.960
 and the more you will do, the more you 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.639
 fit the price have certainly there is a 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.820
 true that there are low prices and a lot to 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.289
 because of the many cards that receives 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.789
 are coming in particular 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.620
 official actimos of sézanne who lives 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.789
 to arrive but it's by dint of doing that 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.150
 you will learn the prices of 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:52.099
 players and you go after you 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.830
 go after sniffing we'll say smell 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:55.580
 the good deals you're going 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.750
 automatically buy this kind because 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.080
 that you know it's a good 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.120
 case 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.280
 here 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.460
 so as you see I got to 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.930
 the idea of ​​the player is not huge and no 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.570
 in an episode but it's already 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.980
 I order to make bah credits yes 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.720
 must be done is to create 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.750
 profits that's main thing that's what 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.990
 is happening the little episode mollahs like 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.330
 I often say it sometimes takes 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.040
 but not all the time but we 're already going 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.960
 completed 3 mas ilûtours masila who is 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.120
 a very very safe value for the load 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.860
 in so you council is in the process of 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.900
 to become little by little the best player 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.890
 I think to go back because the team 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.200
 engaging finds more now too 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.870
 but my wake we find a lot 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:41.840
 here and as you know everything is going 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:46.280
 make everything will sell again and so 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.440
 I'm not doing that 176 between it's not 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.030
 bad at all so for up to our 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.130
 arrival this gas the tan with adie there they 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.460
 by train he lowered during latinos the 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.630
 weak with ronaldo and there he has they go 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.860
 drop again with latino of sézanne 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.830
 so that's why it will be 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.080
 surely team ajo suzanne of the league 1 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.530
 so that's why these prices are going 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.840
 go down here is only a manual 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.560
 da costa that his parents of the game him I have 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.500
 had a hard time selling it 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.210
 but previously as a worker to bring him 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.420
 I had to make a loss to unite 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:20.030
 nothing dramatic here is finally all these 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.530
 winds from the leem the mace Russia to 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.620
 the dakota germany that had been launched 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.810
 this episode ends I got 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.920
 does seventeen thousand credit 800 pretty much 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.170
 profits 

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.740
 it's not bad for 18 players so that's 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:35.270
 little by little a thousand critics by 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.370
 player after 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.940
 approximately it stays 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:43.040
 relatively correct here is so if 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.150
 you a problem do not hesitate to create 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.060
 in the comments or if you have 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.140
 questions or wanted to comment on this 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.450
 video the comment space is done 

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.680
 for that in regards to the series so 

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.360
 for those who are not yet subscribers 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.650
 who were discovering these are only 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.830
 now this series I advise you 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:01.100
 to subscribe to my channel story of 

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:03.380
 follow them following this series and of 

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.580
 talk about this series around you if 

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.380
 you are people who finally buddies 

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.610
 who play tahiti but team 13 and who 

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.260
 you to get some credits from 

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.510
 benefits here so I hope you 

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.660
 will be more expensive and at the 

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.660
 next
