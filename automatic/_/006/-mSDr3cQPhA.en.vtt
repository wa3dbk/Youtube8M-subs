and<00:02:18.660> their<00:02:19.660> tag<00:02:19.930> says<00:02:20.260> they're<00:02:21.160> takes<00:02:21.400> his

gene<00:02:22.060> works<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.780> co<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.590> have<00:02:23.800> no<00:02:23.920> idea<00:02:24.040> what

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
gene works and co so I have no idea what

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.460 
gene works and co so I have no idea what
that<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.460> but<00:02:24.780> essentially<00:02:25.780> they're<00:02:25.930> just<00:02:26.260> a

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
that is but essentially they're just a

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.720 
that is but essentially they're just a
light<00:02:27.100> wash<00:02:27.460> jean<00:02:28.390> um<00:02:28.780> they<00:02:29.710> are<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> bit<00:02:30.460> more

light wash jean um they are a bit more

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.030

how<00:03:30.489> these<00:03:30.670> look<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.720> best<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:35.070> then<00:03:36.070> I'm

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
how these look the best and then I'm

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.620 
how these look the best and then I'm
going<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.489> be<00:03:36.640> wearing<00:03:36.910> my<00:03:37.269> jacket<00:03:37.750> from<00:03:38.440> zara

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.840

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
which looks like this and then I'm just

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:54.240 
which looks like this and then I'm just
thinking<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.690> wearing<00:03:47.019> with<00:03:47.440> that<00:03:47.830> um<00:03:53.250> I'm

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
thinking of wearing with that um I'm

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.660 
thinking of wearing with that um I'm
thinking<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.790> wearing<00:03:54.970> my<00:03:55.180> fur<00:03:56.580> stole<00:03:57.580> with<00:03:57.880> it

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
thinking of wearing my fur stole with it

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.800 
thinking of wearing my fur stole with it
but<00:04:00.670> I'm<00:04:00.760> not<00:04:00.910> sure<00:04:00.940> it's<00:04:01.269> not<00:04:01.330> particularly

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
but I'm not sure it's not particularly

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.449 
but I'm not sure it's not particularly
warm<00:04:02.410> and<00:04:02.680> it's<00:04:02.799> hard<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:03.220> keep<00:04:03.730> on<00:04:03.970> so<00:04:05.459> yeah

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
warm and it's hard to keep on so yeah

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.660 
warm and it's hard to keep on so yeah
but<00:04:07.110> whatever

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
but whatever

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.399 
but whatever

see<00:04:20.479> a<00:04:20.509> tutorial<00:04:20.720> on<00:04:21.259> this<00:04:21.320> I<00:04:21.739> could<00:04:21.949> really

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
see a tutorial on this I could really

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.469 
see a tutorial on this I could really
easily<00:04:22.639> do<00:04:22.910> this<00:04:22.940> um<00:04:24.520> but<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.550> guess<00:04:25.850> it's<00:04:26.240> not

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
easily do this um but I guess it's not

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.900 
easily do this um but I guess it's not
that<00:04:26.539> hard<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:26.930> figure<00:04:27.050> out<00:04:27.199> on<00:04:27.410> your<00:04:27.440> own<00:04:27.910> but

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
that hard to figure out on your own but

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.640 
that hard to figure out on your own but
