this<00:00:02.310> is<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.550> new<00:00:02.700> design<00:00:02.909> of<00:00:03.149> chromatic

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
this is a new design of chromatic

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.230 
this is a new design of chromatic
harmonica<00:00:04.110> that<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.740> did<00:00:04.920> I<00:00:05.069> just<00:00:05.670> have<00:00:05.970> made

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
harmonica that I did I just have made

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.280 
harmonica that I did I just have made
and<00:00:07.610> another<00:00:08.610> instruments<00:00:09.389> made<00:00:09.630> with<00:00:10.019> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
and another instruments made with the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.520 
and another instruments made with the
modern<00:00:10.620> plastic<00:00:11.010> which<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.179> strong<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.870> we

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
modern plastic which is so strong and we

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.040 
modern plastic which is so strong and we
use<00:00:13.710> materials<00:00:14.509> such<00:00:15.509> as<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.279> this<00:00:17.279> is

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
use materials such as this and this is

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.240 
use materials such as this and this is
usually<00:00:19.050> used<00:00:19.710> for<00:00:19.949> bulletproof<00:00:20.939> glasses<00:00:21.510> and

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
usually used for bulletproof glasses and

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.269 
usually used for bulletproof glasses and
we<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.519> hit<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.210> very<00:00:24.359> hard<00:00:24.600> it'll<00:00:25.080> make<00:00:25.740> any

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
we can hit it very hard it'll make any

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.939 
we can hit it very hard it'll make any
damage<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.330> but<00:00:27.660> most<00:00:27.900> important<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.710> that

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
damage and but most important is that

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.580 
damage and but most important is that
the<00:00:29.730> instrument<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.269> made<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:31.140> precision

sound<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.899> upper<00:00:58.350> plate<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.280> lower<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.730> played

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
sound to upper plate or lower we played

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.319 
sound to upper plate or lower we played
directly<00:01:00.660> without<00:01:00.780> any<00:01:00.989> turbulence<00:01:02.180> well<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
directly without any turbulence well the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.690 
directly without any turbulence well the
amazing<00:01:03.719> part<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.949> design<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.549> this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
amazing part of the design of this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.370 
amazing part of the design of this
instrument<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.470> powerful<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
instrument is that is so powerful and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.219 
instrument is that is so powerful and
for<00:01:10.380> my<00:01:10.500> experiment<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.540> played<00:01:12.540> with<00:01:12.810> church

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
for my experiment I played with church

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.270 
for my experiment I played with church
pipe<00:01:13.590> organ<00:01:13.979> with<00:01:14.909> Orchestra<00:01:15.979> with<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
pipe organ with Orchestra with in the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.760 
pipe organ with Orchestra with in the
concert<00:01:17.670> hall<00:01:17.700> without<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.360> microphone<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
concert hall without a microphone and it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.830 
concert hall without a microphone and it
penetrates<00:01:20.430> through<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:21.390> good<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
penetrates through really good and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.020 
penetrates through really good and
strong<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:23.299> another<00:01:24.299> thing<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:26.670> slide

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
strong and another thing is the slide

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.319 
strong and another thing is the slide
well<00:01:27.479> at<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> slide<00:01:28.110> made<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.979> Teflon<00:01:29.329> which

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
well at the slide made of Teflon which

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.590 
well at the slide made of Teflon which
were<00:01:31.140> never<00:01:31.380> stick<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.070> they're<00:01:32.939> always<00:01:33.119> free

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
were never stick and they're always free

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.380 
were never stick and they're always free
and<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.710> know<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.009> sample<00:01:35.460> instrument<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.210> use

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and you know the sample instrument I use

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.770 
and you know the sample instrument I use
for<00:01:36.750> over<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.170> year<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:38.270> still<00:01:39.270> working

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
for over a year and still working

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.069 
for over a year and still working
without<00:01:40.110> any<00:01:40.290> service<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.810> is

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
without any service so I think that is

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.109 
without any service so I think that is
very<00:01:43.590> very<00:01:46.189> welcome<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.399> feature<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.850> this

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
very very welcome the feature of this

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.830 
very very welcome the feature of this
instrument<00:01:48.450> also<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> instrument<00:01:50.070> self

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
instrument also the instrument self

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.700 
instrument also the instrument self
practically<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.100> indestructible<00:01:53.180> because

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
practically is indestructible because

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.249 
practically is indestructible because
the<00:01:55.710> material<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.250> use<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:58.110> construction

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the material we use and the construction

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.969 
the material we use and the construction
of<00:01:58.770> instrument<00:01:59.479> nothing<00:02:00.479> really<00:02:01.469> wears<00:02:01.770> out

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
of instrument nothing really wears out

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.959 
of instrument nothing really wears out
and<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.479> only<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:04.049> part<00:02:04.439> could<00:02:05.219> be<00:02:05.280> replaced

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
and so the only a part could be replaced

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.809 
and so the only a part could be replaced
from<00:02:06.960> time<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.350> time<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.069> reedplate<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
from time to time is the reedplate the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.029 
from time to time is the reedplate the
instrument<00:02:09.300> itself<00:02:09.420> were<00:02:10.349> almost<00:02:10.800> lost

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
instrument itself were almost lost

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.660 
instrument itself were almost lost
forever

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
forever

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.110 
forever

slide exactly so it will make the

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:52.980 
slide exactly so it will make the
instrument<00:02:43.180> work

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.520 

well

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
well

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.350 
well
the<00:02:54.920> reason<00:02:55.220> I'm<00:02:55.340> making<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.880> silver

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
the reason I'm making the silver

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.650 
the reason I'm making the silver
harmonica<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:57.500> course<00:02:57.950> we<00:02:58.580> all<00:02:58.730> know<00:02:58.760> this

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
harmonica of course we all know this

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.350 
harmonica of course we all know this
will<00:02:59.870> be<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.080> very<00:03:00.350> expensive<00:03:00.920> instrument<00:03:01.640> also

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
will be a very expensive instrument also

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.810 
will be a very expensive instrument also
because<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:03.080> this<00:03:03.440> design.you<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.460> a<00:03:04.490> lot<00:03:04.700> of

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
because of this design.you is a lot of

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.030 
because of this design.you is a lot of
more<00:03:04.940> silver<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:05.990> probably<00:03:06.500> this<00:03:06.680> will<00:03:06.860> be<00:03:07.010> a

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
more silver so probably this will be a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.830 
more silver so probably this will be a
most<00:03:07.280> expensive<00:03:07.820> instrument<00:03:08.270> a<00:03:08.330> word<00:03:08.510> but

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
most expensive instrument a word but

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.040 
most expensive instrument a word but
this<00:03:09.500> is<00:03:09.680> not<00:03:09.890> really<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.420> first<00:03:11.420> reason<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:11.990> I

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
this is not really a first reason that I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.440 
this is not really a first reason that I
like<00:03:12.410> to<00:03:12.590> make<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.860> save<00:03:13.100> a<00:03:13.130> harmonica<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:13.910> just

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
like to make a save a harmonica I just

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.420 
like to make a save a harmonica I just
you'd<00:03:14.960> like<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.440> try<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.680> out

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
you'd like to try it out

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.090 
you'd like to try it out
I<00:03:16.520> see<00:03:16.970> whether<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.960> sound<00:03:18.260> will<00:03:18.590> be<00:03:18.770> even

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
I see whether the sound will be even

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.280 
I see whether the sound will be even
better<00:03:19.250> if<00:03:19.700> it's<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.420> instrument<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:20.990> all

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
better if it's the instrument is all

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.160 
better if it's the instrument is all
made<00:03:21.650> in<00:03:21.800> silver<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.510> like<00:03:23.510> other<00:03:23.720> instrument

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
made in silver and like other instrument

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.560 
made in silver and like other instrument
flute<00:03:24.530> or<00:03:24.860> some<00:03:25.220> other<00:03:25.400> wind<00:03:25.700> instrument<00:03:26.240> they

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
flute or some other wind instrument they

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.050 
flute or some other wind instrument they
have<00:03:26.780> made<00:03:27.290> in<00:03:27.590> server<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.280> or<00:03:28.580> precious

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
have made in server and or precious

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.270 
have made in server and or precious
metal<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.630> they<00:03:30.140> claim<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.500> have<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:30.980> better

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
metal and they claim to have a better

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.230 
metal and they claim to have a better
acoustics<00:03:31.970> sound<00:03:32.510> maybe<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.950> will<00:03:34.370> be<00:03:34.880> true<00:03:35.090> on

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
acoustics sound maybe it will be true on

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.640 
acoustics sound maybe it will be true on
this<00:03:35.390> instrument<00:03:35.690> too<00:03:35.990> because<00:03:36.350> this

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
this instrument too because this

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.670 
this instrument too because this
instrument<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.760> harmonica<00:03:38.360> is<00:03:38.540> also<00:03:39.260> built

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
instrument this harmonica is also built

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.740 
instrument this harmonica is also built
with<00:03:40.520> acoustic<00:03:41.060> design<00:03:41.959> in<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:43.570> hope<00:03:44.570> it

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
with acoustic design in it and hope it

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.660 
with acoustic design in it and hope it
will<00:03:45.260> work<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.800> I<00:03:46.010> hope<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:46.340> won't<00:03:46.459> be<00:03:46.640> too

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
will work and I hope it won't be too

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.410 
will work and I hope it won't be too
heavy<00:03:47.030> for<00:03:47.150> mr.<00:03:47.630> years<00:03:47.990> so<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:49.670> can<00:03:50.180> really

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
heavy for mr. years so I I can really

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.960 
heavy for mr. years so I I can really
use<00:03:51.380> this<00:03:51.560> instrument<00:03:51.890> in<00:03:52.370> my<00:03:52.520> class<00:03:52.790> of

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
use this instrument in my class of

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.570 
use this instrument in my class of
performances
