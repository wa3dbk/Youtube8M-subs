and<00:02:33.260> he's<00:02:33.830> playing<00:02:34.070> Jim<00:02:34.430> 1109<00:02:35.110> 1995<00:02:36.110> AKA

and he's playing Jim 1109 1995 AKA

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.920 
and he's playing Jim 1109 1995 AKA
tavington<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.090> think<00:02:38.330> they're<00:02:38.480> both<00:02:38.690> from

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
tavington and I think they're both from

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.770 
tavington and I think they're both from
the<00:02:38.990> HM<00:02:39.500> clan<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.970> way<00:02:41.210> that<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.540> thing

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
the HM clan and the way that this thing

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.010 
the HM clan and the way that this thing
was<00:02:42.100> randomized<00:02:43.100> is<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.520> now<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.700> HM<00:02:44.390> clan

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
was randomized is that now the HM clan

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.310 
was randomized is that now the HM clan
is<00:02:45.980> facing<00:02:46.640> each<00:02:46.820> other<00:02:46.970> off<00:02:47.270> yet<00:02:47.750> again<00:02:47.870> so

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
is facing each other off yet again so

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.650 
is facing each other off yet again so
first<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.800> was<00:02:48.950> tavington<00:02:49.400> vs<00:02:49.940> al<00:02:50.150> sonal<00:02:50.510> or

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
first it was tavington vs al sonal or

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.900 
first it was tavington vs al sonal or
Alana's<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.380> now<00:02:51.860> it's<00:02:52.040> pointment<00:02:52.520> vs

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
Alana's and now it's pointment vs

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.630 
Alana's and now it's pointment vs
tavington<00:02:53.240> so<00:02:53.630> we'll<00:02:54.590> see<00:02:54.740> who<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.010> best<00:02:55.220> HM

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640
