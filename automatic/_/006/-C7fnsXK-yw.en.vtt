00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
find this impressive and partly why

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.729 
find this impressive and partly why
we're<00:01:00.420> uploading<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.019> is<00:01:01.170> because<00:01:01.499> you<00:01:01.620> know

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739

the<00:01:02.219> desert<00:01:02.579> eagle<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> very<00:01:03.449> very

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the desert eagle is a very very

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.390

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
that and I think this is pretty much the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.190 
that and I think this is pretty much the
same<00:01:08.190> concept<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:08.850> team<00:01:09.270> defender<00:01:09.810> I'm<00:01:09.990> not

so<00:02:03.929> in<00:02:04.229> my<00:02:04.409> opinion<00:02:04.530> mono<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.429> three<00:02:05.700> was

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
so in my opinion mono for three was

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.880 
so in my opinion mono for three was
honestly<00:02:06.329> one<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> best<00:02:07.049> Call<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.530> Duty

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
now to be quite honest it was the most

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.830
