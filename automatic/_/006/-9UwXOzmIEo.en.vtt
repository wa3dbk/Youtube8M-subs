00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
else those things and today I thought

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.120 
else those things and today I thought
I'd<00:00:06.480> bring<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.930> guys<00:00:07.109> along<00:00:07.170> I'm<00:00:07.620> building<00:00:08.040> a

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
I'd bring you guys along I'm building a

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.180 
I'd bring you guys along I'm building a
door<00:00:08.370> for<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.730> super<00:00:09.300> small<00:00:09.540> cabin<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.889> door<00:00:11.070> is

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
door for a super small cabin the door is

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.339 
door for a super small cabin the door is
only<00:00:11.309> 23<00:00:11.849> inches<00:00:12.120> wide<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.630> about<00:00:12.809> seven<00:00:13.200> feet

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
only 23 inches wide and about seven feet

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.440 
only 23 inches wide and about seven feet
tall<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.340> it's<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> really<00:00:14.639> small<00:00:14.969> door<00:00:15.240> it's

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
tall so it's a really small door it's

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.700 
tall so it's a really small door it's
going<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.630> be<00:00:15.719> custom<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.410> think<00:00:16.590> it's

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
going to be custom and I think it's

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.680 
going to be custom and I think it's
gonna<00:00:16.859> look<00:00:16.980> cool<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.369> we're<00:00:17.460> all<00:00:17.550> done

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
gonna look cool and we're all done

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.880 
gonna look cool and we're all done

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
I thought it'd be something you ought to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.509 
I thought it'd be something you ought to
be<00:00:19.949> interested<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.880> stay<00:00:21.420> tuned

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519

first things first a piece of plywood
that<00:00:24.779> we're<00:00:24.960> using<00:00:25.109> here<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.500> actually

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
that we're using here is actually

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.160 
that we're using here is actually
construction<00:00:26.550> grade<00:00:26.760> plywood<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.510> 3/4<00:00:27.990> inch

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
construction grade plywood is 3/4 inch

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.200 
construction grade plywood is 3/4 inch
and<00:00:28.859> what<00:00:28.980> construction<00:00:29.519> grade<00:00:29.640> means<00:00:30.029> for

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and what construction grade means for

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.490 
and what construction grade means for
those<00:00:30.330> who<00:00:30.480> don't<00:00:30.630> know<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.260> it's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
those who don't know it's just that it's

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
knots some of the most beautiful in the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.660 
knots some of the most beautiful in the
world<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> serve<00:00:35.460> as<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
world but this is going to serve as the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.840 
world but this is going to serve as the
back<00:00:35.969> side<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.510> door<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.280> this<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.640> part

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
back side of the door and this this part

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
will actually be exposed one of the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.299 
will actually be exposed one of the
sides<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.829> get<00:00:40.920> two<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.190> three

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
sides but it's going to get two or three

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.680 
sides but it's going to get two or three

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
coats of paint so you really won't see

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.779 
coats of paint so you really won't see
it<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.680> cabinet<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.670> is

necessarily<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.610> use<00:01:08.970> one<00:01:09.150> by<00:01:09.270> fours<00:01:09.479> for

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
necessarily have to use one by fours for

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.850 
necessarily have to use one by fours for
your<00:01:09.780> door<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.260> why<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.500> use<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.650> in
