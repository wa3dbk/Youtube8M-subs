what you're about to see is just a
simple<00:00:24.000> bug<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.750> pisses<00:00:24.990> me<00:00:25.230> off<00:00:25.260> because

simple bug but it pisses me off because

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.210 
simple bug but it pisses me off because
it's<00:00:25.830> quite<00:00:26.099> hidden<00:00:26.750> so<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.500> low

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
it's quite hidden so what is low

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.749 
it's quite hidden so what is low
altitude<00:00:29.880> bullshit<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:31.230> works<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.590> this

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
altitude bullshit it works like this

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.040 
altitude bullshit it works like this
you're<00:00:32.759> descending<00:00:33.180> towards<00:00:33.480> ground<00:00:33.719> level

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
you're descending towards ground level

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.959 
you're descending towards ground level
but<00:00:34.500> before<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.890> land<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.550> delayed<00:00:35.790> by

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
but before you land you get delayed by

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.090 
but before you land you get delayed by
skill<00:00:36.300> or<00:00:36.510> awakening<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.230> never<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.890> cause

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
skill or awakening or never the cause

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.389 
skill or awakening or never the cause
may<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.450> your<00:00:39.450> opponent<00:00:39.690> then<00:00:40.140> hits<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.680> but

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
may be your opponent then hits you but

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.220 
may be your opponent then hits you but
you<00:00:41.489> easily<00:00:41.760> get<00:00:41.910> away<00:00:42.120> completely<00:00:42.510> ignoring

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
you easily get away completely ignoring

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.260 
you easily get away completely ignoring
the<00:00:43.500> hits<00:00:43.680> done<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.579> got<00:00:44.760> away<00:00:44.910> because<00:00:45.090> you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the hits done you got away because you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.970 
the hits done you got away because you
were<00:00:45.360> knowledgeable<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:46.079> already<00:00:46.559> knew<00:00:46.800> this

were knowledgeable you already knew this

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.069 
were knowledgeable you already knew this
would<00:00:47.160> happen<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> course<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.809> those<00:00:48.870> who

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
would happen but of course for those who

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.380 
would happen but of course for those who
do<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.410> what<00:00:49.860> happens<00:00:50.190> next<00:00:50.390> looking

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
do not know what happens next looking

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.740 
do not know what happens next looking
for<00:00:51.719> Slugger<00:00:51.960> no<00:00:52.440> no<00:00:52.579> no<00:00:53.579> yes<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.390> course<00:00:54.600> you

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
for Slugger no no no yes of course you

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.740 
for Slugger no no no yes of course you
will<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.020> bashed<00:00:55.579> this<00:00:56.579> happens<00:00:57.000> every<00:00:57.480> time

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
will get bashed this happens every time

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.150 
will get bashed this happens every time
you<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.079> too<00:00:58.230> late<00:00:58.379> right<00:00:58.620> above<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> ground

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
you get too late right above the ground

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.369 
you get too late right above the ground
while<00:00:59.370> descending<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.480> delay<00:01:00.780> prevents<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
while descending the delay prevents the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.660 
while descending the delay prevents the
game<00:01:01.530> from<00:01:01.680> registering<00:01:02.190> whether<00:01:02.460> you're

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
game from registering whether you're

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.310 
game from registering whether you're
above<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> ground<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.809> ground<00:01:03.930> itself

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
above the ground or on the ground itself

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.190 
above the ground or on the ground itself
so<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.040> basically<00:01:05.309> registers<00:01:06.119> both<00:01:06.479> what

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
so it basically registers both what

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.780 
so it basically registers both what
happens<00:01:07.500> next<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.159> cancel<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> hit

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
happens next is that you cancel the hit

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.120 
happens next is that you cancel the hit
San<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.420> delay<00:01:09.689> at<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.930> same<00:01:10.170> time<00:01:10.409> this

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
San and the delay at the same time this

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.770 
San and the delay at the same time this
will<00:01:11.310> enable<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.880> escape<00:01:12.299> without<00:01:12.450> any

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
will enable you to escape without any

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.160 
will enable you to escape without any
problem<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.710> course<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.970> Aisha<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.659> Rina<00:01:15.990> you

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
problem of course for Aisha and Rina you

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.780 
problem of course for Aisha and Rina you
don't<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.710> specifically<00:01:17.250> descend

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
don't have to specifically descend

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.780 
don't have to specifically descend
because<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> tumble<00:01:19.470> bullshit<00:01:19.950> they<00:01:20.640> can

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
because of the tumble bullshit they can

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.190 
because of the tumble bullshit they can
easily<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.240> out<00:01:21.360> simply<00:01:21.750> because<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:22.170> were

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
easily get out simply because they were

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.170 
easily get out simply because they were
above<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.650> ground<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.159> bit<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.970> for

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
above the ground a little bit but for

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.020 
above the ground a little bit but for
the<00:01:24.299> others<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.470> rach<00:01:25.710> worthy<00:01:26.130> even<00:01:26.909> if

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the others this is rach worthy even if

the others this is rach worthy even if
you<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.930> specific<00:01:28.350> bug<00:01:28.530> why

situation you are quite limited with

situation you are quite limited with
options<00:01:41.220> an<00:01:41.430> easy<00:01:42.180> way<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> prevent<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.110> is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
options an easy way to prevent this is

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.170 
options an easy way to prevent this is
of<00:01:43.680> course<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:44.009> launch<00:01:44.220> them<00:01:44.430> launching

of course to launch them launching
effectively<00:01:45.750> cancels<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.350> low<00:01:46.649> altitude

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
effectively cancels out the low altitude

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.670 
effectively cancels out the low altitude
bullshit<00:01:47.659> second<00:01:48.659> option<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> utilize<00:01:49.470> a

here is an example look closely you will
be<00:02:16.740> able<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:17.010> see<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.310> even<00:02:17.550> if<00:02:17.910> they<00:02:18.060> cancel

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300
