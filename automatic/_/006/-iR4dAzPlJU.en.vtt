00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
description below as well so first

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.889 
description below as well so first
things<00:00:59.890> first<00:01:01.230> now<00:01:02.610> these<00:01:03.610> can<00:01:04.119> be<00:01:04.180> mirrored

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
things first now these can be mirrored

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.499 
things first now these can be mirrored
the<00:01:05.199> opposite<00:01:05.649> way<00:01:05.830> so<00:01:06.100> depending<00:01:06.910> on<00:01:07.000> if<00:01:07.270> you

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
the opposite way so depending on if you

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:08.969 
the opposite way so depending on if you
want<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.780> door<00:01:07.990> this<00:01:08.200> side<00:01:08.500> or<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:08.950> other

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
want the door this side or the other

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.460 
want the door this side or the other
side<00:01:09.399> depends<00:01:10.270> on<00:01:10.360> then<00:01:10.600> where<00:01:11.259> you're

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
side depends on then where you're

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.859 
side depends on then where you're
missing<00:01:11.619> out<00:01:11.920> this<00:01:12.130> chunk<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.759> so<00:01:13.390> on<00:01:13.600> so<00:01:13.780> you

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
missing out this chunk and so on so you

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.190 
missing out this chunk and so on so you
can't<00:01:14.110> mirror<00:01:14.380> this<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:16.240> for<00:01:16.450> now<00:01:16.600> on<00:01:16.899> this

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
can't mirror this but for now on this

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.999 
can't mirror this but for now on this
