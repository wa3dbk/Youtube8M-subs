00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.570
 hello to all churchill we are in a 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:09.230
 new gta 5 video today I bring you new 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.419
 information about robberies and robberies 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.230
 gta 5 not that update that we 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:17.510
 promised rockstar for 1.09 or all 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.360
 We think it's going to enter 1.09 but it was not 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.130
 well so we'll have to wait for a 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.710
 update more than I believe since in 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.600
 the 1.10 will already be made robberies and banks 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.600
 of all we hope so it came out new 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.090
 information about the trades that will have 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.449
 each one as we already know about 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.899
 previous information as the groups or 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.149
 teams will have four components worth 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.420
 and those four components each may 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.699
 be you can choose a different trade 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.710
 ok here I am going to put an information 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.960
 about the data they have extracted from data 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.949
 of the game not of game files that 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.109
 they are already in this update 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.389
 but that surely for the 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.969
 next authorization and to this post 

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:00.769
 It is worth the robberies and robberies 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.260
 it's in the archives but still not 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.780
 is installed obviously not because no 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.520
 we have robbery and robbery still so 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.920
 how to continue watching there 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.579
 we get out font string string I think it's 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.820
 string but that's a language 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:20.270
 computer as you see team 1 team 25354 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.130
 that means a team a team of 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.829
 equipment other equipment 4 but refers to 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.670
 which player 142 player 3 player 4 is worth 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:31.399
 and now each of them can choose 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.729
 transportation that transport achieved it 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:38.479
 money snipers lockout defenders 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.119
 attackers hacker demolition that will be me 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.909
 I think demolition can be like in 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.549
 a mission that the campaign way that we 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.700
 we put a suit all 8 like that with a 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.250
 What this submachine gun 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.000
 of resale low everything that is put by 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.590
 in front of 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.539
 there is also the runner who will be me 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.299
 be a species then that the guy who stops 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.000
 not be a runner runner the corridor 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.740
 I know if it is you and is the one in charge of 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.280
 pick up people and escape but 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.190
 there are also for example pilots of the 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.239
 what is being planes and so on 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.410
 drivers that are the drivers those who 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.530
 they will have to escape from the police 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.330
 finally bodyguards that I do not know 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.019
 what is really but I think they are 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.150
 bodyguard is worth but I do not know what 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.580
 what function will be worth is also 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.430
 some main that will be the gunmen and 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.140
 many many things as you are seeing 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.209
 then all those jobs you look for 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.730
 between author google translate it but I 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.380
 I have translated pretty much almost everything 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.540
 that images have also been filtered 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.790
 It is worth it since it is already has gotten 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.579
 the files and he has executed it in his 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.290
 own console is worth and as you are seeing 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.360
 there you can choose to attack 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.849
 attackers hackers demolition runner 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.860
 and each one will be able to choose each 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:55.030
 I do not know if each one will choose his 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.520
 or that the host will choose 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.920
 whoever wants to be each one is worth it 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.740
 that good for example I want that 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.410
 you are hacker had runner and had another 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.600
 thing is worth that can be an option or that 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.430
 each one choose yours do not know very 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.920
 well so good as you are seeing 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.780
 there are images that I am going through and in 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.700
 the last one very important also if 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.280
 you put drivers and put folk folk 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.250
 default I do not know what this means 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.380
 I do not know if it will be random or that it is 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.290
 saying that nothing that there is one in the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.090
 game and you can play with three in the 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.400
 pc that is cons three players who do not 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.989
 it's nobody but it 's the machine it's worth like that 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.700
 that is also information that is not 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.980
 we knew that you can play only with 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.150
 three in epc that will surely be painful 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.790
 and terrible and make you lose the game 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.310
 but you can still play with three 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.090
 what are the machines worth and how can you 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.519
 see you can choose the trade that you 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.770
 you want so it's new information 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.430
 that has leaked over 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.960
 robberies and robberies and robberies although I believe that 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.400
 it's the same but well I say robberies and 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.710
 robbery I do not know why robberies robberies 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.790
 but good so good I hope that you 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.370
 have liked a like and a favorite 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.580
 will help a lot and the truth is that 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.210
 I'm waiting a lot for this update 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.900
 because it's going to give something new to the game and 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.160
 something that can be very cool and the 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.720
 I'm really waiting and I want 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.920
 enjoy this game mode so 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.840
 I hope you also put it on 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.610
 the comments if you want I hope that 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.190
 have liked a favorite like yesterday is a 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.510
 bunch to spread the video a greeting 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.970
