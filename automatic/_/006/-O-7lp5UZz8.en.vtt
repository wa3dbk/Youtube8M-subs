Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.915
I have a new outfit video for you

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.640
we are going to talk about this denim vest I'm wearing

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.060
I have prepared three different looks

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.140
and I'm going to show you how I would match this vest

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.854
this is my first outfit

00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:15.235
and I would say it is sort of a country style

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.960
because of the cheque pattern and denim 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.854
what am I wearing exactly?

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.040
my dress is flanel with a checked pattern

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.780
I love to wear it during the fall season

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.940
and it has two pockets, I really like that

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.680
who already saw some of my videos knows how much I like pockets 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.720
and I'm wearing a normal belt, not a waist belt

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.720
to get some shape into this loosely cut dress

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.720
but the denim vest gives the dress a bit of shape aswell

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.100
the belt is not absolutely nescessary

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.300
because the vest slims it down

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.480
where it is supposed to fit a bit better

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.900
I combined my boots with the wedge heels

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.240
I'm wearing them really often because I just love them

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.600
however, this is my first look

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.780
alright guys, outfit number two, look number two

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.100
I'm going to call it street style/casual style

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.980
maybe it's not for everyone because of the many patterns

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.200
but I definitely wanted to combine the vest with a print shirt

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.700
and I tried it with a leggings and sneakers

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.460
which is a quite simple look you can see often

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.460
but I wanted to do something cool, so I combined the printed shirt with some patterned pants

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.140
so, I chose this style to show you how cool a pattern mix like this could look

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.440
to pick up the colors in the print again I put on my brown boots

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.800
and I think this is a pretty cool style

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.320
alright guys, outfit number 3, look number 3

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.580
I'm wearing a maxi tube dress

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.900
this one doesn't have any slits 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.420
which makes quick walking a little bit difficult ;)

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.080
and to get a bit of a casual touch into this look

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.780
the vest look...dooh, we are only talking about the vest today...again...

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.700
what I actually want to tell you is: the maxi dress alone is a bit too elegant

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.580
a bit too feminin with a bodycon cut which shows even the tyniest muffin top

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.520
the vest makes it a lot cooler

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.240
and it hides little areas you don't like so much

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.720
which makes you feel a lot more comfy

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.700
to get a bit of a rock style into this outfit I took this necklace with 1000 chains

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.140
and my shoes are black peep toe boots with high heels

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.200
and a silver buckle and some cut outs at the side

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.320
that's it for today

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.295
but I have one more question for you

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.760
do you think I could wear this cap to this outfit? 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:11.000
I'm not sure, but maybe it adds a bit of an edgy touch

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
those were the three outfits, I hope you liked them

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.060
and in addition to my first question if you prefer the last outfit with or without cap

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.360
I would like to know which outfit you liked the best?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.220
1, 2 oder 3? I like the second the best

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.880
because I really like those patterned pants

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.420
otherwise please tell me what you would wear to your denim vest?
