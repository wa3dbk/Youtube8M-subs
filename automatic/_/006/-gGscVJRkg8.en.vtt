00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
ported from the pc onto the xbox by a

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.919 
ported from the pc onto the xbox by a
guy<00:00:10.860> named<00:00:11.099> Todd<00:00:11.370> Hale<00:00:11.610> he's<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.210> same<00:00:12.570> exact

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
guy named Todd Hale he's the same exact

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.829 
guy named Todd Hale he's the same exact
guy<00:00:12.990> who<00:00:13.139> sent<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> last<00:00:14.429> map<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:15.030> me<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.420> this

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
guy who sent the last map to me and this

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.050 
guy who sent the last map to me and this
would<00:00:16.080> map<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.800> think<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.490> even<00:00:17.609> better<00:00:17.850> in

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
would map is I think it's even better in

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.460 
would map is I think it's even better in
the<00:00:18.150> first<00:00:18.359> because<00:00:18.690> as<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.050> see<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.439> here

little pods so here i am i'm going to go
through<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.500> place<00:01:10.860> right<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
through this place right here and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.510 
through this place right here and
there's<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> host<00:01:13.530> room<00:01:13.770> right<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.070> there<00:01:14.250> so

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
there's the host room right in there so

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.060 
there's the host room right in there so
let's<00:01:14.729> see<00:01:15.259> okay<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.650> we're<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> go

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
let's see okay so we're going to go

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.109 
let's see okay so we're going to go
inside<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.400> host<00:01:17.640> room<00:01:18.860> right<00:01:19.860> now<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.119> so

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
inside the host room right now and so

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.760 
inside the host room right now and so
pretty<00:01:21.420> much<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.720> pull<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.080> activate<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> pods

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
pretty much to pull to activate the pods

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.399 
pretty much to pull to activate the pods
and<00:01:24.439> then<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> piston<00:01:25.740> will<00:01:26.040> push<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.409> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and then the piston will push up and you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.780 
and then the piston will push up and you
pretty<00:01:28.590> much<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.890> released<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.400> there's<00:01:29.579> no

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
pretty much get released so there's no

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.940 
pretty much get released so there's no
timer<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.390> there's<00:01:30.600> no<00:01:30.810> lag<00:01:31.140> between<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.740> pods

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
timer so there's no lag between the pods

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.830 
timer so there's no lag between the pods
so<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.119> map<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> whole<00:01:33.659> lot<00:01:33.810> better

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
so I like this map a whole lot better

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.469 
so I like this map a whole lot better
because<00:01:34.229> there's<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.640> whole<00:01:36.450> lot

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
because there's going to be a whole lot

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.480 
because there's going to be a whole lot
less<00:01:36.930> lag<00:01:37.259> than<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.710> was<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.100> other<00:01:38.250> map

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
less lag than there was in the other map

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.660 
less lag than there was in the other map
because<00:01:38.790> there<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.210> no<00:01:39.450> timer<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.740> yeah<00:01:41.310> and

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
math like as you can see there's

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.039 
math like as you can see there's
just<00:02:13.950> like<00:02:14.159> scattered<00:02:14.790> around<00:02:14.969> the<00:02:15.299> map<00:02:15.569> and

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
just like scattered around the map and

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.679 
just like scattered around the map and
there's<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.099> lot<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.370> obstacles<00:02:17.609> i<00:02:18.209> really<00:02:18.540> like

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
there's a lot of obstacles i really like

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.599 
there's a lot of obstacles i really like
this<00:02:18.840> map<00:02:19.049> because<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.530> because<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.489> the

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
this map because the because of the

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.869 
this map because the because of the
obstacles<00:02:21.239> uh<00:02:21.950> look<00:02:22.950> at<00:02:23.040> me<00:02:23.159> feeling<00:02:23.400> already

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
obstacles uh look at me feeling already

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.349 
obstacles uh look at me feeling already
but<00:02:24.409> pretty<00:02:25.409> much<00:02:25.819> there<00:02:26.819> is<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> lot<00:02:27.329> of

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
but pretty much there is a lot of

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.229 
but pretty much there is a lot of
obstacles<00:02:27.599> like<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.319> said<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:29.730> know<00:02:29.849> hidden

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
obstacles like I said you know hidden

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.759 
obstacles like I said you know hidden
Chester<00:02:30.659> on<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.930> map<00:02:31.109> and<00:02:31.290> there<00:02:31.439> are<00:02:31.590> also

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
Chester on the map and there are also

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.920 
Chester on the map and there are also
traps<00:02:32.400> around<00:02:32.639> the<00:02:32.969> map<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.329> want<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.599> see<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.840> I

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
traps around the map I want to see if I

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.559 
traps around the map I want to see if I
can<00:02:34.079> find<00:02:34.409> one<00:02:34.799> but<00:02:35.760> yeah<00:02:36.060> there's<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.359> lot<00:02:36.510> of

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
can find one but yeah there's a lot of

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.440 
can find one but yeah there's a lot of
traps<00:02:36.870> here's<00:02:37.109> a<00:02:37.170> castle<00:02:37.650> over<00:02:37.920> here<00:02:38.219> and

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
traps here's a castle over here and

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.110 
traps here's a castle over here and
overall<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.780> think<00:02:40.290> there<00:02:40.680> are<00:02:40.709> three<00:02:41.609> crafting

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
overall I think there are three crafting

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.819 
overall I think there are three crafting
tables<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:44.430> know<00:02:44.579> if<00:02:45.030> someone<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.200> cheats

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829

by still in the crafting table in the

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.559 
by still in the crafting table in the
middle<00:02:48.720> whatever<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:49.859> can<00:02:50.010> still<00:02:50.569> win

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
middle whatever you can still win

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.199 
middle whatever you can still win

craft stuff because there are three

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.990 
craft stuff because there are three
crafting<00:02:55.799> tables<00:02:56.099> on<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.340> map<00:02:56.519> because<00:02:56.669> I<00:02:56.849> had

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
crafting tables on the map because I had

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.190 
crafting tables on the map because I had
that<00:02:57.209> happen<00:02:57.389> to<00:02:57.540> me<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.810> Hunger<00:02:58.019> Games

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
once before but they actually did add

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.360 
once before but they actually did add
some<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.959> their<00:03:01.079> own<00:03:01.260> additions<00:03:01.829> on<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.159> map

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
some of their own additions on this map

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.420 
some of their own additions on this map
like<00:03:03.109> they<00:03:04.109> did<00:03:04.290> add<00:03:04.530> some<00:03:04.799> stuff<00:03:05.040> like<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.370> know

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
like they did add some stuff like I know

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.149 
like they did add some stuff like I know
they<00:03:05.700> added<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.150> ship<00:03:06.689> over<00:03:07.109> here<00:03:07.409> like<00:03:07.980> as

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
they added the ship over here like as

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.009 
they added the ship over here like as
you<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.400> see<00:03:08.549> inside<00:03:09.060> here's<00:03:09.419> a<00:03:09.480> ship<00:03:09.840> and

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
you can see inside here's a ship and

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.959 
you can see inside here's a ship and
they<00:03:10.139> added<00:03:10.439> that<00:03:10.620> themselves<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.489> think

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969 
they added that themselves so I think

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.670 
they added that themselves so I think
it's<00:03:12.150> cool<00:03:12.329> that<00:03:12.389> they<00:03:12.689> ported<00:03:13.109> it<00:03:13.319> but<00:03:13.560> they

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
it's cool that they ported it but they

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.860 
it's cool that they ported it but they
also<00:03:13.859> added<00:03:14.159> some<00:03:14.340> some<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.299> like<00:03:15.510> their<00:03:15.659> own
