00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
smoother from the root kind of Dam we

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.139 
smoother from the root kind of Dam we
don't<00:00:39.989> start<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> waves<00:00:41.070> come<00:00:41.460> to

kind<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.450> midway<00:00:42.989> down<00:00:43.100> which<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.250> great<00:00:44.489> for

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
kind of midway down which is great for

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.639 
kind of midway down which is great for
short<00:00:44.940> hair<00:00:45.120> because<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:46.020> always<00:00:46.200> hard<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
short hair because it's always hard to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.799 
short hair because it's always hard to
curl<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.190> top<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.700> not<00:00:47.789> look<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.480> too

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
curled so what we're going to do because

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.000 
curled so what we're going to do because
she<00:00:51.420> has<00:00:51.600> these<00:00:51.840> layers<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
she has these layers is I'm going to

she has these layers is I'm going to
section<00:00:53.219> her<00:00:53.399> hair<00:00:53.610> off<00:00:53.730> into<00:00:53.760> two<00:00:54.239> sections

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
section her hair off into two sections

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.639 
section her hair off into two sections
if<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:56.250> had<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> haircut<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.480> more<00:00:58.050> one

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
if you had a haircut that was more one

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.889 
if you had a haircut that was more one
length<00:00:59.039> then<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.969> would<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.359> take<00:01:00.629> big

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
length then you would just take big

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.660 
length then you would just take big
sections<00:01:01.410> straight<00:01:01.770> out<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.100> side<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
sections straight out to the side so you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.979 
sections straight out to the side so you
would<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> same<00:01:03.120> thing<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.629> I'm<00:01:03.750> about

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.080 
would do the same thing that I'm about
to<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.589> first<00:01:04.860> section<00:01:05.129> only<00:01:05.970> you

just<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.490> take<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.880> top<00:01:09.330> section<00:01:10.200> here

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
just going to take a top section here

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.609 
just going to take a top section here
top<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.119> her<00:01:12.240> ears<00:01:12.510> about<00:01:12.750> right<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.290> it's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
top of her ears about right here so it's

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.770 
top of her ears about right here so it's
a<00:01:13.680> pretty<00:01:13.890> big<00:01:14.100> section<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.850> I'm<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
a pretty big section and I'm going to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.340 
a pretty big section and I'm going to
curl<00:01:16.080> them<00:01:17.000> moving<00:01:18.000> straight<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.869> from<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
curl them moving straight out from the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.700 
curl them moving straight out from the
head<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.720> think<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.810> lot<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.049> times<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.439> curls

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
head I think a lot of times with curls

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.609 
head I think a lot of times with curls
our<00:01:22.830> instinct<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.729> always<00:01:23.790> curl<00:01:24.450> under<00:01:24.689> so

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
our instinct is to always curl under so

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
our instinct is to always curl under so
we're<00:01:26.130> doing<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> exact<00:01:26.790> opposite<00:01:27.330> we're

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
we're doing the exact opposite we're

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.749 
we're doing the exact opposite we're
keeping<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.080> straight<00:01:28.979> out<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:29.640> we're

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
keeping it straight out and then we're

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.429 
keeping it straight out and then we're
going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> curl<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.390> there's<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.990> couple<00:01:31.079> of

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
going to curl it there's a couple of

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.940 
going to curl it there's a couple of
different<00:01:31.710> techniques<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.750> for<00:01:33.950> her

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
different techniques you can do for her

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.590

hair<00:01:35.220> what<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.240> would<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.479> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
hair what I really like to do would be a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.810 
hair what I really like to do would be a
tonging<00:01:37.140> technique<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.490> what<00:01:38.640> you're<00:01:38.729> going

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
tonging technique so what you're going

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.770 
tonging technique so what you're going
to<00:01:38.880> do<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.180> you're<00:01:39.270> going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.420> take<00:01:39.600> your

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
to do is you're going to take your

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.319 
to do is you're going to take your
curling<00:01:40.140> iron<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.799> you're<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.000> point

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
curling iron and you're going to point

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.830 
curling iron and you're going to point
it<00:01:42.630> straight<00:01:43.110> down<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:45.240> are<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.659> going

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it straight down and you are just going

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.560 
it straight down and you are just going
to<00:01:45.960> wrap<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.740> hair<00:01:47.040> around<00:01:47.119> your<00:01:48.119> curling

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570

curl I'll show you that again
again<00:02:02.729> take<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> pretty<00:02:03.659> long<00:02:03.990> section<00:02:05.150> let's

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
again take a pretty long section let's

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.290 
again take a pretty long section let's
straight<00:02:06.600> out<00:02:06.840> from<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.380> head<00:02:08.209> point<00:02:09.209> your

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
straight out from the head point your

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.790 
straight out from the head point your
curling<00:02:09.569> iron<00:02:09.750> down<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:11.209> then<00:02:12.209> wrap

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.040 

this<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.790> such<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.000> great<00:02:18.360> technique<00:02:18.780> for

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
this is such a great technique for

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.580 
this is such a great technique for
shorter<00:02:19.860> hair<00:02:20.690> because<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.990> have<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.260> do<00:02:22.380> so

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
shorter hair because you have to do so

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.120 
shorter hair because you have to do so
many<00:02:22.800> little<00:02:23.730> sections<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.720> it's<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.770> little

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
many little sections and it's a little

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.770 
many little sections and it's a little
bit<00:02:26.250> easier<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.700> think<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.060> curl<00:02:27.420> your<00:02:27.480> hair

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
bit easier I think to curl your hair

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.720 
bit easier I think to curl your hair
tonging<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.760> with<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.910> short<00:02:30.180> hair<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.670> I'm

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
tonging it with the short hair so I'm

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.940 
tonging it with the short hair so I'm
going<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:35.940> continue<00:02:36.270> doing<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.870> all<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.560> way

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
going to continue doing that all the way

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.070 
going to continue doing that all the way
around<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.580> probably<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.210> middle<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.930> the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
around to probably the middle of the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.170 
around to probably the middle of the
back<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.620> head<00:02:40.800> all<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.670> sections<00:02:42.090> that

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
back of the head all the sections that

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.060 
back of the head all the sections that
I've<00:02:42.300> done<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.660> far<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:43.110> been<00:02:43.140> curled<00:02:43.680> away

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
I've done so far have been curled away

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.220 
I've done so far have been curled away
from<00:02:44.340> our<00:02:44.520> face<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.120> I'll<00:02:45.570> continue<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.080> do

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
from our face and I'll continue to do

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.640 
from our face and I'll continue to do
the<00:02:46.380> same<00:02:46.410> thing<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.100> other<00:02:47.130> side
