00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
no damage drop off for the salad so

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.410 
no damage drop off for the salad so
that's<00:00:59.140> that's<00:00:59.530> huge<00:01:00.010> info<00:01:00.820> to<00:01:00.969> know<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:01.180> who

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
that's that's huge info to know to who

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.810 
that's that's huge info to know to who
to<00:01:01.450> have<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.340> long<00:01:03.340> range<00:01:03.550> it's<00:01:04.149> four<00:01:04.750> shots

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
to have and long range it's four shots

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.359 
to have and long range it's four shots
so<00:01:06.820> let's<00:01:07.030> look<00:01:07.119> at<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.360> rate<00:01:07.479> of<00:01:07.509> fire<00:01:08.369> it

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
so let's look at the rate of fire it

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.550 
so let's look at the rate of fire it
empties<00:01:09.610> are<00:01:09.820> clipping<00:01:10.060> around<00:01:10.390> 3.3<00:01:11.110> seconds

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
empties are clipping around 3.3 seconds

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.690 
empties are clipping around 3.3 seconds
so<00:01:11.979> I<00:01:12.430> calculated<00:01:13.330> that<00:01:13.450> being<00:01:14.340> 444<00:01:15.340> five

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
so I calculated that being 444 five

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.380 
so I calculated that being 444 five
rounds<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.210> minute<00:01:17.340> not<00:01:18.340> real<00:01:18.670> sure<00:01:18.700> about<00:01:18.970> that

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
rounds a minute not real sure about that

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.690 
rounds a minute not real sure about that
but<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.900> can<00:01:20.110> leave<00:01:20.380> comments<00:01:20.710> if<00:01:21.100> you've<00:01:21.520> got

hit<00:02:23.630> people<00:02:23.959> across<00:02:24.830> them<00:02:25.099> up<00:02:25.250> like<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.519> did

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
hit people across them up like I did

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.910 
hit people across them up like I did
like<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:26.299> did<00:02:26.450> there<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:29.290> if<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.470> have<00:02:30.620> steady

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
like I did there and if you have steady

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.309 
like I did there and if you have steady
aim<00:02:31.069> you<00:02:31.220> can<00:02:31.370> fire<00:02:31.700> full<00:02:32.510> auto<00:02:32.720> like<00:02:33.170> I'm

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
aim you can fire full auto like I'm

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.470 
aim you can fire full auto like I'm
doing<00:02:33.650> now<00:02:33.830> otherwise<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.760> have<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.940> tap<00:02:35.299> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
doing now otherwise you have to tap the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.970 
doing now otherwise you have to tap the
trigger<00:02:36.489> so<00:02:37.489> yes<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:38.680> one<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.709> my

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
trigger so yes this is one of my

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.539 
trigger so yes this is one of my
favorite<00:02:40.459> setups<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:42.620> used<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.130> only

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
favorite setups that I used the only

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.490 
favorite setups that I used the only
disadvantage<00:02:44.030> that<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.720> see<00:02:44.959> compared<00:02:45.410> to

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
disadvantage that I see compared to

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.210 
disadvantage that I see compared to
other<00:02:45.709> assault<00:02:46.280> rifles<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.989> long<00:02:48.739> reload

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
other assault rifles is the long reload

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.190 
other assault rifles is the long reload
time<00:02:49.549> as<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.209> see<00:02:50.360> here<00:02:50.569> it's<00:02:50.660> ridiculous<00:02:50.780> how

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
time as you see here it's ridiculous how

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.130 
time as you see here it's ridiculous how
long<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.769> takes<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.160> reload<00:02:52.630> but<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.810> don't<00:02:54.049> know

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
long it takes to reload but I don't know

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.940 
long it takes to reload but I don't know
that<00:02:54.349> this<00:02:54.849> very<00:02:55.849> good<00:02:56.120> setup<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:57.709> fact

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
that this very good setup and the fact

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.039 
that this very good setup and the fact
that<00:02:58.069> it<00:02:58.280> has<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.459> low<00:02:58.910> rate<00:02:59.360> of<00:02:59.420> fire<00:02:59.840> it's

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
that it has a low rate of fire it's

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.940 
that it has a low rate of fire it's
about<00:03:00.319> 550<00:03:01.280> according<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.819> my<00:03:01.940> calculations

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
about 550 according to my calculations

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.530 
about 550 according to my calculations
means<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.100> you<00:03:04.220> can<00:03:04.400> kill<00:03:04.819> two<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.359> three

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
means that you can kill two and three

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.580 
means that you can kill two and three
people<00:03:05.900> with<00:03:07.000> with<00:03:08.000> one<00:03:08.209> clip<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.810> again<00:03:09.319> here

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
people with with one clip and again here

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.580 
people with with one clip and again here
you<00:03:09.769> see<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.010> snide<00:03:10.880> people<00:03:11.269> across<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.200> map<00:03:12.410> if

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
you see a snide people across the map if

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.160 
you see a snide people across the map if
you<00:03:12.620> tap<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.160> trigger<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:14.630> know<00:03:14.750> even<00:03:15.049> with

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
you tap the trigger you know even with

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.250 
you tap the trigger you know even with
the<00:03:15.260> silencer<00:03:15.829> it's<00:03:16.359> based<00:03:17.359> off<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.630> gun<00:03:17.810> now

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
the silencer it's based off a gun now

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.420 
the silencer it's based off a gun now
this<00:03:18.440> my<00:03:18.680> favorite<00:03:19.190> set<00:03:19.910> up<00:03:20.030> it's<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:21.319> AK<00:03:22.280> with

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
this my favorite set up it's the AK with

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.690 
this my favorite set up it's the AK with
the<00:03:22.519> EMP<00:03:22.940> launcher<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.950> boomer<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.430> got<00:03:25.609> the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
the EMP launcher and boomer you got the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.690 
the EMP launcher and boomer you got the
proximity<00:03:26.000> launcher<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:27.160> my<00:03:28.160> opinion<00:03:28.579> this

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
proximity launcher and my opinion this

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.430 
proximity launcher and my opinion this
is<00:03:28.810> one<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:30.019> most<00:03:30.170> versatile<00:03:31.540> setups<00:03:32.540> you

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
is one of the most versatile setups you

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.430 
is one of the most versatile setups you
can<00:03:33.709> have

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
can have

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.560 
can have
because<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.340> have<00:03:36.370> an<00:03:36.580> assault<00:03:36.910> rifle<00:03:37.000> that

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
because you have an assault rifle that

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.630 
because you have an assault rifle that
kills<00:03:38.320> real<00:03:38.950> quick<00:03:39.480> close<00:03:40.480> range<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:42.010> doesn't

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
kills real quick close range it doesn't

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.460 
kills real quick close range it doesn't
really<00:03:42.790> need<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.420> steady<00:03:43.900> aim<00:03:44.050> to<00:03:44.290> kill

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
really need the steady aim to kill

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.770 
really need the steady aim to kill
people<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:45.160> long<00:03:45.610> range<00:03:45.820> as<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.180> as<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.450> see

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
people a long range as you as you see

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.940 
people a long range as you as you see
here<00:03:47.080> and<00:03:48.780> yeah<00:03:49.780> this<00:03:50.020> is<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.290> setup<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.710> used

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
here and yeah this is the setup I used

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.270 
here and yeah this is the setup I used
for<00:03:51.250> ground<00:03:51.730> control<00:03:52.210> because<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.080> many

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
for ground control because of so many

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.750 
for ground control because of so many
vehicles<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:56.020> as<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.560> see<00:03:56.740> here<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.100> EMP

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
vehicles and as you see here the EMP

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.230 
vehicles and as you see here the EMP
launcher<00:03:58.210> is<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:59.170> must<00:03:59.680> for<00:04:00.310> ground<00:04:00.730> control<00:04:01.120> if

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
launcher is a must for ground control if

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.570 
launcher is a must for ground control if
you're<00:04:01.360> playing<00:04:01.540> ground<00:04:02.080> control<00:04:02.530> I<00:04:02.740> mean

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
you're playing ground control I mean

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.730 
you're playing ground control I mean
there's<00:04:04.210> so<00:04:04.390> many<00:04:04.510> hungries<00:04:05.020> especially<00:04:05.680> in

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
there's so many hungries especially in

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.200 
there's so many hungries especially in
the<00:04:05.800> beginning<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.400> match<00:04:06.550> trying<00:04:06.940> to<00:04:07.060> get

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
the beginning of the match trying to get

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.960 
the beginning of the match trying to get
the<00:04:07.420> objectives<00:04:07.960> though<00:04:08.770> EMP<00:04:09.460> lingerie<00:04:09.880> or

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
the objectives though EMP lingerie or

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.480 
the objectives though EMP lingerie or
EMP<00:04:10.210> launcher<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:12.900> seashore<00:04:13.900> basically

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
EMP launcher and the seashore basically

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.170 
EMP launcher and the seashore basically
so<00:04:15.490> that<00:04:16.359> combo<00:04:16.870> is<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:18.130> very<00:04:18.280> deadly<00:04:18.700> against

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
so that combo is is very deadly against

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.440 
so that combo is is very deadly against
zombies<00:04:19.750> piranhas<00:04:20.739> not<00:04:21.549> so<00:04:21.730> much<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.030> tanks

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
zombies piranhas not so much the tanks

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.470 
zombies piranhas not so much the tanks
but<00:04:22.800> here<00:04:23.800> again<00:04:23.890> you<00:04:24.070> see<00:04:24.310> how<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.490> should

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
but here again you see how I should

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.600 
but here again you see how I should
people<00:04:25.690> across<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.230> map<00:04:26.440> i'm<00:04:26.680> not<00:04:26.890> using

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
people across the map i'm not using

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.060 
people across the map i'm not using
steady<00:04:28.210> aim<00:04:28.390> right<00:04:28.570> now<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:29.320> boomer<00:04:29.740> and

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
steady aim right now that boomer and

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.490 
steady aim right now that boomer and
still<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.150> see<00:04:31.360> how<00:04:31.510> paul<00:04:31.870> Getty<00:04:32.140> there's

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
still you see how paul Getty there's

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.240 
still you see how paul Getty there's
that<00:04:32.650> are<00:04:32.800> at<00:04:33.400> range<00:04:34.290> so<00:04:35.290> yeah<00:04:35.860> this<00:04:36.070> is

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
that are at range so yeah this is

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.380 
that are at range so yeah this is
probably<00:04:36.640> my<00:04:36.970> my<00:04:37.510> best<00:04:37.780> my<00:04:38.380> favorite<00:04:39.270> set<00:04:40.270> up

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
probably my my best my favorite set up

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.240 
probably my my best my favorite set up
especially<00:04:40.720> from<00:04:41.200> playing<00:04:41.970> ground<00:04:42.970> control

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
especially from playing ground control

good<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:04.530> again<00:05:05.530> here<00:05:05.830> EMP<00:05:06.310> launcher<00:05:08.100> get<00:05:09.100> a

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
good and again here EMP launcher get a

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.250 
good and again here EMP launcher get a
triple<00:05:09.760> with<00:05:10.680> your<00:05:11.680> c4<00:05:12.930> something<00:05:13.930> you<00:05:14.020> want

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
triple with your c4 something you want

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.930 
triple with your c4 something you want
to<00:05:14.380> use<00:05:14.860> against<00:05:15.430> teams<00:05:16.270> that<00:05:16.419> are<00:05:17.940> spamming

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
to use against teams that are spamming

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.420 
to use against teams that are spamming
the<00:05:19.300> Humvees<00:05:20.140> and<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:20.560> piranhas<00:05:21.160> and<00:05:21.310> all

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
the Humvees and the piranhas and all

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.800 
the Humvees and the piranhas and all
that<00:05:21.610> stuff<00:05:22.140> again<00:05:23.140> here<00:05:23.470> you<00:05:23.560> see<00:05:23.830> with<00:05:24.100> a

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
that stuff again here you see with a

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.220 
that stuff again here you see with a
slow<00:05:26.280> rate<00:05:27.280> of<00:05:27.340> fire<00:05:27.490> you<00:05:27.850> can<00:05:28.030> shoot<00:05:28.960> two

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
slow rate of fire you can shoot two

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.030 
slow rate of fire you can shoot two
three<00:05:29.470> people<00:05:29.830> at<00:05:29.950> a<00:05:29.980> time

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
three people at a time

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.940 
three people at a time
so<00:05:31.960> having<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:33.020> high<00:05:33.170> rate<00:05:33.380> of<00:05:33.410> fire<00:05:33.530> is<00:05:33.680> not

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
so having a high rate of fire is not

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.680 
so having a high rate of fire is not
necessarily<00:05:34.370> a<00:05:34.520> good<00:05:34.760> thing<00:05:34.820> because<00:05:35.270> you<00:05:35.540> run

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
necessarily a good thing because you run

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.780 
necessarily a good thing because you run
out<00:05:35.840> of<00:05:35.870> our<00:05:36.080> more<00:05:36.200> quickly<00:05:36.440> but<00:05:37.250> with<00:05:37.700> this

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
out of our more quickly but with this

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.330 
out of our more quickly but with this
gun<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:38.450> don't<00:05:38.660> don't<00:05:39.050> need<00:05:39.170> to<00:05:39.380> worry<00:05:40.190> about

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
gun you don't don't need to worry about

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.630 
gun you don't don't need to worry about
that<00:05:40.550> and<00:05:41.030> again<00:05:41.300> EMP<00:05:41.810> launcher<00:05:42.310> here<00:05:43.310> on<00:05:43.430> our

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
that and again EMP launcher here on our

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.060 
that and again EMP launcher here on our
no<00:05:43.790> chance<00:05:44.090> whatsoever<00:05:44.360> I<00:05:45.110> think<00:05:45.650> it's<00:05:45.800> too

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
no chance whatsoever I think it's too

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.070 
no chance whatsoever I think it's too
anyway<00:05:46.880> I<00:05:46.910> think<00:05:47.180> it's<00:05:47.270> two<00:05:47.480> rockets<00:05:47.900> with<00:05:48.050> a

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
anyway I think it's two rockets with a

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.740 
anyway I think it's two rockets with a
proximity<00:05:48.980> launcher<00:05:49.520> to<00:05:49.700> finish<00:05:50.570> off<00:05:50.720> a

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
proximity launcher to finish off a

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.380 
proximity launcher to finish off a
piranha<00:05:51.230> for<00:05:51.890> those<00:05:52.010> who<00:05:52.040> don't<00:05:52.250> know<00:05:52.370> you<00:05:53.240> can

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
piranha for those who don't know you can

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.930 
piranha for those who don't know you can
even<00:05:53.540> be<00:05:53.750> helicopters<00:05:54.380> so<00:05:55.540> NP<00:05:56.540> 1<00:05:57.080> to<00:05:57.230> 2<00:05:57.410> rakats

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
even be helicopters so NP 1 to 2 rakats

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.790 
even be helicopters so NP 1 to 2 rakats
especially<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.120> the<00:05:59.420> small<00:05:59.800> helicopters

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
especially the the small helicopters

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.480 
especially the the small helicopters
don't<00:06:00.980> remember<00:06:01.190> what<00:06:01.310> they<00:06:01.400> called<00:06:03.340> they<00:06:04.340> are

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
don't remember what they called they are

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.010 
don't remember what they called they are
definitely<00:06:04.790> I<00:06:05.090> think<00:06:05.150> I<00:06:05.420> think<00:06:05.630> that<00:06:05.750> two

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
definitely I think I think that two

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.760 
definitely I think I think that two
rockets<00:06:06.860> maximum<00:06:07.660> and<00:06:08.660> they<00:06:09.050> need<00:06:09.230> to<00:06:09.380> stay

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
rockets maximum and they need to stay

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.720 
rockets maximum and they need to stay
still<00:06:10.100> in<00:06:10.280> order<00:06:10.490> to<00:06:10.610> shoot<00:06:11.470> people<00:06:12.470> so<00:06:12.950> it's

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
still in order to shoot people so it's

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.860 
still in order to shoot people so it's
easier<00:06:14.120> to<00:06:14.240> hit<00:06:14.360> you<00:06:14.510> need<00:06:14.660> to<00:06:14.780> leave<00:06:15.500> your<00:06:15.800> EMP

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
easier to hit you need to leave your EMP

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.950 
easier to hit you need to leave your EMP
grenade<00:06:17.870> just<00:06:18.140> a<00:06:18.260> bit<00:06:18.440> and<00:06:18.790> then<00:06:19.870> they're<00:06:20.870> as

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
grenade just a bit and then they're as

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.120 
grenade just a bit and then they're as
good<00:06:21.110> as<00:06:21.170> dead<00:06:21.880> so<00:06:22.880> yeah<00:06:23.690> guys<00:06:23.900> this<00:06:24.740> was<00:06:24.950> the
