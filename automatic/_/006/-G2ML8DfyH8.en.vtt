00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:04.489

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.870
 Hey 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.999
 Van Persie 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.670
 roj 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.280

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.280
 come to the desk 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
 it is throughout the village 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.560
 almost all of them are far too long there 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.700
 they all had the land 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.070
 quite a few 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.030
 but were even harder 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.030
 the market 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.340
 it is impressive 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 in their forties 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 I am very happy that Cohen is the neighbor 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.659
 then the caterpillars get 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.449
 the purple clothes 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.449

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.309
 caterpillar to lead 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.309

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.149
 but we have earlier this week 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.729

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:33.089
 we can do no more 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.939
 no of course not 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.029
 however, the hundreds of millions of euros in the stable are not successful 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:42.029
 politically inappropriate 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.489
 we don't have it there 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.399
 we can last 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.770
 of course we can suddenly have them over 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.809
 a river crib striking appearance there were by car 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.799
