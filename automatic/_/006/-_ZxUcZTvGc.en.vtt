00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.559
 broken dream talking about the championship and it is 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.700
 this is the first thing that that 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.179
 I would like to ask the coach of 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.000
 Naples 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.820
 then there is obviously francesca francesca 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.230
 sanipoli is over here today this one 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.670
 dream this hope walter i don't know 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 I have always been down to earth ho 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.289
 always worked I didn't think dreams a 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.670
 so many things that I know there are still 30 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.920
 points today went wrong we have 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.750
 countries 3 we will try to get more into 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.969
 high possible to do the maximum like 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.309
 we have always promised by four 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.739
 years now 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.030
 francesca rai and drain I wanted to say 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.770
 to the coach who within a month and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.149
 half the Naples has passed into practice 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.590
 from the team that was scary 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.079
 juventus to the team that must have 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.940
 fear of Milan and I would not say so 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.010
 putting myself in his shoes that image 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.750
 of cavani who misses a penalty 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.180
 five games with today you are without 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.800
 mark may be the image together 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.690
 with the end of the juventus with the goal 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.190
 Giaccherini in recovery as 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.080
 the fatah ended up with this championship 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.430
 the fatal Verona has now become fatal 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.960
 for naples also because also the year 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.729
 last if I'm not wrong left here 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.439
 are three consecutive years for the truth 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.830
 were his powers he loses to 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.540
 verona 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.729
 last victory at the last victory 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.290
 in 2010 but this was the other question 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.290
 who wants to do to the mister only that he was there 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.299
 we make it as you have done 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.360
 7 together a little 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.700
 I don't know where to start anyway, I believe 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.730
 that all those considerations I have 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.170
 even now we have not heard from you 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.060
 the press can do that 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.190
 who want us we have always said 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.840
 things that the president owned himself 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.640
 we are still spoken of 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.740
 seconds we still have ten finals from 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.810
 at the end we will draw the sums 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.160
 all the rest does not concern us here a 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.350
 About what I was asking 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.810
 first in 2010 the last victory of the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.500
 naples here at the bentegodi marked denis 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.930
 and lavezzi 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.430
 seeing what he's doing lavezzi 5 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.140
 4 goals in five Champions League matches 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.300
 league with paris saint germain this 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.450
 this image sometimes comes to her 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.460
 in mind as your own flash 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.680
 of the news if I had if it were not 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.750
 part of my vocabulary we leave 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.220
 lose now there is this rose on these 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.020
 guys that give me the best they have 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.640
 all broken because they lost 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.110
 I will try to recharge them to make one 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.880
 great game of the room between all the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.740
 rest is not a time to talk from 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.450
 enrico we talk for a moment but then 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.660
 of current events and we are talking about cavani that 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.400
 does not score from 545 minutes in the league and 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.810
 if we put the other two games with the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.430
 a victory and nobody even more 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.150
 today he failed even from the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.860
 But you got an idea, diskette 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.210
 in sincerity of what happened to 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.100
 this player here we see just the 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.380
 his last league goal against the 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.260
 parma that seems a bit we say with the 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.900
 deflated wheels we can that so a 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.610
 beware of seeing just one 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.230
 game in which we created less than 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.850
 today and scored goals 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.860
 today he had the rigor I think 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.630
 the most sensational opportunity is a rigor 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.120
 for a player if he has not entered today 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.670
 we understand that there is a moment like this 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.739
 the negativity that as life is 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.780
 so you do things to the fullest the 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.790
 boy is fine and does not enter the 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.970
 ball in it wants us to unlock 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.640
 come a ball maybe even so that 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.560
 go in strangely and then 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.090
 let's leave again, he won't leave too 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.250
 the top scorer is always a problem 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.870
 of the championship on that mistake there is one 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.130
 abel balbo's question is a consideration 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.730
 a question that will kill me if not 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.040
 other 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.320
 good evening congratulations because 53 points 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.570
 I think there are many but I sincerely 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.610
 23 weeks ago I am a little left 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.890
 listening to the president de laurentiis 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.170
 when I said that line we are 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.260
 at the Napoli mazzarri very good though 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.290
 according to me at a given time 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.640
 so important where you are struggling for 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.530
 win the scudetto 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.920
 I see a great feeling between her 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.590
 the team and maybe the president there 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.060
 will have to save a joke that 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.230
 shows that there is perhaps not all this 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.709
 this feeling 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.540
 I don't think that's probably me 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.400
 extrapolated from a speech indeed 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.680
 I thanked the president 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.540
 publicly that he was alone 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.920
 appreciations towards me also 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.080
 before the game the juventus only 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.030
 felt with my ears so not 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.640
 there are these problems is a relationship 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.000
 great as now maybe there never was 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.160
 before 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.270
 I can tell you so it has nothing to do with it 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.840
 nothing the relationship between me and the 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.610
 president 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.780
 precisely because of this go away from the last one 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.400
 which I ask you then we leave you 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.160
 obviously go to the last question of 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.390
 francesca sanipoli all these rumors about 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.950
 what the future may be and 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.690
 renewal that then also have 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.640
 fed as right then i 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.740
 journalists must also make assumptions about 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.140
 in other words, if a bit too 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.340
 seen a kind of encirclement 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.080
 critic against Naples, not 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.880
 however, they could be somehow 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.770
 overcome if one clearly said then 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.100
 what the future will be is obviously 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.200
 the question is asked then had you 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.120
 that you are also following the fate of 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.800
 naples even before i arrived the 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.169
 napoli di de laurentiis and never has 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.940
 made a fine multi-year contract up 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.770
 I didn't reach you at all 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.169
 the years expired no one spoke 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.320
 but and everything was fine I don't understand 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.270
 because if once by mutual agreement 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.070
 since it was expiring myself later 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.960
 many years of career I say 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.570
 we wait for the end and we meet with 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.630
 great serenity what changes none of it 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.660
 suffers and absolutely only a fact 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.370
 yours that you have to embroider and that yes 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.400
 must do this is really me at 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.020
 team doesn't go all this does n't matter to us 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.229
 disk the used canvas instead says but 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.630
 no one is here those present do not embroider us 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.400
 absolutely answer me why when 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.410
 there was reja that we are not so naples 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.240
 no one talked about this question though 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.160
 is what I think legitimate to do 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.690
 if you think this may have affected the 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.039
 team performance said no 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.560
 and we take note of everything here 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:39.160
 absolutely and categorically I can 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.810
 to guarantee 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.600
 the last act of francesca sanipoli e 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.060
 then we say goodbye to walter mazzarri yes 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.700
 I wanted to ask the coach 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.320
 beyond the speech on the goalkeeper who 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.910
 today he had two let's say injuries 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.370
 we have seen the defense of Naples today 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.760
 certainly down there were certainly 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.590
 important absentees but look at the 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.300
 game two throws two goals two throws and 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.169
 in fact there was an opportunity to 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.880
 head of paloschi 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.790
 here's what we did 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.800
 today it is written in football is lost 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.760
 look at the ball possession look at that 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.830
 led the tender 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.370
 she believes it is up to cannes cese 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.030
 together of these fate francesca 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.169
 moments that we will have few pictures for 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.669
 depict what will really be one 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.630
 tragedy what they said of the del 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:25.530
 naples to invite to call at 45599 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.600
 must be done to 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.690
 immediately restore what was 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.460
 destroyed was one of the most beautiful things 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.620
 that there were in Naples that there are in 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.510
 napoli va must do everything in 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.430
 all ways of restoring to 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.470
 sooner this is what I feel 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:44.810
 to tell everyone thanks thanks to walter 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.810
 mazzarri and we say goodbye let's move on
