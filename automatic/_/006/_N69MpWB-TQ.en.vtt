00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
that strong but I think for only my

this<00:01:02.290> volume<00:01:02.860> and<00:01:03.100> I<00:01:03.430> think<00:01:03.760> I'll<00:01:03.970> be<00:01:04.180> able<00:01:04.329> to

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
this volume and I think I'll be able to

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.609 
this volume and I think I'll be able to
get<00:01:04.869> to<00:01:05.350> working<00:01:06.250> sets<00:01:06.610> in<00:01:06.909> the<00:01:07.210> 135<00:01:08.200> pound

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
get to working sets in the 135 pound

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.029 
get to working sets in the 135 pound
range<00:01:09.210> relatively<00:01:10.210> quickly<00:01:10.539> I'm<00:01:11.229> confident

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
range relatively quickly I'm confident

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.010 
range relatively quickly I'm confident
in<00:01:12.159> that<00:01:12.189> just<00:01:12.579> because<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:13.119> tend<00:01:13.689> to<00:01:13.810> be<00:01:13.990> a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
in that just because I tend to be a

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.690 
in that just because I tend to be a
little<00:01:14.170> bit<00:01:14.319> stronger<00:01:14.619> impressing<00:01:15.340> that<00:01:15.369> I<00:01:15.549> am

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
little bit stronger impressing that I am

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.739 
little bit stronger impressing that I am
in<00:01:15.819> other<00:01:15.969> things<00:01:16.469> I<00:01:17.469> have<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:18.490> decent<00:01:18.789> like<00:01:19.539> for

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:19.749 
in other things I have a decent like for

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:21.330 
in other things I have a decent like for
my<00:01:19.840> body<00:01:20.049> weight<00:01:20.319> I<00:01:20.560> think<00:01:20.770> my<00:01:20.889> bench<00:01:21.130> has

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
my body weight I think my bench has

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.300 
my body weight I think my bench has
always<00:01:21.579> been<00:01:21.729> decent<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.439> things<00:01:24.130> like

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
always been decent and things like

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.129 
always been decent and things like
dumbbell<00:01:24.759> dumbbell<00:01:25.299> pressing<00:01:25.749> incline

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:26.139 
dumbbell dumbbell pressing incline

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:28.739 
dumbbell dumbbell pressing incline
dumbbell<00:01:26.499> pressing<00:01:26.920> I'm<00:01:27.039> okay<00:01:27.429> at<00:01:27.639> so<00:01:28.270> I<00:01:28.299> don't

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
dumbbell pressing I'm okay at so I don't

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:30.179 
dumbbell pressing I'm okay at so I don't
see<00:01:29.079> this<00:01:29.229> as<00:01:29.409> a<00:01:29.439> movement<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:29.889> I'll<00:01:30.069> have

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
see this as a movement that I'll have

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.800 
see this as a movement that I'll have
too<00:01:30.429> much<00:01:30.579> trouble<00:01:30.880> progressing<00:01:31.479> but<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.659> lot

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
too much trouble progressing but a lot

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.789 
too much trouble progressing but a lot
of<00:01:31.840> people<00:01:31.929> do<00:01:32.350> say<00:01:32.619> oh<00:01:32.649> HP<00:01:33.280> is<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.670> toughest

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
of people do say oh HP is the toughest

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.580 
of people do say oh HP is the toughest
compound<00:01:35.799> which<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:36.280> arguable<00:01:36.909> but<00:01:37.179> I<00:01:37.450> can<00:01:38.380> see

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
compound which is arguable but I can see

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.169 
compound which is arguable but I can see
why<00:01:38.679> somebody<00:01:38.979> would<00:01:39.039> say<00:01:39.249> that<00:01:39.429> the<00:01:39.579> form<00:01:39.909> is

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
why somebody would say that the form is

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.940 
why somebody would say that the form is
definitely<00:01:40.749> a<00:01:40.780> constant<00:01:41.289> battle<00:01:41.380> I'm<00:01:41.679> trying

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
definitely a constant battle I'm trying

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.859 
definitely a constant battle I'm trying
to<00:01:42.009> keep<00:01:42.159> my<00:01:42.219> head<00:01:42.369> forward<00:01:43.149> at<00:01:43.359> the<00:01:43.600> top<00:01:43.840> of

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
to keep my head forward at the top of

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.169 
to keep my head forward at the top of
the<00:01:44.229> movement<00:01:44.439> as<00:01:44.709> you<00:01:44.799> see<00:01:45.069> not<00:01:45.609> really<00:01:45.939> lean

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
the movement as you see not really lean

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:47.550 
the movement as you see not really lean
back<00:01:46.450> because<00:01:46.719> I<00:01:46.779> don't<00:01:46.959> want<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.170> put<00:01:47.319> a<00:01:47.350> ton

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
back because I don't want to put a ton

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.749 
back because I don't want to put a ton
of<00:01:47.590> pressure<00:01:47.889> on<00:01:48.069> my<00:01:48.279> lower<00:01:48.429> back<00:01:48.549> but

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
of pressure on my lower back but

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.300 
of pressure on my lower back but
basically<00:01:49.450> that's<00:01:50.439> how<00:01:50.590> my<00:01:50.770> progressions

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
basically that's how my progressions

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.760 
basically that's how my progressions
going<00:01:51.670> doing<00:01:52.389> the<00:01:52.539> five<00:01:52.749> by<00:01:52.929> seven<00:01:52.959> here<00:01:53.590> and

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
going doing the five by seven here and

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.830 
going doing the five by seven here and
yeah<00:01:54.399> some<00:01:54.639> of<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.789> reps<00:01:54.999> are<00:01:55.149> grinders<00:01:55.630> but

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
yeah some of the reps are grinders but

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.719 
yeah some of the reps are grinders but
that's<00:01:56.020> just<00:01:56.170> kind<00:01:56.409> of<00:01:56.469> how<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:56.649> train<00:01:57.009> guys<00:01:57.279> if

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
that's just kind of how I train guys if

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.179 
that's just kind of how I train guys if
I<00:01:58.270> find<00:01:58.569> that<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.170> grinders<00:01:59.619> are<00:01:59.740> keeping<00:02:00.099> me

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
I find that the grinders are keeping me

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.309 
I find that the grinders are keeping me
from<00:02:00.279> progressing<00:02:00.969> of<00:02:01.420> course<00:02:01.749> I'll<00:02:02.049> take

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
from progressing of course I'll take

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.410 
from progressing of course I'll take
them<00:02:02.469> out<00:02:02.649> but<00:02:03.039> that's<00:02:03.759> just<00:02:03.880> basically<00:02:04.179> I've

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
them out but that's just basically I've

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.190 
them out but that's just basically I've
been<00:02:04.569> doing<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:06.490> might<00:02:07.060> lower<00:02:07.509> down<00:02:07.959> to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
been doing it and I might lower down to

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.139 
been doing it and I might lower down to
a<00:02:08.229> five<00:02:08.530> by<00:02:08.709> five<00:02:08.920> from<00:02:09.220> here<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.520> there<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.940> try

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
a five by five from here to there to try

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.300 
a five by five from here to there to try
to<00:02:10.179> get<00:02:10.390> more<00:02:10.569> weight<00:02:10.810> up<00:02:11.020> but<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:11.980> was<00:02:12.100> that

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
to get more weight up but that was that

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.760 
to get more weight up but that was that
work<00:02:12.490> out<00:02:12.730> along<00:02:13.240> with<00:02:13.270> some<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:14.020> bunch<00:02:14.680> of

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
work out along with some a bunch of

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.059 
work out along with some a bunch of
hypertrophy<00:02:15.400> stuff<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.910> then

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
hypertrophy stuff and then

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.890 
hypertrophy stuff and then
that<00:02:16.370> nice<00:02:16.609> chipotle<00:02:17.120> burrito<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.659> baked

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
that nice chipotle burrito that I baked

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.520 
that nice chipotle burrito that I baked
in<00:02:18.049> the<00:02:18.079> oven<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.499> course<00:02:19.239> after<00:02:20.239> this<00:02:20.989> day<00:02:21.319> we

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
in the oven of course after this day we

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.860 
in the oven of course after this day we
had<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.859> legs<00:02:22.069> day<00:02:22.400> as<00:02:23.299> you<00:02:23.480> know<00:02:23.629> I'm<00:02:23.749> on

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870

chest back Delta arms legs repeat and
then<00:02:26.749> my<00:02:26.930> off<00:02:27.079> day<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:27.379> six<00:02:27.769> days<00:02:28.010> split<00:02:28.370> and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
then my off day so six days split and

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.170 
then my off day so six days split and
this<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.079> my<00:02:30.319> deadlift<00:02:30.709> day<00:02:30.920> first<00:02:31.340> time<00:02:31.790> doing

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
this is my deadlift day first time doing

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.379 
this is my deadlift day first time doing
deadlifts<00:02:32.569> guys<00:02:32.870> since<00:02:33.859> I<00:02:34.400> don't<00:02:34.969> even<00:02:35.180> know

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
deadlifts guys since I don't even know

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.599 
deadlifts guys since I don't even know
last<00:02:35.840> October<00:02:36.560> probably<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.159> even<00:02:37.370> then<00:02:37.579> I

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
last October probably and even then I

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.720 
last October probably and even then I
wasn't<00:02:37.969> much<00:02:38.510> higher<00:02:38.810> than<00:02:39.159> working<00:02:40.159> sets<00:02:40.609> of

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
wasn't much higher than working sets of

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.110 
wasn't much higher than working sets of
275<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:42.019> did<00:02:42.859> not<00:02:42.889> feel<00:02:43.340> natural<00:02:43.609> to<00:02:43.879> me

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
275 so this did not feel natural to me

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.119 
275 so this did not feel natural to me
at<00:02:44.209> all<00:02:44.299> I<00:02:44.689> have<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:44.930> lot<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.260> work<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.769> do<00:02:45.889> on<00:02:46.099> my

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
at all I have a lot of work to do on my

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.789 
at all I have a lot of work to do on my
form<00:02:46.549> especially<00:02:46.790> looking<00:02:47.269> back<00:02:47.689> I'm<00:02:48.230> seeing

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
form especially looking back I'm seeing

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.349 
form especially looking back I'm seeing
things<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.099> I<00:02:49.159> didn't<00:02:49.519> notice<00:02:49.849> at<00:02:50.000> all<00:02:50.030> when

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
things that I didn't notice at all when

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:51.699 
things that I didn't notice at all when
I<00:02:50.389> was<00:02:50.569> looking<00:02:50.840> in<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.019> mirror<00:02:51.049> watching

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
I was looking in the mirror watching

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.800 
I was looking in the mirror watching
myself<00:02:51.859> which<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.909> probably<00:02:53.209> shouldn't<00:02:53.719> have

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
myself which I probably shouldn't have

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.500 
myself which I probably shouldn't have
been<00:02:53.900> doing<00:02:54.019> for<00:02:54.290> forms<00:02:54.590> sake<00:02:54.799> as<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.189> is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
been doing for forms sake as it is

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.059 
been doing for forms sake as it is
there's<00:02:56.510> some<00:02:56.659> lower<00:02:56.840> background<00:02:57.469> in<00:02:57.680> here

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
there's some lower background in here

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.129 
there's some lower background in here
there's<00:02:58.370> just<00:02:58.639> my<00:02:59.180> hips<00:02:59.419> are<00:02:59.599> shooting<00:02:59.959> up<00:03:00.019> at

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
there's just my hips are shooting up at

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.020 
there's just my hips are shooting up at
the<00:03:00.199> wrong<00:03:00.349> time<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.769> just<00:03:01.099> there's<00:03:01.669> tons<00:03:01.849> of

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
the wrong time I just there's tons of

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.550 
the wrong time I just there's tons of
things<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.359> I'm<00:03:02.449> doing<00:03:02.480> incorrectly<00:03:03.019> but

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
things that I'm doing incorrectly but

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.559 
things that I'm doing incorrectly but
conventional<00:03:04.519> has<00:03:04.699> always<00:03:05.030> felt<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.540> little

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
conventional has always felt a little

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.240 
conventional has always felt a little
bit<00:03:05.959> better<00:03:06.139> than<00:03:06.319> sumo<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.829> me<00:03:06.949> so<00:03:07.099> I'll

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
bit better than sumo to me so I'll

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.800 
bit better than sumo to me so I'll
probably<00:03:07.549> stay<00:03:07.879> with<00:03:08.030> conventional<00:03:09.400> unless

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
probably stay with conventional unless

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.479 
probably stay with conventional unless
for<00:03:11.810> some<00:03:11.840> reason<00:03:12.040> sumo<00:03:13.040> starts<00:03:13.310> feeling

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
for some reason sumo starts feeling

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.729 
for some reason sumo starts feeling
better<00:03:13.639> when<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:14.540> start<00:03:14.840> progressing<00:03:14.959> which<00:03:15.530> I

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
better when I start progressing which I

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.589 
better when I start progressing which I
don't<00:03:15.859> think<00:03:16.069> it<00:03:16.340> will<00:03:16.489> but<00:03:16.819> i<00:03:17.060> like<00:03:17.480> how

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
don't think it will but i like how

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.539 
don't think it will but i like how
conventional<00:03:17.930> is<00:03:18.469> able<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.799> hit<00:03:18.919> the<00:03:19.099> lower

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
conventional is able to hit the lower

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.300 
conventional is able to hit the lower
back<00:03:19.849> I<00:03:20.269> hate<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.229> pit<00:03:21.439> the<00:03:21.590> back<00:03:21.769> as<00:03:22.009> a<00:03:22.040> whole

well so from a muscle building

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.860 
well so from a muscle building
standpoint<00:03:28.159> I'm<00:03:28.639> utilizing<00:03:29.359> the<00:03:29.449> deadlift

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
standpoint I'm utilizing the deadlift

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.170 
standpoint I'm utilizing the deadlift
just<00:03:30.049> as<00:03:30.139> much<00:03:30.290> as<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:30.620> want<00:03:31.009> to<00:03:31.250> increase<00:03:31.909> my

just as much as I want to increase my

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.420 
just as much as I want to increase my
strength<00:03:32.449> at<00:03:32.780> this<00:03:33.019> movement<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.709> I<00:03:34.189> really

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
strength at this movement and I really

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.979 
strength at this movement and I really
just<00:03:34.459> see<00:03:34.759> it<00:03:34.879> as<00:03:34.970> an<00:03:35.090> overall<00:03:35.540> perfect

just see it as an overall perfect
movement<00:03:36.620> for<00:03:37.280> beginners<00:03:38.269> intermediate

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
movement for beginners intermediate

progression on this i was doing five

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.199 
progression on this i was doing five
sets<00:03:50.569> of<00:03:50.900> seven<00:03:51.229> reps<00:03:51.620> on<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:51.919> day<00:03:52.129> again<00:03:52.729> a

sets of seven reps on this day again a
little<00:03:53.599> bit<00:03:53.689> higher<00:03:53.989> on<00:03:54.229> the<00:03:54.319> reps<00:03:54.530> especially

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
little bit higher on the reps especially

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.559 
little bit higher on the reps especially
for<00:03:55.159> something<00:03:55.280> like<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.489> deadlift<00:03:55.909> so<00:03:56.120> i<00:03:56.150> might

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
for something like a deadlift so i might

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.020 
for something like a deadlift so i might
i'm<00:03:57.199> almost<00:03:57.650> likely<00:03:58.310> get<00:03:58.489> down<00:03:58.699> into<00:03:58.909> the

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
i'm almost likely get down into the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.670 
i'm almost likely get down into the
three<00:03:59.239> to<00:03:59.329> five<00:03:59.509> rep<00:03:59.780> range<00:04:00.019> on<00:04:00.139> a<00:04:00.169> lot<00:04:00.379> of<00:04:00.500> days

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
three to five rep range on a lot of days

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.800 
three to five rep range on a lot of days
because<00:04:01.129> this<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.489> my<00:04:01.639> main<00:04:01.819> compound<00:04:02.389> for<00:04:02.659> leg

day<00:04:03.049> and<00:04:03.290> i<00:04:03.829> typically<00:04:04.340> go<00:04:04.459> higher<00:04:04.879> rep<00:04:05.239> on

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:05.479 
day and i typically go higher rep on

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.379 
day and i typically go higher rep on
things<00:04:05.870> after<00:04:06.109> my<00:04:06.590> compounds<00:04:07.280> like<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:08.269> know

see<00:04:29.770> in<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.950> past<00:04:30.300> I've<00:04:31.300> gotten<00:04:31.720> decent

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
see in the past I've gotten decent

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.129 
see in the past I've gotten decent
volume<00:04:32.380> on<00:04:32.830> back<00:04:33.340> squats<00:04:33.730> for<00:04:33.910> weight<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.960> 25

for<00:04:35.710> four<00:04:35.919> sets<00:04:36.160> of<00:04:36.250> 10<00:04:36.460> so<00:04:36.669> I'm<00:04:36.940> pretty

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
for four sets of 10 so I'm pretty

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.510 
for four sets of 10 so I'm pretty
confident<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:38.050> we'll<00:04:38.139> come<00:04:38.350> back

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
squad up to around 3 15 and the decent

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.050 
squad up to around 3 15 and the decent
time<00:04:46.479> frame<00:04:46.840> but<00:04:47.530> all<00:04:47.860> in<00:04:48.130> all<00:04:48.280> that's<00:04:48.820> what

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
time frame but all in all that's what

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.740 
time frame but all in all that's what
I'm<00:04:49.180> doing<00:04:49.210> for<00:04:50.020> my<00:04:50.320> legs<00:04:50.830> in<00:04:51.250> this<00:04:51.850> video<00:04:52.210> I

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
think I also i actually ended up going

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.779 
terms of body weight feeling good I
don't<00:05:16.000> think<00:05:16.090> I<00:05:16.240> was<00:05:16.350> 155<00:05:17.350> these<00:05:18.070> clips<00:05:18.580> as

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
don't think I was 155 these clips as

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.050 
don't think I was 155 these clips as
probably<00:05:19.300> like<00:05:19.390> 152<00:05:20.080> but<00:05:20.979> I'm<00:05:21.550> feeling<00:05:21.940> good

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
probably like 152 but I'm feeling good

probably like 152 but I'm feeling good
guys<00:05:22.300> honestly<00:05:22.720> I<00:05:23.280> talked<00:05:24.280> about<00:05:24.430> reverse

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
guys honestly I talked about reverse

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.680 
guys honestly I talked about reverse
dieting<00:05:25.840> how<00:05:26.620> I<00:05:26.650> didn't<00:05:27.070> reverse<00:05:27.280> diet<00:05:27.669> if<00:05:28.000> I

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
dieting how I didn't reverse diet if I

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.390 
dieting how I didn't reverse diet if I
had<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:28.930> all<00:05:28.990> over<00:05:29.320> again<00:05:29.410> would<00:05:29.620> I<00:05:29.830> picked<00:05:30.280> a

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
had it all over again would I picked a

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.400 
had it all over again would I picked a
semi<00:05:30.820> more<00:05:31.060> optimal<00:05:31.450> approach<00:05:31.539> to<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.200> end<00:05:32.320> of

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
semi more optimal approach to the end of

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.290 
semi more optimal approach to the end of
my<00:05:32.470> prep<00:05:32.800> most<00:05:33.160> likely<00:05:33.640> but<00:05:33.880> i'll<00:05:34.000> probably

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
my prep most likely but i'll probably

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.880 
my prep most likely but i'll probably
touch<00:05:34.630> on<00:05:34.810> that<00:05:34.840> a<00:05:34.990> little<00:05:35.200> bit<00:05:35.380> more<00:05:35.590> in

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
touch on that a little bit more in

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.060 
touch on that a little bit more in
future<00:05:36.370> videos<00:05:36.669> right<00:05:37.360> now<00:05:37.419> though<00:05:37.979> what<00:05:38.979> I'm

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
future videos right now though what I'm

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.730 
future videos right now though what I'm
focusing<00:05:39.580> on<00:05:39.760> is<00:05:40.000> progressing<00:05:40.750> in<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.440> gym

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
focusing on is progressing in the gym

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.120 
focusing on is progressing in the gym
and<00:05:41.979> just<00:05:42.870> continuing<00:05:43.870> to<00:05:44.080> make<00:05:44.470> progress<00:05:44.500> and

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
and just continuing to make progress and

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.930 
and just continuing to make progress and
take<00:05:45.940> advantage<00:05:46.120> of<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:47.710> age<00:05:48.070> i'm<00:05:48.340> at<00:05:48.550> where

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
take advantage of the age i'm at where

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.170 
take advantage of the age i'm at where
I'm<00:05:49.389> really<00:05:50.020> primed<00:05:50.560> to<00:05:50.919> make<00:05:51.520> gains<00:05:51.789> and

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
I'm really primed to make gains and

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.950 
I'm really primed to make gains and
really<00:05:53.139> what<00:05:53.410> I<00:05:53.440> need<00:05:53.680> to<00:05:53.710> focus<00:05:53.950> on<00:05:54.340> is

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
really what I need to focus on is

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.080 
really what I need to focus on is
building<00:05:55.960> a<00:05:56.169> better<00:05:56.440> foundation<00:05:56.710> in<00:05:57.400> these

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
building a better foundation in these

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.390 
building a better foundation in these
next<00:05:58.330> few<00:05:58.510> years<00:05:58.600> so<00:05:59.530> that<00:05:59.800> when<00:06:00.039> I<00:06:00.070> do<00:06:00.190> decide

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
next few years so that when I do decide

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.120 
next few years so that when I do decide

to cut down again I have a little bit

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.240 
to cut down again I have a little bit
