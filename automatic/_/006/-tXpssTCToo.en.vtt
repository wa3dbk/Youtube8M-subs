so<00:04:18.890> I<00:04:19.780> would<00:04:20.780> recommend<00:04:20.810> using<00:04:21.410> the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
so I would recommend using the

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.900 
so I would recommend using the
controller<00:04:21.980> instead<00:04:22.280> of<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.460> keyboard<00:04:22.790> and

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
controller instead of the keyboard and

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.010 
controller instead of the keyboard and
mouse<00:04:23.060> because<00:04:23.420> you're<00:04:23.720> going<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.870> have<00:04:23.990> a

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
mouse because you're going to have a

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.430 
mouse because you're going to have a
little<00:04:24.170> bit<00:04:24.290> more<00:04:24.500> accuracy<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:27.170> kind<00:04:27.410> of

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
little bit more accuracy and you kind of

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.750 
little bit more accuracy and you kind of
feel<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.650> bullets<00:04:28.040> like<00:04:28.280> when<00:04:28.640> you're

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
feel the bullets like when you're

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.820
