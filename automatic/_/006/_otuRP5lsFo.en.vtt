00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.930
 Is everything okay with you? 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.160
 assembly that again and not this time 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.550
 it was talking about the graphics engine 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.869
 improved gta5 it is evident that gps 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.300
 button the best graphics engines 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.669
 Topicality the guys the game incredibly 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.730
 beautiful has the enviable distances 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.320
 40 minute details on your bugs right? 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.050
 but as the one of that size rich in 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.730
 details and even forgivable but had a 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.430
 item that was the subject of a complaint 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.770
 half world at the launch of gta 5 o 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.870
 Month system of vehicles 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.940
 seriously I've never seen so much black complaining 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.230
 of something when 18-year-old 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.750
 game launch 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.340
 I even understand the complaint knows in the gt4 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.590
 You have got used to us with a system 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.420
 also of a much more realistic 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.310
 You can give a little because driving with 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.240
 care did not touch turned a cake 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.390
 past right 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.340
 the fact is that 69 has not been improved alone 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.890
 that on the 5th the cars seem to be made of 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.870
 titanium or crashed into buses like this. 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.740
 miles per hour and only one flashlight 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.570
 broke 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.700
 it is said that the steering of the car 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.330
 also changed them more 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.280
 floor 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.320
 unlike the gta 4 of the car it seemed 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.200
 a soap in question the system of 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.060
 damage I prefer much more of the 4 gta I 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.780
 I do not understand why the galaxy changed him. 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.540
 I do not know if it was any incompatibility 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.520
 the new graphics system right I go on 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.050
 together with the system but ultimately to 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.540
 who continues it was integer in a 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.760
 3d universe with a little more knocks 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.770
 it's the madrid time change on the route is and it's 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.780
 thinking that a fan of the series 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.970
 programmer called model molds 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.280
 developed a mold to design a 5 with a 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.900
 gta damage system 4 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.710
 he recorded a video that shows this 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.450
 very well and people are very good 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.460
 he uses as a test several cars like 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.710
 for example fall out of test which is a 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.020
 compact in game based on toyota prius 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.380
 in the poor thing it turns to dust with this system to 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.380
 guys 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.520
 the blog 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.170
 the system has improved but has already 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.900
 far more faithful than his own 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.210
 gta5 galera during the fall of a car 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.640
 metal case that would take 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.500
 much more to happen today than 35 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.080
 portugal will arrive but well you need 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.550
 hit a lot more that makes me 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.780
 remember something nice that 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.450
 had in others in theory that 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.740
 simply rock is ignoring 35 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.930
 Does it intend in the future? 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.760
 improve some aspects in the physics of 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.280
 game as the damage system itself 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.440
 through some update then no 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.600
 I want you to find the best system 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.980
 of gta 5 damage or do you think gt4 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.510
 it would be better 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.880
