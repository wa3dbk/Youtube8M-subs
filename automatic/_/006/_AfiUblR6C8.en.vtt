00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
what's the good move here we'll just

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.480 
what's the good move here we'll just
drop<00:01:28.300> in<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.540> pawn<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:29.140> here<00:01:29.650> doesn't<00:01:30.190> do<00:01:30.310> any

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
drop in a pawn to here doesn't do any

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.030 
drop in a pawn to here doesn't do any
good<00:01:30.730> you<00:01:31.120> can<00:01:31.870> just<00:01:31.900> escape<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:35.530> answer

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
good you can just escape so the answer

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.000 
good you can just escape so the answer
here<00:01:36.070> is<00:01:36.430> dropping<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.150> pawn<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.810> here<00:01:38.230> for<00:01:38.710> E

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
here is dropping the pawn to here for E

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.400 
here is dropping the pawn to here for E
and<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:40.360> tactic<00:01:40.900> is<00:01:41.080> called<00:01:41.410> silver<00:01:42.280> pincer

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
and this tactic is called silver pincer

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.040 
and this tactic is called silver pincer
you<00:01:44.410> see<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.740> silver<00:01:45.070> can't<00:01:45.790> go<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.240> anywhere

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
you see the silver can't go to anywhere

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.050 
you see the silver can't go to anywhere
so<00:01:47.710> now<00:01:47.950> you're<00:01:48.190> threatening<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.730> drop

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
so now you're threatening to drop

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.310 
so now you're threatening to drop
another<00:01:49.480> pawn<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.230> here<00:01:50.920> 5f<00:01:51.760> and<00:01:52.200> capture<00:01:53.200> the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
another pawn to here 5f and capture the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.920 
another pawn to here 5f and capture the
silver<00:01:53.680> but<00:01:54.400> gotta<00:01:54.700> can't<00:01:55.120> do<00:01:55.270> anything<00:01:55.660> about

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
silver but gotta can't do anything about

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.920 
silver but gotta can't do anything about
it<00:01:56.050> will<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.890> be<00:01:57.040> careful<00:01:57.580> this<00:01:58.030> silver<00:01:58.420> pincer

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
it will it be careful this silver pincer

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.620 
it will it be careful this silver pincer
tactic<00:01:59.410> works<00:01:59.740> only<00:01:59.980> when<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:00.880> silver<00:02:01.420> is

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
tactic works only when the silver is

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.250 
tactic works only when the silver is
ahead<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.620> his<00:02:02.830> pawn<00:02:03.160> if<00:02:04.090> this<00:02:04.450> pawn<00:02:04.780> wasn't

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
ahead of his pawn if this pawn wasn't

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.370 
ahead of his pawn if this pawn wasn't
here<00:02:05.650> you<00:02:06.490> can<00:02:06.610> just<00:02:06.880> drop<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.300> pawn<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.990> here

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
here you can just drop the pawn to here

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.530 
here you can just drop the pawn to here
right<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:09.010> it<00:02:09.940> doesn't<00:02:10.270> work<00:02:12.300> all<00:02:13.300> right<00:02:13.420> now

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
right so it doesn't work all right now

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.880 
right so it doesn't work all right now
how<00:02:13.720> about<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.080> one

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.310 

let's<00:02:17.890> suppose<00:02:18.160> your<00:02:18.340> opponent<00:02:19.320> exchanged

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
let's suppose your opponent exchanged

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.440 
let's suppose your opponent exchanged
the<00:02:20.500> pawn<00:02:20.860> here<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.140> advanced<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.740> silver

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
the pawn here and advanced the silver

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.700 
the pawn here and advanced the silver
what's<00:02:25.450> your<00:02:25.570> next<00:02:25.690> move

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.830 

well<00:02:32.710> actually<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.430> answer<00:02:33.730> here<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.120> just

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
well actually the answer here is just

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.590 
well actually the answer here is just
you're<00:02:34.990> up<00:02:35.080> in<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.260> Ponte<00:02:35.620> 5f<00:02:36.209> because<00:02:37.209> then

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
you're up in the Ponte 5f because then

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.910 
you're up in the Ponte 5f because then
the<00:02:37.840> silver<00:02:38.200> has<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.680> get<00:02:38.890> back<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:40.180> know<00:02:40.209> why

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
the silver has to get back you know why

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.080 
the silver has to get back you know why
well<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.160> course<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.550> might<00:02:42.730> want<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:42.970> know

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
well of course you might want to know

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.280 
well of course you might want to know
what<00:02:43.390> happens<00:02:43.870> after<00:02:44.020> silver<00:02:44.590> took<00:02:45.100> this<00:02:45.370> pawn

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
what happens after silver took this pawn

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.500 
what happens after silver took this pawn
well<00:02:47.290> if<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.530> take<00:02:47.830> it<00:02:48.040> go<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.090> tack<00:02:49.360> is

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
well if you take it go to the tack is

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.190 
well if you take it go to the tack is
successful<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:52.180> actually<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.600> don't<00:02:52.660> take

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
successful but actually you don't take

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.500 
successful but actually you don't take
it<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:54.400> pull<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:55.090> silver<00:02:55.480> back<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:56.140> 6h<00:02:56.800> and

her pawn to 6e server takes and then you

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.150 
her pawn to 6e server takes and then you
take<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.430> pawn<00:04:40.050> but<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:41.169> will<00:04:41.260> be<00:04:41.440> recaptured

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160
