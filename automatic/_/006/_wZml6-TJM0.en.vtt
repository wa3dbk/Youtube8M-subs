 Nancy a low point of recent years 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.039
 and we return 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:25.000
 in dental lasers and can be postponed carefully because this matter 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.829
 a movie set

 that is diluting we have worked well low 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.449
 and meanwhile 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.449
 as well as who does not want the thing 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.579
 let's put 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.549
 it stabilizes 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:01.669
 suddenly 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.169
 let's put the bread 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.359
 and in covering it in that mixture 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.619
 of a game 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:11.619
 sugar in this case palmilla year 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.680
 let's trust 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.749
 while he warned 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.749
 we discovered a little coatlán taparita 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.610
 we went up the game a little 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.729
 every time less 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.889
 anbar where the habit stayed you can not imagine no 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.150
 on the one hand 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.139
 and then when we think that even the habit 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.450
 There I like a lot with jam and honey jam that is 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.330
 completely she is not in the honey merado is marmalade 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.530
 Demi lovato 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.400
 but they have not focused on such tasty environments bail imposed jams 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.169
 it was this disease 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.849
 it is the most very tasty variety 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:19.880
 very healthy 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.240
 because you know honey 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.439
 the mayor of properties the sugar is by itself has 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.289
 I'm going to tell the dodgers to shake things 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.409
 scientists 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.930
 I know what they will do that the survivors 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.240
 besides that the statute on the other side 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.249
 empty 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:38.529
 that is already coming 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:41.929
 these dates we already have part of ais 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:43.659

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.209
 this is enabled 'the sea of ​​clean' let me present it to you for what of 

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:49.900
 that final result 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.900
 what we have now sugar the oil 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:54.960
 with metastasis 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.039

 read it is because there is a bit of icing sugar so many visits and monkey 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.520
 A) Yes 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.300
 the advantage depends on what federal close 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.330
 The squares 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.369
 5 after exposing to the side 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:22.339
 what you want instead of putting it 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:25.769
 directly above you put the referee and that of the same name 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.020
 so be it 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.509
 Osuna Millán 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:30.819
 my Granny

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:42.189
 our french toast 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.389
 in this case besides clarifying a bit of it 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.900
 sugar iced a little more 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.009
 of course I chased and disappeared 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:52.550
 with this plan born 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.960

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.180
 with honey strap asked to be found with the ape 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.430
 you can hide if nothing happens 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.440
 whatever happens to you in any way is 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.010
 scoop
