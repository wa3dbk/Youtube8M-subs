00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.390
 good, my name is josÃ© arcedo editor 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.830
 boss of crack baby dotcom the day of 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.599
 today we are going to bring you a small 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.039
 review of the improvements that will come with 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:17.420
 the operating system 10 points 2.1 this 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:20.750
 Once we have installed in the berny z10 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:25.400
 stl 101 the operating system version 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:28.880
 10 points 2.1 point 10 55 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.590
 the first change we want to be in the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.590
 quick configuration screen 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.200
 when we perform from top to bottom 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.480
 on the main screen we can see that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.110
 some icons were added like that of 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.400
 the flashlight the brightness control of the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.400
 screen device 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.719
 in airplane mode 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.719
 and some that we already had before 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.510
 if we enter configuration 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.360
 and quick configuration we can see 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.430
 that we can all these icons 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.150
 rearrange and even add or remove 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.150
 icons 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.880
 to personalize it more to our what 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.880
 we want 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.190
 one of the things we also see is the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.290
 new calls screen 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.460
 very different let's make a call 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.460
 a quickly 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.430
 at this moment I am calling from 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.900
 the business that we have in 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.110
 baby investment dairy 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.450
 here they have the call we can 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.320
 ignore to the right and answer the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.320
 left 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.540
 very well 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.540
 another of the things we see is also 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.209
 the ability to install applications 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.170
 Android directly from the apk that 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.370
 we have downloaded 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.200
 at this moment I'm going to show you how 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.760
 download a fishing 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.790
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.040
 enter the google store and search 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.040
 for example instagram 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.380
 once we get 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.380
 what we want 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.330
 let's proceed to copy the link 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.150
 of the 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.150
 from this page we copy it 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.310
 and we go to this page 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.270
 I do not know if they can see it change 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.860
 Once on this page we enter the 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.860
 link previously copied 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.030
 we paste it here and we give it to generate 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.030
 download inc 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.010
 in what we have to this link we see that 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.640
 the package is called instagram like 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.830
 17mb android point instagram and you 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.830
 click here to download 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.800
 and we started to download it 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.660
 I'm going to download it to save a little 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.190
 time because I downloaded 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.320
 but if we verify 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.960
 in the file manager in the 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.200
 folder where it should be 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.020
 we see that if we leave it pressed 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.840
 we have the option to install 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.140
 let's proceed to install it should 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.020
 be a process 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.020
 relatively fast we must remember 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.510
 that this is an application in 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.850
 apk is what is installed in the 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.980
 Android devices this is because of 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.620
 that this new version of the system 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.770
 operative is going to bring a version 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.900
 liberated 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.870
 of the android player that will allow us 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.419
 install android apps 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.949
 directly from the device is 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.620
 say that we will no longer need 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.190
 use a computer to perform 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.190
 the process 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.030
 we wait a moment for the 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.030
 installation correctly 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.630
 and then we can open it or we can close 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.030
 is 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.790
 this screen one of the changes that 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.430
 we are also seeing is that when 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.120
 let's see what messages we have this is 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.800
 flame peak in the corner part 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.710
 top left we can see that the 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.740
 battery does not show them in percentage of 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.740
 This way it is much easier to take on 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.650
 how much battery we have 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.780
 available on the device 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.210
 and how to program here we have the icon 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.280
 from instagram 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.130
 we must remember that this version will 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.620
 everything works absolutely everything we can 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.229
 even upload videos from your own 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.470
 application something that could not be done before 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.470
 do 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:05.610
 well we 're going to leave that for now 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:07.860
 So far we hope that 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.409
 that come much more changes remember 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.240
 that this is a beta version let's hope 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.909
 come many more changes and 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.460
 improvements for this great system 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:21.379
 operative they were told by jose arcedo editor 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.379
 in chief of crack baby dotcom
