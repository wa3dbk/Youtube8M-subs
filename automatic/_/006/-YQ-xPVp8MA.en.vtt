00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.420
 Hello everyone 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.610
 and in this video I'm going to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.199
 introduce the dreamboard app that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.869
 is an alternative to the application 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.000
 winterboard available on cydia 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.890
 of course you will need a device 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.779
 jailbroken then you cast cydia 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.689
 we wait for the loading to be done 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.170
 there will be no source added this is 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.170
 already that 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:46.079
 we are waiting for that then you go to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.210
 search down right then here in 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.809
 there you can write you go 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.870
 write this breen terminals just for 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:04.140
 approaching hockey or animal here you are 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:10.020
 dead like this so once you 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.710
 have typed this he's going to have all these 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.630
 applications 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.150
 you may not have all those 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.159
 who are with question marks 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.720
 you will at least those in blue 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.299
 corn mode and those that will 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.659
 download you have installed 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.130
 confirmed I specify that it is free 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.570
 then it's going to be pretty good 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.659
 of time to download and install 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.680
 and it will be necessary to make re spring so you 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:39.180
 touch here and it will alone 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:42.390
 then on the last application you 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.840
 will have this dreamboard icon that will have 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.520
 appeared you just have to touch it 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.430
 to throw it hop it makes you a little 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.460
 effect like these and basic you 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.049
 will have a theme of andorra this dream terminals 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.729
 then you can already see that 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.140
 the interface is really pretty damn 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.740
 it's really pretty 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.280
 you can have several pages of 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.240
 two worlds to themes and you have 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.850
 just two touchdowns for example him 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.850
 for it beats that write prepare a 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.460
 theme and so they settle down so 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.210
 it's just going to have to wait a bit 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.560
 it settles after I hope it's ok 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.240
 pass because I may have some 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.250
 downloaded applications in this teaser 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.430
 that are incompatible with the dance is 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.040
 good but you can see you have the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.250
 android theme very simply without 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.560
 the mind without anything at all sure about your 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.540
 ipod touch or other iphone then you 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.580
 can see here that you take you 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.600
 swap the wallpaper all that is 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.460
 really like on android that's what 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.270
 is really not bad 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.590
 after you can touch a 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.300
 application as I'm going to do the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.580
 settings it opens quite 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.540
 normally like those here after you 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.100

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.250
