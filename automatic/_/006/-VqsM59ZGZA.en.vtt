00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
this team already half a year yeah

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.660 
this team already half a year yeah

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
actually tough opponents Estonia get

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.200 
actually tough opponents Estonia get
always<00:00:40.149> this<00:00:40.930> is<00:00:41.140> for<00:00:41.350> sure<00:00:41.559> but<00:00:42.219> in<00:00:42.879> the<00:00:42.940> end

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
always this is for sure but in the end

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.439 
always this is for sure but in the end
of<00:00:43.839> all<00:00:44.289> groups<00:00:44.769> which<00:00:45.519> is<00:00:45.730> in<00:00:46.269> the

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
of all groups which is in the

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.590 
of all groups which is in the
qualification<00:00:46.929> now<00:00:47.589> I<00:00:47.859> think<00:00:48.850> this<00:00:49.059> group<00:00:49.269> is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
qualification now I think this group is

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.680 
qualification now I think this group is
is<00:00:49.989> not<00:00:50.320> that<00:00:50.980> tough<00:00:51.339> that<00:00:51.820> we<00:00:51.969> don't<00:00:52.149> have<00:00:52.449> any

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
is not that tough that we don't have any

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.040 
is not that tough that we don't have any
chances<00:00:53.649> and<00:00:53.949> I<00:00:54.219> believe<00:00:54.879> in<00:00:55.210> this<00:00:55.359> team<00:00:55.420> if<00:00:55.929> I

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
chances and I believe in this team if I

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.930 
chances and I believe in this team if I
get<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.859> best<00:00:57.129> players<00:00:57.969> in<00:00:58.390> this<00:00:58.899> age<00:00:59.140> group

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
get the best players in this age group

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.389 
get the best players in this age group
then<00:01:00.940> then<00:01:01.449> we<00:01:01.659> have<00:01:01.780> really<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.199> chance<00:01:02.589> to<00:01:02.949> to

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
then then we have really a chance to to

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.050 
then then we have really a chance to to
come<00:01:03.640> really<00:01:03.909> far<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:06.159> best<00:01:06.400> players<00:01:06.760> I

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
come really far and the best players I

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.840 
come really far and the best players I
mean<00:01:07.270> also<00:01:07.720> if<00:01:08.500> there's<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.190> chance<00:01:09.460> between

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
mean also if there's the chance between

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
mean also if there's the chance between
a<00:01:10.360> team<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:11.080> I'm<00:01:11.860> not<00:01:12.100> 21<00:01:12.520> where<00:01:12.970> are<00:01:13.240> already

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
a team and I'm not 21 where are already

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.410 
a team and I'm not 21 where are already
some<00:01:14.170> place<00:01:14.439> in<00:01:14.710> 18<00:01:15.189> and<00:01:15.399> they<00:01:15.909> have<00:01:16.149> only

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
some place in 18 and they have only

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.179 
some place in 18 and they have only
friendly<00:01:17.049> games<00:01:17.290> and<00:01:17.649> we<00:01:18.159> have<00:01:18.930> important

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
friendly games and we have important

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.880 
friendly games and we have important
qualification<00:01:21.189> games<00:01:21.460> I<00:01:21.759> hope<00:01:22.540> that<00:01:23.229> that<00:01:23.710> we

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
qualification games I hope that that we

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.190 
qualification games I hope that that we
can<00:01:24.070> get<00:01:24.460> also<00:01:24.850> these<00:01:25.030> players<00:01:25.509> because<00:01:25.990> this

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
can get also these players because this

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.980 
can get also these players because this
would<00:01:26.530> make<00:01:26.799> our<00:01:27.070> team<00:01:27.430> so<00:01:27.909> much<00:01:28.149> stronger

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
would make our team so much stronger

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.249 
would make our team so much stronger
they<00:01:29.170> are<00:01:29.229> so<00:01:29.439> experienced<00:01:30.399> and<00:01:30.579> then<00:01:31.539> I<00:01:31.840> see

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
they are so experienced and then I see

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.740 
they are so experienced and then I see
already<00:01:32.740> chances<00:01:33.549> against<00:01:34.000> top<00:01:34.180> teams<00:01:34.479> like

decided on the captain of the team or or
I<00:02:20.260> thought<00:02:20.620> about<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.980> already<00:02:21.340> this<00:02:21.459> arm

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
I thought about the already this arm

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.280 
I thought about the already this arm
actually<00:02:23.600> under<00:02:23.930> 21<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:25.400> team<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:26.570> there's

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
actually under 21 and a team but there's

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.220 
actually under 21 and a team but there's
