00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.269
 keep an exotic home 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.349
 expensive and dangerous but here's the paper 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.320
 everybody can afford a crocodile 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.439
 First of all, a sheet of colored paper 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.920
 a4 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.470
 we cut into 8 identical strips in my 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.660
 case each strip width turned out 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.009
 three centimeters 7 millimeters 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.260
 of these 8 strips 2 will remain intact 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.930
 the remaining 6 need to be cut in half and 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.930
 By the way one half will also have 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.490
 cut in half out of 10 identical 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.490
 cardboard stripes 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.900
 we collect the body of the crocodile we collect by 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:51.350
 chaining principle one of the long strips 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.140
 insert into the last ring we glue and 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.680
 a little undercut this strip will be 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.180
 the tail is another long stripe 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.360
 the first one will be inserted accordingly. 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.950
 ring and and a little bit have to bend and 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.480
 twist and turn it fall 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.700
 eyes will be another wide 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:17.060
 small strip fold it in half 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.000
 glue round edges and glue 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.640
 this strip under the upper jaw 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.190
 crocodile well, the paws will be the remaining 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.160
 thin stripes bend them with two 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.800
 sides and pass through paper loops 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.080
 the crocodile was almost complete it was possible 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.659
 would leave and so but I suggest taking 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.600
 still white paper and crawl out of it 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.450
 a thin strip of nearly large circles 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.360
 rim will mouth and circles 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.400
 eyes 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.200
 like this from one sheet of paper can 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.200
 get a whole crocodile 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.189
 but only in pieces
