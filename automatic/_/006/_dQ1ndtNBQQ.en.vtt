00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.869
 and there, guys, I'm cypherclub 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.730
 and I'm going to teach you today 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.140
 full version of the song that country is 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.380
 this one of the urban legion 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:33.410
 This song only has three minor chords. 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.410
 biggest mistake is bigger 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.790
 I'll start playing the intro 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.480
 As you saw in the introduction, the people 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.350
 will start by playing only down the 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.030
 chords 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:27.030
 I 'll show you one time to pay and then 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:29.070
 teaches how to make the people will assemble 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.410
 court minor and will play eight times 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.200
 down but at this time there's a seven 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.890
 on the third in the sixth and in the 8th beat for 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.229
 low 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.060
 we will unscrew the minor chord 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:49.440
 and play the loose strings 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:52.400
 repair 308 third on Friday and is not 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.400
 shot down 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.320
 then we change the C major package 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.320
 and plays four times down 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.890
 on the last slapping strike it wags 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.310
 we play the loose strings 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.310
 like this 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.840
 to finish we ride the king is bigger and 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.840
 we do the same 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.439
 the full video stays like this 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.660
 this sequence is repeated four times in the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.100
 introduction and soon after we start 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.140
 with the rhythm that will be used to play 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.880
 the rest of the song I'll play it one 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.180
 rather slowly and then I show how to 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.180
 does 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.540
 at this rate we will also use 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.090
 that trick loosen the agreement 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.350
 ball showed in the production this time the 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:16.190
 You will play two down to two 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:18.830
 Up and down and up. 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.330
 unscrew the chord on the second or fourth 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.750
 and on the sixth beat 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.750
 look that 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.340
 continuing we move pro C major and 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:46.960
 play down and up and down to 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.960
 up and last released from chord 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.420
 to finish making them is bigger 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:09.239
 the complete sequence is thus in the 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.370
 introduction this sequence suddenly eight 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.459
 times and in the last four is when 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.560
 starts only for those who have difficulty 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.720
 can do this without undoing the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.090
 chord fingers and you can still use this 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.449
 rhythm to play the whole song of this 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.449
 way 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.670
 just do the same rhythm but without using the 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.380
 trick Music soling will teach in 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.210
 end of the lesson after the introduction 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.950
 people keep the same chords same 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:54.110
 rhythm in the rest of the song I'll play a 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:58.190
 Stretch in the dirt shanty everywhere 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.190
 nobody respects the constitution 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.740
 but all here 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.979
 What father is this? 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:16.229
 who comes and goes 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:16.229
 What country is this? 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.340
 Now I'm going to play only the music. 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.010
 1 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.210
 To start, we'll put our finger. 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:57.150
 in the fifth house of the rope if the finger 3 in the 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:01.920
 seventh string house my turn once 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:04.400
 on the rope if a condom and play more 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.400
 twice 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:20.640
 in the next we play one more in 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:22.860
 rope a neighbor and drag your fingers 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.290
 from the left hand to the third house 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.390
 from the rope if and 103 to the fifth house of the 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.870
 adjacent court rings once in each 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.870
 block 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.370
 now we will reverse the position of the 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.650
 Fingers Left Hand Finger 3 Tighten 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.080

 third house of the condom and we will play 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.740
 3 times 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:02.080
 continuing to play another rope 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.970
 get into a condom and reposition the 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.310

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.800

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.400

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.400
 each quota 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:35.030
 then just repeat solo to watch 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:36.139
