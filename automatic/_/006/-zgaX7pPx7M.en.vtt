now<00:00:36.040> Swift<00:00:36.760> camera<00:00:37.059> guys<00:00:37.270> record<00:00:37.629> out<00:00:37.720> here

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
now Swift camera guys record out here

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.060 
now Swift camera guys record out here
it's<00:00:40.210> actually<00:00:40.360> pretty<00:00:41.020> close<00:00:41.470> to<00:00:41.739> what<00:00:41.890> the

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
it's actually pretty close to what the

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:50.119 
it's actually pretty close to what the
actual<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:44.500> is<00:00:44.620> like<00:00:44.829> a<00:00:46.739> little<00:00:47.739> camera<00:00:48.040> a

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
actual like is like a little camera a

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.350 
actual like is like a little camera a
little<00:00:51.129> bit<00:00:51.280> darker<00:00:51.699> on<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.820> screen<00:00:52.089> than<00:00:52.269> it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
little bit darker on the screen than it

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.079 
little bit darker on the screen than it
is<00:00:52.420> in<00:00:52.540> real<00:00:52.690> life<00:00:52.720> but<00:00:56.220> you're<00:00:57.220> fixed<00:00:57.460> about

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
is in real life but you're fixed about

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.200 
is in real life but you're fixed about
two<00:00:58.269> new<00:00:58.390> bulbs<00:00:59.100> put<00:01:00.100> them<00:01:00.190> in<00:01:00.309> pulled<00:01:01.149> the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
two new bulbs put them in pulled the

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.460 
two new bulbs put them in pulled the
switch<00:01:01.300> out<00:01:01.570> nothing<00:01:01.899> happened

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
switch out nothing happened

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.010 
switch out nothing happened
so<00:01:03.189> I<00:01:03.220> thought<00:01:03.430> crap<00:01:04.269> what's<00:01:04.570> wrong<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.270> if<00:01:07.900> the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
so I thought crap what's wrong so if the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.429 
so I thought crap what's wrong so if the
high<00:01:08.140> beams<00:01:08.409> switch<00:01:08.619> and<00:01:08.890> they<00:01:08.950> came<00:01:09.130> on<00:01:10.439> turn

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
high beams switch and they came on turn

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.870 
high beams switch and they came on turn
the<00:01:11.530> high<00:01:11.619> beams<00:01:11.830> off<00:01:12.070> from<00:01:12.280> below<00:01:12.460> beans<00:01:12.670> came

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
the high beams off from below beans came

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.690 
the high beams off from below beans came
on<00:01:13.320> trying<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.409> switch<00:01:14.560> off<00:01:14.770> cycle<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.549> few

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
on trying to switch off cycle it a few

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.620 
on trying to switch off cycle it a few
times<00:01:15.850> they<00:01:16.090> were<00:01:16.210> fine

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
times they were fine

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.800 
times they were fine
so<00:01:16.780> something<00:01:17.229> with<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.500> high<00:01:18.100> beam<00:01:18.310> switch

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
so something with the high beam switch

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.910 
so something with the high beam switch
relay<00:01:19.810> or<00:01:19.990> something<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.439> there's<00:01:20.590> going<00:01:20.890> a

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
relay or something and there's going a

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.390 
relay or something and there's going a
little<00:01:21.009> haywire<00:01:21.369> of<00:01:22.299> keep<00:01:22.840> an<00:01:22.960> eye<00:01:23.049> on<00:01:23.080> it

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
little haywire of keep an eye on it

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.649 
little haywire of keep an eye on it
maybe<00:01:24.400> just<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.670> little<00:01:24.700> corrosion<00:01:25.299> this<00:01:25.420> thing

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
maybe just a little corrosion this thing

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:26.850 
maybe just a little corrosion this thing
didn't<00:01:25.869> sit<00:01:26.020> for<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.229> couple<00:01:26.259> years<00:01:26.650> where<00:01:26.830> I

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.460 

just<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.120> crank<00:02:11.390> up<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.660> dye<00:02:11.840> grinder<00:02:11.900> with

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
just to crank up the dye grinder with

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.259 
just to crank up the dye grinder with
hair<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:12.920> got<00:02:13.190> in<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.370> compressor<00:02:13.819> just<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.120> see

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
hair I got in the compressor just to see

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.460 
hair I got in the compressor just to see
how<00:02:14.450> they<00:02:14.569> do<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.920> maybe<00:02:16.580> I'll<00:02:16.760> set<00:02:17.030> up<00:02:17.060> the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
how they do so maybe I'll set up the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.470 
how they do so maybe I'll set up the
grinder<00:02:18.470> here<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:19.090> see<00:02:20.090> what<00:02:20.209> happens

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
grinder here and see what happens

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.040 
grinder here and see what happens
