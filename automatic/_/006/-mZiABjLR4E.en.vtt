 promised here is the surprise video that 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.320

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.300
 new channel series is iscte is exactly 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.390
 You asked the questions and now I go. 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.670
 Reply with quote 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.820
 so let's start the first question 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.850
 was from joÃ£o pedro cardoso freitas e 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.190
 so they had several questions well 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.190
 Looks so I'll leave it here. 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.770
 chemical questions are similar and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.500
 who has the same answer as him and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.930
 asked the following when you started 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.710
 to become interested in electronics and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.010
 apple 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.500
 so expensive electronics since I 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.120
 I understand people like electronic I 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.969
 Played remote control trolley 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.789
 when I was a child I thought it was sensational 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.010
 when I get an address book 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.100
 Who remembers electronic diary let 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.170
 in comments because it was a thing 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.090
 revolutionary at the time I liked 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.729
 computer, I always liked video games 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.409
 so I've always liked electronics in 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:23.939
 and by the time I remember when 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.790
 I saw the first time I saw the inec g3 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.700
 the one with the colored tube and I 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.700
 I love canoeing is the most beautiful thing and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.030
 since then, this company must be 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.409
 show but was very young and had no 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.979
 money for nothing 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.810
 So it was in 2005 that I got my 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.399
 Apple's first device that was a 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.460
 ipod nano with absurdos 1 gb of 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.810
 capacity was that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.509
 first generation 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.469
 I won, I do not remember if it was Christmas. 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.740
 and from there I started to 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.320
 I started learning to learn and only 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.149
 the passion of the time grew to the second 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.950
 guilherme hage's question 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.259
 but as he several people asked 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.100
 so I'll leave it here and then 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.400
 ask how many years 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.700
 24 the renata beauty nor did I try when 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.370
 I did the apple tattoo and what 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.959
 He inspired me to make this tattoo 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.800
 where the idea came 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.690
 good idea came when Uncle Steve 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.170
 jobs died 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.200
 there in October 2011 that was a month that 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.970
 I did the tattoo and I did the tattoo 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.810
 because of this because I wanted 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.360
 pay homage or do something 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.700
 that mark if that moment for me is 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.510
 How do you like a tattoo and that moment? 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.610
 I scored then I got a tattoo of the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.510
 apple was actually more positive than 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.790
 that for the period under I're asking 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.930
 for 2014 I will have the opportunity to 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.610
 meet the 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:08.269
 yes thats because i got input from 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.400
 last minute was not going but I got it and there 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.890
 When we see there people can be 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.360
 stop or send a patient to 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.140
 people to find a brand 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:23.510
 place 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:26.510
 miguel asked me you are too then the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.519
 gabrielle camargo asked her 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:34.070

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.930

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.320
 I like harry potter watch all 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.420

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.440
 test asked did you already succeed? 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.440
 complete the magic cube 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:05:01.009
 The Hangar of Ana was able to have a 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:03.110
 man this is very much a show if you guys 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:07.340
 Never tried in life, it's gotta be a lot. 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:10.969
 legal and internet has several tips and 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:15.050
 several tutorials on how you ride and 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:19.250
 Your magic body, my little monkey, I'm going 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.889
 leave the bozo right here and ask why 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.949
 You're not going to work on the apple. 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.650
 Dude, ask me the question every day. 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:30.770
 too but they never hired me 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.690
 I sent a resume but they did not call me. 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:38.000
 so I can do nothing 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.940
 the daniel walnut asked in the cell 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.629
 What are your expectations for 2014? 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.419
 And how do you see yourself in the year 2014? 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.580
 dude sincerely hope 2014 is 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.169
 much better than 2013 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.650
 This is because you remember that I gave a 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.990
 stop making videos in 2013 and I do not 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.389
 I want this to happen in 2014 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.690
 on the contrary I want to invest every 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:06.620
 more on the channel and on the blog to whom 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:08.930

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.080
 investment for 2014 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.719
