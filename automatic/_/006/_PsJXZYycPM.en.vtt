unique from this set I think the paint
jobs<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.120> pretty<00:00:36.420> good<00:00:36.480> yeah<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.530> see

some blue coming in from the back but um

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.549 
some blue coming in from the back but um
these<00:00:41.070> are<00:00:41.129> really<00:00:41.640> thin<00:00:41.969> strips<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:43.020> still

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
these are really thin strips so it still

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.040 
these are really thin strips so it still
looks<00:00:43.770> good<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.129> me<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.850> these<00:00:45.450> are<00:00:45.510> really

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
looks good to me and these are really

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.690 
looks good to me and these are really
small<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.800> tell<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.160> mean<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.460> only

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
small if you can tell I mean it's only

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.200 
small if you can tell I mean it's only
probably<00:00:49.070> maybe<00:00:50.070> an<00:00:50.280> inch<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.670> half<00:00:50.700> tall

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
probably maybe an inch and a half tall

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.650 
probably maybe an inch and a half tall
so<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.739> got<00:00:52.860> pretty<00:00:53.100> good<00:00:53.280> detail

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
so that they got pretty good detail

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.060 
so that they got pretty good detail
alright<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.899> let's<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.199> talk<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
alright so let's just talk about the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.069 
alright so let's just talk about the
figure<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.579> let's<00:00:56.850> see<00:00:57.030> if<00:00:57.059> he's<00:00:57.270> any<00:00:57.420> good<00:00:57.480> so

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
figure and let's see if he's any good so

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.770 
figure and let's see if he's any good so
he's<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> grounded<00:00:58.680> character<00:00:59.039> he<00:00:59.160> doesn't<00:00:59.430> fly

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
he's a grounded character he doesn't fly

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.439 
he's a grounded character he doesn't fly
and<00:01:00.780> he's<00:01:01.170> got<00:01:01.350> six<00:01:01.710> range<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.309> he<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.609> shoot

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
and he's got six range so he can shoot

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.690 
and he's got six range so he can shoot
someone<00:01:03.690> from<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.290> six<00:01:04.530> distant<00:01:05.010> this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
someone from up to six distant this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.090 
someone from up to six distant this
first<00:01:05.970> click<00:01:06.299> has<00:01:06.540> eight<00:01:06.810> movement<00:01:07.500> nine

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
first click has eight movement nine

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.120 
first click has eight movement nine
attack<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.820> seventeen<00:01:09.450> defense<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.380> two

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
attack and seventeen defense and two

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.179 
attack and seventeen defense and two
damage<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.180> those<00:01:12.390> numbers<00:01:12.750> aren't<00:01:12.930> like

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
damage so those numbers aren't like

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.080 
damage so those numbers aren't like
overpowering<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> things<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.880> make

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
overpowering but the things that make

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.600 
overpowering but the things that make
them<00:01:15.210> pretty<00:01:15.479> good<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.990> um<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.799> nineteen<00:01:17.310> has

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
them pretty good is um the nineteen has

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.090 
them pretty good is um the nineteen has
psychic<00:01:18.119> blast<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.259> cuts<00:01:19.650> through<00:01:19.890> any

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
psychic blast and that cuts through any

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.960 
psychic blast and that cuts through any
defenses<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.439> reduce<00:01:22.439> damage<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.700> even

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
defenses that reduce damage so that even

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.940 
defenses that reduce damage so that even
though<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.270> too<00:01:24.479> damaged<00:01:24.930> it'll<00:01:25.619> go<00:01:25.740> right

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
though it's too damaged it'll go right

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
though it's too damaged it'll go right
through<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.610> pretty<00:01:26.700> good<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.900> he's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
through it so that's pretty good so he's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
through it so that's pretty good so he's
seventeen<00:01:28.740> invulnerability<00:01:29.340> which<00:01:30.090> blocks

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
seventeen invulnerability which blocks

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.080 
seventeen invulnerability which blocks
two<00:01:30.840> damage<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.799> if<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.159> three<00:01:32.520> damage<00:01:32.729> to

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
two damage so if you do three damage to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.850 
two damage so if you do three damage to
him<00:01:33.240> he<00:01:33.509> blocks<00:01:33.810> two<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.619> takes

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
him he blocks two of it and just takes

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.200 
him he blocks two of it and just takes
one<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.840> his<00:01:36.990> damage<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.560> perplex<00:01:38.549> which

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
one and on his damage is perplex which

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.530 
one and on his damage is perplex which
he<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:40.470> one<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.009> his<00:01:41.130> stats<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.880> his<00:01:42.240> dial

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
he can up one of his stats on his dial

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.649 
he can up one of his stats on his dial
or<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.040> his<00:01:44.100> stats<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:45.090> friendly

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
or up one of his stats on a friendly

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.260 
or up one of his stats on a friendly
character<00:01:46.140> or<00:01:46.350> opposing<00:01:47.009> character<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:48.090> most

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
character or opposing character but most

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.730 
character or opposing character but most
likely<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:48.720> an<00:01:48.869> opposing<00:01:49.350> character

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
likely if it's an opposing character

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.590 
likely if it's an opposing character
you're<00:01:49.920> probably<00:01:50.100> gonna<00:01:50.310> perplexed<00:01:50.850> down<00:01:51.210> one

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
you're probably gonna perplexed down one

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.109 
you're probably gonna perplexed down one
of<00:01:51.720> these<00:01:51.780> stats<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.119> ten

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
of these stats so you can have a ten

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.870 
of these stats so you can have a ten
attack<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.689> three<00:01:55.170> damage<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> 18

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
attack or three damage or have a 18

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.609 
attack or three damage or have a 18
defense<00:01:57.240> alright<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:57.960> let's<00:01:58.140> take<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> look<00:01:58.500> at

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
defense alright so let's take a look at

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.560 
defense alright so let's take a look at
the<00:01:58.710> second<00:01:59.100> click<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.909> as<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.240> tell<00:02:00.450> he

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the second click so as you can tell he

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.660 
the second click so as you can tell he
goes<00:02:00.750> down<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.320> numbers<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> attack<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
goes down in numbers on the attack and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.740 
goes down in numbers on the attack and
defense<00:02:03.259> so<00:02:04.259> eight<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.700> really<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.509> good

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
defense so eight is not really that good

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.240 
defense so eight is not really that good
of<00:02:06.869> an<00:02:06.990> attack<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.649> he<00:02:07.710> still<00:02:07.950> keeps

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
of an attack but he still keeps

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.630 
of an attack but he still keeps
perplexed<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.270> his<00:02:09.539> damage<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.259> his<00:02:11.069> defense

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
perplexed on his damage and his defense

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.330 
perplexed on his damage and his defense
goes<00:02:12.180> down<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> sixteen

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
goes down to a sixteen

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.030 
goes down to a sixteen
and<00:02:13.640> that's<00:02:14.569> toughness<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.590> instead<00:02:15.980> of

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
and that's toughness so instead of

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.070 
and that's toughness so instead of
blocking<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.850> within<00:02:17.209> vulnerability

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
blocking to within vulnerability

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.199 
blocking to within vulnerability
he<00:02:18.290> blocked<00:02:18.560> one<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.340> time<00:02:19.610> do<00:02:19.970> another

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
he blocked one this time do another

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.540 
he blocked one this time do another
click<00:02:20.569> alright<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.410> now<00:02:21.560> he<00:02:21.620> has<00:02:21.800> psychic

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
click alright so now he has psychic

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.370 
click alright so now he has psychic
blast<00:02:22.760> still<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.780> cuts<00:02:24.050> through<00:02:24.230> any

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
blast still so it cuts through any

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.949 
blast still so it cuts through any
damage<00:02:24.800> he<00:02:25.190> has<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.610> toughness<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:26.630> he<00:02:26.720> blocks

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
damage he has the toughness so he blocks

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.120 
damage he has the toughness so he blocks
one<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:27.620> now<00:02:28.040> he<00:02:28.100> has<00:02:28.400> shape<00:02:29.180> change<00:02:29.540> so

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
one and now he has shape change so

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.920 
one and now he has shape change so
basically<00:02:31.130> how<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.550> works<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:32.120> if<00:02:32.360> someone

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
basically how that works is if someone

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.280 
basically how that works is if someone
attempts<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.950> attack<00:02:34.040> him<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.870> get<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.050> roll

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
attempts to attack him you get the roll

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.610 
attempts to attack him you get the roll
of<00:02:36.440> dice<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.950> if<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.280> roll<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.489> five<00:02:37.940> or<00:02:37.970> six

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
of dice and if you roll a five or six

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.530 
of dice and if you roll a five or six
they<00:02:39.620> can't<00:02:39.920> attack<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:40.340> front<00:02:41.180> with<00:02:41.360> that

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
they can't attack you front with that

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.260 
they can't attack you front with that
guy<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.860> that's<00:02:43.069> pretty<00:02:43.280> good<00:02:43.489> but<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:44.030> doesn't

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
guy so that's pretty good but it doesn't

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.449 
guy so that's pretty good but it doesn't
really<00:02:44.630> bonus<00:02:45.200> when<00:02:45.530> your<00:02:45.680> stats<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.190> just

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
really bonus when your stats it just

really bonus when your stats it just
helps<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.269> evade<00:02:47.690> a<00:02:47.720> attack<00:02:48.170> let's<00:02:49.010> check

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
helps you evade a attack let's check

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.610 
helps you evade a attack let's check
again<00:02:49.519> another<00:02:50.060> clip<00:02:50.390> alright<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.260> he<00:02:51.350> loses

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
again another clip alright so he loses

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.820 
again another clip alright so he loses
psychic<00:02:52.310> blast<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:52.910> gains<00:02:53.269> energy<00:02:53.830> explosion

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
psychic blast and gains energy explosion

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.550 
psychic blast and gains energy explosion
with<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.880> energy<00:02:56.300> explosion<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:56.930> does<00:02:57.320> one

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
with the energy explosion it does one

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.140 
with the energy explosion it does one
damage<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.190> character<00:02:58.519> your<00:02:58.640> attack<00:02:58.880> and

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
character around that obviously if you

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.040 
character around that obviously if you
have<00:03:03.920> powers<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.700> reduce<00:03:05.209> damage<00:03:05.660> it<00:03:05.870> won't

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
have powers that reduce damage it won't

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.120 
have powers that reduce damage it won't
go<00:03:06.170> through<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.410> but<00:03:06.560> if<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.709> have<00:03:06.800> armor

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
go through it but if you have armor

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.190 
go through it but if you have armor
piercing<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.819> would<00:03:08.330> go<00:03:08.510> through<00:03:08.750> obviously

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
piercing it would go through obviously

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.020 
piercing it would go through obviously
you<00:03:09.830> have<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.069> know<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.340> game<00:03:10.519> a<00:03:10.550> little<00:03:10.760> bit

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
you have to know the game a little bit

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.759 
you have to know the game a little bit
to<00:03:11.180> understand<00:03:11.600> these<00:03:11.780> characters<00:03:12.230> but<00:03:12.440> still

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
to understand these characters but still

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.540 
to understand these characters but still
then<00:03:13.280> we<00:03:13.459> have<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:14.209> 15<00:03:14.630> defense<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.920> we<00:03:16.100> still

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
then we have the 15 defense and we still

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.960 
then we have the 15 defense and we still
have<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.450> two<00:03:17.630> damage<00:03:17.959> with<00:03:18.110> shape<00:03:18.320> change

let's<00:03:19.970> click<00:03:20.209> them<00:03:20.360> again<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:20.989> basically<00:03:21.709> the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
let's click them again so basically the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.360 
let's click them again so basically the
same<00:03:22.280> powers<00:03:23.060> but<00:03:23.600> his<00:03:24.230> attack<00:03:24.590> went<00:03:24.860> down<00:03:25.040> by

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
same powers but his attack went down by

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.090 
same powers but his attack went down by
one<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.940> do<00:03:26.060> them<00:03:26.269> again<00:03:26.510> we're<00:03:27.200> also<00:03:27.350> staying

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
one to do them again we're also staying

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.830 
one to do them again we're also staying
the<00:03:28.340> same<00:03:28.370> here<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.239> let's<00:03:29.390> try<00:03:29.660> them<00:03:29.780> again

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
the same here so let's try them again

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.759 
the same here so let's try them again
alright<00:03:30.739> so<00:03:31.010> now<00:03:31.250> we<00:03:31.310> have<00:03:31.519> a<00:03:31.670> new<00:03:31.880> power<00:03:32.090> its

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
alright so now we have a new power its

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.420 
alright so now we have a new power its
regen<00:03:33.769> so<00:03:34.750> regeneration<00:03:36.100> basically<00:03:37.100> what<00:03:37.250> you

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
regen so regeneration basically what you

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.840 
regen so regeneration basically what you
do<00:03:37.610> there<00:03:37.880> is<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:38.120> roll<00:03:38.510> one<00:03:38.840> dice<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.850> you

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
do there is you roll one dice and you

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.870 
do there is you roll one dice and you
subtract<00:03:41.510> two<00:03:41.810> from<00:03:42.320> that<00:03:42.530> dice<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.190> whatever

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
subtract two from that dice and whatever

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.240 
subtract two from that dice and whatever
you<00:03:44.150> roll<00:03:44.359> say<00:03:44.600> you<00:03:44.660> roll<00:03:44.959> for<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.739> subtract

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
you roll say you roll for you subtract

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.210 
you roll say you roll for you subtract
two<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:46.850> you<00:03:47.180> heal<00:03:47.450> two<00:03:47.780> kliks<00:03:48.140> so<00:03:48.950> then<00:03:49.100> you

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
two and you heal two kliks so then you

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.030 
two and you heal two kliks so then you
would<00:03:49.400> go<00:03:49.720> click<00:03:50.720> heal<00:03:51.079> yourself<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.890> more

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
would go click heal yourself to more

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.259 
would go click heal yourself to more
clicks<00:03:53.920> if<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.070> know<00:03:55.190> how<00:03:55.310> that<00:03:55.459> works<00:03:55.640> so

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
clicks if you know how that works so

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.420 
clicks if you know how that works so
let's<00:03:56.390> go<00:03:56.570> back<00:03:56.810> there<00:03:57.140> so<00:03:57.829> if<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.190> don't<00:03:58.340> get

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
let's go back there so if you don't get

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.210 
let's go back there so if you don't get
past<00:03:58.670> that<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:59.180> go<00:03:59.329> do<00:03:59.510> another<00:03:59.720> click<00:04:00.220> and

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
past that you go do another click and

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.580 
past that you go do another click and
now<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.459> lose<00:04:01.970> in<00:04:02.329> your<00:04:02.600> attack<00:04:03.049> power<00:04:03.290> and

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
now you lose in your attack power and

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.150 
now you lose in your attack power and
you<00:04:03.769> still<00:04:03.980> have<00:04:04.100> regen<00:04:05.680> now<00:04:06.680> you're<00:04:06.890> looking

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160

nice<00:04:30.199> to<00:04:30.500> help<00:04:30.710> him<00:04:30.889> try<00:04:31.430> to<00:04:31.490> stay<00:04:31.699> alive<00:04:31.940> but

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
nice to help him try to stay alive but

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:38.529 
nice to help him try to stay alive but
he's<00:04:32.870> very<00:04:33.410> poor<00:04:34.099> attacker<00:04:34.940> late<00:04:35.780> dial<00:04:37.360> we<00:04:38.360> got

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
he's very poor attacker late dial we got

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.520 
he's very poor attacker late dial we got
one<00:04:38.900> too<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:41.360> he<00:04:41.449> only<00:04:41.569> has<00:04:41.750> two<00:04:41.990> clicks<00:04:42.319> of

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
one too so he only has two clicks of

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.159 
one too so he only has two clicks of
Keio<00:04:43.009> which<00:04:43.430> is<00:04:43.610> pretty<00:04:44.060> good<00:04:44.389> for<00:04:44.449> a<00:04:44.780> hundred

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
Keio which is pretty good for a hundred

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.770 
Keio which is pretty good for a hundred
and<00:04:45.319> six<00:04:46.250> point<00:04:46.580> character<00:04:47.090> he<00:04:47.419> doesn't<00:04:47.659> have

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
and six point character he doesn't have

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.480 
and six point character he doesn't have
a<00:04:47.810> team<00:04:48.020> ability<00:04:48.259> so<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:48.770> won't<00:04:48.919> get<00:04:49.009> benefit

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
a team ability so you won't get benefit

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.809 
a team ability so you won't get benefit
from<00:04:49.639> that<00:04:49.870> but<00:04:50.870> anyways<00:04:51.229> this<00:04:51.949> is<00:04:52.190> my<00:04:52.400> review

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
from that but anyways this is my review

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:58.089 
from that but anyways this is my review
on<00:04:53.060> mr.<00:04:53.419> sinister<00:04:55.000> 406<00:04:56.000> points<00:04:56.569> it's<00:04:57.409> a<00:04:57.560> solid

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
on mr. sinister 406 points it's a solid

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.820 
on mr. sinister 406 points it's a solid
figure<00:04:58.340> but<00:04:58.789> you<00:04:59.360> know<00:04:59.479> he's<00:04:59.780> probably<00:04:59.990> not

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
figure but you know he's probably not

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.980 
figure but you know he's probably not
going<00:05:01.039> to<00:05:01.099> be<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.430> powerful<00:05:01.900> because<00:05:02.900> he

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
going to be that powerful because he

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.719 
going to be that powerful because he
just<00:05:03.199> doesn't<00:05:03.500> have<00:05:03.620> a<00:05:03.650> really<00:05:04.099> high<00:05:04.310> attack

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
just doesn't have a really high attack

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.700 
just doesn't have a really high attack
and<00:05:05.120> he<00:05:05.210> doesn't<00:05:05.389> have<00:05:05.569> a<00:05:05.599> lot<00:05:05.780> of<00:05:05.840> he<00:05:06.530> doesn't

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
and he doesn't have a lot of he doesn't

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.490 
and he doesn't have a lot of he doesn't
do<00:05:06.889> a<00:05:06.919> lot<00:05:07.009> of<00:05:07.159> damage<00:05:07.520> but<00:05:07.909> he's<00:05:08.599> pretty<00:05:09.229> hard

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
do a lot of damage but he's pretty hard

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.990 
do a lot of damage but he's pretty hard
to<00:05:09.590> kill<00:05:09.830> because<00:05:10.159> he<00:05:10.250> only<00:05:10.400> has<00:05:10.550> two<00:05:10.729> clicks

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
to kill because he only has two clicks

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.870 
to kill because he only has two clicks
of<00:05:11.150> Keio<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:11.840> he<00:05:12.259> has<00:05:12.349> a<00:05:12.380> lot<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.650> regen<00:05:13.250> to

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
of Keio and he has a lot of regen to

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.360 
of Keio and he has a lot of regen to
help<00:05:14.090> him<00:05:14.300> survive<00:05:14.599> and<00:05:15.110> gain<00:05:15.830> a<00:05:15.860> lot<00:05:16.159> of<00:05:16.190> his

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
help him survive and gain a lot of his

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.240 
help him survive and gain a lot of his
life<00:05:16.550> back<00:05:16.789> but<00:05:17.569> so<00:05:17.780> yeah<00:05:17.960> this<00:05:18.770> is<00:05:18.979> from<00:05:19.099> The

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.270 
life back but so yeah this is from The
Ultimates<00:05:19.759> and<00:05:20.139> it's<00:05:21.139> probably<00:05:21.680> I<00:05:21.949> don't<00:05:22.190> know

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
Ultimates and it's probably I don't know

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.790 
Ultimates and it's probably I don't know
how<00:05:22.400> hard<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.819> figure<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.300> is<00:05:23.419> to<00:05:23.599> get<00:05:23.870> but<00:05:24.620> um

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
how hard a figure it is to get but um

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.120 
how hard a figure it is to get but um
it's<00:05:25.280> one<00:05:25.610> of<00:05:25.669> my<00:05:25.759> favourite
