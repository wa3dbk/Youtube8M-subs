laughing stone this is good because
obviously<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.420> flat<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:21.710> you<00:00:22.710> obviously

want a flat surface so all I do is
gently<00:00:31.189> run<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.399> back<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> blade<00:00:33.719> over

marks from the stone all along the blade

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.660 
marks from the stone all along the blade
they're<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:42.840> nice<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.050> even

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
to do on the edge here on a good chisel

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.049 
to do on the edge here on a good chisel
you<00:00:51.750> shouldn't<00:00:52.110> need<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> do<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.690> very<00:00:54.690> much

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
you shouldn't need to do this very much

you shouldn't need to do this very much
on<00:00:57.059> kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> cheaper<00:00:57.780> chisels<00:00:58.140> you'll<00:00:59.180> kind

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
on kind of cheaper chisels you'll kind

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.810 
on kind of cheaper chisels you'll kind
of<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.590> lot<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.100> what<00:01:02.699> will

of have to do this a lot and what will
happen<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:04.080> will<00:01:04.199> bring<00:01:04.530> down<00:01:05.510> Japanese

happen is you will bring down Japanese

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.179 
happen is you will bring down Japanese
chisels<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.020> kind<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.320> hollow<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
chisels have this kind of hollow in the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.160 
chisels have this kind of hollow in the
back<00:01:08.430> which<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.240> probably<00:01:09.360> already<00:01:09.510> know

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
back which you probably already know

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.840 
back which you probably already know
about<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> help<00:01:10.890> sharpen<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.950> hollow

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
about it's to help sharpen the hollow

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.990 
about it's to help sharpen the hollow
should<00:01:15.560> almost<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.979> full<00:01:17.189> width<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
should almost be the full width of the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.210 
should almost be the full width of the
blade<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.479> there<00:01:19.350> should<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.560> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
blade and there should be kind of a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.200 
blade and there should be kind of a
really<00:01:20.909> thin<00:01:21.330> piece<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.930> blade<00:01:22.850> kind<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.970> back

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
really thin piece of blade kind of back

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.840 
really thin piece of blade kind of back
left<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.290> either<00:01:25.439> side<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.369> they<00:01:26.640> should<00:01:26.790> be

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
left on either side and they should be

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.499 
left on either side and they should be
thin<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.360> even<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.820> if<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> cheaper

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
thin and even and if you have a cheaper

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.539 
thin and even and if you have a cheaper
chisel<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> lot<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.400> this

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
chisel and you have to do a lot of this

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.859 
chisel and you have to do a lot of this
back<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:34.100> what<00:01:35.100> will<00:01:35.220> happen<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.869> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
back I think what will happen is you

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.130 
back I think what will happen is you
will<00:01:37.310> basically<00:01:38.310> wear<00:01:38.850> out<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:40.159> those<00:01:41.159> side

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
will basically wear out that those side

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.480 
will basically wear out that those side
pieces<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:45.420> will<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:46.490> what's

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
pieces here and you will get what's

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.370 
pieces here and you will get what's
known<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.880> flat<00:01:48.119> back<00:01:49.159> which<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
known as a flat back which is it the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.679 
known as a flat back which is it the
chisel<00:01:52.680> still<00:01:52.860> works<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.329> it's

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
chisel still works but it's not it's

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.870 
chisel still works but it's not it's
kind<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.869> taboo<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.619> traditional<00:01:56.490> Japanese

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
kind of taboo in traditional Japanese

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
tool world so don't do that and this is

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.190 
tool world so don't do that and this is
already<00:02:02.159> there<00:02:02.460> now<00:02:02.670> I've<00:02:03.540> got<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> nice<00:02:03.930> even

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
already there now I've got a nice even

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.620 
already there now I've got a nice even
scratch<00:02:05.100> pattern<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> way<00:02:05.790> down<00:02:06.000> and

scratch pattern all the way down and
I've<00:02:07.079> got<00:02:07.229> two<00:02:07.409> nice<00:02:09.140> kind<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.229> flat<00:02:10.800> areas<00:02:11.220> on

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
I've got two nice kind of flat areas on

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.720 
I've got two nice kind of flat areas on
either<00:02:11.520> side

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
either side

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.559 
either side
so<00:02:13.530> now<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.860> wanna<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:15.760> want<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.060> have<00:02:16.209> like<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
so now I wanna we want to have like the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.220 
so now I wanna we want to have like the
polish<00:02:16.810> in<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:16.959> stage<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:19.800> use<00:02:20.800> natural<00:02:21.370> stones

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
polish in the stage I use natural stones

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.460 
polish in the stage I use natural stones
I<00:02:23.260> have<00:02:23.769> man-made<00:02:24.370> as<00:02:24.790> well<00:02:25.060> but<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:26.080> don't<00:02:26.200> like

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
I have man-made as well but I don't like

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.670 
I have man-made as well but I don't like
them<00:02:26.680> as<00:02:26.920> much<00:02:28.200> especially<00:02:29.200> for<00:02:29.319> Japanese

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
them as much especially for Japanese

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.320 
them as much especially for Japanese
tools<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.160> find<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.760> natural<00:02:31.120> stones

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
tools I find that the natural stones

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.350 
tools I find that the natural stones
work<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.870> lot<00:02:32.080> nicer<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:33.700> flatten<00:02:34.030> these<00:02:34.150> as

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
work a lot nicer and I flatten these as

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.110 
work a lot nicer and I flatten these as
well<00:02:34.510> with<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.780> diamond<00:02:35.080> plate<00:02:35.940> prior<00:02:36.940> to

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
well with the diamond plate prior to

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.229 
well with the diamond plate prior to
using<00:02:37.300> here<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:39.459> same<00:02:39.610> thing<00:02:39.819> here<00:02:40.030> just

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
using here and the same thing here just

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.890 
using here and the same thing here just
given<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.720> light<00:02:41.489> going<00:02:42.489> over<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:45.780> there<00:02:46.780> we

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
given the light going over and there we

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.150 
given the light going over and there we
go<00:02:47.049> all<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.680> scratches<00:02:47.920> from<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.280> diamond

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
go all the scratches from the diamond

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.850 
go all the scratches from the diamond
stone<00:02:51.160> I've<00:02:51.459> taken<00:02:51.760> out<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.989> that's<00:02:53.170> enough

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
stone I've taken out so that's enough

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.259 
stone I've taken out so that's enough
this<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.910> an<00:02:55.510> hour<00:02:55.989> tour<00:02:56.579> it's<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.730> kind<00:02:58.239> of

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
this is a an hour tour it's a kind of

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.380 
this is a an hour tour it's a kind of
medium<00:02:58.860> medium<00:02:59.860> stone<00:03:00.430> it's<00:03:00.880> quite<00:03:01.120> soft

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
medium medium stone it's quite soft

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.620 
medium medium stone it's quite soft
which<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.290> not<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.680> good<00:03:02.829> for<00:03:02.890> tools<00:03:03.510> but<00:03:04.510> it's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
which is not so good for tools but it's

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.789 
which is not so good for tools but it's
a<00:03:04.660> pretty<00:03:04.810> standard<00:03:05.310> natural<00:03:06.310> stone<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.620> from

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
a pretty standard natural stone so from

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.690 
a pretty standard natural stone so from
that<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:13.599> a<00:03:13.630> sweeter<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.829> some<00:03:15.280> sort<00:03:15.519> I

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
that this is a sweeter of some sort I

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.270 
that this is a sweeter of some sort I
can't<00:03:15.880> remember<00:03:16.000> where<00:03:16.209> it's<00:03:16.299> from<00:03:16.480> but<00:03:17.280> this

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
can't remember where it's from but this

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.059 
can't remember where it's from but this
is<00:03:18.430> my<00:03:18.609> kind<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.030> next<00:03:19.209> step<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:20.069> again

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
is my kind of next step and again

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.770 
is my kind of next step and again
flattened<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.829> want<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.040> give<00:03:24.160> this<00:03:24.780> very

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
flattened and you want to give this very

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:34.160 
flattened and you want to give this very
light<00:03:26.519> coming<00:03:27.519> over

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.870 

and<00:03:34.790> that<00:03:35.790> looks<00:03:35.970> good<00:03:36.410> so<00:03:37.410> that's<00:03:37.560> done<00:03:37.880> and

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
and that looks good so that's done and

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.449 
and that looks good so that's done and
finally<00:03:39.390> this<00:03:40.050> is<00:03:42.560> Tamiya<00:03:43.560> from<00:03:44.209> somewhere

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
finally this is Tamiya from somewhere

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.460 
finally this is Tamiya from somewhere
this<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.580> my<00:03:47.730> finishing<00:03:48.150> stone<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:49.410> is

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
this is my finishing stone this is

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.050 
this is my finishing stone this is
usually<00:03:49.740> as<00:03:49.980> fine<00:03:50.160> as<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.370> go

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
usually as fine as I go

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.710 
usually as fine as I go
this<00:03:52.050> isn't<00:03:52.350> ultra<00:03:52.709> fine<00:03:53.030> but<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.540> is

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
this isn't ultra fine but this is

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.440 
this isn't ultra fine but this is
definitely<00:03:55.110> good<00:03:55.350> enough<00:03:55.560> for<00:03:55.709> most<00:03:56.420> work<00:03:59.450> and

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
definitely good enough for most work and

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.330 
definitely good enough for most work and
that's<00:04:00.930> it

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.750 

natural<00:04:05.340> stones<00:04:05.580> they<00:04:05.940> don't<00:04:06.120> produce<00:04:06.330> the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
natural stones they don't produce the

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.670 
natural stones they don't produce the
kind<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.820> a<00:04:09.030> mirror<00:04:09.270> edge<00:04:09.510> or<00:04:09.959> mirror<00:04:10.380> finish

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
kind of a mirror edge or mirror finish

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.220 
kind of a mirror edge or mirror finish
so<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.670> can<00:04:11.790> see<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.120> all<00:04:12.450> may<00:04:12.600> be<00:04:12.630> fancy<00:04:12.959> but

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
so you can see this all may be fancy but

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.849 
so you can see this all may be fancy but
it's<00:04:13.500> kind<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:13.920> dull<00:04:14.340> like<00:04:14.850> hazed<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.859> I

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
it's kind of dull like hazed and I

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.340 
it's kind of dull like hazed and I
actually<00:04:17.100> like<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.549> look<00:04:17.730> it's<00:04:18.720> kind<00:04:19.320> of

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
actually like that look it's kind of

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.500 
actually like that look it's kind of
more<00:04:20.959> refined<00:04:21.959> though<00:04:22.140> yes<00:04:22.350> so<00:04:23.300> now<00:04:24.300> with<00:04:24.450> the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
more refined though yes so now with the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.560 
more refined though yes so now with the
back<00:04:24.660> time<00:04:25.669> it's<00:04:26.669> time<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:26.970> move<00:04:27.090> on<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.330> the

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
back time it's time to move on to the

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:35.030 
back time it's time to move on to the
actual<00:04:27.870> blade<00:04:28.200> itself<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:32.750> same<00:04:33.750> thing<00:04:34.040> this

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
actual blade itself and same thing this

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.880 
actual blade itself and same thing this
comes<00:04:35.610> pretty<00:04:35.850> flat<00:04:36.120> as<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.200> kind<00:04:37.800> of

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
comes pretty flat as it is and kind of

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.290 
comes pretty flat as it is and kind of
slightly<00:04:38.100> polished<00:04:38.460> but<00:04:38.729> it's<00:04:38.850> obviously<00:04:39.120> not

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
slightly polished but it's obviously not

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.320 
slightly polished but it's obviously not
home<00:04:39.810> sharp<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:41.280> I'll<00:04:41.430> start<00:04:41.760> again<00:04:41.910> with<00:04:42.240> this

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
home sharp so I'll start again with this

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.240 
home sharp so I'll start again with this
Auto<00:04:42.600> and<00:04:44.330> I'll<00:04:45.330> give<00:04:45.690> it<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:46.830> find<00:04:47.100> your

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
Auto and I'll give it you find your

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.430 
Auto and I'll give it you find your
bevel<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:47.790> it's<00:04:48.180> just<00:04:48.360> standard<00:04:49.290> shopping

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
bevel and it's just standard shopping

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.570 
bevel and it's just standard shopping
with<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.530> chisel<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:53.010> narrow<00:04:53.310> it's

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
with the chisel this narrow it's

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:04.160 
with the chisel this narrow it's
actually<00:04:53.850> quite<00:04:54.060> hard<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.450> hand

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.060 

just<00:05:05.170> a<00:05:05.230> bit<00:05:05.530> more<00:05:05.560> there<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:08.620> can<00:05:08.770> see<00:05:08.920> I'm

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
just a bit more there you can see I'm

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.090 
just a bit more there you can see I'm
actually<00:05:09.340> doing<00:05:09.610> this<00:05:09.760> sideways<00:05:10.800> most<00:05:11.800> people

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
actually doing this sideways most people

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.960 
actually doing this sideways most people
they<00:05:12.190> do<00:05:12.310> it<00:05:12.370> kind<00:05:12.550> of<00:05:12.640> bagging<00:05:13.090> Li<00:05:14.730> you<00:05:15.730> can<00:05:15.790> do

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
they do it kind of bagging Li you can do

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:41.469 
they do it kind of bagging Li you can do
that<00:05:16.090> too<00:05:19.980> and<00:05:22.890> bit<00:05:23.890> more

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:52.210 

better

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:06:08.040 

it's<00:05:53.180> looking<00:05:53.600> good<00:05:53.780> so<00:05:54.380> that's<00:05:54.590> done<00:05:58.510> Sita
