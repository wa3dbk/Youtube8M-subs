00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.070
 Hello, my name is calling me 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.170
 I come to tell you that you are 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.200
 contributing you are contributing as your name 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.200
 what it says is to throw and carry you're going to 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.970
 then contribute to your baby then in what 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.029
 it consists so much contributing they are contributing 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.329
 consists of techniques and help for the 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.329
 mom 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.940
 being a mom suddenly dropped me by surprise 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.520
 and then I came here because I loved it 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.870
 dance and found everything here 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.610
 I enjoyed 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:21.760
 They are totally raffling and the best 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.760
 of the case is that now I can not 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.070
 Hello 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.320
 the dance platform are therefore what 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.330
 what are your evaluations the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.100
 evaluations are to see the state 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.350
 physical condition in which the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.680
 mothers in order to rehabilitate the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.680
 they 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.980
 good are you contributing is the continuation 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.980
 of physical activation during 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.879
 during pregnancy you are contributing 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.430
 participate let's say an activity 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:44.280
 playful of a physical activity in a 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.280
 close congruence between more of you 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.920
 what follows is what is the 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.140
 music therapy music therapy makes 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.870
 help the babies to stimulate and also 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.760
 to relax the mom and that release of 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.370
 this is helping to have an adaptation 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.970
 free and healthy and thus have a production 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.970
 milk 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.909
 the improvement of all this is that moms 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.799
 they contain better oxygenation not 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.860
 the feet swell all the pains of the 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.849
 pregnancy decreases and in postpartum 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.730
 what it does is that you have a 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.730
 rehabilitation with greater haste 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.209
 that is, for us to propose a 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.530
 objective we need to make some 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.349
 evaluations some measurements 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.290
 specific as they are stature weight 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.860
 body mass index percentage 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.380
 fat minimally 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.530
 so that for us to evaluate 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.990
 how it evolves 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.750
 and the mother's body 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.700
 what are the benefits 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.610
 and we can hire them in a way 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.500
 objective the other aspect would be a 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.200
 resistance that would be a bit test 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.490
 more specific this could be through 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.070
 the ship course protocol that is a 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.120
 distance of 20 meters that gives a few 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.010
 departures and makes different stadiums and the 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.100
 another would be a cooper that is a test 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.320
 of 12 minutes trying to achieve a 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.200
 maximum distance in those 12 2 minutes 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.960
 it was a 400 meter track with these 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.510
 parameters that would be the minimum 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.510
 We could do a preliminary evaluation 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.360
 and later in the course of 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.370
 three months to do a control test and 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.800
 be supervising the participants 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.870
 periodically for us to see 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.870
 the percentage of profit 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.370
 no no 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.280
 the benefit 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.140
 physical or in aspect 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.930
 cardiovascular although helped because there 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.500
 an activation the ideal activation for 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:02.310
 this exercise should be light between 165 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.250
 and 75 percent maximum frequency 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.100
 Cardiac frequency 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.100
 cardiac of the mother but this let's say 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.900
 the muscle benefit is not 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.060
 and the most important 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.000
 bonding affective type and 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:22.090
 emotional that there is in the body body 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.600
 share a socializing activity and 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.440
 a playful activity 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.440
 Mother 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.409
 d 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.409
 but the proposal 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.020
 no no 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:25.820
 contribute to parenting with an attachment 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.410
 music therapy this sounds like importer and 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.560
 after we have all that you go 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.700
 to dance with Afro-Latin rhythms 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.100
 so we're waiting for you to compromise 

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:38.140
 carrying and after concluding all this 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.140
 to not accuse us to dance thank you
