 so much a headset series as well 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.010
 user's manual 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.460
 samsung exterior with 85 2 rooms were empty 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.069
 scientists from Russia 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:11.139
 the device is lighter and thinner than most 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.429
 their competitors 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.129
 its thickness is only 10 and 9 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.669
 ten millimeters 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:22.319
 application 118 solution 56 millimeters samsung with 805 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.419
 November 2 were tested 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.699
 screen model 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.579
 made by technology super amoled 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.769
 its diagonal is 3 and 3 tenths of an inch 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.950
 and the resolution is 480 by 800 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:35.760
 points 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.120
 if, by permission, our models find 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.700
 all strong competitors so far 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.780
 purely image brightness itself 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.390
 hardly 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.990
 This is the most intense and vivid picture. 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.940
 more accessible today 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.710
 and this is a technical miracle 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.610
 behaves great in any 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.540
 conditions 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.490
 there was no home just huge 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.570
 and in the brightest sun the screen is not 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.740
 it just stays readable 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.750
 shows itself in all its glory and 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.220
 completely incorrect 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.450
 It will not be loudly said that this is the most 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.380
 best screen at the moment on 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.670
 mobile device market display 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.730
 made by capacitive technology with 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.860
 application to subside the screen quickly and clearly 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.360
 reacts to touch 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.240
 fingers 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.780
 device speed 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.250
 provides us with a smaller processor arm 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.850
 cortex a8 with a frequency of 1 gigahertz it is three 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.600
 fastest possible at this 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.890
 competitors moment 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.590
 plus everything samsung from 85 November 2 says has 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.630
 powerful graphics processor pavel 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.130
 other ports of Russia 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.179
 here are the words 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:35.359
 battery capacity 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.360
 battery equals 1500 billionaire hours 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.330
 which is justified with such a powerful 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.620
 the processor 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.470
 This allows the device to work up to 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.650
 five become hours standby 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.990
 offended talk 500 minutes 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.390
 samsung tec 85 2 car numbers produced in 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.330
 two versions of internal memory 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.240
 Alena two gigabytes of 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.090
 passengers 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.860
 there is also a memory card slot 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.210
 micro and judge cards up to 32 gigabytes 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.940
 work without problems 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.510
 this plan he is running 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.810
 proprietary operating system 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.840
 bada 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.039
 user interface drag if 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.050
 3.0 now you can create bbc 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.509
 work tables 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.399
 panels have beautiful seamless animation 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.659
 Screens can be visited to 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.699
 get the fastest access to 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.069
 frequently used applications 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.140
 In standby 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.339
 three desktops are not displayed 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:29.319
 on each of which can be placed 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.259
 several visits initially and 20 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.209
 but this amount is optional 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.889
 increase the built-in accelerometer 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.459
 running fast screen orientation 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.129
 changes without problems 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.999
 you can not view photos 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.469
 touching the story 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.519
 for this, simply tilt 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.379
 apparatus 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.239
 but to turn off the sound either lands 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.299
 just turn the phone 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.389
 in addition, you can open applications 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.230
 pats the case to enter 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.209
 characters using advice Alena and Katya 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.639
 keyboard 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.809
 because of the small screen size on 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:03.759
 not very convenient but easier there 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.849
 that is, the usual alphanumeric 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.189
 keyboard and handwritten per year 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.489
 the player is very convenient and powerful 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.169
 the processor provides 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.319
 no hangs at 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.489
 recycled from one fragment to another 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.150
 Naturally that on such a device 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.349
 Internet access provided 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.150
 for this there is a special browser 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.840
 flash doctor 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.590
 which makes it possible 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.729
 view online streaming video 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.819
 on flash does not work everywhere premiere 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.759
 listen to music social networks do not 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.999
 it will be otherwise quite comfortable 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.509
 internet browser 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.679
 get there as Egypt has a receiver 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:38.439
 preinstalled application for 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.599
 navigation 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.939
 works and they are fast and good 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.079
 may well replace car 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.659
 samsung navigator with 85 2 left and quite 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.559
 extraordinary quite successful 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:50.419
 instance 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.549
 elegantly enclosed powerfully 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.089
 standing communicator 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.399
 In many respects, this model does not have 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:58.989
 analogues and obvious competitors is not easy 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.090
 incredible screen quality 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.499
 but she herself is not that unavailable 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:07.029
 it's safe to say samsung with 85 2 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:09.199
 on the left of that stand 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.459
 sites ugits anyone threatens to shop 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.299
 what Euroset network if provided 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.180
 phone 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.699
 device speed 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.599
 provides the most powerful 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.599
 no one else decide 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.180
 replaced 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.370
 more 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.260
 both countries see themselves as language on condition 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.800
 what falls 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.159
 device speed 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.159
 provides the most powerful
