00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.920
 and welcome to today cost it comes 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.320
 again a recipe wish and this time 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.519
 from marina she wanted to have something with 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.230
 paprika brush and asked them wanted now 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.060
 Although have chopped spinach 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.740
 but I just have a few now 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.189
 player taken note goes the same way 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.219
 good and I'll think of it 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.469
 stuffed peppers do too 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.710
 Now we are the first with this stupid 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.579
 case about 25 grams and none 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:49.649
 I onions same time into small cubes 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.870
 cut and protect is the same 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.219
 at times 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.860
 best again a well coated 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.210
 pan and a little oil I take 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.960
 olive oil now when i travel 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.960
 come to give the goals 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.950
 and they just stew glassy 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.430
 By the way, you can already get the cup 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.840
 take and in the bowl a bit 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:23.409
 to press and the short time you can 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:27.830
 to give up the popo he needs two more 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:32.570
 medium tomatoes are also quite simple 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:35.619
 cut into small pieces about 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.619
 the size would be enough 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.179
 I can you fill-sometimes even 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.920
 Girls are allowed a bit 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:51.979
 paprika powder fit again 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:53.390
 Do you know the chains thus support 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.240
 take the title then you can 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:02.209
 which gives thematic and whole club 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.979
 you two to three quarters of the seats 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.979
 to and has a daze 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.410
 So that could just be what I wanted 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.050
 now two different variants 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.740
 Try filling the peppers and 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:25.380
 although once from above and once in the 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:29.930
 I would be the paprika because we varied 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.950
 The best way to get in from above is at an angle 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.950
 with the lids afterwards also good again 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:44.820
 you can put on it tomorrow the strunk 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:49.440
 around and inside you can completely 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.070
 simply by hand or with it 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.720
 scrape out 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:58.440
 best the white as well as it gets 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.730
 not just take out in the European Cup 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.920
 should be where it is actually 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.500
 Okay, well then you can do it below 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.780
 just a little cut off so she 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.269
 nice and straight stands and the other places 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:23.130
 quite simply halve and 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:25.100
 best a shield sharp knife then 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.970
 you need your spinach 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.030
 I have now emerged here 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.230
 you have to play a bit 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.660
 Express when your fresh is 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.420
 of course much better 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.060
 just a little bit of salt 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.190
 and when everyone starts to fill up 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:45.090
 I will be here now in the schedule 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:50.570
 cut open a bit first 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.570
 player also distributes nice pure press 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.500
 and then the filling 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:04.260
 In any case, press firmly and now 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.610
 the upright in the bell pepper her 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.700
 can I also want the gamblers with the 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.209
 Filling mission and the peppers 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.530
 come complete with it 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.260
 but I hope we just hope 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.230
 just a very nice picture afterwards 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.070
 if it is cut open it will 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.070
 will work 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.090
 Here I give the now purely alternately 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.130
 So always a bit of a player then 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:36.590
 again a little filling everything stuck 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:36.590
 press spinat again a bit and 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:46.800
 the lid a bit on top of it 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:49.440
 Press and finish technical data sauce 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.020
 Cook or just stir cold, for example 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.610
 the vegan when I had pizza 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.000
 but just add a little water 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.990
 bit of powder taken because I'm sitting 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.620
 now the peppers in and then 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.620
 will all the luggage 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.740
 290 degrees about five hours 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.820
 it could also last longer 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:23.100
 if you want to look like it now 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:25.670
 Looks like that looks definitely 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:30.690
 ever find delicious 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:38.090
 let's see how that cut open 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:38.090
 looks with a very sharp knife 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.310
 here looks cool in any case 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.770
 Many thanks to Maria for this great 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.020
