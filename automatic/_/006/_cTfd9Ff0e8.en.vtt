00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.130
 which I'm going to show you a tweet that you see 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.250
 to do is very fundamental basic 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.500
 which is called activator this top 10 and 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.020
 we are going to add many many 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.990
 benefits to our device which 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.340
 I'm going to show you is an example one 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.530
 which is one of my favorites 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.260
 It is compatible with all devices 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.570
 no more they have to go do or not 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.940
 they have to add no repo here they go 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.220
 to write activator 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.870
 here the option will appear here and 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.180
 I have installed the van to speak here in 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.220
 install then they will give you in confirm 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.580
 I see I do it because I have it 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.050
 installed 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.770
 after this he will ask you for a 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.909
 small respite 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.229
 Now what you are going to do is go to settings 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.730
 they will reach a preference in 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.440
 settings 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.970
 to teach an example of what they can 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.970
 do with this tweet 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.730
 is active and with those and an option 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.620
 it says anywhere it says in 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.280
 the home screen in an application 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.900
 and on the lock screen what we're going 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.700
 to do in this example that I'm going to 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.310
 show that your new favorites is 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.860
 put on lock screen after 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.850
 lock screen let's pick on 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.430
 volume buttons 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.680
 here in volume buttons to choose 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.870
 short pressure down 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.440
 short print down the slight one 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.679
 they are going to look for an option what is seen 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.020
 previous after this way back and 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.180
 they will choose now short press 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.700
 up and they will choose track 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.780
 next as I have it the track 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.510
 next can find the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.920
 options at the end 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.260
 here is next track previous track 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.390
 after this we are going to leave now you 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.490
 let's give an example of what it does 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.930
 this on the lock screen I'm going to 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.930
 put a music 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.120
 Here as you see, my music starts 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.230
 after this I'm going to press the button 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:52.630
 of volume up to go away 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.630
 to the next track for example 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.010
 and I started was the next song now 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.459
 I'll show you an example again in 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.459
 The next 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.310
 the next song is changed as you see 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.830
 on the lock screen this serves me 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.460
 a lot to me to not be unlocking 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.320
 every moment the device 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.070
 we can not give an example with the button 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.520
 from previous song 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.910
 to see what the previous track is 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.910
 again 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.630
 and the previous track goes away this is one of 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.180
 the solutions that gives us activator 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.690
 Clear activists gives us many options 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.780
 I have activated a point that in the 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.180
 battle on my carrier's screen 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.910
 so much so that in the carrier so access to 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.120
 me to my multitasking 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.570
 is an example of a journey towards 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.760
 right to the right is an option 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.070
 that does not add sbsettings a twist 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.480
 lazy that my opinion is very good 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.629
 It is also very basic 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.730
 well, this is practically all 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.220

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.920
