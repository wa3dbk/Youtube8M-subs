position you're ready to swing forward

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.720 
position you're ready to swing forward
and<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:25.170> motion<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.619> relatively<00:00:26.160> simple<00:00:26.519> from

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
and the motion is relatively simple from

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.370 
and the motion is relatively simple from
the<00:00:26.849> L<00:00:26.970> position<00:00:27.180> which<00:00:27.630> I'm<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.930> here<00:00:28.230> I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the L position which I'm in here I

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.310 
the L position which I'm in here I
simply<00:00:29.369> drop<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.269> racket<00:00:30.779> down<00:00:30.990> onto<00:00:31.260> my

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
shoulder and right now I'm in the exact

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
shoulder and right now I'm in the exact
same<00:00:34.469> body<00:00:34.739> position<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
same body position I was in in the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.020 
same body position I was in in the
previous<00:00:36.870> video<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.590> transition<00:00:38.309> from

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
previous video so the transition from

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.080 
previous video so the transition from
the<00:00:39.360> L<00:00:39.510> position<00:00:39.719> here<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.500> again<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the L position here it is again to the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.810 
the L position here it is again to the
previous<00:00:42.930> position<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.040> position<00:00:44.370> from<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
previous position the position from the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.049 
previous position the position from the
previous<00:00:45.270> videos<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:46.050> very<00:00:46.890> very<00:00:47.219> simple<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
previous videos is very very simple and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.439 
previous videos is very very simple and
this<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.140> very<00:00:49.680> similar<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.190> transitioning<00:00:51.180> to

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
this is very similar to transitioning to

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.209 
this is very similar to transitioning to
the<00:00:51.719> racket<00:00:51.989> drop<00:00:52.230> again<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.739> not<00:00:52.920> quite

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the racket drop again it's not quite

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.490 
the racket drop again it's not quite
there<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.449> don't<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> try<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.260> get

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
there but you don't want to try and get

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.110 
there but you don't want to try and get
to<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> racket<00:00:56.070> drop<00:00:56.309> when<00:00:56.760> you're<00:00:56.940> first

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
to the racket drop when you're first

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.760 
to the racket drop when you're first
building<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.719> serve<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.350> perfectly

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
building your serve this is perfectly

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.090 
building your serve this is perfectly
fine<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.420> let's<00:01:00.420> watch<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:00.989> more<00:01:01.379> time<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
fine so let's watch it one more time and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.939 
fine so let's watch it one more time and
I<00:01:02.579> drop<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> racket<00:01:03.780> onto<00:01:04.140> my<00:01:04.260> shoulder<00:01:04.650> just

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
I drop the racket onto my shoulder just

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.300 
I drop the racket onto my shoulder just
lightly<00:01:05.250> tap<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.000> swing<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.930> edge

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
lightly tap it and then swing up on edge

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.469 
lightly tap it and then swing up on edge
pronate<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.909> course<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> weight

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
pronate and of course the weight

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.810 
pronate and of course the weight
transfer<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> body<00:01:10.320> turn<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.920> exactly

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
transfer and the body turn is exactly

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.750 
transfer and the body turn is exactly
the<00:01:12.030> same<00:01:12.270> from<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.560> previous<00:01:14.189> steps<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the same from the previous steps the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.929 
the same from the previous steps the
previous<00:01:15.180> videos<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.320> section<00:01:16.729> now<00:01:17.729> that

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
previous videos in this section now that

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.460 
previous videos in this section now that
you've<00:01:18.060> got<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.390> basic<00:01:18.780> motion<00:01:19.020> down

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you've got the basic motion down

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.100 
you've got the basic motion down
starting<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> L<00:01:20.520> position<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.930> add

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
starting in the L position you can add

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.469 
starting in the L position you can add
the<00:01:22.619> toss<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.250> try<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.759> hit<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> tennis<00:01:24.210> ball

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the toss and try and hit the tennis ball

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.870 
the toss and try and hit the tennis ball
and<00:01:24.720> again<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.490> previous

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and again just like in the previous

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.240 
and again just like in the previous
video<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.960> want<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.259> do<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.740> slow<00:01:29.100> as

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
video you want to do this as slow as

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.280 
video you want to do this as slow as
possible<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:30.060> hit<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> ball<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.840> soft<00:01:31.079> as

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
possible and hit the ball as soft as

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.960 
possible and hit the ball as soft as
possible<00:01:31.320> trying<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.130> get<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.850> bounce

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
possible trying to get it to bounce

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.120 
possible trying to get it to bounce
three<00:01:33.420> times<00:01:33.780> before<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.320> gets<00:01:34.500> gets<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
three times before it gets gets to the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.670 
three times before it gets gets to the
baseline<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.720> will<00:01:36.869> allow<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
baseline and that will allow you to

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.270 
baseline and that will allow you to
really<00:01:38.159> work<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.670> technique<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.140> again<00:01:40.799> here

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
really work the technique so again here

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.370 
really work the technique so again here
I<00:01:41.310> am<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> L<00:01:41.820> position<00:01:42.000> I'm<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.200> toss

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
I am in the L position I'm going to toss

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.530 
I am in the L position I'm going to toss
the<00:01:43.590> tennis<00:01:43.860> ball<00:01:44.070> racquet<00:01:44.759> drops<00:01:45.000> onto<00:01:45.420> my
