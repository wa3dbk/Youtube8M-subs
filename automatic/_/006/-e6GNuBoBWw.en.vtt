in the new s-class we created a very
central<00:02:53.570> design<00:02:54.110> for<00:02:54.500> our<00:02:54.530> dashboard<00:02:55.040> but

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
central design for our dashboard but

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.520 
central design for our dashboard but

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
next to that we wanted to give the car

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.130 
next to that we wanted to give the car
this<00:02:57.770> ultimate<00:02:58.670> expression<00:02:59.240> of<00:02:59.510> high

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
this ultimate expression of high

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.930 
this ultimate expression of high
technology<00:03:00.710> and<00:03:00.950> therefore<00:03:01.790> we've

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
technology and therefore we've

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.530 
technology and therefore we've
integrated<00:03:02.300> this<00:03:03.170> huge<00:03:03.770> unit<00:03:04.340> with<00:03:04.910> two<00:03:05.270> flat

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
integrated this huge unit with two flat

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.620 
integrated this huge unit with two flat
screens<00:03:05.900> into<00:03:06.710> this<00:03:07.040> very<00:03:07.370> organic<00:03:07.550> world<00:03:08.180> and

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
screens into this very organic world and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.680 
screens into this very organic world and
that<00:03:09.170> was<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.350> real<00:03:09.590> challenge
