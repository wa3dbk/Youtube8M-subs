00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.990
 nava 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.720
 hello how about i in the middle of her boyfriend 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.239
 for the intel itanium channel 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.210
 well in this sinister 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.640
 what is a video 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.680
 let's say it kind of informative 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.940
 n of the most useful practical commands 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.540
 from windows 7 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.430
 well you have all these commands that I'm going to give you 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.070
 if rather I have doubts 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.010
 And it is 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.050
 are to know what are owned by the system 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.610
 the kun device 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.050
 designer and on-screen keyboard 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.050
 i know the contribution of the system 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.450
 the meeting what is a document 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.620
 informing 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.260
 point 2 x 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.300
 the registration of it so that it can be downloaded 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.350
 percent 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.260
 winds these commands 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.620
 the use that of what is a manual including seven for 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.900
 to use windows 7 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.930
 and this I know that catches thread 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.480
 put in what is this 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.190
 this documents 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.640
 that got me around three pages 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.220
 sitges page 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.250
 this 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.610
 The new sample is composed 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.610
 all these 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.920
 all these commands encounters 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.380
 there are two ways to use these commands 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.830
 ee one is with smd with him 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.510
 simÃ³ the system 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.660
 or with 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.360
 the executable what salaries slaughter 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.520
 this incident 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.750
 gave as an example driving 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.190
 as they were throwing equipment immune components subject disorder 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.630
 clipboard 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.560
 nine discs exist 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.410
 this wind 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.600
 after an example is very simple 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.810
 I repeat is sunk totally informative more than anything 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.199
 this 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.199
 because they have known that it was diagnosed 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.669
 only 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.949
 pique at what seconds more r 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.299
 and we're going to have what was said open executable we're just going to 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.809
 it contributes what it does 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.809
 in the following command the cyst 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.169
 they will go santa 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.749
 and well here museum people properties and 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.149
 the dyn diagnostic tool I threw him ex 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.199
 this can replace what the 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:43.709
 I will tell you 64 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:44.709
 households 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.709
 I repeat there is another way to use what the commands are not 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.549
 in with the minsa m 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:57.869
 let's see what is the management of disk partitions 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.759
 It's just that write 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.939
 if you confirm the administrator we say yes 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.499
 come here to not like what a small window is 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.559
 cheese in the list of patients with 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.950
 it depends a lot on what conditions to see what the command is 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.679
 already seedless wen 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:25.629
 the normal executable 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.659
 porfi amosal what yes 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.659
 normal guilty 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.549
 it can not be presented differently 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.889
 ii the visualization 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.889
 according to the command 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.959
 although here as ours 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.369
 it was said that you feel 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:51.459
 this forest good what if this commented I repeat descended 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.499
 so they can get what their alleged 'command' 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.749
 that can serve them in some occasion dike 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:02.009
 Northeast running or properly your computer 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.199
 and that thanks to some command of these 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.249
 good to do more practical 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:09.129
 or can they solve 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.129
 your problem is that you have 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.469
 and this document comes and I leave it description of the video 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.999
 iniesta uploaded to lamego silver server 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:21.519
 that is not compressed is just comfortable commented doc 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.800
 well and without more to say I leave you with the video 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.800
 they put us one 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.319
 I'm going to put the feet in quick version this video 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.319
 in what I do all the momposina commands 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.849
 until now 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:13.579
 Program
