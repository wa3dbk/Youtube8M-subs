00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.690
 Teams okay 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.300
 Today I'm going to teach you here, mockery. 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.820
 stuffed with nutella and you will see how 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.680
 it's easy and it gets really tasty 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.099
 let's make the first step of the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.710
 recipe is to make the pasta where I 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.779
 I'll mix the dry ingredients. 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.390
 first I've had flour that 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.760
 She's already sifted and I'm going to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.129
 yeast this package not right here 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.370
 then we put that sugar gives entou 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.680
 a money mix for them to stay 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.899
 all mixed together make a hole that a 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.809
 here the middle and I'll put the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.870
 butter and I have to repeat for 30 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.100
 seconds in the microwave 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:03.000
 the goal was a knock together that also 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.470
 for milk that is in a good state and there 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.130
 people give a mixed one to find jade 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.130
 in the mass 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:26.060
 now there's no way you have to put the 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:29.090
 hands - on remembering that I'm 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.969
 getting while I'm stirring 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.549
 here is mass as the important thing is to leave 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:37.459
 a little bit of flour donated by chance 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.060
 stick a lot comes a little bit just 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:43.069
 to detach and keep stirring now 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.429
 Take ours out of the bowl and we'll go 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:49.340
 save for 15 minutes for her to stay 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.829
 soft and grow a lot 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.140
 the little group picks up flour 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.090
 play a little, no problem 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.509
 ready look how she is not helping 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.209
 more in the hand I make a little ball here and 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.390
 I'm going back, she protects, she'll cover 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.500
 one year and I'll let it grow by 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.819
 volume doubling 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.739
 more or less about 30 minutes 40 around 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.319
 My mass has grown 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:19.340
 I'm going to take it out of the bowl and I'm going 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:25.220
 put under the floured stone back 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.280
 in four and you stop I'll work one 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:39.669
 each time they 'll make a little ball here and 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:39.669
 leave it on the side I'll open this piece 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.780
 round 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.230
 It does not hurt that she is not totally 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.390
 round because I'll pass a tip 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.490
 no sooner does it get too thin 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.950
 You see the thickness of it now I go 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.530
 take a plate to give the format well 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.540
 round in the crowd to stay cool 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.000
 then we cut with the bag and strip 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.430
 This little fat here does not work . 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.340
 I also got round, I got 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.739
 to accelerate from the surroundings as well 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.360
 I put a sheet of buttered paper 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.920
 up here is where I'm going to put the 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.820
 pasta 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.380
 I'm going to hit it here the screen is a 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.110
 little hard then what I did 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.390
 I put a little here in a little pot and 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.640
 of you in a microwave for 10 seconds 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.530
 20 seconds until soft because otherwise 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.910
 I can not pass you by, we'll go. 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.910
 to caprichar on earth that 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:06.980
 now I'm going to get the other dough and do 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:22.180
 I can do the same with all 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:27.380
 I usually pull it out but that 's how it is. 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:32.449
 For me to give trouble and I'll take it up 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:35.539
 This one's going to be very, very correct. 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.139
 getting it right for sure does not 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.760
 Ill fell here, we'll hit it. 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:44.120
 soon this co 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.320
 I'll put another layer of nutella 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.320
 very generous 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.160
 you saw what's left right clay 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.470
 So, how delicious is it that I go? 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.380
 do not throw away and I will do 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.870
 balls in and I do all this with the dough 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.050
 that's left we will not miss anything right? 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.789
 and neither layers with the help of a glass 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.430
 just to centralize for us to do the 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.680
 cut the ingredients and the amounts 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.820
 are below in the video description 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.690
 on Youtube 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.690
 I think it will cut 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.120
 I'll take a glass, just to leave it. 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.530
 I have this most beautiful we will 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.530
 like it and four again 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:46.239
 So cool, we'll get it later. 

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:53.109
 two parts and make two out two 

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:55.619
 ruan times the two come here and stick to 

00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:58.509
 here i point 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:06:01.659
 I'll do it again 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:09.969
 It takes two shares something right 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:14.859
 rolls out twice a couple of 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:17.579
 sticks booties here and I will do in 

00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:17.579
 all of them 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:27.909
 we made it end here primping 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:30.749
 better closing what is silver said that 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.749
 she does not escape 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.990
 now quit with the gem 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.729
 let's get going then 20 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.440
 I'll finish the oven minutes. 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:53.440
 decorating with confectioner's sugar 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.380
 I put a penny in and I'm playing for 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.380

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:14.170
