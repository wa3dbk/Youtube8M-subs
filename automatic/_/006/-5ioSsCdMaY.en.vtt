comfortable with this team being in this

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.189 
comfortable with this team being in this
position<00:04:58.550> then<00:04:59.240> maybe<00:04:59.449> they<00:04:59.659> were<00:04:59.720> even<00:04:59.960> a

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
position then maybe they were even a

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.080

year<00:05:00.380> ago<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:00.979> number<00:05:01.370> one<00:05:01.520> seed<00:05:01.729> in<00:05:01.849> the<00:05:01.970> NCAA

tourney<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:03.800> know<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:03.919> think<00:05:04.069> it's<00:05:04.639> really

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
tourney you know I think it's really

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.450 
tourney you know I think it's really
this<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.389> same<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:06.110> same<00:05:06.139> team<00:05:06.530> yeah<00:05:07.069> I<00:05:07.220> don't

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
this the same the same team yeah I don't

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.460 
this the same the same team yeah I don't
think<00:05:07.669> we<00:05:07.849> approached<00:05:08.690> it<00:05:08.720> any<00:05:08.990> differently

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
think we approached it any differently

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.230 
think we approached it any differently
not<00:05:10.009> that<00:05:10.159> I<00:05:10.220> think<00:05:10.400> that's<00:05:10.729> why<00:05:10.880> we're<00:05:11.090> able

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
not that I think that's why we're able

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.930 
not that I think that's why we're able
to<00:05:11.389> perform<00:05:11.750> as<00:05:12.409> we<00:05:12.740> do<00:05:12.919> because<00:05:13.190> we<00:05:13.550> don't<00:05:13.759> get

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
to perform as we do because we don't get

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.089 
to perform as we do because we don't get
too<00:05:14.120> hot<00:05:14.690> with<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:14.960> highs<00:05:15.199> or<00:05:15.229> to<00:05:15.650> load<00:05:15.830> the

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
too hot with the highs or to load the

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.309 
too hot with the highs or to load the
lows<00:05:16.310> we<00:05:17.000> kind<00:05:17.210> of<00:05:17.300> maintain<00:05:17.720> and<00:05:17.990> we<00:05:18.080> kind<00:05:18.259> of

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 
lows we kind of maintain and we kind of

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.170 
lows we kind of maintain and we kind of
stay<00:05:18.500> focused<00:05:18.949> on<00:05:19.039> the<00:05:19.099> task<00:05:19.190> at<00:05:19.610> hand<00:05:19.669> and
