in<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.460> coming<00:00:08.760> lessons<00:00:08.910> we're<00:00:09.269> going<00:00:09.389> to

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
in the coming lessons we're going to

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.660 
in the coming lessons we're going to
embark<00:00:09.809> on<00:00:10.050> some<00:00:10.410> specific<00:00:10.650> spindle<00:00:11.490> turning

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
embark on some specific spindle turning

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.879 
embark on some specific spindle turning
and<00:00:12.000> faceplate<00:00:12.540> turning<00:00:12.960> work<00:00:13.170> basically

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
and faceplate turning work basically

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.320 
and faceplate turning work basically
this<00:00:14.340> means<00:00:14.490> we're<00:00:14.700> going<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.880> do<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> whole

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
this means we're going to do a whole

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.260 
this means we're going to do a whole
bunch<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.599> different<00:00:15.900> projects<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.240> before<00:00:18.240> I

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
bunch of different projects and before I

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.300 
bunch of different projects and before I
do<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:19.170> wanted<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.680> throw<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.920> one<00:00:20.250> more

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
do that I wanted to throw in one more

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.340 
do that I wanted to throw in one more
general<00:00:21.029> lesson<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.600> discusses<00:00:21.960> some<00:00:22.260> of

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
general lesson that discusses some of

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:31.959 
general lesson that discusses some of
the<00:00:22.410> fundamentals<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.340> foot<00:00:24.000> power<00:00:24.180> turning<00:00:24.630> I

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.080 

just<00:00:32.969> take<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> series<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.719> strokes<00:00:34.820> up<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
just take a series of strokes up the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:49.940 
just take a series of strokes up the
piece<00:00:48.200> looking<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.680> cross-section

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
piece looking at this in cross-section

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.000 
piece looking at this in cross-section
now<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.059> I'm<00:00:51.239> much<00:00:51.510> much<00:00:51.809> closer<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
now you can see I'm much much closer to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:19.600 
now you can see I'm much much closer to
round<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.000> I'm<00:00:54.090> gonna

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.730 

your<00:01:20.610> body<00:01:20.850> position<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.720> relation<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
your body position in relation to the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.649 
your body position in relation to the
turning<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.310> you're<00:01:23.430> doing<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.420> raise

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
turning that you're doing as you raise

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.969 
turning that you're doing as you raise
and<00:01:24.899> lower<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.259> handle<00:01:25.740> there's<00:01:25.920> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and lower this handle there's a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.889 
and lower this handle there's a
potential<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.000> come<00:01:27.780> in

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
potential that it's going to come in

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.350 
potential that it's going to come in
contact<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.740> leg<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> lot<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> times

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
contact with your leg so a lot of times

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.830 
contact with your leg so a lot of times
you<00:01:31.049> might<00:01:31.259> need<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.680> actually<00:01:32.509> switch<00:01:33.509> legs

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you might need to actually switch legs

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
you might need to actually switch legs
which<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.619> another<00:01:35.369> transition<00:01:44.509> an<00:01:45.860> instant

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
which is another transition an instant

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.570 
which is another transition an instant
stop<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.580> switch<00:01:48.060> legs<00:01:48.950> just<00:01:49.950> stop<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
stop so I can switch legs just stop and

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.730 
stop so I can switch legs just stop and
switch<00:01:50.789> legs<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:52.050> don't<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.470> worry

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
switch legs and I don't have to worry

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.460 
switch legs and I don't have to worry
about<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.490> initial<00:01:54.149> startup<00:01:55.020> time<00:01:55.289> or

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
about that initial startup time or

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:06.230 
about that initial startup time or
anything<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.830> that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.969 

10-20-30<00:02:07.240> blanks<00:02:07.689> down<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.990> road<00:02:08.200> not<00:02:08.770> only

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
10-20-30 blanks down the road not only

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.559 
10-20-30 blanks down the road not only
will<00:02:09.099> you<00:02:09.160> be<00:02:09.190> really<00:02:09.759> good<00:02:09.940> at<00:02:10.090> knocking<00:02:10.479> the

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
will you be really good at knocking the

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.089 
will you be really good at knocking the
corners<00:02:10.929> off<00:02:11.080> with<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.319> chopping<00:02:11.709> block<00:02:11.920> or

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
corners off with the chopping block or

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.910 
corners off with the chopping block or
the<00:02:12.220> bench<00:02:12.459> but<00:02:12.970> rounding<00:02:13.630> smooth<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.410> true
