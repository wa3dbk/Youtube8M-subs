00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.409
 I get it 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.540
 Well, you are welcome to the new 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.670
 salsa section we will explain the 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.260
 new champions that are coming out in the 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.700
 such an invoking air in the flay code itself 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.279
 we started obviously with the newest 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.920
 hunter that is brown the new support or 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.750
 support has just come out and well you know 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.279
 how is not bald last good in a forum 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.890
 It's really cool I've seen those too 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.210
 push-ups that we had before and I think 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.320
 that we are going to go that we care that they are 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.670
 the skills what we all want 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.380
 see and let's start with the passive to 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.920
 please read in real time in English is 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.450
 so bolÃ³n see verÃ³n and his allies 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.460
 they work together to study a 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.829
 target after basic brawn attacks 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.690
 apply when the blog contest 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.489
 first one is that is applied ie 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.050
 the first blow also the attacks 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.340
 Basic Allies Make 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.949
 conclusions lose that is to say the first 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.269
 blow of de brown will be the one that starts that 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.039
 account but then the allies also 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.629
 can they help so he went into team fais 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.879
 it's going to be great that we're going 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.040
 to do that to hit a hit and such with 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.080
 reach four stacks the goal is 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.050
 study for about 25 seconds and 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.730
 receives 70 the magic year in addition during 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.650
 the facts the next eight seconds 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.850
 you will not be able to live stacks it's a shame 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.610
 You will be able to study all the time 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.690
 someone but they will continue to receive 14 year 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.420
 magical extra for part 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.650
 brawn so even though you can not 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.720
 apply stacks also comes in handy 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.400
 that still keep hitting now let's see 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.140
 like my partner in salsa to hit me 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.090
 those four punches and it's going to leave me 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.490
 first 1 on 2 and will be 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.320
 perfectly and the room hurts me 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.420
 magic and it's also tunea and 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.980
 any this new brawn that is 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.600
 of fire that is dragons layer 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.280
 It's fire and now I'm going to look at a sauce 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.770
 stop hitting me 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.979
 and let's stop let's see what in the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.310
 normal ice skin on the tracks 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:53.600
 but we have 12 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.130
 and 4 freezes and we'll see how in the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.159
 next eight seconds we do not make it 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.200
 this but we do not do extra magic damage and 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.549
 now let's catch an allied champion 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.560
 to be able to do the skills of the 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.670
 good allies because now we go with 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.080
 the skills of brawn works to 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.310
 keep explaining the passive because as 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.959
 We have commented before if you have a 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.450
 ally who hits basic attacks 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.530
 after you also apply those stacks 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.000
 of the passive so let's make a 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.290
 example with the dragon that the poor thing 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.930
 let's hesitate all the time to 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.120
 teach the skills and we started a 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.010
 blow I put the passive let's say how 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.780
 part of any passive they are placed 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.580
 at the time and it manages to explode so 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.190
 well the more ally they are hitting 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.430
 in this case the enemy more are 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.080
 we will apply and it will be much easier 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.360
 put them tuna and the bot line goes to 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.420
 noticing enough now let's go with the cv 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.340
 directly the bite of winter in 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.780
 English or wing in Spanish or winters bait 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.600
 in English 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.030
 Brawn makes a hit of ice from his 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.440
 shield doing 130 damage to level 3 a 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.700
 level 1 I think it was far less 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.210
 plus 36 that equals those 36 to 2.5 for 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.220
 one hundred of brawn's maximum life 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.260
 this magical year to the first goal that 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.660
 hits and will also load 70 metes 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.370
 hundred that falls in two seconds is to say 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.440
 is falling little by little there is a 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.150
 zero and also applies an extract 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.190
 including what we seek to apply the q 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.840
 we have put on we will see how they see 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.530
 keeps hitting and in the end it also comes out 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.530
 string again 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.980
 3 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.390
 of the compulsive blog are also complicated 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.770
 with the cuckoo which if you do not get to put 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.360
 completely and you can not hit a blow but 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.100
 you put him here also counts for then 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.190
 be able to do a study and continue with 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.330
 the cc then we go with the w the w is a 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.650
 of jump seems to me of injuries 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.680
 practically the same only that instead of 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.959
 give life the magic resistance armor 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.950
 for three seconds in addition this armor and 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.349
 mighty magic resistance 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.959
 and earn more the more armor and more 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.830
 older and we have that is 20 in this 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.239
 case at level one plus 14% of the 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:55.040
 armor and magical residence of brawn in 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:57.420
 this case the 14 portions 6 and not if they are 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.410
 6 and 1 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.810
 and then we have like that man cable 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.630
 and broke in 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.900
 in Spanish that brawn reduces the damage 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.360
 that comes to him and blocks block to 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.680
 for the allies he has behind blown 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.480
 raise your shield in one direction by 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.250
 three seconds denying the damage of the brush 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.660
 next attack in that direction further 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.530
 the next two attacks that come 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.940
 then at 30% reduced damage 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.470
 also interprets projectiles but not 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.880
 it's like the yasuo wall that eliminates them 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.250
 and is already but simply the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.720
 eat brawn thus reducing that by 30% 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.280
 damage to level 1 and as it goes 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.320
 raising the level reduces a little less 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.970
 of the year we're going to blame him in this 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.900
 case to the Aragonese so you can see how 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.900
 hit and then I reduce the damage of the 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.900
 aic 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.790
 it's over and hits us a little more 39 now 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.920
 and finally finally we have the last 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.540
 that we are going to come from salsa and me 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.310
 online that there are not many wines going to 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.680
 do what is 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.600
 Brawn hit the ground not staying at all 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.180
 the enemies that are nearby in a line 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.370
 and it's in front of that fissure stays 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.630
 a time that also slows the 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.540
 enemies 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.640
 150 the magic year the first champion 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.260
 that hits rises up and the 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.480
 these enemies also praised 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.770
 but much shorter during the 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.510
 next four seconds those who are 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.970
 in that area they are slowed by a 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.970
 60% let's see what we throw here 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.310
 everyone gets up front raised more 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.370
 the recipes a little less and no longer 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.200
 they are necessary has slow so 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.230
 basically we do a count we have 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.430
 the passive you placed a hit and the 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.200
 following four hits 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.820
 the English hits will make it a 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.010
 magical damage plus a study not with five 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.900
 seconds about 35 if I'm not wrong not 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.910
 with 25 to neither of the two then 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.820
 We have the ability to do magic damage 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.070
 here we have it also applies our 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.870
 passive from master to chalk we do not want 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.310
 that the w that is a jump to help 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.920
 our partner and provide 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.220
 aggressive armor that probably 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.690
 will be combined with the classmates on 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.400
 the first damage that comes in addition to 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.440
 show off all the damage and take us all 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.940
 projectiles for us and then also 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.110
 we have the last and bloody we have 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.810
 seen that raises the whole world and 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.340
 else do you see it area in conclusion I 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.600
 I think it's going to be a very complete character 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.110
 that is going to have a lot of game that 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.880
 use time 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.710
 even some people as if someone by 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.210
 example compares them with utility with 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.650
 characters like 3 so it's going to be a 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.240
 character that is going to be used well and 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.400
 He also has a bull that is not always 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.200
 fly I hope you liked this 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.290

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.280
