00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.330
 speaks guys are welcome to tutorial 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.099
 of the five star good embassies 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.349
 to start doing any of these 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.030
 books you need first player 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.160
 five stars and first to make the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.260
 embassies if you have any 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.480
 how to do embassies like this is the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.340
 tutorial of all the dribles that do not have 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.289
 a tutorial explaining how to do 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.710
 good first dribble embassies is the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.019
 around the world round the world in this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.270
 session freestyle dribbling where 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.340
 they serve more than anything to give you a 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.989
 your opponent to do the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.239
 Shoulder staff to have you're doing 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.640
 embassies and then you have to turn 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.300
 360 degree or right analog 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.680
 on one side or the other is 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.750
 depending on which side you will say logical 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 will be one side that the player will 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.620
 run the dribble 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.289
 It's good, then, look how it works. 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.059
 control is just one like old control there 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.190
 looks embassies embassies and suddenly 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.170
 the 360 he downloads 360 embassies 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.810
 on the other hand is to make each other 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.400
 reverse is one of the other and is 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.250
 You can also keep doing 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.380
 several times so look only at the oral 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.150
 movement and the player to do a followed 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.009
 the other is fine 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.439
 there you can make a move in 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.110
 together with the embassies same're 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.650
 when you 're pressing the rb button 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.320
 good, this is the one for the good or for him 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.600
 né ô double in these two rounds to the world 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.400
 so you have to turn quickly but 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.400
 It 's kind of hard to do this fast. 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.439
 dribble move very fast so twice 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.810
 your right analog while you have 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.610
 making embassies that will leave more or 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.610
 less at this amazing speed than 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.619
 You see, there's the command for everyone. 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:53.189
 You on the small screen again. 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.720
 two very fast laps there your 720 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.630
 degrees and analogue right 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.369
 the next vote I or the reverse content 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.979
 to do this here, personal during the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.560
 embassies must hold click on the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.170
 left analogue, and then you 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.379
 should make 360 degrees on the analog 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.880
 The same thing is the right command 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.560
 like 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.660
 the wave or other difference is that you have 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.210
 that hold has to tighten the analog 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.070
 left click on it to found the 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.150
 Analog lighter is good but that one 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.240
 little he 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.850
 and just look at the embassies click on the logic 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.220
 left and I circled my analog right 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.010
 the number of times you run will be 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.590
 the number of shelters that the guy is going to do 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.990
 with this that made the team a little 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.510
 The more complicated you have to give 360 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.880
 degrees on the right analog and then 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.550
 one touch forward is by the direction 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.240
 to which the player is facing 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.970
 good 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.590
 there the player will make himself beautiful dribble and 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.040
 This beautiful embassy you are 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.680
 See you there, just watch the two balls. 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.580
 two legs to the ball and gives a touch 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.810
 with the foot 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.860
 Look at the control, it's like this. 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.310
 embassies 360 and forward 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.170
 Look 360 ahead, it's real fast. 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.100
 that command of the personnel requires a 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.100
 little workout 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.900
 good this here is very easy site steppe 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.880
 while you are doing embassies 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.430
 just hold it to one side 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.380
 the right player will give this 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.250
 Nice touch on the ball and take a little step 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.870
 to the right side is good between the dribles of 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.520
 company embassies of five stars 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.850
 This is a personal one, that 's what I consider 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.470
 more useful okay and so here you can 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.660
 have the opponent you start to do 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.420
 embassies guy comes with a madman who you 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.110
 steal the ball there you go and bpi does it 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.510
 site step I want to go straight, okay? 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.209
 good is the never bullshit during a game 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.100
 This is here but I'm going to test you 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.110
 will see in the next episodes that make 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.390
 then I'll try one more test these 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.640
 embassies five stars is good 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.560
 look just the tech site you secure 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.420
 analog one way side you 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.540
 hold the analog is the side of the player 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.820
 It's going to be okay, is this dribbling? 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.959
 even gives even to dribble the little 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.120
 goalkeeper're 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.420
 just look at the control like this when doing 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.090
 safe embassies on one side analog 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.110
 right and then you'll do the step site 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.610
 good 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.920
 It's cool, you can combine 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.310
 Guys, I'm just going to combine it here. 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.750
 the heal the world was just one 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.150
 little hat back with analog 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.610
 Left Analog Right pulls to 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.349
 front looks only 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.960
 You can do any combination 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:31.509
 with five stars embassies okay 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.370
 personal looks only the tech site to dribble 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.830
 goalkeeper looks only goalkeeper came many 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.550
 is and there he was confused 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.250
 Ok it's good 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.169
 if you want to see more examples of these 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.180
 dribles personal click on the part 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.060
