00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
tire I think I'm going that direction

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.160 
tire I think I'm going that direction
the<00:02:51.680> Continental<00:02:52.370> DWS<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:53.510> looked<00:02:53.900> at<00:02:53.989> those

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
the Continental DWS is I looked at those

the Continental DWS is I looked at those
but<00:02:54.769> those<00:02:54.860> are<00:02:55.040> really<00:02:55.280> expensive<00:02:55.489> tires<00:02:56.090> so

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
but those are really expensive tires so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.660 
but those are really expensive tires so
I<00:02:57.140> probably<00:02:57.620> passed<00:02:57.860> on<00:02:58.070> that<00:02:58.190> for<00:02:58.400> right<00:02:58.519> now

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
