00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.650

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.830
 As you have already noticed in the title of the video, I bring you the story of the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.110
 shorts 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.320
 My inspiration for making this video was that I had a hunger strike and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.420
 eat me a background I happened to make this video but good going back to 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.690

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.010
 in a bread with elongated shape that is usually accompanied with some time left as 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.489
 ketchup and mustard 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.770
 also to make it clear is one of the easiest meals to prepare since 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.380
 only requires is a sausage and a honeycomb have been given to prepare a background 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.150

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.760
 now a little history the shorts were made in different parts of Europe 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.760
 before European immigrants, especially of German origin, will take them 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.800
 to the united states and it became a very popular street food among the 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.450
 middle class 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.450
 New York made its way in the first decade of the 19th century thanks to the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.320
 contribution of several European butchers who were dedicated to replicating the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.430
 sausage in the new continent 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.560

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.510
