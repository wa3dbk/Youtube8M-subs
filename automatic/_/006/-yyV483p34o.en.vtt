little<00:00:56.879> bit<00:00:57.329> irrelevant<00:00:58.340> but<00:00:59.449> it's

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
little bit irrelevant but it's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.599 
little bit irrelevant but it's
interesting<00:01:00.719> with<00:01:01.050> those<00:01:01.230> three<00:01:01.410> players<00:01:01.620> not

on a team I mean I can't help but feel

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.820 
on a team I mean I can't help but feel
like<00:01:05.780> there's<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.990> possibility<00:01:07.140> like

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
like there's the possibility like

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.560 
like there's the possibility like
there's<00:01:08.010> got<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.340> at<00:01:08.490> least<00:01:08.549> some<00:01:08.970> talks<00:01:09.270> of

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
there's got to be at least some talks of

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.570 
there's got to be at least some talks of
kind<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> trying<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> old<00:01:11.100> impact

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
kind of trying to get the old impact

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.770 
kind of trying to get the old impact
back<00:01:11.790> together<00:01:12.090> whether<00:01:12.360> or<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.570> they're

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
back together whether or not they're

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.770 
back together whether or not they're
going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.140> called<00:01:13.650> impact<00:01:14.509> it<00:01:15.509> almost

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
going to be called impact it almost

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.679 
going to be called impact it almost
seems<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> way<00:01:16.560> things<00:01:16.619> are<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.689> like

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
seems like the way things are going like

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.179 
seems like the way things are going like
I<00:01:19.909> it<00:01:20.909> almost<00:01:21.150> seems<00:01:21.360> too<00:01:21.570> coincidental<00:01:22.189> for

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
I it almost seems too coincidental for

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.499 
I it almost seems too coincidental for
all<00:01:23.250> these<00:01:23.400> players<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.000> free<00:01:24.270> right<00:01:24.450> now

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
and it's almost like they're looking at

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.580 
and it's almost like they're looking at
this<00:01:26.759> game<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.900> black<00:01:28.140> ops<00:01:28.380> 2

and they're like we can probably do

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.179

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
not one hundred percent sure if you're

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.499 
not one hundred percent sure if you're
gonna<00:01:53.100> need<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.640> much<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.909> an<00:01:54.000> anchor<00:01:54.299> just

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
gonna need so much of an anchor just

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.719 
gonna need so much of an anchor just
because<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.810> way<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> maps<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.729> but

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
because of the way the maps are but

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.420 
because of the way the maps are but
we'll<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.899> mean<00:01:58.079> with<00:01:58.619> hardpoint<00:01:59.040> chances

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
we'll see I mean with hardpoint chances

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.649 
we'll see I mean with hardpoint chances
are<00:01:59.549> you're<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.000> need<00:02:00.119> some<00:02:00.149> sort<00:02:00.570> of

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
are you're going to need some sort of

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.929 
are you're going to need some sort of
anchor<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.280> this<00:02:02.280> game<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.850> be

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
anchor but this game is going to be

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.190 
anchor but this game is going to be
played<00:02:03.240> looks<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:03.960> going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> be

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
played looks like it's going to be

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.870 
played looks like it's going to be
played<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> lot<00:02:04.710> more<00:02:04.860> aggressively<00:02:05.369> than<00:02:05.490> even

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
played a lot more aggressively than even

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.290 
played a lot more aggressively than even
black<00:02:06.090> ops<00:02:06.299> 2<00:02:06.570> was<00:02:06.780> though<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:08.090> this<00:02:09.090> game<00:02:09.270> is

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
black ops 2 was though so this game is

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.479 
black ops 2 was though so this game is
probably<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:10.229> far<00:02:10.500> when<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.739> comes<00:02:10.979> out<00:02:11.099> land

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
probably as far when it comes out land

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.400 
probably as far when it comes out land
it's<00:02:11.730> probably<00:02:12.180> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.569> come<00:02:12.780> down

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
it's probably going to come down

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.730 
it's probably going to come down
more<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.280> your<00:02:14.670> rotations<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.720> your<00:02:16.590> gun

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
more of just your rotations and your gun

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.380 
more of just your rotations and your gun
skill<00:02:17.070> because<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.850> game<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.090> going<00:02:18.270> to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
skill because this game is going to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.240 
skill because this game is going to
separate<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:19.050> lot<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.530> players<00:02:19.770> from<00:02:20.070> each

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
separate a lot of the players from each

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.710 
separate a lot of the players from each
other<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.700> mean<00:02:21.150> there's<00:02:21.300> gonna<00:02:21.390> be<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.570> lot<00:02:21.660> of

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
other I mean there's gonna be a lot of

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.270 
other I mean there's gonna be a lot of
good<00:02:21.840> good<00:02:22.230> pro<00:02:22.530> players<00:02:22.800> but<00:02:23.070> there's<00:02:23.220> going
