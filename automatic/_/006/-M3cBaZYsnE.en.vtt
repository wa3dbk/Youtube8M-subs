00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
was selected run the guys at home

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.100 
was selected run the guys at home
through<00:00:41.850> why<00:00:42.090> you've<00:00:42.270> chosen<00:00:42.300> Hong<00:00:42.780> Kong<00:00:42.960> for

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
through why you've chosen Hong Kong for

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.139 
through why you've chosen Hong Kong for
the<00:00:43.200> setting<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.500> true<00:00:43.620> crime<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the setting of true crime I think the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.369 
the setting of true crime I think the
most<00:00:45.239> important<00:00:45.750> thing<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.140> were<00:00:46.200> very

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
most important thing is we were very

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.810 
most important thing is we were very
heavily<00:00:46.739> influenced<00:00:47.190> by<00:00:47.250> Hong<00:00:47.430> Kong<00:00:47.610> cinema

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
heavily influenced by Hong Kong cinema

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.150 
heavily influenced by Hong Kong cinema
action<00:00:48.239> movies<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.680> we<00:00:49.680> were<00:00:49.770> really<00:00:49.920> looking

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
action movies and we were really looking

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.680 
action movies and we were really looking
to<00:00:50.430> take<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> open<00:00:50.969> world<00:00:51.090> gamer<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
to take the open world gamer to

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.880 
to take the open world gamer to
somewhere<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.230> there<00:00:52.379> hadn't<00:00:52.620> been<00:00:52.649> before

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
somewhere that there hadn't been before

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.100 
somewhere that there hadn't been before
and<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:54.059> know<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.360> perspective<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.960> low

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
and you know from that perspective a low

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
and you know from that perspective a low
and<00:00:55.260> Hong<00:00:55.440> Kong<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:56.010> made<00:00:56.219> perfect<00:00:56.430> sense

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
and Hong Kong just made perfect sense

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.670 
and Hong Kong just made perfect sense
and<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.539> more<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.750> started<00:00:58.140> looking<00:00:58.230> into<00:00:58.530> it

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and the more we started looking into it

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.560 
and the more we started looking into it
and<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.399> look<00:00:59.520> at<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> difference<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and you look at the difference of the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.420 
and you look at the difference of the
wide<00:01:00.840> architectural<00:01:01.590> range<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.100> Hong<00:01:02.219> Kong

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
wide architectural range that Hong Kong

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.810 
wide architectural range that Hong Kong
has<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.320> got<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.920> lot<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.220> areas<00:01:05.670> down

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
has you know you got a lot of areas down

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.370

markets and things like that so just the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.700 
markets and things like that so just the
range<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.659> gameplay<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.380> thought<00:01:16.530> we

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
range of gameplay that we thought we

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.929 
range of gameplay that we thought we
could<00:01:16.860> get<00:01:16.950> out<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.310> would<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.640> excellent

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
could get out of it would be excellent

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.670 
could get out of it would be excellent
and<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:18.990> reason<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.439> went<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and you know for that reason we went to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.960 
and you know for that reason we went to
Hong<00:01:19.830> Kong<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.610> give<00:01:20.729> us<00:01:20.820> some<00:01:20.850> examples

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970

Hong Kong can you give us some examples
of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> gameplay<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.259> how<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.470> will

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
of the gameplay and how it will

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.859 
of the gameplay and how it will
differentiate<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.060> different<00:01:24.390> parts<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.640 
Point for example is a model very much
after<00:01:30.119> Mong<00:01:30.479> Kok<00:01:30.720> which<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.110> actually<00:01:31.290> more<00:01:31.530> on

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
after Mong Kok which is actually more on

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.870 
after Mong Kok which is actually more on
the<00:01:31.740> mainland

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the mainland

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.300 
the mainland
a hump<00:01:33.149> on<00:01:33.270> proper<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.950> has<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> lot<00:01:35.189> of

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
a hump on proper but it has a lot of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.310 
a hump on proper but it has a lot of
alleyways<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:36.210> has<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> lot<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.539> night<00:01:36.810> markets

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
alleyways it has a lot of night markets

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.719 
alleyways it has a lot of night markets
and<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.890> there's<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.070> lot<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.189> foot<00:01:38.490> chase

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and so there's a lot of foot chase

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.090 
and so there's a lot of foot chase
scenes<00:01:39.060> through<00:01:39.420> there<00:01:39.600> where<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.950> to

scenes through there where you have to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.859 
scenes through there where you have to
you<00:01:41.280> know<00:01:41.399> use<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.610> crowd<00:01:41.939> dodging<00:01:42.390> mechanic

there whereas if you had central for

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.919 
there whereas if you had central for
example<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.579> know<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.939> roads<00:01:51.539> are<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> lot

example you know the the roads are a lot

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.800 
example you know the the roads are a lot
wider<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.679> lot<00:01:52.829> way<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.039> open<00:01:53.429> and<00:01:53.810> you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
wider there a lot way to open and you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.690 
wider there a lot way to open and you

see the martial arts you know system in

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.970 
see the martial arts you know system in
play<00:02:53.549> can<00:02:54.239> see<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.540> like<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> fall<00:02:55.019> offensive

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.620 
and defensive range of Cape of combat
capabilities<00:02:58.920> we<00:02:59.519> saw<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.700> counter<00:03:00.209> system

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
capabilities we saw a counter system

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.390 
capabilities we saw a counter system
which<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:01.019> really<00:03:01.200> cool<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:02.220> think

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
which is really cool and I think

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.620 
which is really cool and I think
