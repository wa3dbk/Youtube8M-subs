00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.890 
because it's just
you<00:02:17.290> know<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.920> structure<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:19.360> so

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
you know the the structure is is so

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.990 
you know the the structure is is so
simple<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.500> difficult<00:02:20.980> at<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.460> same<00:02:21.700> time

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
simple and difficult at the same time

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.200 
simple and difficult at the same time
because<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.720> for<00:02:23.110> example<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.530> first<00:02:23.710> moment

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
because the for example the first moment

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.000 
because the for example the first moment
has<00:02:25.210> so<00:02:26.200> many<00:02:26.970> scales<00:02:27.970> which<00:02:28.690> are<00:02:29.010> actually

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
has so many scales which are actually

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.510 
has so many scales which are actually
music<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.410> make<00:02:32.620> music<00:02:33.100> out<00:02:33.370> of

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
music and and you you make music out of

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.820 
music and and you you make music out of
it<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:34.630> quite<00:02:34.720> typical<00:02:34.930> with<00:02:35.320> Beethoven

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
it and it's quite typical with Beethoven

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.220 
it and it's quite typical with Beethoven
but<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.460> very<00:02:36.700> Valen<00:02:37.360> istic<00:02:37.630> ly<00:02:37.720> difficult

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
but it's very Valen istic ly difficult

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.740 
but it's very Valen istic ly difficult
to<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:39.100> make<00:02:39.340> real<00:02:40.240> music<00:02:40.750> out<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:41.220> this

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
to to make real music out of this

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.059 
to to make real music out of this
structure

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.420 

it's<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:51.180> music<00:02:51.599> pure<00:02:52.469> and<00:02:52.739> every<00:02:53.069> note<00:02:53.219> is

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
it's just music pure and every note is

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.949 
it's just music pure and every note is
like<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:54.269> gold<00:02:54.569> so<00:02:55.409> you<00:02:55.439> have<00:02:55.859> to<00:02:55.980> just<00:02:56.959> make

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
like like gold so you have to just make

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.459 
like like gold so you have to just make
sure<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:59.069> it's<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.390> stays<00:03:00.719> as<00:03:00.989> pure<00:03:01.290> as

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
sure that that it's it stays as pure as

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.649 
sure that that it's it stays as pure as
possible<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.219> of<00:03:02.280> course<00:03:02.340> we<00:03:02.849> all<00:03:03.239> put<00:03:03.510> our

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
possible and of course we all put our

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.619 
possible and of course we all put our
emotions<00:03:04.170> into<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:04.980> Concetta<00:03:05.519> but<00:03:05.819> but<00:03:06.450> it

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
emotions into this Concetta but but it

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.920 
emotions into this Concetta but but it
it<00:03:07.290> carries<00:03:07.709> us<00:03:08.189> rather<00:03:08.730> than<00:03:08.879> we<00:03:09.180> carry<00:03:09.480> the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
it carries us rather than we carry the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.979 
it carries us rather than we carry the
music<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.819> especially<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.569> second

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
music and especially in the second

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.470 
music and especially in the second
movement<00:03:13.200> where<00:03:13.680> there<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.519> moment<00:03:14.970> where

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
movement where there is a moment where

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.750 
movement where there is a moment where
you<00:03:15.629> feel<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.379> there<00:03:17.129> is<00:03:17.250> no<00:03:17.430> time

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
you feel that that there is no time

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.289 
you feel that that there is no time
anymore

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
anymore

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.390 
anymore
and<00:03:18.540> there<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.319> no<00:03:19.469> pulse<00:03:19.739> anymore<00:03:20.250> that

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
and there is no pulse anymore that

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.259 
and there is no pulse anymore that
everything<00:03:20.790> stands<00:03:22.310> still<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.819> I<00:03:24.239> think

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
everything stands still and I think

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.309 
everything stands still and I think
that's<00:03:24.659> what<00:03:24.810> also<00:03:25.370> audience<00:03:26.370> feels<00:03:26.639> often

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
that's what also audience feels often

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.569 
that's what also audience feels often
listening<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.790> second<00:03:29.790> moment<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:31.620> and

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
listening to this second moment and and

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.970 
listening to this second moment and and
still<00:03:32.909> it's<00:03:33.180> it's<00:03:33.419> very<00:03:33.510> very<00:03:33.750> others<00:03:34.409> it's

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
still it's it's very very others it's

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.580 
still it's it's very very others it's
actually<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.459> first<00:03:35.609> concerto<00:03:35.909> that<00:03:36.590> was

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
actually the first concerto that was

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.569 
actually the first concerto that was
written<00:03:37.769> in<00:03:38.010> this<00:03:38.129> virtual<00:03:39.560> style<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:41.340> last

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
written in this virtual style the last

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.369 
written in this virtual style the last
moment<00:03:42.060> because<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.720> really<00:03:42.870> show<00:03:43.169> what

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
moment because you can really show what

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.220 
moment because you can really show what
you<00:03:43.500> can<00:03:43.939> it<00:03:44.939> actually<00:03:45.150> brings<00:03:45.720> me<00:03:45.840> into

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
you can it actually brings me into

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.740 
you can it actually brings me into
another<00:03:46.530> world<00:03:46.919> myself<00:03:47.669> and<00:03:47.939> and<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.389> hope<00:03:48.569> that

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
another world myself and and I hope that

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.099 
another world myself and and I hope that
this<00:03:48.989> is<00:03:49.139> what<00:03:49.379> also<00:03:50.870> happens<00:03:51.870> with<00:03:51.989> the

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
this is what also happens with the

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.349 
this is what also happens with the
audience<00:03:52.560> because<00:03:52.799> this<00:03:53.250> music<00:03:53.669> is<00:03:53.849> you<00:03:54.120> you

us<00:04:10.650> into<00:04:10.949> this<00:04:11.090> completely<00:04:12.090> different<00:04:12.540> world

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
us into this completely different world

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.599 
us into this completely different world
and<00:04:15.079> there<00:04:16.079> are<00:04:16.229> several<00:04:16.919> condenses<00:04:17.489> that

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
and there are several condenses that

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.589 
and there are several condenses that
have<00:04:17.880> been<00:04:18.090> written<00:04:18.239> for<00:04:18.859> well<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:19.979> concerto

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
have been written for well this concerto

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.860 
have been written for well this concerto
I'll<00:04:21.599> be<00:04:21.720> picking<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:24.300> Schnitkey<00:04:24.510> garden

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
I'll be picking the the Schnitkey garden

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.680 
I'll be picking the the Schnitkey garden
so<00:04:25.110> this<00:04:25.349> time<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:25.949> used<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.610> play<00:04:26.820> they<00:04:27.270> cadenza

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
so this time I used to play they cadenza

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.790 
so this time I used to play they cadenza
by<00:04:27.810> Chrysler<00:04:28.080> which<00:04:28.830> is<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.159> classical<00:04:30.800> most

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
by Chrysler which is the classical most

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.230 
by Chrysler which is the classical most
of<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.010> most<00:04:32.250> of<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.460> Balinese<00:04:32.760> play<00:04:33.000> that

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
of the most of the Balinese play that

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.360 
of the most of the Balinese play that
but<00:04:33.570> I<00:04:33.990> find<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.650> Schnitkey<00:04:34.889> currents<00:04:35.220> are

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
but I find the Schnitkey currents are

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.700 
but I find the Schnitkey currents are
quite<00:04:35.550> fun<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.570> play<00:04:36.810> because<00:04:37.229> it's<00:04:38.479> actually

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
quite fun to play because it's actually

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.270 
quite fun to play because it's actually
introduced<00:04:41.720> so<00:04:42.720> many<00:04:42.990> other<00:04:43.530> concertos<00:04:44.130> in

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
introduced so many other concertos in

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.710 
introduced so many other concertos in
that<00:04:44.400> cadenza<00:04:44.909> which<00:04:45.060> probably<00:04:45.360> were

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
that cadenza which probably were

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.790 
that cadenza which probably were
influenced<00:04:46.409> by<00:04:47.659> Beethoven<00:04:48.680> actually<00:04:49.680> you

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
influenced by Beethoven actually you

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.060 
influenced by Beethoven actually you
find

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.190 
appreciate so much this music that they
that<00:05:37.550> it<00:05:37.669> takes<00:05:37.940> quite<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.210> long<00:05:38.570> time<00:05:38.840> from

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
that it takes quite a long time from

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.790 
that it takes quite a long time from
them<00:05:39.410> through<00:05:39.650> to<00:05:40.370> to<00:05:41.020> get<00:05:42.020> away<00:05:42.140> from<00:05:42.350> it

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
them through to to get away from it

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.830
