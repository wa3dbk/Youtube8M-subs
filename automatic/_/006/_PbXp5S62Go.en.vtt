00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.070 
what I think the WWE should do now I
think<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> number<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.119> option<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> dub

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
think the number one option for the dub

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.070 
think the number one option for the dub
w/e<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.100> viacom<00:01:14.549> right<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.570> can

PG channel there's not really a lot of

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.140 
PG channel there's not really a lot of
pg-13<00:03:17.069> stuff<00:03:17.310> there<00:03:17.489> has<00:03:17.609> been<00:03:17.759> a<00:03:17.790> little<00:03:17.939> bit

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
pg-13 stuff there has been a little bit

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.699 
pg-13 stuff there has been a little bit
but<00:03:18.329> not<00:03:18.840> really<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:19.109> lot<00:03:19.229> of<00:03:19.349> stuff<00:03:19.530> that's

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
but not really a lot of stuff that's

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.429 
but not really a lot of stuff that's
really<00:03:20.009> exceeded<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.489> PG<00:03:20.819> stuff<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.359> if<00:03:22.169> this

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:22.439 
really exceeded the PG stuff and if this

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.990 
really exceeded the PG stuff and if this
happened<00:03:22.889> this<00:03:23.099> would<00:03:23.280> kind<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.519> cement<00:03:23.879> that

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
happened this would kind of cement that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.149 
happened this would kind of cement that
W<00:03:24.389> is<00:03:24.479> going<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:24.959> stay<00:03:25.109> PG<00:03:25.470> for<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.739> long<00:03:25.889> time

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
W is going to stay PG for a long time

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.789 
W is going to stay PG for a long time
because<00:03:26.849> they<00:03:27.329> can't<00:03:27.599> really<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:28.290> much<00:03:28.319> on

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
because they can't really do much on

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.259 
because they can't really do much on
Disney<00:03:29.220> Disney<00:03:29.400> will<00:03:29.669> limit<00:03:29.849> them<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.060> what

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
Disney Disney will limit them to what

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.729 
Disney Disney will limit them to what
they<00:03:30.389> can<00:03:30.540> do<00:03:30.689> because<00:03:30.959> of<00:03:31.139> they<00:03:31.439> want<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.620> make

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
they can do because of they want to make

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.050 
they can do because of they want to make
sure<00:03:31.769> all<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.069> vons<00:03:32.400> our<00:03:32.609> stuff<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.909> to<00:03:33.030> a

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
sure all the vons our stuff is to a

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.569 
sure all the vons our stuff is to a
minimum<00:03:33.449> but<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.290> WWE<00:03:34.889> is<00:03:34.919> all<00:03:35.189> about<00:03:35.459> the

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
minimum but the WWE is all about the

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.059 
minimum but the WWE is all about the
violence<00:03:35.790> all<00:03:36.120> about<00:03:36.419> the<00:03:37.379> wrestling<00:03:37.859> the

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
violence all about the wrestling the

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.740 
violence all about the wrestling the
talent<00:03:38.459> all<00:03:38.549> that<00:03:38.639> stuff<00:03:38.879> so<00:03:38.909> I<00:03:39.120> cannot<00:03:39.509> see

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
talent all that stuff so I cannot see

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.649 
talent all that stuff so I cannot see
them<00:03:39.900> going<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.259> Disney<00:03:40.560> being<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.979> viable

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
them going to Disney being a viable

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.719 
them going to Disney being a viable
partner<00:03:42.659> and<00:03:42.900> Disney<00:03:43.560> but<00:03:44.129> it's<00:03:44.340> kind<00:03:44.579> of<00:03:44.639> a

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
partner and Disney but it's kind of a

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.129 
partner and Disney but it's kind of a
good<00:03:44.849> thought<00:03:45.060> because<00:03:45.389> Disney<00:03:45.720> has<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.930> lot<00:03:46.109> of

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
good thought because Disney has a lot of

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.929 
good thought because Disney has a lot of
promotion<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.739> stuff<00:03:46.919> they<00:03:47.340> can<00:03:47.489> really<00:03:47.639> take

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
promotion and stuff they can really take

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.210 
promotion and stuff they can really take
the<00:03:48.180> go<00:03:48.599> w<00:03:48.930> ed<00:03:49.079> program<00:03:49.439> to<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.620> next<00:03:49.859> level

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
the go w ed program to the next level

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.649 
the go w ed program to the next level
kind<00:03:50.699> of<00:03:50.790> raised<00:03:50.909> all<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.209> stuff<00:03:51.419> up<00:03:51.599> a

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
kind of raised all that stuff up a

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.330 
kind of raised all that stuff up a
little<00:03:51.870> bit<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.409> also<00:03:52.470> another<00:03:52.859> competitor

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
little bit and also another competitor

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.069 
little bit and also another competitor
has<00:03:53.489> been<00:03:53.669> Fox<00:03:54.060> now<00:03:54.780> Fox<00:03:55.409> on<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:56.819> w/e<00:03:57.629> could<00:03:57.930> be

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
has been Fox now Fox on the w/e could be

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.770 
has been Fox now Fox on the w/e could be
a<00:03:58.109> really<00:03:58.409> interesting<00:03:58.969> constant<00:03:59.969> but<00:04:00.239> the

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
a really interesting constant but the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.879 
a really interesting constant but the
thing<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.019> they<00:04:01.290> have<00:04:01.409> to<00:04:01.500> really<00:04:01.680> think<00:04:01.769> about

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
thing is they have to really think about

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.409 
thing is they have to really think about
it<00:04:02.219> i<00:04:02.370> think<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.699> other<00:04:02.759> programs<00:04:03.239> if<00:04:03.329> they

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
it i think the other programs if they

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.170 
it i think the other programs if they
got<00:04:03.540> going<00:04:03.810> on<00:04:03.900> now<00:04:04.169> they<00:04:04.799> recently<00:04:05.180> ended

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
got going on now they recently ended

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:37.569 
economy the the best option

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:39.749 
economy the the best option
for<00:06:38.020> the<00:06:38.259> WWE<00:06:38.889> just<00:06:39.009> because<00:06:39.309> so<00:06:39.669> many

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 
for the WWE just because so many

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.549 
for the WWE just because so many
networks<00:06:40.210> so<00:06:40.449> much<00:06:40.599> stuff<00:06:40.839> can<00:06:40.960> go<00:06:41.110> on<00:06:41.319> there

00:06:41.549 --> 00:06:41.559 
networks so much stuff can go on there

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:43.739 
networks so much stuff can go on there
and<00:06:41.770> they<00:06:42.550> can<00:06:42.699> kind<00:06:42.909> of<00:06:42.939> just<00:06:43.029> schedule<00:06:43.599> their

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:43.749 
and they can kind of just schedule their

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:46.230 
and they can kind of just schedule their
stuff<00:06:43.990> around<00:06:44.319> what<00:06:44.589> Vikon<00:06:45.099> does<00:06:45.369> with<00:06:45.610> MTV

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:48.699 
vh1 spike and all this stuff but I think

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.429 
vh1 spike and all this stuff but I think
they'll<00:06:48.789> get<00:06:48.849> a<00:06:48.909> lot<00:06:49.119> of<00:06:49.149> rain<00:06:49.360> on<00:06:49.479> Spike<00:06:49.749> maybe

00:06:50.429 --> 00:06:50.439 
they'll get a lot of rain on Spike maybe

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:52.829 
they'll get a lot of rain on Spike maybe
they<00:06:50.619> can<00:06:50.770> have<00:06:50.919> raw<00:06:51.219> smackdown<00:06:51.879> NXT<00:06:52.389> on<00:06:52.509> spike

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:52.839 
they can have raw smackdown NXT on spike

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.269 
they can have raw smackdown NXT on spike
and<00:06:53.080> then<00:06:53.199> have<00:06:53.379> main<00:06:53.559> event<00:06:53.830> somewhere<00:06:54.069> else
