00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
congregation Church of Greeley found out

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.519 
congregation Church of Greeley found out
there's<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.600> lot<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:06.960> things<00:00:07.109> that<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.379> can

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
there's a lot of things that you can

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.690 
there's a lot of things that you can
have<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.740> consider<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.189> have<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.370> think<00:00:08.610> about

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
have to consider you have to think about

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.610 
have to consider you have to think about
the<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.420> soul<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.900> organ<00:00:10.170> or<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.410> breath

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
the the soul of the organ or the breath

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.350 
the the soul of the organ or the breath
of<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.889> organ<00:00:11.219> which<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.940> air<00:00:12.090> that's

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
of the organ which is the air that's

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.360 
of the organ which is the air that's
pumped<00:00:12.660> through<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.139> there's<00:00:13.860> win<00:00:14.130> lines

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
pumped through it so there's win lines

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.580 
pumped through it so there's win lines
and<00:00:14.730> reservoirs<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.389> fill<00:00:15.900> up<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.139> chests

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
and reservoirs that fill up the chests

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.800 
and reservoirs that fill up the chests
so<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.160> air<00:00:17.279> can<00:00:17.430> come<00:00:17.609> out<00:00:17.789> but<00:00:18.720> then

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
so that the air can come out but then

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.730 
so that the air can come out but then
you<00:00:18.869> also<00:00:19.020> have<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.289> think<00:00:19.410> about<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
you also have to think about the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.390 
you also have to think about the
electronic<00:00:20.310> component<00:00:20.789> which<00:00:20.910> allows<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
electronic component which allows the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.429 
electronic component which allows the
the<00:00:23.400> pipes<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.269> sound<00:00:24.539> plus<00:00:25.230> there's

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the pipes to sound plus there's

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.560 
the pipes to sound plus there's
different<00:00:25.830> other<00:00:26.279> things<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.449> to

different other things you have to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.040 
different other things you have to
consider<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.019> pipe<00:00:28.230> work<00:00:28.470> itself<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:30.050> also

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
consider the pipe work itself and also

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.139 
consider the pipe work itself and also
the<00:00:31.230> shades<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:32.040> know<00:00:32.579> all<00:00:32.730> those<00:00:32.880> kind<00:00:33.120> of

the shades you know all those kind of

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.850 
the shades you know all those kind of
things<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.750> each<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.440> those<00:00:34.590> has<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
things and each one of those has a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.299

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
and there's Tremeloes in there and just

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.670 
and there's Tremeloes in there and just
just<00:00:39.989> when<00:00:40.989> there's<00:00:41.140> that<00:00:41.230> there's<00:00:41.410> a<00:00:41.469> lot<00:00:41.649> of

much less than that of a brand new organ
which<00:01:30.159> would<00:01:30.340> work<00:01:30.550> better<00:01:30.819> in<00:01:31.030> their<00:01:31.179> church
