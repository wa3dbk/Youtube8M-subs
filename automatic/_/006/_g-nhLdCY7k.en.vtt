have juices and then you save so much

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.420 
have juices and then you save so much
energy<00:04:19.130> from<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:20.030> digestive<00:04:20.630> process<00:04:21.430> during

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
energy from the digestive process during

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.980 
energy from the digestive process during
