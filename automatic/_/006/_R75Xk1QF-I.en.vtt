and as you can see the combination of

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.730 
and as you can see the combination of
these<00:01:04.460> creams<00:01:04.940> evens<00:01:05.780> out<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:05.930> skin<00:01:06.080> tone<00:01:06.530> but

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.649 
it doesn't give me that full coverage
look<00:01:09.530> that<00:01:09.740> I<00:01:09.770> would<00:01:09.979> guess<00:01:10.159> I<00:01:10.369> used<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:11.000> full

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
look that I would guess I used a full

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.530 
look that I would guess I used a full
coverage<00:01:12.200> foundation<00:01:12.580> obviously<00:01:13.580> it<00:01:14.360> just

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
coverage foundation obviously it just

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.450 
coverage foundation obviously it just
gives<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.780> very<00:01:14.900> dewy<00:01:15.259> luminous<00:01:15.830> look<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.369> it

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
gives a very dewy luminous look and it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.190 
gives a very dewy luminous look and it
evens<00:01:16.729> out<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.880> skin<00:01:17.030> tone<00:01:17.450> as<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:17.720> just<00:01:17.960> said

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
evens out the skin tone as I just said

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.719 
evens out the skin tone as I just said
and<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:19.009> doesn't<00:01:19.250> look<00:01:19.280> like<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:19.580> have

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
anything on the skin it just makes your

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
and now I'm going to define the lower

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.210 
and now I'm going to define the lower
lash<00:02:20.180> line<00:02:20.510> by<00:02:20.930> running<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.530> same<00:02:21.890> taupe

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
lash line by running that same taupe

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.039 
lash line by running that same taupe

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
color for makeup forever under my lower

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.800 
color for makeup forever under my lower
lash<00:02:24.319> line<00:02:24.620> with<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.459> bedell<00:02:25.849> iam<00:02:26.000> tools<00:02:26.269> pencil

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
lash line with a bedell iam tools pencil

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.410 
lash line with a bedell iam tools pencil
brush<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.319> this<00:02:28.280> doesn't<00:02:28.790> give<00:02:29.090> too<00:02:29.299> much

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
brush and this doesn't give too much

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.880 
brush and this doesn't give too much
darkness<00:02:29.810> but<00:02:30.079> it<00:02:30.200> gets<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.410> little<00:02:30.620> bit<00:02:30.799> of

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
darkness but it gets a little bit of

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.550 
darkness but it gets a little bit of
shadow<00:02:31.099> so<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.519> have<00:02:31.910> more<00:02:32.599> definition<00:02:33.290> under

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
shadow so you have more definition under

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.870 
shadow so you have more definition under
the<00:02:33.680> lower<00:02:33.829> lash<00:02:34.069> line<00:02:34.370> without<00:02:34.549> it<00:02:34.819> looking

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
the lower lash line without it looking

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.030 
the lower lash line without it looking
too<00:02:35.239> dramatic

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
pretty much perfect so I don't need to

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.930 
pretty much perfect so I don't need to
do<00:03:49.910> anything<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:51.490> and<00:03:52.490> you<00:03:52.580> always<00:03:52.700> want<00:03:52.910> to
