can submit their photos and kind of

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.090 
can submit their photos and kind of
morph<00:02:18.020> their<00:02:18.230> images<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.740> see<00:02:18.770> what<00:02:18.980> their

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
morph their images to see what their

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.980 
morph their images to see what their
children<00:02:19.250> would<00:02:19.580> look<00:02:19.760> like<00:02:19.880> well<00:02:20.750> there's

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
children would look like well there's

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.510 
children would look like well there's
another<00:02:21.200> website<00:02:21.680> where<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.890> can<00:02:22.040> morph<00:02:22.310> two

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
another website where you can morph two

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.730 
another website where you can morph two
peoples<00:02:22.820> images<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.720> tell<00:02:23.930> if<00:02:24.230> they<00:02:24.440> are<00:02:24.590> in

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
peoples images to tell if they are in

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.340 
peoples images to tell if they are in
fact<00:02:24.770> biologically<00:02:25.580> related<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:27.020> is<00:02:27.170> the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
fact biologically related so this is the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.300 
fact biologically related so this is the
I<00:02:27.530> took<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.340> honor<00:02:28.490> I<00:02:28.640> submitted<00:02:29.240> these<00:02:30.310> these

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
I took the honor I submitted these these

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.860 
I took the honor I submitted these these
photos<00:02:31.790> here<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:35.210> is<00:02:35.270> what<00:02:35.660> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
photos here and and this is what the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.960 
photos here and and this is what the
computer<00:02:36.380> came<00:02:36.680> up<00:02:36.860> with<00:02:37.040> as<00:02:37.250> proof<00:02:37.550> that<00:02:37.580> we

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
computer came up with as proof that we

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:46.310 
computer came up with as proof that we
are<00:02:38.150> in<00:02:38.300> fact<00:02:38.540> related

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.130

we should never mate okay glad there's a
