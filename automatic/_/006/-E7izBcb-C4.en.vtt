00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.499 
way to the motorway then headed off
towards<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.549> top<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.939> map<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.270> would<00:01:36.420> have

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
towards the top of the map I would have

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
towards the top of the map I would have
loved<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> see<00:01:36.869> where<00:01:37.259> he<00:01:37.409> ended<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.490> there

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
loved to see where he ended up but there

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.880 
loved to see where he ended up but there
is<00:01:38.939> some<00:01:39.150> things<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.630> go<00:01:39.659> wrong<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.710> me

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
is some things I can go wrong so for me

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.270 
is some things I can go wrong so for me
I<00:01:40.920> had<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.460> stop<00:01:41.729> tap<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.270> Y<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:43.409> before<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
I had to stop tap and Y just before the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060 
I had to stop tap and Y just before the
last<00:01:44.460> zoom<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.409> before<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
last zoom in so just before I get in the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.639 
last zoom in so just before I get in the
car<00:01:47.250> T<00:01:47.880> human<00:01:48.240> life<00:01:48.420> had<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.810> tap<00:01:49.020> wide<00:01:49.229> until

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
car T human life had to tap wide until

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.370 
car T human life had to tap wide until
he<00:01:49.770> got<00:01:49.890> all<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> way<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.640> his<00:01:50.790> car<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
he got all the way in his car so it's a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.289 
he got all the way in his car so it's a
little<00:01:52.680> bit<00:01:52.829> tricky<00:01:53.520> getting<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.880> right<00:01:54.090> but

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
little bit tricky getting the right but

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.670 
little bit tricky getting the right but
it<00:01:54.450> only<00:01:54.570> took<00:01:54.840> me<00:01:55.020> about<00:01:55.200> three<00:01:55.439> or<00:01:55.530> four

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
it only took me about three or four

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.499 
it only took me about three or four
tries<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.700> could<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.030> every<00:01:57.329> time

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
tries and then I could do it every time

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.090 
tries and then I could do it every time
now<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.380> some<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.649> things<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.979> you

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
now this is some of the things that you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.980 
now this is some of the things that you
don't<00:01:59.310> want<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> happen<00:01:59.790> if<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.600> happens

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
don't want to happen if that happens

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.780 
don't want to happen if that happens
what<00:02:01.500> will<00:02:01.619> happen<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.159> will<00:02:02.310> spawn<00:02:02.549> in

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
what will happen is you will spawn in

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.580 
what will happen is you will spawn in
your<00:02:02.939> car<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.540> will<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.869> completely

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
your car it will be completely

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.010 
your car it will be completely
indestructible<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.030> will<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.570> able

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
to try again

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.720 
to try again
if<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.500> spawn<00:02:11.770> outside<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.400> your<00:02:12.490> car<00:02:12.700> like
