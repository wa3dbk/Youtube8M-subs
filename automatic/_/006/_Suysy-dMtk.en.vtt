hey what's up guys just wanted to show

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.440 
hey what's up guys just wanted to show
you<00:00:02.850> my<00:00:03.000> at<00:00:03.300> ten<00:00:03.570> plate<00:00:03.810> system<00:00:05.089> it's<00:00:06.089> working

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
you my at ten plate system it's working

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.440 
you my at ten plate system it's working
really<00:00:06.690> good<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:07.230> far<00:00:07.730> I've<00:00:08.730> only<00:00:08.849> tested<00:00:09.389> a

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
really good so far I've only tested a

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.650 
really good so far I've only tested a
few<00:00:09.480> times<00:00:09.929> but<00:00:10.860> uh<00:00:11.120> as<00:00:12.120> i'll<00:00:12.269> go<00:00:12.420> ahead<00:00:12.450> and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
few times but uh as i'll go ahead and

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.029 
few times but uh as i'll go ahead and
pull<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.019> cell<00:00:14.240> i'll<00:00:15.240> show<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:17.660> it's<00:00:18.660> a

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
pull the cell i'll show you it's a

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.099 
pull the cell i'll show you it's a
standstill<00:00:20.039> wall<00:00:20.400> places<00:00:20.640> like<00:00:21.029> before<00:00:21.390> but

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
standstill wall places like before but

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.689 
standstill wall places like before but
there's<00:00:22.590> ten<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.859> them<00:00:22.980> now<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
there's ten of them now so the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.140 
there's ten of them now so the
configuration<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:25.910> negative<00:00:26.910> neutral

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
configuration is negative neutral

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.849 
configuration is negative neutral
neutral<00:00:27.539> positive<00:00:28.260> neutral<00:00:28.680> neutral

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
neutral positive neutral neutral

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.359 
neutral positive neutral neutral
negative<00:00:29.490> neutral<00:00:29.670> neutral<00:00:30.090> positive<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:32.099> I'm

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
negative neutral neutral positive so I'm

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.400 
negative neutral neutral positive so I'm
getting<00:00:32.550> pretty<00:00:32.940> good<00:00:33.059> results<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
getting pretty good results with it I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.889

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
amount so go ahead and power up I'll

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.050 
amount so go ahead and power up I'll
hook<00:01:07.740> my<00:01:07.920> connections<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:11.060> also

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
hook my connections up and I also

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.080 
hook my connections up and I also
extended<00:01:12.750> these<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.290> put<00:01:14.189> washers<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.700> between

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
extended these I put washers in between

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.700 
extended these I put washers in between
I<00:01:15.330> don't<00:01:15.659> know<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.900> mentioned<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.500> last

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
I don't know if I mentioned that in last

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.130 
I don't know if I mentioned that in last
video<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> could<00:01:17.670> use<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> wing<00:01:18.150> nuts<00:01:18.180> that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
video so I could use the wing nuts that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.609 
video so I could use the wing nuts that
I<00:01:19.170> think<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.619> did<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:21.049> let<00:01:22.049> me<00:01:22.080> pick<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.470> the

I think I did so let me pick up the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.219 
I think I did so let me pick up the
power<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> voltmeter<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.170> show<00:01:25.170> you

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
power and the voltmeter and show you

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:56.740
