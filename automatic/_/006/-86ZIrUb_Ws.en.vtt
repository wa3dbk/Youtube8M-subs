00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.180
 let's talk today about something very 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.939
 important for a program of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.410
 artificial insemination organs 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.460
 reproductive characteristics of a cow is very 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.430
 important for us knowing knowing and 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.649
 feel them in the body of the player 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.530
 of the cow then we will pass a 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.100
 little time for 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.059
 to learn a little bit that they are where they are 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.559
 located in the cow what is it that 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.989
 let's feel when we introduce the 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.269
 hand and also cover a little more of 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.879
 the technique that we're going to have to 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.640
 use for artificial insemination the 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.470
 reproductive organs of a cow are 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.680
 what we have here drawn for 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.989
 you starting with the with the vulva 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.780
 that what we see here is the only thing 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.670
 that we can see now of the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.769
 reproductive organs of the cow 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.360
 normally everything else can not be 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.429
 see logically are internal in the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.100
 cow but the vulva is the only one that 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:13.640
 you can see and there we continue to the vagina 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.530
 which is very elastic very soft in sense 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.429
 when when we introduce her hand and 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.399
 we feel she is the long part after 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:25.700
 to enter the vulva there after that 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.100
 we get to the cervix which is a part of 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.039
 very hard organ well a more 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.830
 difficult more different from the vagina 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.899
 that is still there the cervix is ​​the most 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.520
 important to us because that's 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.250
 discrimination is what we have to 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.700
 fix and pass it varies logically if 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.130
 we 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.759
 if we look and leave the week in the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.189
 center or in the vagina we will not have 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.539
 very good results then the cervix 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.159
 importance for a program of 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.679
 insemination simply because we have 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.240
 that fix it locate it and pass the 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.850
 rod then it is very important the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.850
 cervix in an insemination system and 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.700
 for you to know where is happening 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.319
 from cervix we go to the uterus the uterus has 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.630
 the importance logically because it is the 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.970
 where we will start having her breeding 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.230
 after fertilization but more 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.840
 important for a program of 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.970
 insemination is the place to go 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.650
 from the cervix to the entrance of the uterus is 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.810
 where we like to deposit the semen 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.459
 then this is when the deposited 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.680
 call in this place gives us the 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.049
 opportunity for that man to disperse 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.090
 to or through the two horns and no 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.549
 only for one then it is very important 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.299
 in that sense know where the uterus is 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.700
 for that case or that reason and there we continue 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.130
 to the horns here is where the 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.799
 gestation of the cow for breeding and 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.079
 develops and ends there after that 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.220
 we end up with the infused what is 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.599
 where currently the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.250
 after the ovary that is what 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.910
 follow 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.320
 have the evaluation the cow joins with 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.440
 the semen so to speak more 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.160
 simply there occurs fertilization and 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.140
 then pregnancy or gestation ends 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.590
 in one of the horns depends on which 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.690
 is ovulating in that case to another party 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.150
 this is what it is to be part of 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.760
 the reproductive part of the cow and then 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.980
 we go to the rectum logically the rectum does not 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.260
 has a part in the reproductive organs 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.970
 but if you have any part very 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.280
 important in what is in simulation 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.020
 activity simply because of the anus 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.480
 through the rectum is where we introduce the 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.880
 hand to be able to feel down to 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.430
 fix the service and be able to pass the 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.080
 rod then that's the role of the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.270
 rectum or anus in program 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.690
 designation and also reason why 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.580
 we mention for you in this case 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.320
 another very important part that is not 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.230
 reproductive but very important in a 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.239
 insemination program is the bladder 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.060
 very very important this because it is 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.739
 simply although it has no part in what 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.290
 which is reproductive of the cow if it has 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.760
 part in what is in simulation 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.700
 remember that when we are going to finish 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.930
 we always like to introduce the hand and 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.510
 when we introduce the rod 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.810
 introduce it so up the cow 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.150
 not straight and down simply because 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.910
 the moment we introduce the rod to 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.280
 the bladder we have the possibility of 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.889
 a lot of causing a lot of pain for the cow 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.209
 and she's going to kick us or there's a 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.050
 great possibility that will do that 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.970
 then be careful to introduce 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.310
 the rod up until 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.620
 we reach the cervix in order to have a 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.780
 most effective program much much 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.570
 care should take the person who is 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.310
 starting or as it is in simulator 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.020
 norden or introduce the rod to the 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.300
 bladder simply because of the pain and 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.639
 damage that can cause the cow then 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.860
 these are the organs of a body 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.020
 player of a cow 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.510
 I think if you take the time to 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.550
 learn where is each 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.110
 and it's going to help a lot in having a 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.530
 success in your insemination program 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.530
 artificial 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.060
 continuing our talk with the 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.460
 reproductive organs of a cow 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.710
 we have a tract here dead to 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.200
 and you see a little bit to see 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.540
 a little more current as is the true 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.060
 the reproductive tract 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.220
 before starting the work that we have 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.800
 here in front of us is very 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.240
 important you in the courses of 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.130
 insemination are going to have this 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.580
 opportunity to work in this way 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.980
 spend several in on the cervix on a table 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.840
 well as we see opposite it is very 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.370
 importantly wear gloves when they are 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.160
 working with these disposable gloves 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.720
 do not take the risk that we may have 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.580
 diseases take into account that the 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.320
 most of the animals we go to 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.690
 work the reproductive organs 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.250
 what we are working with are animals 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.530
 that went to the slaughterhouse for X 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.180
 reason can be because of illness can be 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.940
 by reproduction or anything but 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.520
 we do not know we are then they take 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.490
 the precaution always to wear gloves 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:01.410
 when they are working in this way 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:03.600
 happening following the talk we talk about 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.760
 the parts of the reproductive organ the 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.580
 cow and we have here an organ that has 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.320
 open me so they can see what 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.780
 that we are 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.639
 although we are working starting with 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.080
 the vulva remembers that we talk about the 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.880
 vulva that are the lips what 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.520
 Currently we can see the organ 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.680
 player and then we go to the vagina 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.060
 which is very important also because 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.780
 this is the part where where 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.820
 we introduce the rod in this case is 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.180
 very difficult to see but here I'm going to put the 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.250
 finger is the entrance to the bladder this is 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.810
 the part that remembers that we speak that 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.180
 you always have to insert the rod 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.250
 upwards to keep the 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.200
 rod in this part if the 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.090
 rod to the tableware again the cow goes 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.130
 to respond very nervously and very and 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.590
 with a lot of pain and it's probably going to 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.510
 give a kick then take care in 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.450
 always insert the rod towards 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:58.600
 up we continue with the one of the vulva to 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:01.690
 alludes to the vagina of the cow as they can 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.320
 see is very soft well elastic all 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.470
 all right 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.210
 easy to move but that yes that's 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.470
 much easier when you feel 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.020
 the rod that they are entering are going to 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.479
 feel this is very smooth and then 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.360
 let's say to the organ that we're going to 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:16.310
 to work 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.719
 what is the servef if you can see 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:22.460
 that service is a bit more fixed 

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:25.039
 it seems there are several descriptions that have 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.860
 given in texture how it feels 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:30.050
 they say that it feels like a neck of 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:34.099
 hen that you have felt that you have 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:36.530
 eaten in the good wines that there are but 

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:39.469
 all these all have different 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:43.840
 textures a little harder more different 

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:47.449
 to the elastic and soft that is the vagina 

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:51.590
 so many times when we get to the 

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:53.659
 alser vex and we fix that seen in the hand 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.490
 and then when we try to introduce the 

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:57.979
 rod we enter the bags 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.719
 around the cervix thinking that 

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:01.990
 we are entering and we have reached a 

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:01.990
 ring
