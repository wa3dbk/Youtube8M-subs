you who don't know how to read it

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.060 
you who don't know how to read it
already

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
already

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.519

even a little bit on reading sheet music
as<00:00:36.150> well<00:00:36.390> because<00:00:36.810> the<00:00:37.080> the<00:00:37.530> sheet<00:00:37.770> music<00:00:38.250> is

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
as well because the the sheet music is

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
tablature and I mentioned about systems

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.040 
tablature and I mentioned about systems
of<00:00:42.600> learning<00:00:44.120> learning<00:00:45.120> by<00:00:45.420> ear

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
of learning learning by ear

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.890 
of learning learning by ear
learning<00:00:46.680> by<00:00:46.940> tablature<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.120> also<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> little

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
learning by tablature and also a little

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.020 
learning by tablature and also a little
bit<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.290> being<00:00:49.980> able<00:00:50.130> to<00:00:50.280> read<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.760> little

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
bit of being able to read just a little

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
bit of being able to read just a little
bit<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.300> sheet<00:00:51.690> music<00:00:51.900> for<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.470> timing<00:00:52.920> that's

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
bit of sheet music for the timing that's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.300 
bit of sheet music for the timing that's
involved<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.700> some<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.940> these<00:00:55.040> licks<00:00:56.040> and

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
phrases so all those the three systems

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.450 
phrases so all those the three systems
of<00:01:00.630> learning<00:01:01.110> are<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.800> available<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

to play on train 45 is a lip that you've

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.520 
to play on train 45 is a lip that you've
already<00:01:48.350> learned<00:01:49.340> in<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.610> previous<00:01:50.170> segment<00:01:51.170> as

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
already learned in a previous segment as

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.370 
already learned in a previous segment as
well<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:52.430> being<00:01:52.900> we're<00:01:53.900> going<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.080> use<00:01:54.230> the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
well that being we're going to use the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.260 
well that being we're going to use the
forward<00:01:54.650> roll<00:01:55.070> with<00:01:55.670> that

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
forward roll with that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.240 
forward roll with that
you<00:01:56.720> remember<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.200> forward<00:01:57.770> roll<00:01:57.950> patter

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
you remember that forward roll patter

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.680 
you remember that forward roll patter
and<00:01:58.400> I<00:01:58.550> said<00:01:58.790> you're<00:01:58.910> going<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.210> use<00:01:59.330> quite<00:01:59.630> a

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
and I said you're going to use quite a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.120 
and I said you're going to use quite a
lot<00:01:59.900> in<00:02:00.200> bluegrass<00:02:00.410> what<00:02:00.860> we're<00:02:00.980> going<00:02:01.100> to

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
lot in bluegrass what we're going to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.980 
lot in bluegrass what we're going to
start<00:02:01.370> off<00:02:01.780> using<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:03.200> very<00:02:03.980> same<00:02:04.340> lick

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
start off using that very same lick

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.830 
start off using that very same lick
so<00:02:05.990> that'll<00:02:06.290> it<00:02:06.380> consisted<00:02:07.040> of<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:08.149> using

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
so that'll it consisted of the the using

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.510 
so that'll it consisted of the the using
the<00:02:08.960> hammer<00:02:09.200> on<00:02:10.750> from<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:12.200> second<00:02:12.620> fret<00:02:12.890> to

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
the hammer on from the second fret to
