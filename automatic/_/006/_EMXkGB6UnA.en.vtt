blade 350 QX right now I have my

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.729 
blade 350 QX right now I have my
spectrum<00:00:27.820> transmitter<00:00:28.480> programmed<00:00:29.079> to

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
control and fly my 350 QX I use the main

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.320 
control and fly my 350 QX I use the main
control<00:00:34.900> sticks<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.430> in<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:37.030> normal

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
control sticks and in the normal

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.590 
control sticks and in the normal
capacity<00:00:37.449> but<00:00:37.900> I<00:00:37.989> also<00:00:38.110> use<00:00:38.440> 4<00:00:38.920> switches<00:00:39.250> I<00:00:39.699> use

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.310 
mode fight mode 3 is the agility mode I
also<00:01:00.460> use<00:01:00.879> this<00:01:01.299> stick<00:01:01.600> which<00:01:01.780> is<00:01:01.960> normally

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
also use this stick which is normally

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.289 
also use this stick which is normally
the<00:01:02.949> switch<00:01:03.250> which<00:01:03.460> is<00:01:03.610> normally<00:01:03.939> for<00:01:04.150> my

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
the switch which is normally for my

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.300 
the switch which is normally for my
flaps<00:01:04.600> here<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.500> controlling<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.220> return

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
flaps here is controlling the return

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.730 
flaps here is controlling the return
home<00:01:06.670> function<00:01:07.180> at<00:01:07.689> the<00:01:07.810> top<00:01:07.840> it's<00:01:08.320> normal

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
home function at the top it's normal

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.210 
home function at the top it's normal
that<00:01:09.930> means<00:01:10.930> it's<00:01:11.140> just<00:01:11.439> flying<00:01:11.680> around<00:01:11.890> just

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
that means it's just flying around just

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.190 
that means it's just flying around just
lying<00:01:12.400> around<00:01:12.520> middle<00:01:13.420> switch<00:01:13.659> is<00:01:13.840> nothing

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
lying around middle switch is nothing

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.700 
lying around middle switch is nothing
and<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.560> bottom<00:01:14.830> switches<00:01:15.220> return<00:01:15.549> home<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
and the bottom switches return home and

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.320 
and the bottom switches return home and
I'm<00:01:17.830> using<00:01:18.040> step<00:01:18.400> 1<00:01:18.610> because<00:01:18.850> there<00:01:19.000> was<00:01:19.119> no

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
I'm using step 1 because there was no

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.130 
I'm using step 1 because there was no
return<00:01:19.479> home<00:01:20.130> discussion<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.340> also<00:01:21.880> use<00:01:22.329> triple

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
return home discussion I also use triple

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.940 
return home discussion I also use triple
trim<00:01:23.530> tabs<00:01:23.799> for<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.369> elevator<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.409> for<00:01:29.829> my

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
trim tabs for the elevator so and for my

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.669 
trim tabs for the elevator so and for my
aileron<00:01:32.520> high-rate<00:01:33.569> so<00:01:34.569> it<00:01:34.810> when<00:01:35.229> I'm<00:01:35.380> flying

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
aileron high-rate so it when I'm flying

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.289 
aileron high-rate so it when I'm flying
I<00:01:35.979> don't<00:01:36.189> have<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.369> look<00:01:36.490> down<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.729> see<00:01:37.090> what's

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
I don't have to look down to see what's

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:37.980 
I don't have to look down to see what's
happening

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
happening

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.429 
happening
the<00:01:38.469> other<00:01:38.560> major<00:01:38.829> control<00:01:39.310> used<00:01:39.579> and<00:01:40.439> gives

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
the other major control used and gives

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.499 
the other major control used and gives
the<00:01:41.560> trim<00:01:41.799> tab<00:01:42.039> when<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.030> when<00:01:43.359> the

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
the trim tab when the when the

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.660 
the trim tab when the when the
quadcopter<00:01:44.170> is<00:01:44.649> landed<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.369> want<00:01:45.549> the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
quadcopter is landed and I want the

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.480 
quadcopter is landed and I want the
motors<00:01:45.969> to<00:01:46.119> stop<00:01:46.499> operating<00:01:47.499> I<00:01:47.679> push<00:01:48.310> that

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
motors to stop operating I push that

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.480 
motors to stop operating I push that
down<00:01:48.789> so<00:01:49.479> my<00:01:49.810> spectrum<00:01:50.200> dx9<00:01:50.799> transmitter<00:01:51.340> is

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
down so my spectrum dx9 transmitter is

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.359 
down so my spectrum dx9 transmitter is
programmed<00:01:51.999> for<00:01:52.149> my<00:01:52.600> plate<00:01:52.960> 350<00:01:53.590> QX<00:01:53.859> and

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
programmed for my plate 350 QX and

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.020 
programmed for my plate 350 QX and
you've<00:01:54.939> just<00:01:54.969> heard<00:01:55.359> the<00:01:55.539> commands
