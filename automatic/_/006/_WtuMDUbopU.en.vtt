00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 let's go the glace is done with a clear 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.760
 set 250 grams of sugar and juice 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.950
 lemon how much lemon juice a quarter of 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.280
 cup adding the juice of a lemon aiju 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.359
 of last perfect ready then lemon 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.520
 pica or lemon adhere to that I have 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.680
 more doubts and he seemed to make the meringue 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.529
 just that the lemon is going to give you like that 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.420
 more gritty texture at the most makes 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.420
 gritty that's like making a meringue 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.420
 I'm going to take it with care 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.500
 but then look what I have here is 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.320
 simply an egg white and what 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.180
 let's beat 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.200
 if I had advanced a little bit the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.480
 beaten on time 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.480
 and we are going to incorporate sugar flower 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.970
 and mid morning 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.070
 web 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.180
 7 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.260
 it can only be stevia also or not in 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:35.240
 this case does not serve that sugar is a 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.240
 unless we could experience 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.479
 about this 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.479
 but for him 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.610
 for your good health is being week 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.930

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.350
 entertaining creative and you take 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.630
 double tickets for this weekend 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.230
 it's a big picture it's like in health 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.700
 in the araucano park project in addition to 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.050
 the cookies exist as other 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.990
 recipes 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.220
 they are only for Christmas the bread of 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.220
 Christmas that more 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.260
 only let's go let's leave it is 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.850
 It's there and I'll show you how 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.230
 the couple cookies are left 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.040
 it seems to you because in the background you have 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.040
 what to see when they try 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.700
 you have to do it like for a while and 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:50.950
 thicken you already have thought to go to the street 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:56.670
 hard come in your street magic 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.670
 this is entertaining for children 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:11.860
 these are the probable ones and these are the 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:15.930
 we were born with the first plus that is the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.920
 white that is decorating but we 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.270
 we replaced a little vegetable coloring 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.680
 since we just did we put a 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.480
 touch of vegetable coloring 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.870
 and now my mind wants if we had the 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.189
 cookie already cooked I feel that I 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.569
 it seems that he had an appetite creates and 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.170
 saved that was ready to arrive and 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.170
 add 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.609
 then we started true in addition to a 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:50.230
 jiffy because we 're not seeing what 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:52.359
 that makes the cookie there is at 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.459
 account of 1 2 and 3 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.200
 what is the name of that question that we are 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.000
 in a sleeve 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.000
 a pastry bag but we can be 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.629
 we can also use 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.970
 if we do not have a pastry bag or that 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.600
 the glass that you put it in and that 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.490
 Vegetable coloring 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.830
 It can be done with a syringe too 

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.830
 if you can ideally with this video 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:37.270
 Mr 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:42.050
 and there you can get creative and free 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.550
 but with clean conscience these 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.400
 cookies that are super simple have 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.990
 few ingredients the first time 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.220
 we play very little things because in 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.380
 reality when they tell us about decoster 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.540
 Christmas we always imagine things like 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.850
 faces and then I wanted to mention that I 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.380
 It seems very important in the case of 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.380
 cookies that we made with oatmeal the base 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.950
 of fruit and oats is a very 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.380
 rich in fiber and fiber vitamin b calcium 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.930
 it has iron also has a good 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.940
 protein source then makes the 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.560
 food is much more complete and 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.590
 little girl the fact that it's made of oats 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.590
 that the road product produces more 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.150
 satiety already then when allowed 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.280
 make us faster we eat less 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.050
 declared that we see ourselves without guilt anymore 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.790
 so the idea is that we can treat 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.680
 of doing always incorporate in fact in 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.480
 other recipes integral products already 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.980
 what are we associated with? 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.440
 faster and we do not have to eat 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.740
 large quantities replace the banana 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.360
 for some other apple 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:43.949
 the apple can be already or could be 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.949
 subtle in this time strawberries 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.669
 with a variety of problems both 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.680
 if the idea is that everything is 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.729
 they invite the children to the kitchen and the 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.800
 cookies we can remove the children 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:02.729
 we can make a family afternoon a day 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.729
 cooking
