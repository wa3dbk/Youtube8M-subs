00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.880
 trailer drove the a 44 in direction 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.250
 dortmund as him out yet 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.170
 clarified cause a car drove up 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.030
 because of the enormous power was the 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.340
 trailer hurled and came 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.870
 opposite to the direction of travel 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.950
 partly on an adjacent meadow 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.170
 piece to stand 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.130
 the three vehicle occupants came with the 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.770
 frighten off 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.870
 the second casualty lost the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.969
 control over his vehicle shot one 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.159
 Bank high and stayed at tree height 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.600
 lying on the roof 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.219
 before a rescue of the driver 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.019
 was still thought to be in the vehicle 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.640
 At first this could be done 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.420
 Vehicle secured against slipping 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.460
 become 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.870
 only then could the slightly injured 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.940
 driver out of his predicament 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.289
 he was freed after one 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.819
 Initial medical care at the 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.440
 accident site with relatively light 

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:59.649
 injuries in a nearby 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.539
 hospital 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.190
 the car had totalschaden is 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.500
 got stuck above the hook and 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.330
 but in retrospect with ours 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.760
 crane trucks from increased so that no 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.920
 more evidence whether the 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.720
 strong rainfall is a reason for the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.580
 could have been an accident could us 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.560
 the police do not confirm yet 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.530
 here we see recordings of the near 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.000

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.680
 accident were recorded 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.790
 partly the highway stood here 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.790
 completely under water 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.480
 due to the very elaborate 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.670
 recovery measures had the a 44 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.410
 temporarily be fully blocked 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.090
 with a crane of the professional fire brigade 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.220
 Kassel could then return the vehicle 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.290
 be lifted back onto the roadway 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.060
 The sailplane trailer was through 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.650
 a recovery company back in the 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.570
 right direction of travel turned 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.060
 for this too, the highway had to 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.800
 In the short term, it was completely closed 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.440
 to significant disabilities 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.420
 around the westkreuz kassel after 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.880
 The police kassel will be the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.600
 Property damage with around 50,000 euros 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.600
