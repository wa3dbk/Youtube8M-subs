for<00:01:51.899> car<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.320> use<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:53.100> my<00:01:53.520> guess<00:01:53.759> is

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
for car to use this like my guess is

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.789 
for car to use this like my guess is
that<00:01:53.939> he<00:01:54.390> wanted<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.780> show<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.439> him<00:01:55.560> maybe

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
that he wanted to show that to him maybe

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.139 
that he wanted to show that to him maybe
bring<00:01:56.070> some<00:01:56.100> 0<00:01:56.310> because<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.670> maybe<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.060> was

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
bring some 0 because that maybe that was

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.730 
bring some 0 because that maybe that was
like<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> first<00:01:57.509> card<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.990> he<00:01:58.140> was<00:01:58.290> given<00:01:58.500> to

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
