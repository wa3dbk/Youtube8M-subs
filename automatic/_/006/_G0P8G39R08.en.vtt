00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.930
 Pudong Desu in rpg definitive feeling like 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:38.630
 Playstation 2 was released and made a big hit dell its more elements 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:43.150
 Appeared in the ps vita as Soma 4 The Golden you are adding a 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.150
 I talked to the number of producers' bridges 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:52.769
 psp when fine of Persona 3 and it is the performance of that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:57.400
 I have to cut the movie or cut the production by all means 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:01:01.150

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.220
 The next time you have the opportunity to just vita 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.860
 I got it by chance 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.790
 Then let's do it with this 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:15.440
 Or rather it is not necessary to give up its simply nothing 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:18.060
 It can also be a little more beautiful I mean Ikeru by Tashi 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.180
 I was also clear of problems with capacity 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.630
 But it's good hard too me 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.630
 I think 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.150
 After all it is a very simple story if it says in p 4 but it is drawing performance, too 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.570
 p is better 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.740
 There is no problem at all, it moves by + 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:43.760
 The other one is the size of the screen 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:47.920

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:51.130
 The student life in the country town 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.950
 If you have a small screen, there is no sense of presence 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.450
 A little big 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.450
 Because there is a sense of reality 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.510

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.909

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:15.230
 Like being a beater once 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.230
 It may be a bit unsatisfactory if it is a ps 2 graduate 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.110
 Well one person who is connected with various people 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.220

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.249

 One feature is that various contents are prepared gorgeously 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:17.530
