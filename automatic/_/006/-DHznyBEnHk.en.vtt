00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140
 ManÃ© snack me to see 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.680
 yang 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.680
 Yes Yes 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.380
 the first units of the renovated c 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.740
 max and grand c max came to the 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.510
 dealers last June 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.070
 these minivans of compact size 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.290
 and a half with five and seven seats 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.480
 respectively they have received changes 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.140
 aesthetics of equipment and its offer 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.140
 of engines 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.600
 I 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.020
 the c-max has a length of 438 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.880
 meters with a width of 183 meters and 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.880
 a height of 161 meters 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.200
 do not 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.679
 the most significant change of image 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.210
 is on the front with the new 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.719
 large grill and design 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.039
 inspired by the sports aston martin 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.199
 the windshield wipers are now 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.470
 hidden and the hood has a more 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.470
 cleansed 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.980
 the tailgate has an appearance 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.110
 more fluid thanks to the use of 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.730
 innovative laser welding techniques 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.810
 and the pilots have a more design 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.810
 compact and modern 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.850
 inside, they have improved 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.250
 finished and there is a greater feeling of 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.250
 quality thanks in part to the optimized 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.630
 Silence of march for it was used 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.820
 a greater amount of materials 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.290
 insulators and absorbers and some crystals 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.290
 thicker sides 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.460
 a novelty in the segment is the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.110
 hands-free gate technology that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.030
 allows users to access the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.509
 trunk with a simple movement of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.369
 foot is an option that costs 600 euros and 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.369
 includes keyless opening and access 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.500
 the trunk offers a remarkable volume 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.680
 of 471 liters that can be expanded up to 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.520
 the thousand 723 liters knocking down the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.520
 rear seats 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.230
 another innovation is the gasoline engine that 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.690
 mounts the proven version is about 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.790
 15-liter keko bus that improves on 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.420
 fuel efficiency that with 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.950
 like 1.6 liters which it replaces with the 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.450
 blood and the aluminum cylinder head this 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.580
 four cylinders in line has 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.670
 Four valves per injection cylinder 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.040
 direct and turbocharger ratio one 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.989
 maximum power of 150 horses and a 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.330
 remarkable torque that already reaches 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.100
 the maximum value at 1600 revolutions per 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.450
 minute and keeps it up to 4,000 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.450
 revolutions per minute 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.140
 the available driving force is 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.090
 moves to the front wheels by 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.010
 means of a 6-speed manual transmission and 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.010
 you have the stop system to be 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.360
 the c-max has a weight of 1,395 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.980
 kilograms but the elastic motor that 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.780
 It stands out for its great smoothness of march 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.239
 allows you to accelerate from 0 to 100 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.489
 kilometers per hour in 94 seconds and 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.299
 reach a maximum speed of 204 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.299
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.760
 the average consumption approved by force is 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.590
 6.1 liters per 100 kilometers and in 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.959
 Our test performed under conditions 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.270
 dynamic we have got 9 liters per 100 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.620
 kilometers the figure is high for a 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.360
 car of this size power and 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.750
 benefits and is above the 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.750
 homologated 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.700
 c-max improve their behavior 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.800
 dynamic with firmer suspensions 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.900
 to reduce the rolling buffers 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.030
 recalibrated and with a valve design 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.250
 optimized that enhance the feeling of 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.230
 agility in the direction and adjustments in the 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.160
 electric power steering to achieve 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.160
 more precision 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.510
 it has an improved version of the 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.370
 city braking assistant who helps 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.650
 to avoid or reduce the seriousness of 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.530
 collisions at low speed in environment 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.690
 urban now works at speeds of 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.520
 up to 50 kilometers per hour compared to 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.610
 the 30 kilometers per hour of the version 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.610
 previous 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.270
 the pre-collision assistant works 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.800
 way similar to city braking 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.710
 but with a detection range of 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.520
 much larger vehicles that goes from 8 to 180 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.520
 kilometers per hour 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.180
 Adaptive cruise control costs 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.770
 800 euros and allows to maintain a 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.720
 determined distance with the vehicle 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.610
 precedent although its speed is more 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.610
 low than the selected cruise 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.460
 more sensors have been placed 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.319
 distance and now the system 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.569
 assisted parking adds capacity 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:19.389
 to park on battery and get out of the 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:21.370
 square without touching the steering wheel also 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.840
 It has cross traffic alert 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.840
 for the outputs in reverse 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.999
 titanium finish is the highest and 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.770
 It includes safety equipment and 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.749
 very broad comfort although there are quite a few 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.009
 optional elements as upholstery 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:39.689
 leather that rode the unit 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.489
 tests that goes in a package that costs 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:43.080
 two thousand euros and also includes the 

00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:44.610
 electrical adjustment on the seat of the 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.909
 conductor and heating in the 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.129
 front seats as standard is included 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:51.839
 the multimedia system singh 2 that 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.849
 includes a touch screen of 8 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:56.879
 inches and the amount of 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.739
 The controls are also different 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:01.830
 of the air conditioner and the console has more 

00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:03.929
 space for objects between the seats 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:08.659
 front there is a gap with large lid 

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:08.659
 capacity that includes both usb sockets 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.699
 the posture during is comfortable and enjoy 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.320
 of a remarkable visibility 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.080
 the seats hold the body well and 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.850
 there is good support for the left foot 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.380
 the rear seats are quite spacious 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.360
 with a more comfortable center of the 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.250
 usual and adjustable air vents 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.750
 of the air conditioning although the windows 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.750
 backs do not come down completely 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.770
 What we liked the most was the 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.990
 softness and silence of the quality march 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.610
 of materials and finishes and commitment 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.610
 between efficiency and running comfort 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.669
 I 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.289
 what has been least liked have been the 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.720
 high consumption that the wheel of 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:07:00.310
 emergency spare is optional and the 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.310
 threaded ceiling antenna that is fragile 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.070
 if it costs
