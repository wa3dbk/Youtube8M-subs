I<00:00:37.160> think<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:38.540> implant<00:00:39.230> seems<00:00:39.890> safe<00:00:40.550> every

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
I think the implant seems safe every

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.120 
I think the implant seems safe every
surgery<00:00:41.540> has<00:00:41.630> a<00:00:42.670> downside<00:00:44.110> but<00:00:45.110> I<00:00:45.530> think<00:00:45.980> this

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
surgery has a downside but I think this

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.910 
surgery has a downside but I think this
one<00:00:46.370> should<00:00:46.400> be<00:00:46.760> okay<00:00:47.330> and<00:00:47.540> successful<00:00:48.200> I<00:00:48.500> hope

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
one should be okay and successful I hope

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.510 
one should be okay and successful I hope
and<00:00:49.510> I<00:00:50.510> think<00:00:50.750> it's<00:00:50.870> better<00:00:51.080> more<00:00:52.040> natural

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
and I think it's better more natural

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.630 
and I think it's better more natural
than<00:00:52.910> wearing<00:00:53.050> contact<00:00:54.050> lenses<00:00:54.140> I<00:00:54.680> want<00:00:55.520> to

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
than wearing contact lenses I want to

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.880 
than wearing contact lenses I want to
change<00:00:55.940> my<00:00:56.210> eye<00:00:56.240> colour<00:00:56.690> because<00:00:57.200> everyone<00:00:57.680> in

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890

I think the implants are very good and
safe<00:02:24.030> because<00:02:24.650> it's<00:02:25.650> better<00:02:25.860> than<00:02:26.129> putting

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
if my surgery I think they should if

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.500 
if my surgery I think they should if
they<00:04:02.920> really<00:04:03.400> want<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:03.670> have<00:04:03.970> bright<00:04:04.239> eyes

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.259 
because I think it's safe and if you
save<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.620> lot<00:04:08.860> of<00:04:08.920> money<00:04:09.040> instead<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:10.000> paying

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
save a lot of money instead of paying

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.940 
save a lot of money instead of paying
for<00:04:10.420> something<00:04:11.019> that<00:04:11.200> looks<00:04:11.230> big<00:04:11.650> like

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950
