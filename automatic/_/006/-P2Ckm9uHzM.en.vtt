00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
 "Which brand of canned tuna contains the most mercury?" 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.900
 "Are some canned tuna brands worse than others?" 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.460
 Recently, measurements of mercury concentrations were made in three US 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.340
 canned tuna brands. 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.840
 Overall, they found that "55% of all tuna studied exceeded the limit 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.700
 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for human consumption. " 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.720
 Mercury is not just a problem for children. 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.260
 As I have mentioned over the years in several videos, "the health consequences of consuming methylmercury 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.020
 in adults they are significant and may include 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.440
 central nervous system damage, ataxia, paraesthesia, hearing loss, impaired vision 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.880
 loss of sensation in the limbs and loss of consciousness leading to death. " 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.329
 “Due to the increased susceptibility of the developing nervous system 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.740
 however, the damage is more apparent in human fetuses, infants and young children. These may include 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.740
 microcephaly (shrinking of the brain), delayed child development, impaired cognitive ability 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.580
 and severe neurological disorders. " 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.260
 They suggest that due to the measured quantities of mercury in canned tuna 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.100
 an average nine-year-old would have already exceeded the EPA threshold when consumed 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.200
 more than one can of tuna every 43 days. 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.920
 This is not the first study on canned tuna. 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.300
 Previous studies, some even 20 years old, have found high levels of mercury 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.440
 however, they were not as high as today's. 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.980
 The problem with mercury in tuna is obviously getting worse and worse. 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.180
 Which brand was the worst? 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.040
 The national number three contained significantly more mercury 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.080
 than the other two, researchers did not disclose which brand it was. 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.800
 They just didn't want to tell. 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.900
 All they said was that these results suggest "a stricter need 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.680
 regulation of the canned tuna industry ”to ensure this 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.300
 vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, infants and children.
