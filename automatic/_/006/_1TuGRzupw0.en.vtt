00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.090 
yeah skittish little creatures aren't
you

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.360 

oh<00:00:31.190> you<00:00:32.090> know<00:00:32.300> that<00:00:32.480> skittish

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.910 

okay<00:00:37.370> this<00:00:37.610> is<00:00:37.790> dawn<00:00:38.950> in<00:00:40.180> Olympia<00:00:41.740> on<00:00:42.740> the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
okay this is dawn in Olympia on the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.380 
okay this is dawn in Olympia on the
Olympia<00:00:43.280> Peninsula<00:00:43.960> I'm<00:00:44.960> a<00:00:45.020> hurricane<00:00:45.620> ridge

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
Olympia Peninsula I'm a hurricane ridge

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.340 
Olympia Peninsula I'm a hurricane ridge
and<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:47.570> down<00:00:47.810> there<00:00:48.970> is<00:00:49.970> Vancouver<00:00:50.900> on<00:00:51.230> the

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
and that down there is Vancouver on the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.750 
and that down there is Vancouver on the
other<00:00:51.470> side<00:00:51.710> of<00:00:51.740> the<00:00:51.860> strikes<00:00:52.220> and<00:00:52.520> this<00:00:52.580> is

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
other side of the strikes and this is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.590 
other side of the strikes and this is
all<00:00:53.560> fogged<00:00:54.560> in<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.100> I<00:00:55.760> got<00:00:56.000> my<00:00:56.120> little<00:00:56.360> time

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
all fogged in and I got my little time

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.020 
all fogged in and I got my little time
lapse<00:00:56.840> going<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:58.760> record<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:01.160> sea<00:01:01.820> fog

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
lapse going to record the sea fog

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:25.560 
lapse going to record the sea fog
burning<00:01:02.420> off

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.469 

ok<00:01:26.570> that's<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.990> Olympia<00:01:27.409> Peninsula<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:29.180> I've

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
ok that's the Olympia Peninsula and I've

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.929 
ok that's the Olympia Peninsula and I've
gotten<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.810> this<00:01:30.820> in<00:01:31.820> Mount<00:01:32.179> Olympus<00:01:32.799> and<00:01:33.939> this

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
gotten to this in Mount Olympus and this

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:42.700 
gotten to this in Mount Olympus and this
is<00:01:35.360> all<00:01:38.470> basaltic<00:01:39.640> lava<00:01:40.640> deposits<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.710> this

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
is all basaltic lava deposits and this

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.569 
is all basaltic lava deposits and this
Mount<00:01:43.399> Olympus<00:01:43.909> is<00:01:44.329> sedimentary<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:46.460> can

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
Mount Olympus is sedimentary you can

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.710 
Mount Olympus is sedimentary you can
believe<00:01:46.819> that<00:01:47.289> got<00:01:48.289> into<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:49.479> beastie<00:01:50.479> over

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
believe that got into this beastie over

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.969 
believe that got into this beastie over
there<00:01:51.130> one<00:01:52.130> there<00:01:52.750> is<00:01:53.750> sedimentary<00:01:54.470> top<00:01:54.799> on

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
there one there is sedimentary top on

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.830 
there one there is sedimentary top on
that<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:57.530> it's<00:01:57.679> not<00:01:57.799> volcanic<00:01:58.009> at<00:01:58.459> all<00:01:58.640> well<00:01:59.479> it

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
that so it's not volcanic at all well it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.719 
that so it's not volcanic at all well it
is<00:01:59.959> and<00:02:00.140> isn't<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.500> uplift<00:02:00.979> this<00:02:01.490> is<00:02:01.610> all

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
is and isn't the uplift this is all

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.550 
is and isn't the uplift this is all
obviously<00:02:02.119> volcanic<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.080> uplift<00:02:03.439> was

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
obviously volcanic and the uplift was

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.490 
obviously volcanic and the uplift was
volcanic<00:02:04.209> but<00:02:05.209> I<00:02:05.299> had<00:02:05.420> no<00:02:05.569> idea<00:02:05.599> top<00:02:06.349> of

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
volcanic but I had no idea top of

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.600 
volcanic but I had no idea top of
Olympus<00:02:06.679> was<00:02:08.019> sedimentary<00:02:09.019> and<00:02:09.459> that<00:02:10.459> would

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
Olympus was sedimentary and that would

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.080 
Olympus was sedimentary and that would
put<00:02:10.819> this<00:02:11.260> much<00:02:12.260> more<00:02:12.530> akin<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:14.920> place<00:02:15.920> yet<00:02:16.160> so

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
put this much more akin to place yet so

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.410 
put this much more akin to place yet so
they<00:02:17.420> have<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.810> plate<00:02:18.500> going<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:19.819> oceanic

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
they have the plate going the oceanic

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.750 
they have the plate going the oceanic
plate<00:02:20.690> gun<00:02:20.900> down<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.489> all<00:02:22.640> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
plate gun down and this is all the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.750 
plate gun down and this is all the
sedimentary<00:02:23.299> stuff<00:02:23.600> which<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:23.870> all<00:02:23.989> contorted

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
sedimentary stuff which is all contorted

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.610 
sedimentary stuff which is all contorted
and<00:02:25.760> pushed<00:02:26.239> almost<00:02:26.630> straight<00:02:27.290> up<00:02:27.319> which

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
and pushed almost straight up which

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.020 
and pushed almost straight up which
which<00:02:27.859> is<00:02:28.010> what<00:02:28.190> we<00:02:28.280> saw<00:02:28.430> on<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.670> top<00:02:28.850> of<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
which is what we saw on the top of the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.000 
which is what we saw on the top of the
ridge<00:02:29.209> see<00:02:29.780> look<00:02:29.900> at<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.140> sedimentary<00:02:30.680> rocks

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
ridge see look at the sedimentary rocks

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.210 
ridge see look at the sedimentary rocks
around<00:02:31.280> here<00:02:32.170> let's<00:02:33.170> find<00:02:33.440> some<00:02:33.680> sedimentary

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
around here let's find some sedimentary

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.069 
around here let's find some sedimentary
rocks<00:02:34.519> here<00:02:34.760> we<00:02:34.850> go<00:02:35.470> what<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.650> find<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:38.079> the

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
rocks here we go what you find is the

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.330 
rocks here we go what you find is the
sedimentation<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:41.889> sediments<00:02:42.889> are<00:02:43.010> coming

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
sedimentation the sediments are coming

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.270 
sedimentation the sediments are coming
straight<00:02:43.790> out<00:02:43.850> towards<00:02:44.269> you<00:02:44.720> yeah<00:02:45.350> you<00:02:46.130> see

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
straight out towards you yeah you see

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.789 
straight out towards you yeah you see
this<00:02:46.480> yeah<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.630> sediment<00:02:48.049> sedimentary

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
this yeah the sediment sedimentary

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.780 
this yeah the sediment sedimentary
layers<00:02:49.069> are<00:02:50.139> coming<00:02:51.139> out<00:02:51.290> 90<00:02:52.100> degrees<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.700> way

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
layers are coming out 90 degrees the way

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.400 
layers are coming out 90 degrees the way
they<00:02:52.940> should<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.239> been<00:02:53.269> live<00:02:53.569> there<00:02:54.200> being

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
they should have been live there being

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.860 
they should have been live there being
bent<00:02:54.829> up<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.069> they've<00:02:55.430> been<00:02:55.519> bent<00:02:55.850> upwards<00:02:56.769> so

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
bent up and they've been bent upwards so

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.380 
bent up and they've been bent upwards so
the<00:02:59.440> reckoning<00:02:59.860> is<00:03:00.099> Olympia<00:03:00.760> formed<00:03:01.150> under

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
the reckoning is Olympia formed under

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.190 
the reckoning is Olympia formed under
water<00:03:01.599> and<00:03:02.340> those<00:03:03.340> up<00:03:03.519> left<00:03:04.049> which<00:03:05.049> is<00:03:05.170> why<00:03:05.970> all

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
water and those up left which is why all

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.410 
water and those up left which is why all
the<00:03:08.200> sedimentary<00:03:08.799> layers<00:03:09.069> around<00:03:09.220> here<00:03:09.670> are

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
the sedimentary layers around here are

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.380 
the sedimentary layers around here are
really<00:03:10.659> contorted<00:03:11.379> and<00:03:12.750> then<00:03:13.750> finally<00:03:15.390> this

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
really contorted and then finally this

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.839 
really contorted and then finally this
place<00:03:16.629> got<00:03:16.810> hammered<00:03:17.049> by<00:03:17.290> glaciation<00:03:18.069> which

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
place got hammered by glaciation which

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.160 
place got hammered by glaciation which
is<00:03:18.970> why<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.239> get<00:03:19.390> all<00:03:19.510> these<00:03:19.659> you<00:03:19.900> shaped

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
is why you get all these you shaped

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.819 
is why you get all these you shaped
valleys<00:03:21.269> as<00:03:22.269> you<00:03:22.450> can<00:03:22.569> see<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:22.930> place<00:03:23.290> starts

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
valleys as you can see this place starts

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.520 
valleys as you can see this place starts
to<00:03:23.950> crawl<00:03:24.280> some<00:03:24.579> about<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.909> move<00:03:25.060> arms

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
to crawl some about the move arms

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.470 
to crawl some about the move arms
however<00:03:28.739> it's<00:03:29.739> just<00:03:30.640> a<00:03:30.700> chat<00:03:31.060> with<00:03:31.209> one<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.359> the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
however it's just a chat with one of the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.300 
however it's just a chat with one of the
Rangers<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.019> I'd<00:03:32.079> always<00:03:32.260> assumed<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.890> this

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
Rangers and I'd always assumed that this

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.610 
Rangers and I'd always assumed that this
thing<00:03:33.549> behind<00:03:33.700> me<00:03:34.000> here<00:03:34.500> was<00:03:35.879> like<00:03:36.879> rainia

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
thing behind me here was like rainia

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.289 
thing behind me here was like rainia
big-ass<00:03:38.620> volcano<00:03:39.489> that<00:03:39.819> just<00:03:40.150> got<00:03:40.269> hammered

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
big-ass volcano that just got hammered

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.559 
big-ass volcano that just got hammered
by<00:03:40.720> glaciers<00:03:41.019> but<00:03:41.440> it's<00:03:41.620> not<00:03:41.829> it's<00:03:42.790> the

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
by glaciers but it's not it's the

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.020 
by glaciers but it's not it's the
ancient<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:45.010> used<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.370> be<00:03:45.489> an<00:03:45.549> ancient

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
ancient this used to be an ancient

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.649 
ancient this used to be an ancient
sedimentary<00:03:46.629> bay<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:48.659> continental

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
sedimentary bay and the continental

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.809 
sedimentary bay and the continental
plate<00:03:49.930> is<00:03:50.140> actually<00:03:50.500> full<00:03:50.620> plate<00:03:50.980> it's<00:03:51.549> not

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
plate is actually full plate it's not

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.199 
plate is actually full plate it's not
the<00:03:52.680> Pacific<00:03:53.680> oceanic<00:03:54.220> crust<00:03:54.519> that's<00:03:54.790> pushing

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
the Pacific oceanic crust that's pushing

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.640 
the Pacific oceanic crust that's pushing
all<00:03:55.329> this<00:03:55.450> up<00:03:55.629> there's<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.900> little<00:03:56.019> flake<00:03:56.319> near

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
all this up there's a little flake near

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.920 
all this up there's a little flake near
that<00:03:56.859> push<00:03:57.099> it<00:03:57.220> up<00:03:57.340> that's<00:03:57.879> responsible<00:03:58.209> for

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
that push it up that's responsible for

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.869 
that push it up that's responsible for
the<00:03:59.019> Cascade<00:03:59.560> it's<00:03:59.829> also<00:03:59.980> responsible<00:04:00.760> for

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
the Cascade it's also responsible for

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.510 
the Cascade it's also responsible for
the<00:04:01.599> uplift<00:04:02.019> and

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.530 

the<00:04:05.120> mountains<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.750> you<00:04:05.990> see<00:04:06.200> behind<00:04:06.380> me<00:04:07.540> and

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
the mountains that you see behind me and

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.750 
the mountains that you see behind me and
so<00:04:09.140> what<00:04:09.380> you<00:04:09.530> actually<00:04:09.680> find<00:04:10.070> is<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.490> met<00:04:10.610> all

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
so what you actually find is the met all

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.520 
so what you actually find is the met all
these<00:04:10.910> mountains<00:04:11.420> are<00:04:11.630> actually<00:04:12.020> almost

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
these mountains are actually almost

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.230 
these mountains are actually almost
entirely<00:04:13.100> sedimentary<00:04:13.730> there<00:04:13.940> is<00:04:14.030> some

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
entirely sedimentary there is some

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.690 
entirely sedimentary there is some
volcanism<00:04:14.720> around<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.230> outside<00:04:15.680> but<00:04:16.520> this

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
volcanism around the outside but this

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.699 
volcanism around the outside but this
was<00:04:16.880> all<00:04:17.030> clearly<00:04:17.360> made<00:04:17.600> underwater<00:04:18.050> us<00:04:18.410> there

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
was all clearly made underwater us there

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.060 
was all clearly made underwater us there
is<00:04:18.860> pillow<00:04:19.760> lava<00:04:20.350> which<00:04:21.350> I'm<00:04:21.530> hoping<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:21.920> see

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
is pillow lava which I'm hoping to see

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.200 
is pillow lava which I'm hoping to see
on<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.340> way<00:04:22.460> down<00:04:23.800> so<00:04:24.820> yeah<00:04:25.820> I'd<00:04:26.030> always

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
on the way down so yeah I'd always

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.820 
on the way down so yeah I'd always
assume<00:04:26.600> this<00:04:26.690> was<00:04:26.840> just<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.140> volcano<00:04:27.530> they<00:04:27.710> got

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
assume this was just a volcano they got

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.740 
assume this was just a volcano they got
hammered<00:04:28.040> by<00:04:28.280> glaciers<00:04:28.550> but<00:04:28.970> it's<00:04:29.120> not<00:04:29.360> it's

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
hammered by glaciers but it's not it's

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.100 
hammered by glaciers but it's not it's
it's<00:04:30.370> mostly<00:04:31.370> sedimentary<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.240> because<00:04:32.960> it's

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
it's mostly sedimentary and because it's

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.590 
it's mostly sedimentary and because it's
right<00:04:33.410> next<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.770> ocean<00:04:34.270> as<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.480> ocean

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
right next to the ocean as the ocean

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.450 
right next to the ocean as the ocean
over<00:04:36.020> there<00:04:36.580> Pacific<00:04:37.580> there's<00:04:39.460> the

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
over there Pacific there's the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.370 
over there Pacific there's the
conditions<00:04:41.180> are<00:04:41.330> right<00:04:41.360> for<00:04:41.540> temperate

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
conditions are right for temperate

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.220 
conditions are right for temperate
rainforest<00:04:43.100> so<00:04:44.000> you<00:04:44.060> only<00:04:44.330> really<00:04:44.870> eerie

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
rainforest so you only really eerie

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.870 
rainforest so you only really eerie
rainforests<00:04:46.220> on<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:47.440> mostly<00:04:48.440> on<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.880> west

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
rainforests on the mostly on the west

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.080 
rainforests on the mostly on the west
side<00:04:50.030> of<00:04:50.570> Olympia<00:04:51.280> which<00:04:52.280> is<00:04:52.520> another<00:04:52.700> of<00:04:52.970> the

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
side of Olympia which is another of the

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.930 
side of Olympia which is another of the
main<00:04:53.420> attractions<00:04:54.080> here<00:04:54.200> and<00:04:54.580> i'll<00:04:55.580> see<00:04:55.790> if<00:04:55.880> i

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
main attractions here and i'll see if i

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.160 
main attractions here and i'll see if i
can<00:04:56.090> find<00:04:56.270> some<00:04:56.480> on<00:04:56.570> the<00:04:56.660> way<00:04:56.690> down<00:04:56.930> the

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
can find some on the way down the

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.990 
can find some on the way down the
confinement<00:04:57.950> all<00:04:58.190> over<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.520> place<00:04:58.730> down<00:04:58.940> here

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
confinement all over the place down here

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.230 
confinement all over the place down here
it's<00:04:59.780> just<00:05:00.560> that<00:05:00.830> on<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.250> west<00:05:01.460> that's<00:05:01.940> where

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
it's just that on the west that's where

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.040 
it's just that on the west that's where
the<00:05:02.590> most<00:05:03.590> dense<00:05:04.240> ok<00:05:05.240> this<00:05:05.450> is<00:05:05.630> up<00:05:05.780> on<00:05:05.930> the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
the most dense ok this is up on the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.070 
the most dense ok this is up on the
Olympic<00:05:06.470> Peninsula<00:05:07.030> or<00:05:08.030> on<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.270> coastal<00:05:08.720> side

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
Olympic Peninsula or on the coastal side

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.430 
Olympic Peninsula or on the coastal side
that's<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:09.860> west<00:05:10.370> side<00:05:10.720> and<00:05:11.720> everything<00:05:12.260> is

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
that's the west side and everything is

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.310 
that's the west side and everything is
really<00:05:12.920> hammered<00:05:13.490> with<00:05:14.390> rain<00:05:14.690> so<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.230> get

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
really hammered with rain so you get

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.600 
really hammered with rain so you get
these<00:05:15.440> temperate<00:05:16.040> rainforests<00:05:17.230> where<00:05:18.610> you

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
these temperate rainforests where you

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.910 
these temperate rainforests where you
get<00:05:19.730> some<00:05:19.910> really<00:05:20.180> quite<00:05:20.600> strange<00:05:21.080> growth<00:05:21.530> so

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
get some really quite strange growth so

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.800 
get some really quite strange growth so
this<00:05:22.100> is<00:05:22.720> one<00:05:23.720> tree<00:05:24.140> that<00:05:24.440> is<00:05:24.470> a<00:05:25.510> grown<00:05:26.510> out<00:05:26.780> of

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
this is one tree that is a grown out of

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.830 
this is one tree that is a grown out of
the<00:05:26.990> stump<00:05:27.320> of<00:05:27.440> another

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.760 

this<00:05:31.440> kind<00:05:31.710> of<00:05:31.800> funky<00:05:33.290> okay<00:05:34.290> this<00:05:34.500> is<00:05:34.650> just

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
this kind of funky okay this is just

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:43.590 
this kind of funky okay this is just
some<00:05:35.100> more<00:05:35.660> footage<00:05:36.660> of<00:05:37.110> the

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.570 

the<00:05:44.200> sort<00:05:44.470> of<00:05:44.530> thing<00:05:44.740> that<00:05:44.770> you<00:05:45.070> get<00:05:45.250> in<00:05:45.400> these

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
the sort of thing that you get in these

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.690 
the sort of thing that you get in these
temperate<00:05:46.210> rainforests<00:05:47.100> as<00:05:48.100> you<00:05:48.280> can<00:05:48.430> see

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
temperate rainforests as you can see

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.530 
temperate rainforests as you can see
everything<00:05:49.330> is<00:05:49.450> absolutely<00:05:49.660> covered<00:05:50.410> with

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
everything is absolutely covered with

00:05:51.540 --> 00:06:02.990 
everything is absolutely covered with
green<00:05:52.540> living<00:05:53.080> stuff<00:05:54.720> that

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.440 

and<00:06:04.130> quite<00:06:05.130> often<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.580> trees<00:06:05.880> you'll<00:06:06.360> get

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
and quite often the trees you'll get

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:17.960 
and quite often the trees you'll get
trees<00:06:09.450> growing<00:06:09.900> out<00:06:10.080> of<00:06:10.140> trees<00:06:16.580> this<00:06:17.580> is<00:06:17.790> the

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
trees growing out of trees this is the

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.510 
trees growing out of trees this is the
sort<00:06:18.330> of<00:06:18.420> there<00:06:19.380> are<00:06:19.470> much<00:06:19.620> denser<00:06:20.100> places

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
sort of there are much denser places

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.940 
sort of there are much denser places
than<00:06:20.670> this<00:06:20.850> but<00:06:21.090> there<00:06:21.390> I'm<00:06:22.260> more<00:06:22.620> on<00:06:22.770> the

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
than this but there I'm more on the

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.190 
than this but there I'm more on the
north<00:06:23.550> side<00:06:23.850> at<00:06:24.060> the<00:06:24.120> moment<00:06:24.480> when<00:06:24.900> you<00:06:25.050> get

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
north side at the moment when you get

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
north side at the moment when you get
onto<00:06:25.320> the<00:06:25.530> west<00:06:25.740> side<00:06:26.070> it<00:06:26.880> gets<00:06:27.210> really<00:06:27.750> dense

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
onto the west side it gets really dense

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.150 
onto the west side it gets really dense
and<00:06:29.220> even<00:06:29.580> though<00:06:29.730> there<00:06:29.940> are<00:06:30.060> some<00:06:30.270> really

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
and even though there are some really

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:39.460 
and even though there are some really
quite<00:06:32.160> big<00:06:32.490> trees<00:06:32.910> here<00:06:35.090> like<00:06:36.090> so<00:06:37.940> for<00:06:38.940> me

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
quite big trees here like so for me

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.700 
quite big trees here like so for me
there<00:06:40.470> is<00:06:40.500> only<00:06:40.890> one<00:06:41.540> place<00:06:42.540> to<00:06:42.900> see<00:06:43.080> the<00:06:43.290> big

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
there is only one place to see the big

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.230 
there is only one place to see the big
trees<00:06:44.100> and<00:06:44.400> that's<00:06:44.550> the<00:06:44.700> james<00:06:44.970> irvine

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240
