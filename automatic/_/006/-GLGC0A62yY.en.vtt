00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
of what it actually looks like but this

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.439

is<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.870> 11<00:00:54.870> inch<00:00:55.020> version<00:00:55.379> there's<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.579> 4<00:00:57.270> inch

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
is the 11 inch version there's a 4 inch

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.900 
is the 11 inch version there's a 4 inch
version<00:00:57.780> out<00:00:58.289> there<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:59.129> half<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.489> size

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
version out there that's half the size

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.479 
version out there that's half the size
of<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:04.049> almost<00:01:04.619> completely<00:01:05.250> dead

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
and not really showing any light so I'm

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.190 
and not really showing any light so I'm
going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.909> gift<00:01:09.270> go<00:01:09.570> ahead<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.869> give<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.020> a

that good in here that you can kind of

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:40.630 
that good in here that you can kind of
see<00:02:27.900> see<00:02:28.900> it

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.940 

and<00:02:41.210> does<00:02:41.569> hold<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.020> charge<00:02:42.200> after<00:02:42.620> its

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
and does hold the charge after its

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.670 
and does hold the charge after its
friggin<00:02:43.190> shaken<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.750> it's<00:02:44.990> getting<00:02:45.290> maybe<00:02:45.530> a

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
friggin shaken so it's getting maybe a

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.910 
friggin shaken so it's getting maybe a
little<00:02:46.840> it'll<00:02:47.840> go<00:02:48.100> for<00:02:49.100> about<00:02:50.650> four<00:02:51.650> minutes

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
little it'll go for about four minutes
