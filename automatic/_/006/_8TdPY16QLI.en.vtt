00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
mechanic and the super system we think

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.600 
mechanic and the super system we think
that's<00:03:06.470> really<00:03:06.800> new<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.100> really<00:03:07.250> original

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
that's really new and really original

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.000 
that's really new and really original
really<00:03:07.880> fresh<00:03:08.150> once<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:09.020> play<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.650> game<00:03:09.800> it

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
really fresh once you play the game it

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.370 
really fresh once you play the game it
makes<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.220> lot<00:03:10.340> of<00:03:10.400> sense<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:11.959> it's<00:03:12.230> not

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
makes a lot of sense and so it's not

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.110 
makes a lot of sense and so it's not
just<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.770> matter<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:13.100> being<00:03:13.280> very<00:03:13.610> similar<00:03:14.090> to

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
just a matter of being very similar to

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.640 
just a matter of being very similar to
other<00:03:14.420> games<00:03:14.630> but<00:03:14.780> also<00:03:14.870> bring<00:03:15.200> something<00:03:15.500> new

time you know playing one game quick

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.810 
time you know playing one game quick
learning<00:03:29.930> curve<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:30.500> was<00:03:30.620> already<00:03:30.860> using<00:03:31.580> /<00:03:31.670> out

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
learning curve I was already using / out

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.580 
learning curve I was already using / out
but<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.120> dropped<00:03:32.540> boom<00:03:32.750> boxes<00:03:33.140> and<00:03:33.380> great<00:03:33.530> and

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
but it dropped boom boxes and great and

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.680 
but it dropped boom boxes and great and
crazy<00:03:33.800> stuff<00:03:34.130> yeah<00:03:34.459> pull<00:03:34.700> lots<00:03:34.820> of<00:03:35.030> supers<00:03:35.390> so

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
crazy stuff yeah pull lots of supers so

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
I think that's kind of what the essence

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.100 
I think that's kind of what the essence
of<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.820> game<00:03:37.970> is<00:03:38.120> really<00:03:38.330> yeah<00:03:38.720> we<00:03:38.959> have<00:03:39.080> a

of the game is really yeah we have a
two-prong<00:03:39.470> strategy<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:40.130> we<00:03:40.220> call

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430
