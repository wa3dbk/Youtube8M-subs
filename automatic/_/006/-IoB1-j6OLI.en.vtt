just that so i'm going to show you where

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.740 
just that so i'm going to show you where
it<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.930> time<00:00:19.170> it's<00:00:19.439> another<00:00:19.680> verizon<00:00:20.130> one

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
it is this time it's another verizon one

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.200 
it is this time it's another verizon one
and<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.560> hoverboard<00:00:23.369> believe<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.000> or<00:00:24.090> not

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
and it is a hoverboard believe it or not

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.029 
and it is a hoverboard believe it or not
or<00:00:24.449> at<00:00:24.480> least<00:00:24.660> that's<00:00:24.840> what<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> ad<00:00:25.199> says<00:00:25.650> so

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
or at least that's what the ad says so

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.640 
or at least that's what the ad says so
let's<00:00:27.029> check<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.420> out<00:00:29.150> go<00:00:30.150> over<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.779> let's<00:00:31.470> see

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
let's check it out go over to let's see

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.549 
let's check it out go over to let's see
I<00:00:31.679> think<00:00:31.740> it's<00:00:32.360> well<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> think<00:00:33.840> we're<00:00:34.260> actually

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
I think it's well I think we're actually

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.840 
I think it's well I think we're actually
located<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.700> pretty<00:00:36.059> much<00:00:36.210> random<00:00:37.730> but<00:00:38.730> i'm

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
located is pretty much random but i'm

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
located is pretty much random but i'm
going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> show<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.210> where<00:00:39.510> i<00:00:39.540> found<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.829> i

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
going to show you where i found it but i

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.260 
going to show you where i found it but i
think<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> ads<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.790> be<00:00:41.820> pretty<00:00:42.090> much

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
think the ads can be pretty much

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.670 
think the ads can be pretty much
anywhere<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.670> that<00:00:44.670> wasn't<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.030> was<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.680> no

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
anywhere so that wasn't it was it no

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.200 
anywhere so that wasn't it was it no
that's<00:00:46.920> something<00:00:47.340> else<00:00:47.809> okay<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.730> we<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:50.910> over

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
that's something else okay so we go over

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:59.290 
that's something else okay so we go over
to<00:00:51.480> snow<00:00:52.440> that's<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.100> i<00:00:53.160> want<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.370> do

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.020 

right<00:00:59.989> there<00:01:00.170> okay<00:01:00.649> there<00:01:00.800> it<00:01:00.890> is<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:01.670> I'm<00:01:01.850> on

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
right there okay there it is so I'm on

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.649 
right there okay there it is so I'm on

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
apps like I that I was right but I think

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.180

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
it's random where it can be if it will

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.490 
it's random where it can be if it will
