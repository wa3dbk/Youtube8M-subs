00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:16.190
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.590
 circle tv and today we talk about such 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.470
 great car like bmpt terminator 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.470
 Well, or the frame as it should have been 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.839
 call but it doesn't matter bmpt he is bmpt 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.240
 at the eighth level we have this 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:32.570
 car in the game and is a hybrid 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.210
 main battle tank and bbm that is 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.629
 combat armored vehicles and so why 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.239
 same 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.430
 and what do we have as a result of whether this 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.469
 car or good I would like to immediately 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.570
 say that of course she is wonderful 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.850
 but let's not get ahead of ourselves let's 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.699
 understand right by the points and so have 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.129
 we have weapons well firstly 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.370
 we have a launcher for our 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.949
 tours and it consists of 4 launchers 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.320
 installations so to speak and we can start up 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.050
 immediately 4 rounds charge four at once 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.610
 pthu recharge in my 24 seconds and 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.509
 then at two second intervals 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.060
 we start to bully our opponent 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:13.790
 one-time damage of about 650 units 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.680
 quite a lot and as a result of these 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.079
 four rounds we can put in 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.280
 principle probably any tank of the seventh 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.619
 level inclusive 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.079
 or very ruin the eighth life 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.939
 level but it is worth remembering that our students 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.040
 are actually cumulative 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.329
 projectiles and even 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.860
 good armor penetration 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.860
 they are likely to break about 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.509
 dynamic protection and other screens 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.210
 Of course you need to still get 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.369
 confident and accurate opponent and not at that 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.590
 the place where he has a bar is not too much and 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.200
 so going back to arming 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.630
 here we still have 2 30 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.149
 millimeter twin guns shoot 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.860
 they are not simultaneously but separately, that is 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.020
 take turns while just 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.600
 rate of fire is actually not higher than 200 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.060
 a 300 rounds per minute ammunition 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.850
 pretty impressive nearly 500 shells 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.920
 which is pretty good and we can choose 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.829
 between subscalers who pierce 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.720
 in my opinion 155 millimeters in stock and in 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.280
 top a few millimeters more 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.959
 and 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.450
 there is a high-explosive tape in order 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.850
 to kill and about heavy targets right in 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.160
 forehead while in some kind of vulnerabilities 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.410
 undergo quite impressive damage or 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.270
 let's say the same leopard two again 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.130
 the roof of the tower is being thrown too 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.709
 wonderful though so in the forehead you his 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.780
 You will be very very long to pick at 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.880
 Again, this is good for us. 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.650
 Sorry but they are not found themselves 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.120
 launchers i.e. they look 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.459
 only forward and can intervene 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.380
 obstacles that is if you got up 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.400
 blocked let's say the right side 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.500
 launchers 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.239
 the rocket from there will break about the obstacles 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.489
 you need to take this into account to get up so that 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.070
 they went out strictly on target and there wasn’t 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.230
 nothing in their way with this sap tour we 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.600
 can pretty well fire a rocket in 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.120
 same hull roof and there armor in 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.519
 Basically, of course, we don’t have tanks there. 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.260
 We will do more damage as well but 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.750
 of course our choice for the most part 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.030
 these are tapes here i use mostly 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.489
 they are not, of course, the Tatars, too, but 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.980
 they are quite specific and not always 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.500
 sometimes I need to try to play only 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.049
 tours and depends on the situation sometimes 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.209
 come out of the fight with a good damage and 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.799
 sometimes you put literally two or three 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.260
 penetration and all proper 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.120
 average damage on this machine is approximately 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.890
 combat can be applied in normal 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.019
 coincidence somewhere order 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.910
 probably three or four thousand is to 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.610
 Sorry not a striker who will 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.350
 fill in every battle of 7 thousand but damage 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.790
 also pretty impressive considering that 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.709
 it 's still not a bt 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.350
 but I would like to talk about protection 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.049
 note that don't burst ok not normally 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.269
 make their way through with 3 damage and 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.739
 half this is our tower that is 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.930
 our launchers where we have 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.000
 located the instrument that we have instead 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.200
 armor towers there are not very many but 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.060
 I would like to note that with 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.359
 automatic guns it is not 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.970
 probably the only place is taken 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.840
 enemy sub-caliber shells comes in 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.880
 cumulative 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.459
 it's in the forehead of the body where we have 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.380
 is slit mehvoda is uppermost 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.959
 part so let's say the grounds here this 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.970
 towers just below it and of course in the stern 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.340
 can still find shells as well 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.370
 dynamic protection + our own 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.620
 the armor is very decisive we are not punched not 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.570
 sevens are not eight only 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.420
 happy coincidence if 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.340
 knows where to push us 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.770
 even do partial damage getting into 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.860
 tower and sometimes damage does not pass sometimes 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.560
 just breaks down the guns so I wanted 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.260
 to say that the car suffers a blow and 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.690
 she knows them very well not tolerate him 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.550
 worse than the same leopard two again at the same time 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.400
 she's not only in frontal projection well 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.950
 protected but the boards live very well 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.900
 Many shells , but yes of course when 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.210
 dynamic protection will be torn off 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.040
 punch us a little easier but I tell you 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.440
 I will say this is probably one of the most 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.540
 armored vehicles in the game and and armor 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.420
 you can really envy but 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.550
 regarding speed, it's pretty quick 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.100
 car and even with the stock engine she 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.080
 goes pretty fast but in the top she 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.240
 starts to just tear and throw of course 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.370
 unfortunately in the top I haven't rolled out yet 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.190
 stock engine but there acceleration 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.340
 about three and a half seconds to my 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.860
 thirty kilometers per hour here is 575 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.830
 as far as I know it is almost in 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.690
 two times there will be acceleration and dynamics and 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.960
 the maneuverability of this car is of course on 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.600
 very good level is sky bm yes by 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.040
 completely i.e. there is no speed to 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.650
 on some bmp 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.690
 but there is a great armor and 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.360
 while the speed is much higher than those 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.090
 bt feels like a car in a random 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.860
 well, very comfortable and perhaps this is one of 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.730
 those units that must try 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.890
 each 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.050
 very interesting combination and at the same time 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.300
 it is far from losing it is the opposite 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.910
 very, very well distributed by the way 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.650
 one-time damage from our guns 30 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.380
 millimeter sabot projectile 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.570
 It is also quite good and one cassette in 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.180
 we remind cassette 40 shells we 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.940
 we can put very, very well 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.830
 closer to two thousand already damage even if 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.260
 no more in my opinion there goes 2 with 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.120
 half but of course here it is necessary to punch 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.070
 all shells and I will tell you 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.080
 pretty serious numbers because 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.030
 in fact from one cassette we are quite 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.430
 We're killing wheeled tank destroyers 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:21.060
 such as lav 300 which is not with us 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.490
 but the accent of the Urales is 600 but 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.100
 so on in the general car just 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.050
 Ultimate if I fight in the forehead I 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.240
 more complicated then the rest 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.520
 opponents for her mostly meat 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.190
 I hope I told you about it in detail and 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.410
 you must have liked her 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.850
 swing try still see you 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.850
 Oink was ready bye bye
