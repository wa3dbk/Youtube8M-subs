00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.379
Welcome to Adam Equipment’s video training series.

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.519
This video will provide an overview of Adam’s Moisture Analyzers,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.120
the PMB series.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.660
Let’s take a look at them now.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.840
Two Adam moisture analyzers offer the same features and operation for simple

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.560
and fast moisture determination

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.660
The PMB 53 delivers moisture content results to 0.01%

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.670
with a maximum capacity of 50 grams.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.220
The PMB 202 delivers moisture content results to 0.05%

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.600
with a maximum capacity of 200 grams.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.250
Bi-directional RS232 and USB ports

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.130
allow you to connect to computers and printers easily.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.320
Adam’s PMB allows you to quickly store and recall test routines and results

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.270
for many different products.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.700
Now let’s go through a simple moisture test to demonstrate how easy it can be

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.850
to get results with the PMB.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.740
The settings we are about to show you are not ideal for all products.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.950
You may have to adjust the actual settings for the type of moisture

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.310
determination that you are attempting to do.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.759
Notice that the function keys are arranged in a cursor key configuration

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.520
to provide Up, Down, Left and Right directional capability

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.899
Press the Test/Down Arrow key to show RESULT

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.810
with the current setting: Moisture, Solid,

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.180
ATRO Moisture, or ATRO Solid

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.929
Using the Display Up Arrow key and
Test Down Arrow key

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.060
you can step through the available types of test results.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.320
Moisture displays the percentage of moisture content of the original sample.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.080
Solid displays the percentage of solid remaining after moisture has been driven off.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.280
ATRO Moisture displays the percentage of moisture relative to the dried sample mass.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.320
ATRO Solid displays the percentage of solid relative to the dried sample mass.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.550
We’ll select Moisture by pressing the Enter key when Moisture is displayed.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.019
Now we need to select a method of heating.

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.899
The PMB offers three methods:

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.560
SINGLE temperature to heat your sample to a set temperature.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.300
RAMP to gradually reach your final temperature in a specified amount of time.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.319
And STEP to use up to 3 different
temperatures during the test.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.899
We’ll select SINGLE for our test by pressing Enter when SINGLE is displayed.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.550
You’ll notice the display shows a temperature.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.000
To change the temperature use the
Preset Right Arrow key

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.380
to select the digit and the Display Up Arrow and

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.880
Test Down Arrow keys to increase
and decrease the number.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.350
The temperature can be set from 50 to 160 degrees C.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.260
Next we need to enter a time interval
the analyzer will use to calculate

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.900
and update results.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.720
Enter a value from 1 to 99 seconds.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.200
We’ll set the interval at 5 seconds.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.520
To do this we use the Arrow keys as before.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.260
Next we will select a stop condition.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.200
The test can be stopped automatically after a set time,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.260
or after the sample is stable, meaning weight loss has virtually ended, or a combination of these.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.740
For our demonstration we will run
the test for 4 minutes, then stop.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.170
And now to START the test, we will select AUTO so the test begins when we close the lid.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.580
Tare a disposable sample pan.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.310
Add your sample.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.540
Close the lid to begin the test.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.240
The display shows complete test information including the elapsed time,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.320
the temperature inside the chamber,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.660
and in this example, the percentage of moisture removed from the sample

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.379
If you have an Adam printer connected you can output the test results for a printed record.
