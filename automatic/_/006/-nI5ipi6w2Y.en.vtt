00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:10.350
 and today I'm going to show you this 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.830
 powerful purple lipstick is the launch of 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:17.670
 Content grass okay this is the love berg 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.140
 mate which is a very intense purple lipstick รณ 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.449
 but as you can see he does not stay 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:29.070
 small it does not look opaque is a lipstick 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.500
 It has a bit of a brightness, yes it's me. 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.920
 I would rather you were button with a 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.930
 brush because it is a lipstick that looked like 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.230
 I was going to give a little work I could 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.120
 also spot then before doing this 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.969
 I already applied a little bit of 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.850
 base in my mouth to remove the color and 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.329
 I started to work around my mouth with 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.700
 lipstick with this first layer gives 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.289
 to see that he is super pigmented he is 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:01.590
 super intense the intense color but it stays 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:06.460
 the softer purple with this first 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.940
 layer is applied with a brush ok 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.390
 and with a brush it does not stain such is 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.000
 super easy to apply this is the lipstick 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.750
 a layer it gets softer the color 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.990
 is clearer and I decided to apply 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.229
 a layer with it straight from the bullet and looks 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.729
 How button becomes and becomes very 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.950
 more intense look at the color difference 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.430
 It changes a lot, it changes a lot. 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.530
 practically another button then you can 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.200
 you use these two ways 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.530
 this is the button already water with ending up with 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.190
 the two layers it goes falling with the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.950
 time we do not last very long 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.390
 button to explore a little more difficult 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.280
 so that's it folks I hope you 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.950
