00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.699
 interesting topic for many i hope 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.699
 will be interesting about shutting down 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.800
 any gaming headsets 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.820
 either external microphones to your android 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.539
 device either 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.029
 device but we will need the actual 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.910
 some headphones in which the first 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.710
 have either 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.780
 Headphone Splitter Grafon 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.550
 separately in apk ordinary fillet background 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.980
 almost say many will say why 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.559
 it is necessary to many it is not necessary well 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.080
 some still play online games and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.780
 sitting in an online voice chat would be convenient 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.769
 there was a phone there sitting to chat with 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.839
 good quality 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.610
 listen to sounds with good quality 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.710
 can and send to chat 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.800
 or if you want to write some 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.610
 interview or your dictation video 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.649
 need a good microphone buttonhole first 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.329
 what you need to pay attention to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.940
 It will not work at all to 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.190
 Sorry phones not on why on moto 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.110
 g for example does not work on the loggia 90 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.300
 earned great 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.220
 can you burn something with 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.820
 this way and you will be there that 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.869
 I can test this mukuro ask myself 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.020
 filmed will curl 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.830
 then do not write what happened 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.439
 will determine 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.540
 working for your suggestions with external 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.900
 microphone how to define it well 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.240
 for example if you want to charge 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.210
 unplug any wired headset 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.180
 usually set on the phone and run 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.759
 cameras try to dictate something if 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.950
 the sound comes through tapping on 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.350
 Headset for him on the phone determine 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.900
 up to 1000 sound if not then some 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.110
 look for a third-party program for example 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.610
 Amiran fv in my opinion she is called 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.439
 supports setting is set 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.770
 external microphone and sound is written with 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.509
 external microphone just 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.530
