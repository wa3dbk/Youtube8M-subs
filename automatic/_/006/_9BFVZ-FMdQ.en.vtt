onto<00:01:11.220> both<00:01:11.490> sides<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.180> take<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> right

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
onto both sides you take the right

strand and cross it over the entire left
strand<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.560> basically<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.939> did

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
added on to both sides and all you do is

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.039 
added on to both sides and all you do is
repeat<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.220> steps<00:01:23.640> throughout<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.540> rest<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
repeat the steps throughout the rest of

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.530 
repeat the steps throughout the rest of
the<00:01:25.380> top<00:01:25.650> part<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> head<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.150> keep

the top part of the head so just keep

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.300 
the top part of the head so just keep
continuing<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.259> steps<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.710> adding<00:01:28.950> hair<00:01:29.130> into

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
continuing the steps of adding hair into

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.370 
continuing the steps of adding hair into
both<00:01:29.490> sides<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:30.450> crossing<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.259> over

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
both sides and then crossing it over

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.170 
both sides and then crossing it over
each<00:01:31.740> other<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.100> continue<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.850> all<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> way

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
each other and continue it all the way

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.910 
each other and continue it all the way
down<00:01:33.390> until<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.810> run<00:01:33.960> out<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.140> hair<00:01:34.439> at<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
down until you run out of hair at the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.359 
down until you run out of hair at the
bottom<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.700> head<00:01:36.770> now<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.220> down

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
bottom of the head now that you get down

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.800 
bottom of the head now that you get down
to<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> bottom<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.000> end<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.329> with<00:01:39.509> two

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to the bottom you end up with two

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.569 
to the bottom you end up with two
strands<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> hair<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.979> then<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.369> just

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
strands of the hair and then you just

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.149 
strands of the hair and then you just
start<00:01:41.820> twisting<00:01:42.360> both<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> strands<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
start twisting both of the strands to

make sure they are both very tightly

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.560 
make sure they are both very tightly
twisted<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:53.220> not<00:01:53.399> too<00:01:53.670> twisted<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.450> they

start<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.350> know<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.740> curl<00:01:56.040> up<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.520> stuff

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
start to you know like curl up and stuff

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.370 
start to you know like curl up and stuff
now<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.299> part<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.600> pretty<00:01:57.659> easy<00:01:57.869> because<00:01:58.229> all

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
now this part is pretty easy because all

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.289 
now this part is pretty easy because all
you<00:01:58.469> do<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.799> cross<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.070> right<00:01:59.490> strand<00:01:59.909> over

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
you do is cross the right strand over

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.700 
you do is cross the right strand over
the<00:02:00.509> left<00:02:00.719> strand<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.350> might<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.649> to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
the left strand and you might have to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.240 
the left strand and you might have to
retwist<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.610> between<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.329> make<00:02:03.479> sure<00:02:03.659> that

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
retwist it in between to make sure that

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.400 
retwist it in between to make sure that
strands<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.850> hair<00:02:05.000> stay<00:02:05.390> tight<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:05.780> twisted

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
strands of hair stay tight and twisted

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.320 
strands of hair stay tight and twisted
and<00:02:06.590> then<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.280> can<00:02:07.400> just<00:02:07.520> bring<00:02:07.730> it<00:02:07.850> down<00:02:07.880> to

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
and then you can just bring it down to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.760 
and then you can just bring it down to
your<00:02:08.420> shoulders<00:02:08.869> or<00:02:09.050> hands<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:09.500> get<00:02:09.590> too

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770

tired<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.369> then<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:11.270> continue<00:02:11.690> this<00:02:11.810> step

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
tired and then just continue this step

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.600 
tired and then just continue this step
all<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.380> way<00:02:12.500> down<00:02:12.680> into<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.040> very<00:02:13.220> bottom

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
all the way down into the very bottom

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.830 
all the way down into the very bottom
and<00:02:13.790> when<00:02:13.880> you're<00:02:14.000> done<00:02:14.150> tie<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.600> up<00:02:14.720> and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840
