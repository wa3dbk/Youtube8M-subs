00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.579 

time<00:00:00.950> for<00:00:01.250> some<00:00:01.430> arpeggios<00:00:02.360> and<00:00:05.470> we're<00:00:06.470> going

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
time for some arpeggios and we're going

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.650 
time for some arpeggios and we're going
to<00:00:06.649> try<00:00:06.799> to<00:00:06.859> play<00:00:07.069> some<00:00:07.339> Kirk<00:00:08.120> Hammett<00:00:08.450> cell

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
to try to play some Kirk Hammett cell

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.320 
to try to play some Kirk Hammett cell
arpeggios<00:00:09.260> and<00:00:09.760> basically<00:00:10.760> the<00:00:10.940> pattern

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
arpeggios and basically the pattern

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.210 
arpeggios and basically the pattern
which<00:00:11.480> we're<00:00:11.690> going<00:00:11.810> to<00:00:11.900> use<00:00:12.050> is<00:00:12.440> going<00:00:13.040> to<00:00:13.130> be

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.220 
which we're going to use is going to be

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.929 
which we're going to use is going to be
very<00:00:13.250> reminiscent<00:00:14.210> to<00:00:14.710> this<00:00:15.710> pattern<00:00:16.219> which

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
very reminiscent to this pattern which

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.749 
very reminiscent to this pattern which
we<00:00:17.150> which<00:00:17.539> we<00:00:17.570> looked<00:00:17.869> at<00:00:18.019> last<00:00:18.050> time<00:00:18.380> I<00:00:18.759> think

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759 
we which we looked at last time I think

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:27.189 
we which we looked at last time I think
one<00:00:25.060> that<00:00:26.060> kind<00:00:26.300> of<00:00:26.329> stuff<00:00:26.509> we're<00:00:26.960> gonna<00:00:27.109> do

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
one that kind of stuff we're gonna do

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.069 
one that kind of stuff we're gonna do
that<00:00:27.409> within<00:00:27.619> our<00:00:27.829> pecho<00:00:28.279> and<00:00:28.960> and<00:00:29.960> we're

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
that within our pecho and and we're

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.599 
that within our pecho and and we're
gonna<00:00:30.169> start<00:00:30.439> on<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:30.739> fifteenth<00:00:31.130> left<00:00:31.429> on<00:00:31.519> the

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
gonna start on the fifteenth left on the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.279 
gonna start on the fifteenth left on the
E<00:00:31.640> string<00:00:32.029> so<00:00:32.599> we're<00:00:32.750> gonna<00:00:32.870> play<00:00:33.079> something

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.289 
E string so we're gonna play something

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:40.150 
E string so we're gonna play something
like<00:00:33.410> that<00:00:36.280> and<00:00:37.480> to<00:00:38.480> get<00:00:38.660> this<00:00:38.870> right<00:00:39.109> and<00:00:39.469> it's

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
like that and to get this right and it's

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.420 
like that and to get this right and it's
essential<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:40.699> you<00:00:42.129> that<00:00:43.129> you're<00:00:43.280> very

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
essential that you that you're very

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.430 
essential that you that you're very
careful<00:00:43.910> with<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.239> index<00:00:44.600> finger<00:00:44.750> to<00:00:45.230> get

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
careful with the index finger to get

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.229 
careful with the index finger to get
this<00:00:45.620> right<00:00:45.859> it's<00:00:46.399> essential<00:00:46.969> that<00:00:47.000> you

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
this right it's essential that you

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.270 
this right it's essential that you
flatten<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.079> image<00:00:48.410> finger<00:00:49.719> but<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:52.010> also

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
flatten the image finger but you also

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.009 
flatten the image finger but you also
have<00:00:52.519> to<00:00:52.579> be<00:00:52.730> careful<00:00:53.149> if<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:53.390> don't<00:00:53.570> get<00:00:53.780> two

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
have to be careful if you don't get two

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.910 
have to be careful if you don't get two
notes<00:00:54.320> ringing<00:00:54.679> at<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:54.920> same<00:00:55.010> time<00:00:56.769> that<00:00:57.769> can

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
notes ringing at the same time that can

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.380 
notes ringing at the same time that can
be<00:00:57.949> a<00:00:58.100> cool<00:00:58.339> effect<00:00:58.460> but<00:00:58.820> we<00:00:58.999> should<00:00:59.149> try<00:00:59.329> to

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
be a cool effect but we should try to

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.979 
be a cool effect but we should try to
avoid<00:00:59.510> it<00:00:59.719> here<00:01:00.019> so<00:01:00.559> in<00:01:00.980> order<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:01.370> achieve<00:01:01.989> or

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
avoid it here so in order to achieve or

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.380 
avoid it here so in order to achieve or
to<00:01:03.109> do<00:01:03.379> not<00:01:03.559> get<00:01:03.920> two<00:01:04.129> notes<00:01:04.460> ring<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.119> string

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
to do not get two notes ring a string

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.510 
to do not get two notes ring a string
time<00:01:05.630> same<00:01:06.350> time<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:06.650> have<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.860> angle<00:01:07.159> your

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
time same time you have to angle your

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
time same time you have to angle your
index<00:01:07.909> finger<00:01:08.270> so

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.609 

I'm<00:01:16.540> exaggerating<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.530> movement<00:01:17.920> now<00:01:19.619> well

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
I'm exaggerating the movement now well

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.470 
I'm exaggerating the movement now well
don't<00:01:20.830> just<00:01:20.920> like<00:01:21.189> this

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.230 

you<00:01:24.020> can<00:01:24.170> hear<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.500> noise<00:01:24.790> if<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:25.850> haven't

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
you can hear the noise if you haven't

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.630 
you can hear the noise if you haven't
figured<00:01:26.420> out<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.750> pattern<00:01:27.080> yet<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:27.830> goes<00:01:28.550> like

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
figured out the pattern yet it goes like

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.450 
figured out the pattern yet it goes like
this<00:01:31.840> that's<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:33.110> it's<00:01:33.830> a<00:01:33.890> sixteenth<00:01:34.340> of

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
this that's it it's a sixteenth of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.160 
this that's it it's a sixteenth of
pattern<00:01:34.880> we<00:01:35.360> get<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.970> we're<00:01:41.720> going<00:01:41.900> to<00:01:41.930> mix

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
pattern we get to and we're going to mix

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:57.390 
pattern we get to and we're going to mix
that<00:01:42.350> one<00:01:42.680> with<00:01:42.920> this<00:01:43.400> kind<00:01:43.670> of<00:01:43.700> pattern<00:01:46.180> so

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.910 

play<00:01:58.400> them<00:01:58.610> together<00:01:58.910> again

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.480 

now<00:02:05.920> we're<00:02:06.280> gonna<00:02:07.200> move<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.500> pattern<00:02:09.009> up<00:02:09.190> in

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
now we're gonna move this pattern up in

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.210 
now we're gonna move this pattern up in
the<00:02:09.700> E<00:02:09.729> minor<00:02:10.060> scale<00:02:10.540> and<00:02:10.810> by<00:02:11.020> doing<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.440> we

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
the E minor scale and by doing that we

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.800 
the E minor scale and by doing that we
get<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.900> different<00:02:13.900> arpeggios<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:15.690> with<00:02:16.690> this

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
get a different arpeggios and with this

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.090 
get a different arpeggios and with this
approach<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.440> really<00:02:17.710> don't<00:02:17.890> have<00:02:18.040> to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
approach you really don't have to

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.280 
approach you really don't have to
understand<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:19.180> name<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.660> every<00:02:19.960> hour<00:02:19.990> page

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
understand the name of every hour page

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.900 
understand the name of every hour page
you<00:02:20.770> don't<00:02:20.950> even<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.310> understand<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
you don't even have to understand the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.000 
you don't even have to understand the
function<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.540> your<00:02:22.720> pages<00:02:22.960> because<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:26.800> can

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
function of your pages because you can

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.350 
function of your pages because you can
do<00:02:27.160> this<00:02:27.370> kind<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.640> approach<00:02:30.210> move<00:02:31.210> your

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
do this kind of approach move your

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.290 
do this kind of approach move your
picture<00:02:31.780> hedges<00:02:32.710> around<00:02:32.830> like<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.370> if<00:02:34.090> you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
picture hedges around like that if you

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.190 
picture hedges around like that if you
know<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.810> key<00:02:35.050> if<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.709> know<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:37.540> backing

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
know the key if you know the backing

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.770 
know the key if you know the backing
goes<00:02:38.500> an<00:02:38.650> E<00:02:38.800> minor<00:02:39.010> for<00:02:39.370> instance<00:02:39.670> then<00:02:40.630> you

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
goes an E minor for instance then you

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.080 
goes an E minor for instance then you
can<00:02:40.959> just<00:02:41.140> use<00:02:41.440> your<00:02:42.130> pages<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.760> are<00:02:42.790> found

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
can just use your pages that are found

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.670 
can just use your pages that are found
in<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.540> E<00:02:43.570> minor<00:02:43.990> scale<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:46.030> will<00:02:46.270> sound

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
in the E minor scale and it will sound

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.480 
in the E minor scale and it will sound
sound<00:02:47.680> good<00:02:48.240> so<00:02:49.240> what<00:02:49.360> we're<00:02:49.480> doing<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.870> ah<00:02:50.490> at

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
sound good so what we're doing is ah at

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.080 
sound good so what we're doing is ah at
the<00:02:51.940> second<00:02:52.440> arpeggio<00:02:53.440> it's<00:02:54.130> fine<00:02:54.370> found<00:02:54.850> here

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
the second arpeggio it's fine found here

the second arpeggio it's fine found here
on<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.890> 17<00:02:56.890> threats<00:02:57.160> on<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.610> 14<00:02:58.000> threaten<00:02:58.420> on

on the 17 threats on the 14 threaten on
15th<00:02:58.930> fret<00:02:59.140> it's<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.560> d<00:02:59.950> major<00:03:00.250> triad<00:03:00.820> or<00:03:00.940> petrol

and and hopefully you will realize how
I'm<00:03:05.800> thinking<00:03:06.459> if<00:03:07.300> you<00:03:07.540> look<00:03:07.780> at<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.019> provided

I'm thinking if you look at the provided
scale<00:03:09.250> chart<00:03:09.640> scale<00:03:10.630> shows<00:03:10.840> where<00:03:11.320> I've

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
outlined the arpeggios so you can see

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.229

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
this 17 threats we're just doing the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
same pattern as the other one was so you

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.729 
same pattern as the other one was so you
can<00:03:30.400> see<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.640> similarities<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.989> then<00:03:32.590> we're

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
can see the similarities and then we're

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.840 
can see the similarities and then we're
going<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:32.980> move<00:03:33.040> each<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:33.940> every<00:03:34.330> notes<00:03:34.570> oh

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
going to move each and every notes oh

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.830 
going to move each and every notes oh
one<00:03:37.350> step<00:03:38.350> in<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:39.190> in<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.549> scale<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:40.570> we<00:03:40.690> get

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
one step in the in the scale so we get

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.449 
one step in the in the scale so we get
an<00:03:41.019> E<00:03:41.140> minor<00:03:41.380> tried<00:03:41.799> our<00:03:41.950> page<00:03:42.130> other<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.920> then

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
an E minor tried our page other and then

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.770 
an E minor tried our page other and then
we<00:03:45.760> do<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.090> same<00:03:46.299> thing<00:03:46.570> we<00:03:47.410> get<00:03:48.040> up<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.970> 20

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
we do the same thing we get up to the 20

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.860 
we do the same thing we get up to the 20
fret<00:03:50.080> here<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.560> we<00:03:51.190> get<00:03:51.400> F<00:03:52.030> sharp<00:03:52.420> diminished

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
fret here and we get F sharp diminished

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:02.780 
fret here and we get F sharp diminished
arpeggio<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:55.000> whole<00:03:55.120> thing

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.650 

and<00:04:03.790> if<00:04:04.600> we<00:04:04.750> have<00:04:05.040> this<00:04:06.040> little<00:04:06.660> variation

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
and if we have this little variation

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:17.430 
and if we have this little variation
pattern<00:04:15.600> hello<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:16.900> i<00:04:16.959> hope<00:04:17.079> you<00:04:17.260> recognize

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
pattern hello and i hope you recognize

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.080 
pattern hello and i hope you recognize
the<00:04:17.950> last<00:04:18.130> pattern<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:21.070> in<00:04:21.790> order<00:04:21.910> to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
the last pattern it and so in order to

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.780 
the last pattern it and so in order to
get<00:04:22.570> this<00:04:22.750> approach<00:04:23.139> down<00:04:23.470> i<00:04:23.800> really<00:04:24.610> suggest

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
get this approach down i really suggest

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.670 
get this approach down i really suggest
if<00:04:25.180> you<00:04:25.300> don't<00:04:25.480> know<00:04:25.630> that<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:25.900> minor<00:04:26.200> scale<00:04:26.530> let

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
if you don't know that a minor scale let

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.550 
if you don't know that a minor scale let
you<00:04:26.770> start<00:04:27.040> learning<00:04:27.280> a<00:04:28.530> few<00:04:30.120> of<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.480> boxes<00:04:32.350> in

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
you start learning a few of the boxes in

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.210 
you start learning a few of the boxes in
the<00:04:32.830> E<00:04:32.860> minor<00:04:33.160> scale<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:35.290> can<00:04:35.470> use<00:04:36.010> the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
the E minor scale and you can use the

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.520 
the E minor scale and you can use the
provided<00:04:36.400> scale<00:04:37.270> chart<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:37.780> also<00:04:38.290> try<00:04:38.470> to

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
provided scale chart and also try to

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.470 
provided scale chart and also try to
understand<00:04:39.010> how<00:04:39.220> we<00:04:39.280> horizontally<00:04:40.240> move

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
understand how we horizontally move

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.920 
understand how we horizontally move
around<00:04:41.280> this<00:04:42.280> pattern<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:43.210> achieve

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
around this pattern and achieve

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.140 
around this pattern and achieve
different<00:04:44.169> arpeggios<00:04:44.950> by<00:04:45.160> doing<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:45.669> and<00:04:45.850> once

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
different arpeggios by doing so and once

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.840 
different arpeggios by doing so and once
again<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:47.050> arpeggios<00:04:47.590> have<00:04:47.890> different<00:04:48.310> names

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
again the arpeggios have different names

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.170 
again the arpeggios have different names
but<00:04:49.270> they<00:04:49.870> fit<00:04:50.290> in<00:04:50.560> an<00:04:51.040> e-minor<00:04:51.669> kind<00:04:52.090> of

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
but they fit in an e-minor kind of

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.900 
but they fit in an e-minor kind of
situation<00:04:52.750> if<00:04:53.169> you've<00:04:53.740> taken<00:04:54.040> them<00:04:54.460> from<00:04:54.729> the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
situation if you've taken them from the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.700 
situation if you've taken them from the
E<00:04:54.940> minor<00:04:55.389> scale<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:55.990> that's<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.260> pretty<00:04:56.410> simple

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
E minor scale so that's a pretty simple

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.830 
E minor scale so that's a pretty simple
