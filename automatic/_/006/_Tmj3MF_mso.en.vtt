hello<00:00:01.170> world<00:00:01.500> here's<00:00:01.860> another<00:00:02.070> video<00:00:02.280> I

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:03.740 
hello world here's another video I

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.829 
hello world here's another video I
resurrected<00:00:04.740> my<00:00:04.890> 300<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:05.850> put<00:00:06.180> two<00:00:06.330> motors<00:00:06.660> on

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
resurrected my 300 I put two motors on

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.350 
resurrected my 300 I put two motors on
it<00:00:06.990> 40<00:00:07.620> volts<00:00:07.919> with<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.130> batteries<00:00:08.519> this

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
it 40 volts with the batteries this

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.720 
it 40 volts with the batteries this
thing's<00:00:09.570> on<00:00:09.719> crack<00:00:09.960> yeah<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:11.099> goes<00:00:11.250> like<00:00:11.429> 40

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
thing's on crack yeah it goes like 40

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.730 
thing's on crack yeah it goes like 40
miles<00:00:11.880> an<00:00:12.030> hour<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:13.139> going<00:00:13.320> down<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.590> hill

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
miles an hour it's going down the hill

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.120 
miles an hour it's going down the hill
and<00:00:14.330> yeah<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.480> steering<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.590> really<00:00:16.650> wobbly

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
and yeah the steering is really wobbly

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.090 
and yeah the steering is really wobbly
and<00:00:18.080> obviously<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.260> thing<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.590> not<00:00:19.770> designed

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
and obviously this thing is not designed

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.769 
and obviously this thing is not designed
to<00:00:20.220> go<00:00:20.340> 40<00:00:20.670> miles<00:00:20.820> an<00:00:21.000> hour<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.390> who<00:00:21.570> cares

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
to go 40 miles an hour but who cares

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.359 
to go 40 miles an hour but who cares
it's<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> entire<00:00:22.320> point<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.650> doing<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.980> so

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
it's the entire point of doing this so

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.019 
it's the entire point of doing this so
ha<00:00:23.880> take<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:25.760> made<00:00:26.760> my<00:00:26.880> own<00:00:26.910> little

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
ha take that I made my own little

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.859 
ha take that I made my own little
charging<00:00:27.570> system<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.380> some<00:00:29.510> 3m<00:00:30.510> crimp

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
charging system I got some 3m crimp

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.160 
charging system I got some 3m crimp
connectors<00:00:31.320> actually<00:00:32.189> worked<00:00:32.369> pretty<00:00:32.579> well

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
connectors actually worked pretty well

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.170 
connectors actually worked pretty well
those<00:00:34.170> are<00:00:34.380> gone<00:00:34.530> anyway<00:00:34.860> looks<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.610> clean<00:00:35.850> too

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
those are gone anyway looks so clean too

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.520 
those are gone anyway looks so clean too
said<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.890> an<00:00:38.040> automotive<00:00:38.610> ten<00:00:38.940> gauge<00:00:39.120> wire

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
said it's an automotive ten gauge wire

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.290 
said it's an automotive ten gauge wire
some<00:00:40.530> ghetto<00:00:41.280> tape<00:00:41.879> job<00:00:42.149> over<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.460> I<00:00:44.460> got

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
some ghetto tape job over here and I got

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.970 
some ghetto tape job over here and I got
some<00:00:45.360> 12th<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.989> power<00:00:46.170> connectors<00:00:46.680> from

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
some 12th and power connectors from

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.940 
some 12th and power connectors from
RadioShack<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.840> only<00:00:49.020> thing<00:00:49.200> about<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.590> is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
RadioShack the only thing about this is

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.900 
RadioShack the only thing about this is
a<00:00:49.980> design<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.120> 14<00:00:51.510> gauge<00:00:51.780> wire<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.699> I'm<00:00:53.699> using

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
a design for 14 gauge wire and I'm using

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.479 
a design for 14 gauge wire and I'm using
10<00:00:54.239> gauge<00:00:54.480> wire<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.930> them<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.289> get<00:00:55.949> those<00:00:56.129> wires

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
10 gauge wire on them so get those wires

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.020 
10 gauge wire on them so get those wires
in<00:00:56.730> there<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.059> pretty<00:00:57.239> nasty<00:00:57.390> job<00:00:57.920> but<00:00:59.030> all

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
in there it's pretty nasty job but all

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.900 
in there it's pretty nasty job but all
these<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.840> does<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.370> this<00:01:02.370> plug<00:01:02.670> hooks

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
these what this does is this plug hooks

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.509 
these what this does is this plug hooks
them<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.270> series<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:05.010> feeds<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
them all in series and it feeds it to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.760 
them all in series and it feeds it to
the<00:01:05.640> controller<00:01:06.030> which<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.049> rated<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.439> 48

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the controller which is rated for 48

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.420 
the controller which is rated for 48
volts<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.750> 12<00:01:09.990> volt<00:01:10.140> batteries<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:11.310> up

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
volts so for 12 volt batteries to up

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.039 
volts so for 12 volt batteries to up
here<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.450> down<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:14.180> what<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.330> does<00:01:15.570> it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
here to down there and what this does it

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.630 
here to down there and what this does it
hooks<00:01:16.259> them<00:01:16.470> all<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.830> parallel<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
hooks them all in parallel all the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.149 
hooks them all in parallel all the
batteries<00:01:17.909> each<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.840> these<00:01:18.930> wires<00:01:19.159> represents

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
batteries each of these wires represents

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.749 
batteries each of these wires represents
a<00:01:20.220> different<00:01:20.369> battery<00:01:20.790> go<00:01:21.780> back<00:01:22.110> back<00:01:22.490> yeah

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
a different battery go back back yeah

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.600 
a different battery go back back yeah
each<00:01:24.150> individual<00:01:24.869> row<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> battery<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.400> all

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
each individual row is a battery so all

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.760 
each individual row is a battery so all
these<00:01:27.080> hooked<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.380> parallel<00:01:28.640> go<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.970> way

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
these hooked up in parallel go this way

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.660 
these hooked up in parallel go this way
H<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.720> my<00:01:33.720> computer<00:01:34.079> car<00:01:34.259> charger<00:01:34.619> II<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.280> it's

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
H to my computer car charger II and it's

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.999 
H to my computer car charger II and it's
charging<00:01:35.939> right<00:01:36.119> now<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.659> that's<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.860> that

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
charging right now so that's so that

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.210 
charging right now so that's so that
works<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.610> even<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> little<00:01:39.740> connected<00:01:40.740> put

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
works I even have a little connected put

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.310 
works I even have a little connected put
the<00:01:41.369> original<00:01:41.729> alligator<00:01:42.329> clips<00:01:42.570> back<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.990> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the original alligator clips back on so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.830 
the original alligator clips back on so
oh<00:01:44.299> yeah<00:01:45.299> all<00:01:45.630> set<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:47.780> right<00:01:48.780> down<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.320> I

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
oh yeah all set so right down here I

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.660 
oh yeah all set so right down here I
grinded<00:01:51.840> down<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.560> deck<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.250> could<00:01:53.399> fit<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
grinded down the deck so I could fit the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.690 
grinded down the deck so I could fit the
other<00:01:53.790> motor<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.240> there

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.550 

there's<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.790> 15<00:01:58.270> inch<00:01:58.479> chain<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:59.020> there<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.530> I

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
there's a 15 inch chain in there that I

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.010 
there's a 15 inch chain in there that I
had<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.920> I<00:02:00.159> had<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.939> take<00:02:01.149> a<00:02:01.180> link<00:02:01.509> out<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.930> then

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
had to I had to take a link out and then

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.279 
had to I had to take a link out and then
I<00:02:02.049> had<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.259> put<00:02:02.409> it<00:02:02.500> back<00:02:02.619> in<00:02:02.890> so<00:02:03.579> bozer<00:02:03.820> on<00:02:04.060> that

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
I had to put it back in so bozer on that

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.800 
I had to put it back in so bozer on that
that<00:02:05.289> mounting<00:02:06.070> bracket<00:02:06.430> right<00:02:06.549> there<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.780> I

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
that mounting bracket right there so I

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.969 
that mounting bracket right there so I
want<00:02:08.019> to<00:02:08.050> cut<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:08.349> out<00:02:08.410> you<00:02:08.709> know<00:02:08.800> that's

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
want to cut that out you know that's

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.800 
want to cut that out you know that's
it's<00:02:09.880> meant<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.149> hold<00:02:10.269> those<00:02:10.420> motors<00:02:10.780> in<00:02:11.099> so

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
it's meant to hold those motors in so

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.500
