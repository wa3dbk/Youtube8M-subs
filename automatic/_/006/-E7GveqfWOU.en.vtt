00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.170
 we are going then to enter the part 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.840
 technique what we are most interested in 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.000
 is what interests you the most in the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.770
 part of the subject of the examination that 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.500
 contains the exam 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.080
 we have been mentioning that it is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.540
 important that before seeing this 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.910
 product or while reading this 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.560
 product go to the official site of the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.410
 ceneval and download from there the guide 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.350
 officer that gives you the ceneval this guide 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.990
 you are going to see the following topics that are 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.470
 five modules and we will explain little to 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.910
 little what the modules contain and what 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.600
 are the things that you would have 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.540
 study are obviously five modules 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.730
 the modules have certain biases and 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.340
 unfortunately the ceneval guide does not 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.860
 tells us in particular what topics we have 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.200
 to study because for sure 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.350
 see how the examination of the 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.720
 ceneval is teachers join in a 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.970
 area and they are asked to 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.700
 ask questions then there is no 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.310
 agenda as such but there are things a 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.410
 little bit at random what we have 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.720
 fact is that in each module and in this 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.330
 same module that we're going to comment on 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.960
 the subject of the exam, what we ask is 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.820
 that locate certain concepts that if 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.250
 they come in the exam and if they are going to 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.630
 ask and open other concepts that do not 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.060
 ask you however just locate yourself in 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.300
 the most important concepts of each 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.479
 area we recommend that for each 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.850
 module you investigate between 50 100 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.860
 concepts of the most important of 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.080
 according to what comes in the guide and from 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.540
 according to the books and what we 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.110
 we want to comment you then in the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.790
 five modules let's talk about module 1 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.990
 development of the business plan if you 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.360
 account this module according to the ceneval 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.110
 occupies between 27 and 28 percent of the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.090
 exam this means that it is 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.850
 absolutely important but when 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.930
 we analyze within that module 1 of 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.269
 development of plans 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.689
 of business we see that the plan of 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.969
 Marketing is 22 percent going to 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.340
 see that the exercises you have in your 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:27.230
 exam and the exercises that we are going to 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.049
 comment are a constant exercises of 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.180
 positioning top of mind market share 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.700
 chose the international market those 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.680
 marketing exercises will occupy 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.620
 much of the exam this first point 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.109
 it is absolutely important according to the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.810
 design of the ceneval there are years in which 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.930
 the percentage varies a little but 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.900
 around between 25 to 30 percent 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.030
 the exam will be in this module 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.870
 then it is a very important module 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.180
 second module commercial negotiation 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.669
 international in this module comes great 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.409
 part of the incoterms could I 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:12.000
 I would venture to say that the incoterms 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:14.939
 are going to be a 78 9% of your exam that is 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.699
 important that you know very well incoterms 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.200
 and contracts that you know absolutely 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.540
 well also 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.099
 is some negotiation book and that 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.290
 be very clear about the points 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.519
 fundamental as the objectives of the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.560
 negotiation negotiation types 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:35.610
 trading strategies in terms 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.550
 general you have to know 19% 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.550
 third module trade application 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.010
 international in the business world 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.620
 I would like you to focus on this 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.360
 occasion in this that says scope 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.280
 business that this module 3 is a lot 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.450
 management planning organization 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.480
 control direction effectively but the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.690
 another side is the other point that says 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.980
 detection of why it is in the company 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.980
 through the permanent analysis of 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.660
 national and international environment here 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.810
 talks a lot about something we do not understand 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.729
 well the experts because it was made from that 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.180
 way in the ceneval I would tell you by 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.370
 example the concept of competitiveness is 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.590
 talks a lot about norms of normativity 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.020
 international and national 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.449
 there we should focus on the 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.940
 regulatory institutions of commerce 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.130
 international focus on studying the 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.729
 official Mexican standard in studying 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.310
 ISO 9000 international standards and so on 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.650
 then this application of the trade 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.530
 international is very difficult to understand 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.889
 in fact the teachers that I know 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.220
 who have taught this workshop course for 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.680
 the ceneval has cost them a lot of work 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.000
 we have tried to decipher it 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.169
 unfortunately the approach is 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.080
 that way of trade logistics 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.360
 international that is only 12% 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.940
 here we are very clear when 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.220
 let's get to the logistics module 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.280
 you will understand why we are very clear that 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.919
 the logistics part logistics documents 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.310
 it is very important to study cubicaje 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.870
 some container exercises 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.320
 basically fundamental issues 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.960
 types of dangerous cargo loads there is 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.360
 very clear what is coming and finally the 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.540
 Customs management that is 20 percent 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.120
 in this in this fifth module our 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.970
 Customs management area ask us 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.880
 including item numbers you have 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.290
 to know what is the agent's article 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.480
 customs what is the article of the 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.000
 proxy donald say you have to 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.770
 learn about ten articles because 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.050
 surely they are going to ask you in the 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.030
 exam you also have to know the 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.040
 fundamental concepts you're going to have to 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.050
 study the customs law but that's what 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.290
 we will discuss and more particularly 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.940
 when we get to that module and in 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.840
 as regards the programs of promotion 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.850
 foreign trade 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.860
 you have to be very clear about what they are 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.260
 those programs that already happened that already 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.290
 there are no more and those programs that 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:18.380
 still subsist in particular you 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:21.110
 I recommend that you review the immex decree 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.540
 and that you see the fundamental points of 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.010
 immex decree that way you'll be very 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.050
 well prepared 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.230
 these are the fundamental modules of 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.810
 exam let's enter each one of them not 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:36.980
 without commenting you that logistics is 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.690
 the smallest area of this examination is the 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.940
 easier to study because it is very 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:44.630
 clear what we have to do but it is 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:47.600
 the one that has the least reactive contains in the 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:50.330
 exam and also very important 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.160
 tell you that the area that asks the most questions 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.190
 has is the marketing area 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.040
 international from there we could go 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.530
 saying each one of them but I would like 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.460
 I enter each of the modules in 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.460
 general terms
