00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.580
 hello I'm liberal someone from the banks 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.820
 mariela reigned 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.840
 Now the question is how to build innovation within 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.079
 although the law better 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.799
 Moratinos stressed 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.789
 I think that fine in the room of eta 1las thinks it as a concept 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:18.949
 abstract 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.849
 the winds 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.380
 in the last year they were the best team in the world 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.759
 the Murcian does not in a certain moment of glory popularity so we 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:29.659
 has been 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.659
 a lot of defends that is like 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.340
 we want to do 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.200
 we go 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.520
 besides the diesel 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.080
 an opinion for 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.280
 think of a certain idea 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.300
 and society 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.690
 Ortega one does not manage to give inside him 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.690
 the possibility of innovating that problem 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.250
 you have to build it the the possible not so the cup 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.570
 this thinker really 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.420
 what one does from shock and clients like attracted so much my 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.970
 company 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.100
 generated new 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.350
 josico morfÃ­n a little tino service and processes 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.480
 and all that accompanied 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.210
 an organizational restructuring that in turn all the agents in the act 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.180
 in contributing ideas the particular 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.470
 thanks to the possible end of leaving him manassero 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.620
 of people 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.370
 and one last more capable of the organization 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.430
 I can not go from anyone 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.630
 global that unites us 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.650
 for that situation I would have had enough of launching challenges 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.200
 Figs have enrolled to illuminate with an idea 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.490
 - good 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.490
 but it's also important for a hundred 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.580
 the new business model to monetize is innovation 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.290
 here too 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.740
 creating a space 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.030
 a social dynamic within the remises and allows us to innovate 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.510
 for example 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.320
 brainstorming sessions 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.810
 the process for thorning country 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.650
 there to get ideas 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.380
 the type of recio bar 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.039
 bring pieces in the marker 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.959
 unne of a business that has wish to the market be 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.449
 do not do it like that 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.769
 take 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.309
 ep the blank check to be 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:20.209
 jassim research for a long time means putting certain 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.599
 limits and throwing ideas and I kept on even though it's good to approve them in the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.449
 marker 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:26.879
 percy seconds 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.250
 consumers and eventually is to continue refining those is the model 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.149
 that today is imposed 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:37.269
 otherwise this one is not seeing and you take dayz treat us others 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.879
 the linear meter but also give more 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.759
 for example the a-40 lie in 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.609
 the open source is a cradle a sample of that 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.700
 nowadays companies have to have the subject d 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.209
 evidently allow them to say 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.359
 develop 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.329
 what still made their secret sauce that it is necessary that makes them difference them 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.119
 turn on your customers 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:03.089
 and in the rest fish infrastructure let's say basic necessary to 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.489
 for the business that closed usable 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.159
 there is a lot 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.440
 today with its infrastructure that one may be using is important 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.249
 so 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:17.339
 I think it's important to maintain the type and nature the link is with 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:20.489
 universities with the community 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.169
 other works 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.569
 and be able to arm some even with other companies to be able to bring those daughters and 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.339
 that's why they have marked us 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:31.999
 I also think it's fundamental 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:36.540
 to create a work environment in which people can innovate in that place 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:39.649
 From space 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:40.659
 the asf 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:41.989
 the processes 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.399
 They are fundamental 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:47.969
 ulecia the digestive syndic diptych that will be issued to start in homes is a 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.969
 clear indication that we are not creating an environment 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.700
 ideal to be able to propose ideas the good thing is that to give giving shape to that space 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.769
 so that really 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.229
 So be it 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.839
 and what good percent I think that is what is necessary for 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:07.069
 to attract innovation you have to be continually thinking that you do not 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.989
 how to make things look 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.959
 not having one as a replacement is looking for how it is
