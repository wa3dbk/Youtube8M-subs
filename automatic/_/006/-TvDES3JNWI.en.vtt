00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
so I'm supposed to look like I'm just

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.680 
so I'm supposed to look like I'm just
moving<00:00:59.720> in<00:00:59.990> very<00:01:00.020> easily<00:01:00.320> flip<00:01:01.220> of<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.400> wrist

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
moving in very easily flip of the wrist

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.870 
moving in very easily flip of the wrist
but<00:01:02.690> it's<00:01:03.530> not<00:01:03.740> exactly<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:04.339> easy<00:01:04.580> or

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
but it's not exactly that easy or

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.090 
but it's not exactly that easy or
somebody's<00:01:05.210> almost<00:01:05.540> as<00:01:05.630> big<00:01:05.810> as<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:06.740> we

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
somebody's almost as big as you so we

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.650 
somebody's almost as big as you so we
have<00:01:07.220> to<00:01:07.340> find<00:01:07.610> ways<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:08.210> kind<00:01:08.360> of<00:01:08.479> like

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
have to find ways to kind of like

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.840 
have to find ways to kind of like
counter<00:01:09.110> balance<00:01:09.440> each<00:01:09.560> other<00:01:09.740> in<00:01:10.490> order<00:01:10.670> to

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
counter balance each other in order to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.460 
counter balance each other in order to
make<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:11.119> look<00:01:11.240> like<00:01:11.300> it's<00:01:11.840> not<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:12.110> hard<00:01:12.290> for

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
make it look like it's not that hard for

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
challenging also but not because the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.719 
challenging also but not because the
steps<00:01:19.880> are<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:20.240> hard<00:01:20.660> it's<00:01:21.380> because<00:01:21.650> it<00:01:22.280> needs

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
steps are so hard it's because it needs

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.160 
steps are so hard it's because it needs
