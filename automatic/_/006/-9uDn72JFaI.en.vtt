00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 with you prague and today we have it 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.910
 interesting update about clash of 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.950
 clans 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:15.750
 but what I found out was added 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.380
 new warriors dark barracks he 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.430
 called hell hound don't know but he 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.189
 he looks like somehow because of his 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:33.239
 health is so much he sort of goes 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.730
 air defense i.e. can 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.370
 attack and airborne ground damage like a 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:44.210
 him small not very big also not 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.059
 only added it added a couple more 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.579
 Troops now show you added not 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.590
 the troops, that is, you can improve now 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.250
 barbarian on the seventh level and student 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.219
 also tower archers improve by 13 and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.620
 dark barracks on 6 well depending on 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:08.100
 addition if you want to use this 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:10.430
 warrior hell hound so further appeared 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.430
 such 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.420
 You may have noticed what appeared below 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:08.960
 such a panel and the troops are precisely enemy 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.940
 for example, this is how I showed you 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.980
 such a function is shorter added 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.730
 developers can see 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.230
 searches that attack enemies and all 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:26.890
 the rest in general, then we go on like this 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:32.120
 that there we are a barbarian and archer level 7 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:37.450
 I also wanted to say that to the sixth 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:41.870
 level I do not know whether I will raise 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:47.570
 barbarians and archers are expensive 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.760
 there are about 77 million five hundred thousand 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.050
 Something like this 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.120
 Elixir as I remember is and 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.310
 Archers 7 levels I 100 percent and a hundred 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.440
 percent sure that they are eight new 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.540
 It is worth it so I do not know how much 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.989
 days it all will last how many not 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.769
 will improve if I did not know at all 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:16.760
 but I think somewhere around 20 days somewhere two 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:20.780
 weeks I do not know well within and maybe 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.550
 I don't know anymore , let's look further 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.670
 go reduced the healing time plays 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.250
 now I wanted to say more with me 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.140
 the barbarian is recovering now 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.570
 level one has been restored before 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.530
 hour and now he is recovering 30 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:43.280
 I don’t know it for me 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.870
 of course made comfortable learning 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.690
 Valkyrie passes faster 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.019
 valky as I remember valkyrie 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.530
 I had to improve 14 I draw Kant 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:58.610
 minutes do not remember well, we got 13 minutes 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:02.450
 now she is training for 8 minutes 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:05.510
 that is, in general, everything changed as 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.840
 see salt or work for big 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.990
 groups of creatures wondering what 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.990
 groups 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:20.480
 group of creatures ok then somehow 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:24.760
 show so extra winov can be expelled 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.950
 clan fortress camps understand it 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.070
 now you can 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.470
 troops that is, you can remove them winter 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:40.190
 you don't like them or i don't know or 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:42.880
 they just somehow remove in general kai so 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.710
 what's next for us 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:51.800
 upcoming spells can be removed for free 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:55.250
 it's interesting to delete for free and yes 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.169
 it turns out clear in general, such 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.970
 convenient and update done in 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:02.960
 features for me don't know how for 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.190
 who are you to me for sure because everywhere 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.910
 that is, the benefit 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.419
 but of course one thing certainly doesn’t make me happy 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.870
 what 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:16.669
 and the barracks in the dark Kozar 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.070
 will have to improve to level six 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.470
 I don’t know how I will be with this 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:27.800
 living even before 5 has not improved 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:31.610
 fully caused the creation of hi8 and understood 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.789
 Now 8 called for can about such under 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:38.870
 minions to call it hell 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:41.830
 puppy from and puppies that is to call it 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.900
 can she damn or I'm confused 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.750
 these fiery blood creatures dislike 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.570
 air defenses if their 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.280
 kill they explode spawning new 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.389
 smaller creatures 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:59.240
 that is, penny 8 essentially causes 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:02.660
 Well, maybe more and see how much 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.150
 about 12 empty places probably and not 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.389
 I know even how much up to 12 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:12.260
 call when they kill him when they kill her 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:15.680
 is it then 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:20.630
 and how much will it be 390 black elixir 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:26.090
 cost 1 bondage 450 well yes basically 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:30.230
 everything is normal, I think in general is 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:33.320
 update we have prepared so 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:36.890

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:40.250
 would like to see at all then write will 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:43.010
 interesting to read your comments also
