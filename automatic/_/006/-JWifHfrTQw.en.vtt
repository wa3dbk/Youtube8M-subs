00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
island I believe off the coast of

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.519 
island I believe off the coast of
Australia<00:00:17.099> and<00:00:17.789> he<00:00:18.720> ends<00:00:19.050> up<00:00:19.109> getting<00:00:19.259> married

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.380 
Australia and he ends up getting married
to<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:19.890> woman<00:00:19.980> named<00:00:20.310> Isabel<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.939> he<00:00:21.210> brings

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
to this woman named Isabel and he brings

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.929

his<00:00:21.539> wife<00:00:21.660> out<00:00:22.019> to<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.679> island<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.550> they

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
his wife out to the island and they

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.519 
his wife out to the island and they
basically<00:00:24.150> just<00:00:24.359> lived<00:00:24.720> their<00:00:24.839> lives<00:00:25.050> almost

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
basically just lived their lives almost

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.679 
basically just lived their lives almost
completely<00:00:26.159> in<00:00:26.400> isolation<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:27.300> live<00:00:27.509> there

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
completely in isolation they live there

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.200 
completely in isolation they live there
for<00:00:27.900> almost<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.499> entire<00:00:28.650> year<00:00:29.400> he<00:00:29.759> has<00:00:29.999> to

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
for almost the entire year he has to

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.669 
for almost the entire year he has to
surf<00:00:30.419> or<00:00:30.659> I<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:31.079> a<00:00:31.109> three<00:00:31.380> year<00:00:31.650> term

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
surf or I think like a three year term

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.800 
surf or I think like a three year term
so<00:00:32.550> he<00:00:32.700> basically<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.240> there<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.630> an<00:00:33.720> entire

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
so he basically is there for an entire

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.570 
so he basically is there for an entire
year<00:00:33.990> they<00:00:34.500> get<00:00:34.650> like<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.830> month<00:00:35.100> off<00:00:35.280> when<00:00:35.490> they

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
year they get like a month off when they

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.920 
year they get like a month off when they
go<00:00:35.670> back<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.060> mainland<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.630> they'll<00:00:36.750> go

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
go back to the mainland and they'll go

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.240 
go back to the mainland and they'll go
visit<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.440> Isabelle's<00:00:37.830> parents<00:00:38.160> but

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
visit it like Isabelle's parents but

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.350 
visit it like Isabelle's parents but
they're<00:00:38.400> basically<00:00:38.520> by<00:00:38.790> themselves<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.240> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
they're basically by themselves for the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.670 
they're basically by themselves for the
majority<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.870> time<00:00:40.080> so<00:00:40.410> you're<00:00:40.530> following

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
to just not report it so they end up

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.880 
to just not report it so they end up

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
if it was their own child and then

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.450 
if it was their own child and then

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
get into it any more than that because

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:35.300 
get into it any more than that because
the<00:01:34.499> rest<00:01:34.679> would<00:01:34.799> probably<00:01:35.069> be<00:01:35.189> considered

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the rest would probably be considered

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.950 
the rest would probably be considered
spoilers<00:01:35.999> but<00:01:36.240> there<00:01:36.389> are<00:01:36.509> obviously

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
spoilers but there are obviously

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.929 
spoilers but there are obviously
consequences<00:01:37.649> to<00:01:37.799> their<00:01:37.950> action<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.670> was<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
consequences to their action this was a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.550 
consequences to their action this was a
really<00:01:39.329> interesting<00:01:39.659> book<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> read<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> will

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
really interesting book to read I will

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.379 
really interesting book to read I will
definitely<00:01:40.950> give<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.399> that<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:42.060> at<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> very

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:42.389 
definitely give it that like at the very

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:43.959 
definitely give it that like at the very
beginning<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.499> covers<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
beginning I think it covers a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.550 
beginning I think it covers a
interesting<00:01:44.969> period<00:01:45.749> of<00:01:45.869> time<00:01:46.109> and<00:01:46.439> an

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
interesting period of time and an

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.749 
interesting period of time and an
interesting<00:01:46.979> place<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.369> at<00:01:47.579> least

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
interesting place like at least

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.819 
interesting place like at least
personally<00:01:47.999> I<00:01:48.270> don't<00:01:48.509> read<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> lot<00:01:48.689> about<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
personally I don't read a lot about the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.309 
personally I don't read a lot about the
1920s<00:01:50.609> in<00:01:50.729> Australia<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:51.929> really<00:01:52.079> nice

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
1920s in Australia so it was really nice

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.800 
1920s in Australia so it was really nice
to<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.039> sort<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.939> story<00:01:54.299> being<00:01:54.539> told

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
to have that sort of story being told

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.330 
to have that sort of story being told
there<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.109> a<00:01:55.200> lot<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.530> information<00:01:55.740> given<00:01:56.130> in

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
there is a lot of information given in

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.969 
there is a lot of information given in
the<00:01:56.429> book<00:01:56.609> about<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.630> place<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:58.590> about<00:01:58.679> what

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
the book about that place and about what

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.149 
the book about that place and about what
was<00:01:59.069> happening<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.729> history<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.749> you<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:01.649> learn

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
was happening in history so you do learn

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.129 
was happening in history so you do learn
a<00:02:02.219> little<00:02:02.670> bit<00:02:02.819> about<00:02:03.149> Australian<00:02:03.749> history<00:02:03.840> by

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:04.139 
a little bit about Australian history by

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:05.629 
a little bit about Australian history by
reading<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.560> book<00:02:04.740> which<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.159> personally

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:05.639 
reading this book which I personally

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:06.250 
reading this book which I personally
really<00:02:05.759> like

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
really like

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.990 
really like
this<00:02:06.470> is<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.680> little<00:02:06.980> bit<00:02:07.070> of<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.250> slower<00:02:07.520> novel

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
this is a little bit of a slower novel

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.060 
this is a little bit of a slower novel
so<00:02:08.150> if<00:02:08.240> you<00:02:08.300> don't<00:02:08.510> like<00:02:08.869> stories<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.800> are

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
so if you don't like stories that are

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.010 
so if you don't like stories that are
more<00:02:10.430> like<00:02:10.640> slow<00:02:10.970> burns<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:11.900> is

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
more like slow burns and this is

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.900 
more like slow burns and this is
probably<00:02:12.260> not<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.650> book<00:02:12.770> for<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.040> but<00:02:13.310> again

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
probably not the book for you but again

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.430 
probably not the book for you but again
I<00:02:13.940> don't<00:02:14.270> mind<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.750> actually<00:02:15.140> really

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
I don't mind that I actually really

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.930 
I don't mind that I actually really
liked<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.160> liked<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.370> have<00:02:16.520> descriptive

that I had with this book were mainly
the<00:02:44.060> ones<00:02:44.210> that<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.390> had<00:02:44.600> with<00:02:44.750> like<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.020> last

the<00:02:47.540> weight<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.960> it<00:02:48.050> felt<00:02:48.380> like<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.710> author

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
the weight and it felt like the author

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.070 
the weight and it felt like the author
made<00:02:49.520> everything<00:02:50.180> just<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.510> little<00:02:50.540> bit<00:02:50.870> too

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
made everything just a little bit too

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.810 
made everything just a little bit too
nice<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.040> don't<00:02:52.100> want<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.490> say<00:02:52.580> too<00:02:52.640> much

nice and I don't want to say too much
more<00:02:53.180> than<00:02:53.210> that<00:02:53.360> because<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.900> feel<00:02:54.110> like<00:02:54.140> I'm

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
more than that because I feel like I'm

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.470 
more than that because I feel like I'm

about<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.989> I<00:03:24.230> do<00:03:24.380> think<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.280> book<00:03:25.519> is

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700

about it I do think that this book is
good<00:03:25.940> for<00:03:26.150> book<00:03:26.300> clubs<00:03:26.570> though<00:03:26.750> because<00:03:27.019> I

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
good for book clubs though because I

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.600 
good for book clubs though because I
feel<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.260> this<00:03:27.500> is<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.650> book<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:27.890> has<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.400> lot

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
feel like this is a book that has a lot

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.740 
feel like this is a book that has a lot
of<00:03:28.790> things<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.239> could<00:03:29.360> potentially

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
of things that you could potentially

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.020 
of things that you could potentially
talk<00:03:29.959> about<00:03:30.260> there's<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.680> lot<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:31.040> like<00:03:31.310> morally

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
talk about there's a lot of like morally

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.660 
talk about there's a lot of like morally
gray<00:03:32.420> areas<00:03:33.050> or<00:03:33.500> ways<00:03:33.950> that<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.280> could<00:03:34.459> see

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
gray areas or ways that you could see

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.880 
gray areas or ways that you could see
like<00:03:34.700> multiple<00:03:35.630> sides<00:03:35.810> of<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.080> story<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:36.650> I

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
like multiple sides of the story so I

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.380 
like multiple sides of the story so I
think<00:03:37.130> this<00:03:37.340> would<00:03:37.489> be<00:03:37.550> a<00:03:37.670> good<00:03:37.910> book<00:03:38.120> club

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
think this would be a good book club

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.640 
think this would be a good book club
book<00:03:38.600> because<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:38.930> feel<00:03:39.110> like<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.410> would<00:03:39.500> bring

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
book because I feel like it would bring

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.410 
book because I feel like it would bring
about<00:03:39.800> a<00:03:39.950> really<00:03:40.430> good<00:03:40.459> discussion<00:03:40.880> like<00:03:41.300> I

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
about a really good discussion like I

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.330 
about a really good discussion like I
don't<00:03:41.630> think<00:03:41.840> this<00:03:41.989> is<00:03:42.019> a<00:03:42.200> book<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:42.470> everyone

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
don't think this is a book that everyone

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.560 
don't think this is a book that everyone
will<00:03:43.519> love<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:43.880> I<00:03:43.970> don't<00:03:44.060> think<00:03:44.300> it's<00:03:44.390> a<00:03:44.450> book

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
will love and I don't think it's a book

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.880 
will love and I don't think it's a book
that<00:03:44.600> everyone<00:03:45.110> will<00:03:45.290> hate<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.470> feel<00:03:45.739> like

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
that everyone will hate I feel like

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.530 
that everyone will hate I feel like
you're<00:03:46.100> going<00:03:46.459> to<00:03:46.489> find<00:03:46.880> people<00:03:47.209> throughout

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.020 
you're going to find people throughout
the<00:03:47.780> spectrum<00:03:48.680> because<00:03:48.800> a<00:03:49.310> lot<00:03:49.610> of<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:49.850> stuff

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
the spectrum because a lot of the stuff

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.940 
the spectrum because a lot of the stuff
that<00:03:50.239> happens<00:03:50.660> like<00:03:50.989> it<00:03:51.320> could<00:03:51.590> have<00:03:51.739> gone

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
that happens like it could have gone

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.370 
that happens like it could have gone
multiple<00:03:52.700> ways<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:53.510> could<00:03:53.870> see<00:03:54.050> people's

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
multiple ways and I could see people's

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.259 
multiple ways and I could see people's
feelings<00:03:54.769> falling<00:03:55.220> across<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.640> board<00:03:55.850> so<00:03:56.150> in

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
feelings falling across the board so in

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.400 
feelings falling across the board so in
the<00:03:56.360> end<00:03:56.480> I<00:03:56.540> gave<00:03:56.630> this<00:03:56.750> book<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.989> 3<00:03:57.019> out<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.290> 5
