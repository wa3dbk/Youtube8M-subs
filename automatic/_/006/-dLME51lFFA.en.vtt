 robert plant is the figure 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.630
 iconic rock of the 70s is 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.040
 I really think it's incredible 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.599
 come from people who came during 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.490
 the seventies in essaouira and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.960
 I hope they made a merger with 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.220
 gueugnon and all that will be amazing 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.020

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.760

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.609

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.320
 big kisses the 360 â€‹â€‹I love you it's a 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.189
 myth and at the same time limit me that 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.689
 would like to say that there are holes in it 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.609
 there are no holes in robert plant 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.130
 okay because he's still there 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.320
 still green for his age and exists 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.570
 represents for me that's an aero 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.969
 of adolescence what's this someone 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.640
 I loved the music 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.379
 obviously era two the seed them and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.610
 someone who has kept a 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.070
 certain artistic integrity 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.410
 it's a pure legend really the icon 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.239
 the king should therefore saga pleasure from the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.789
 see Morocco here is great because we 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.109
 lose a mythical figure of rock I 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.340
