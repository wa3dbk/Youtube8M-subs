00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:30.889 
the biggest change
you<00:04:28.679> know<00:04:28.799> it's<00:04:29.449> it's<00:04:30.449> really<00:04:30.599> made<00:04:30.869> a

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:30.899 
you know it's it's really made a

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:32.179 
you know it's it's really made a
difference<00:04:30.959> in<00:04:31.349> our<00:04:31.469> playing<00:04:31.679> like<00:04:31.949> we<00:04:32.039> can

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:32.189 
difference in our playing like we can

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:33.529 
difference in our playing like we can
all<00:04:32.309> Tibetan<00:04:32.639> like<00:04:32.759> we<00:04:32.879> can<00:04:32.999> spend<00:04:33.209> that<00:04:33.359> time

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
all Tibetan like we can spend that time

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.329 
all Tibetan like we can spend that time
we<00:04:33.719> used<00:04:33.929> to<00:04:34.019> be<00:04:34.139> selling<00:04:34.559> shoes<00:04:34.799> or<00:04:35.099> whatever

00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:35.339 
we used to be selling shoes or whatever

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:36.919 
we used to be selling shoes or whatever
or<00:04:35.519> making<00:04:35.699> coffee<00:04:35.969> practicing<00:04:36.809> your

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:36.929 
or making coffee practicing your

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:38.899 
or making coffee practicing your
instruments<00:04:37.589> and<00:04:37.769> try<00:04:38.279> to<00:04:38.339> write<00:04:38.549> new<00:04:38.669> songs

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
instruments and try to write new songs

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.229 
instruments and try to write new songs
and<00:04:40.009> it's<00:04:41.009> I<00:04:41.279> think<00:04:41.519> it's<00:04:41.639> just<00:04:41.669> made<00:04:41.909> a<00:04:41.939> lot<00:04:42.209> of

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:42.239 
and it's I think it's just made a lot of

00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:45.319 
and it's I think it's just made a lot of
difference<00:04:42.719> to<00:04:43.429> the<00:04:44.429> energy<00:04:44.849> that<00:04:44.999> we<00:04:45.059> can<00:04:45.209> put

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:45.329 
difference to the energy that we can put

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:47.389 
difference to the energy that we can put
into<00:04:45.479> the<00:04:45.659> show<00:04:45.889> and<00:04:46.889> just<00:04:47.039> trying<00:04:47.249> to<00:04:47.309> make
