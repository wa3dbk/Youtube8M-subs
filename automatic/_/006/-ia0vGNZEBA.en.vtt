00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
that were commonly known to kill us do

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.170 
that were commonly known to kill us do
tend<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.319> use<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.530> lot<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:09.890> organic<00:02:10.429> flowers

tend to use a lot of organic flowers

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.520 
tend to use a lot of organic flowers
there's<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.540> little<00:02:11.810> difficult<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.170> come<00:02:12.379> by

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
there's a little difficult to come by

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.350 
there's a little difficult to come by
and<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.040> know<00:02:13.190> we<00:02:13.459> had<00:02:13.549> our<00:02:13.579> soy<00:02:13.940> milk

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
and you know we had our soy milk

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.610 
and you know we had our soy milk
what's<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.660> difference<00:02:14.840> between<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.200> soy<00:02:15.410> milk

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
what's the difference between a soy milk

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.170 
what's the difference between a soy milk
and<00:02:15.829> regular<00:02:16.220> milk<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.819> little<00:02:17.030> bit

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
and regular milk it is a little bit

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.220 
and regular milk it is a little bit
sweeter<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.750> take<00:02:17.989> that<00:02:18.079> into

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
sweeter so you take that into

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.720 
sweeter so you take that into
consideration<00:02:18.290> when<00:02:18.769> you<00:02:18.950> use<00:02:19.099> it<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.700> first

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
consideration when you use it the first

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.670 
consideration when you use it the first
