00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
fidelity you'd get yourself a record and

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.889 
fidelity you'd get yourself a record and
there<00:00:05.460> was<00:00:05.609> information<00:00:05.970> encoded<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:06.839> that

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
there was information encoded in that

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.480 
there was information encoded in that
groove<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.649> needle<00:00:08.010> could<00:00:08.160> pick<00:00:08.370> out

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
groove and that needle could pick out

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.129 
groove and that needle could pick out
that<00:00:08.700> information<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.540> could<00:00:09.719> have<00:00:09.870> rock

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
that information and you could have rock

that information and you could have rock
and<00:00:10.170> roll<00:00:10.590> but<00:00:11.099> see<00:00:11.309> records<00:00:11.700> were<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.330> big

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
and roll but see records were this big

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.360 
and roll but see records were this big
around<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.469> problem<00:00:13.830> with<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.250> you

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
how a CD can hold information because

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.389 
how a CD can hold information because
that<00:00:45.690> CD<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.260> holding<00:00:46.590> information<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:47.190> ones

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that CD is holding information in ones

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.950 
that CD is holding information in ones
and<00:00:47.579> zeros<00:00:47.670> because<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.329> know<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> few

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and zeros because you know like a few

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.779 
and zeros because you know like a few
years<00:00:49.170> ago<00:00:49.350> you'd<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> cd-rom<00:00:50.280> drive<00:00:50.550> for

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
years ago you'd get a cd-rom drive for

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.540 
years ago you'd get a cd-rom drive for
your<00:00:50.879> computer<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.710> cd-rom<00:00:53.039> drive<00:00:53.399> could

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
your computer and the cd-rom drive could

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.790 
your computer and the cd-rom drive could
store<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> picture<00:00:54.030> my<00:00:54.210> pictures<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.629> 1<00:00:54.809> 1<00:00:55.170> 0<00:00:55.530> 0

skip to one yeah so that's the picture

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.969 
skip to one yeah so that's the picture
inside<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.630> CD<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.439> want<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.830> how

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
inside of a CD and we want to know how

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
inside of a CD and we want to know how
that<00:01:08.130> CD<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.490> storing<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.060> information<00:01:09.240> we

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that CD is storing that information we

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.149 
that CD is storing that information we
want<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.960> know<00:01:10.020> how<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.710> incredibly

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
want to know how it can be so incredibly

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.630 
want to know how it can be so incredibly
dense<00:01:11.460> because<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.530> textbook<00:01:13.640> student

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
dense because this is a textbook student

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.539 
dense because this is a textbook student
edition<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.360> cd-rom<00:01:15.780> ding<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> piece<00:01:17.400> of

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
edition on cd-rom ding on a piece of

edition on cd-rom ding on a piece of
plastic<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.180> pretty<00:01:18.720> cool<00:01:18.990> right<00:01:19.470> but

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
plastic that's pretty cool right but

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.950 
plastic that's pretty cool right but
then<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.299> better<00:01:21.509> people<00:01:21.900> were

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
then see it's it got better people were

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.840 
then see it's it got better people were
like<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.290> could<00:01:22.470> make<00:01:22.619> movies<00:01:23.070> out<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.729> this

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
like we could make movies out of this

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670 
like we could make movies out of this
same<00:01:24.090> storage<00:01:24.450> medium<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.170> I've<00:01:25.320> got<00:01:25.500> myself

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
same storage medium and I've got myself

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.749 
same storage medium and I've got myself
a<00:01:26.040> movie<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.700> look<00:01:27.659> at<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.340> that's<00:01:29.340> an

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
a movie on a look at this that's an

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.210 
a movie on a look at this that's an
enormous<00:01:30.270> CD<00:01:30.810> exactly<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> same<00:01:31.920> storage

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
enormous CD exactly the same storage

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520 
enormous CD exactly the same storage
technology<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> CD<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.320> made<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
technology as a CD but they just made a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.990 
technology as a CD but they just made a
bigger<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.009> they<00:01:35.070> call<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> laserdisc

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
bigger and they call it a laserdisc

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
bigger and they call it a laserdisc
because<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:37.110> cool<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.650> what<00:01:37.860> if

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
because it's really cool like what if

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
because it's really cool like what if
you<00:01:38.040> shine<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> laser<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.970> watch<00:01:39.420> this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
you shine the laser on it watch this

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.700 
you shine the laser on it watch this
yeah<00:01:41.390> all<00:01:42.390> kinds<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.840> awesome<00:01:43.170> things<00:01:43.350> happen

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
yeah all kinds of awesome things happen

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.130 
yeah all kinds of awesome things happen
in<00:01:43.860> fact<00:01:44.100> there's<00:01:44.670> actually<00:01:45.180> well<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:46.020> all

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
in fact there's actually well see all

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.539 
in fact there's actually well see all
the<00:01:46.259> multiple<00:01:46.649> dots<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.130> means<00:01:47.280> there<00:01:47.460> must

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the multiple dots that means there must

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.850 
the multiple dots that means there must
be<00:01:47.700> some<00:01:47.880> kind<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.090> diffraction<00:01:48.590> guess<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.740> can

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
be some kind of diffraction guess we can

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.499 
be some kind of diffraction guess we can
do<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> CD<00:01:50.610> too<00:01:50.820> let's<00:01:51.060> try<00:01:51.270> it

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
do that with a CD too let's try it

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.840 
do that with a CD too let's try it
can<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.229> look<00:01:52.680> at<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:52.890> those<00:01:53.040> dots<00:01:53.310> yep

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
can we look at all those dots yep

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.730 
can we look at all those dots yep
probably<00:01:54.270> diffraction<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.470> too

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
probably diffraction going on there too

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.969 
probably diffraction going on there too
yep<00:01:56.549> what<00:01:57.119> about<00:01:57.240> oh<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.530> said<00:01:58.770> wait

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
yep what about oh and then I said wait

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.230 
yep what about oh and then I said wait
wait<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.549> put<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.700> dots<00:01:59.850> even<00:02:00.000> closer

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
wait we can put the dots even closer

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.670 
wait we can put the dots even closer
together<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.869> then<00:02:01.290> they<00:02:01.350> got<00:02:01.500> these<00:02:01.619> things

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
together and then they got these things

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.600 
together and then they got these things
called<00:02:03.049> DVDs<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.680> these<00:02:04.920> guys<00:02:05.159> might<00:02:05.579> have

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
called DVDs and these guys might have

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.340 
called DVDs and these guys might have
even<00:02:06.030> more<00:02:06.210> diffraction<00:02:06.869> because<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.170> dots

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
even more diffraction because the dots

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.559 
even more diffraction because the dots
are<00:02:07.530> closer<00:02:07.710> together<00:02:07.920> wow<00:02:08.610> there's<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.479> much

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
are closer together wow there's so much

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.570 
are closer together wow there's so much
diffraction<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.470> only<00:02:10.679> see<00:02:11.069> two<00:02:11.310> dots

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
diffraction that I can only see two dots

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.680 
diffraction that I can only see two dots
at<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> time

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
at a time

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.720 
at a time
if<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.900> got<00:02:13.110> me<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> blu-ray<00:02:13.920> disc<00:02:14.280> out<00:02:14.520> here

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
if you got me a blu-ray disc out here

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.340 
if you got me a blu-ray disc out here
Wow<00:02:14.910> look<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.240> can<00:02:15.390> barely<00:02:15.660> see<00:02:15.960> those<00:02:16.110> three

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
Wow look I can barely see those three

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.380 
Wow look I can barely see those three
almost<00:02:16.530> if<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.400> got<00:02:17.550> me<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.700> blu-ray<00:02:18.120> disc

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
almost if you got me a blu-ray disc

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.510 
almost if you got me a blu-ray disc
you'd<00:02:18.690> probably<00:02:18.900> only<00:02:19.350> be<00:02:19.890> able<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.100> see<00:02:20.310> one

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
you'd probably only be able to see one

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.340 
you'd probably only be able to see one
dot<00:02:20.730> at<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.880> time<00:02:21.060> wow<00:02:21.300> that's<00:02:22.020> cool<00:02:22.170> did<00:02:22.320> you

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
dot at a time wow that's cool did you

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.930 
dot at a time wow that's cool did you
see<00:02:22.530> all<00:02:22.650> those<00:02:22.800> at<00:02:23.010> one<00:02:23.160> moment<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.610> think<00:02:23.910> I

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
see all those at one moment I think I

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.310 
see all those at one moment I think I
was<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.300> middle<00:02:24.540> doing<00:02:24.930> some<00:02:25.110> really

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
was in the middle doing some really

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.810 
was in the middle doing some really
interesting<00:02:25.500> stuff<00:02:25.950> okay<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.400> that's<00:02:26.670> fun

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
interesting stuff okay so that's fun

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.920 
interesting stuff okay so that's fun
play<00:02:27.030> with<00:02:27.150> layers<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.450> some<00:02:27.600> time<00:02:27.750> but<00:02:27.870> I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
play with layers of some time but I

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.360 
play with layers of some time but I
don't<00:02:28.110> want<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.350> bore<00:02:28.500> you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
don't want to bore you

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.910 
don't want to bore you
the<00:02:30.030> point<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.470> optical<00:02:31.470> storage<00:02:31.710> is

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
the point is optical storage is

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.500 
the point is optical storage is
incredibly<00:02:32.520> cheap<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.120> make<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.390> with

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
incredibly cheap you can make it with

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.060 
incredibly cheap you can make it with
plastic<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.170> can<00:02:34.200> seriously<00:02:34.830> buy<00:02:35.010> these

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
plastic and you can seriously buy these

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.760 
plastic and you can seriously buy these
things<00:02:35.280> for<00:02:35.790> ten<00:02:36.060> cents<00:02:36.570> apiece<00:02:36.810> if<00:02:37.560> you're

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
things for ten cents apiece if you're

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.740 
things for ten cents apiece if you're
paying<00:02:37.950> $15<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.850> CD<00:02:39.120> you're<00:02:39.540> probably

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
paying $15 for a CD you're probably

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.300 
paying $15 for a CD you're probably
paying<00:02:40.050> some<00:02:40.320> other<00:02:40.440> people<00:02:40.770> rather<00:02:40.980> than<00:02:41.220> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
paying some other people rather than the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.550 
paying some other people rather than the
plastic<00:02:41.580> manufacturer<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:42.900> here's<00:02:43.170> my<00:02:43.350> point

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
plastic manufacturer so here's my point

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.550 
plastic manufacturer so here's my point
this<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.250> how<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.430> read<00:02:44.790> information<00:02:45.630> on<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.900> CD

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
this is how we read information on a CD

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.350 
this is how we read information on a CD
I<00:02:46.770> want<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.490> pretend<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:47.940> you've<00:02:48.120> got<00:02:48.330> a

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
I want you to pretend that you've got a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.900 
I want you to pretend that you've got a
laser<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.050> if<00:02:49.410> it's<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.680> CD<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.250> sucker<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.880> a

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
laser and if it's a CD that sucker is a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.690 
laser and if it's a CD that sucker is a
red<00:02:51.300> laser<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.380> you've<00:02:52.530> got<00:02:52.740> white<00:02:53.160> coming

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
red laser and so you've got white coming

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.230 
red laser and so you've got white coming
down<00:02:54.320> pooh-pooh<00:02:55.320> like<00:02:55.740> this<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.240> you're

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
down pooh-pooh like this and you're

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.080 
down pooh-pooh like this and you're
scanning<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.960> surface<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:59.100> CD<00:02:59.490> but<00:02:59.850> on<00:03:00.060> a

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
scanning the surface of the CD but on a

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.170 
scanning the surface of the CD but on a
CD<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:01.050> may<00:03:01.260> find<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.160> bump<00:03:02.580> but

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
CD you may find that there is a bump but

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.120 
CD you may find that there is a bump but
notice<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.810> bump<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.320> not<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.800> problem

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
notice that that bump is not a problem

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.280 
notice that that bump is not a problem
right<00:03:05.370> now<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.910> lo<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:06.330> behold<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.930> CD

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
right now but lo and behold the CD

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.290 
right now but lo and behold the CD
surface<00:03:07.710> is<00:03:07.920> moving<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.580> direction<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:09.240> you

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
surface is moving this direction so you

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.540 
surface is moving this direction so you
got<00:03:09.510> light<00:03:09.720> coming<00:03:09.750> down<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.530> you've<00:03:10.830> got<00:03:11.070> Ray

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
got light coming down and you've got Ray

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.910 
got light coming down and you've got Ray
one<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.390> Ray<00:03:12.960> to<00:03:13.020> notice<00:03:13.680> we're<00:03:13.800> always

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
one and Ray to notice we're always

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.160 
one and Ray to notice we're always
comparing<00:03:14.340> one<00:03:14.610> ray<00:03:14.790> versus<00:03:15.180> another<00:03:15.390> ray<00:03:15.690> ray

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
comparing one ray versus another ray ray

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.110 
comparing one ray versus another ray ray
one<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.560> Ray<00:03:16.709> two<00:03:16.770> when<00:03:17.370> they<00:03:17.550> bounce<00:03:17.820> off

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
one and Ray two when they bounce off

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.699 
one and Ray two when they bounce off
let's<00:03:18.480> say<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.780> bounce<00:03:18.989> off<00:03:19.260> they're<00:03:19.500> still

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
let's say the bounce off they're still

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.830 
let's say the bounce off they're still
going<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.920> be<00:03:19.980> red<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.420> don't<00:03:21.540> really<00:03:21.660> want

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
going to be red but I don't really want

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.260 
going to be red but I don't really want
to<00:03:21.900> draw<00:03:22.110> them<00:03:22.320> red<00:03:22.530> sorry<00:03:22.860> still<00:03:23.430> red<00:03:23.790> but

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
to draw them red sorry still red but

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.060 
to draw them red sorry still red but
they're<00:03:24.450> going<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.660> be<00:03:24.810> coming<00:03:25.050> up<00:03:25.260> like<00:03:25.709> this

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
they're going to be coming up like this

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.640 
they're going to be coming up like this
and<00:03:26.430> like<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:27.239> what's<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.900> effective<00:03:28.350> path

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
and like this what's the effective path

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.290 
and like this what's the effective path
length<00:03:28.980> difference<00:03:29.070> between<00:03:29.670> Ray<00:03:29.850> one<00:03:30.120> and

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
length difference between Ray one and

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.360 
length difference between Ray one and
Ray<00:03:30.390> -<00:03:30.450> well<00:03:31.050> it's<00:03:31.260> exactly<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.890> same<00:03:32.100> path

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
Ray - well it's exactly the same path

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.440 
Ray - well it's exactly the same path
they're<00:03:32.610> doing<00:03:32.790> nothing<00:03:33.090> different<00:03:33.270> than

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
they're doing nothing different than

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.430 
they're doing nothing different than
they're<00:03:33.570> reflecting<00:03:33.959> off<00:03:34.050> of<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.260> same

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
they're reflecting off of the same

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.010 
they're reflecting off of the same
surface<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:35.250> forget<00:03:35.700> about<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.300> do<00:03:36.810> not

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
surface so forget about it you do not

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.750 
surface so forget about it you do not
have<00:03:37.350> any<00:03:37.560> path<00:03:37.830> length<00:03:38.070> difference<00:03:38.130> but<00:03:38.700> you

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
have any path length difference but you

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.460 
have any path length difference but you
know<00:03:39.060> what<00:03:39.300> would<00:03:39.390> cause<00:03:39.630> destructive

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
know what would cause destructive

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.110 
know what would cause destructive
interference<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.370> get<00:03:41.580> destructive

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
interference you get destructive

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.780 
interference you get destructive
interference<00:03:43.700> destructive<00:03:46.160> interference<00:03:47.160> if

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
interference destructive interference if

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.100 
interference destructive interference if
and<00:03:49.160> only<00:03:50.160> if<00:03:50.550> well<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.090> guess<00:03:51.330> if<00:03:51.480> we<00:03:51.510> have<00:03:51.780> some

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
and only if well I guess if we have some

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.520 
and only if well I guess if we have some
multiple<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.800> I<00:03:53.280> guess<00:03:53.940> if<00:03:54.300> this<00:03:54.630> effective

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
multiple of I guess if this effective

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.750 
multiple of I guess if this effective
path<00:03:56.010> length<00:03:56.519> is<00:03:57.140> one<00:03:58.140> half<00:03:58.590> of<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:59.220> wavelength

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
path length is one half of a wavelength

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.220 
path length is one half of a wavelength
because<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.150> means<00:04:00.390> that<00:04:00.570> one<00:04:00.780> wave<00:04:00.989> would

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
because that means that one wave would

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.440 
because that means that one wave would
be<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.440> half<00:04:01.739> wave<00:04:02.430> out<00:04:02.820> of<00:04:03.000> phase<00:04:03.180> with<00:04:03.360> the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
be a half wave out of phase with the

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.940 
be a half wave out of phase with the
other<00:04:03.630> wave<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.110> they<00:04:04.200> would<00:04:04.350> totally<00:04:04.530> kill

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
other wave and they would totally kill

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.400 
other wave and they would totally kill
each<00:04:05.070> other<00:04:05.250> for<00:04:05.640> all<00:04:05.790> times<00:04:06.150> all<00:04:06.959> right<00:04:07.019> so

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
each other for all times all right so

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.410 
each other for all times all right so
here's<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:07.980> point<00:04:08.310> if<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:08.790> surface<00:04:09.090> is

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
here's the point if this surface is

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.670 
here's the point if this surface is
moving<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:09.840> direction<00:04:10.019> because<00:04:10.410> there's<00:04:10.620> a

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
moving this direction because there's a

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.190 
moving this direction because there's a
motor<00:04:10.950> spinning<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.640> CD<00:04:12.060> underneath<00:04:12.570> us<00:04:12.780> it's

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
motor spinning the CD underneath us it's

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.470 
motor spinning the CD underneath us it's
like<00:04:13.380> -<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.550> we're<00:04:14.730> shining<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:15.060> laser<00:04:15.150> at<00:04:15.450> a

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
like - and we're shining a laser at a

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.259 
like - and we're shining a laser at a
particular<00:04:16.019> point<00:04:16.200> on<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.500> CD<00:04:16.859> is<00:04:17.790> this<00:04:18.030> tiny

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
particular point on the CD is this tiny

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.880 
particular point on the CD is this tiny
little<00:04:18.510> dot<00:04:18.780> so<00:04:19.019> small<00:04:19.290> that<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.470> can't<00:04:19.709> even

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
little dot so small that you can't even

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.460 
little dot so small that you can't even
see<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.190> look<00:04:20.549> wow<00:04:21.299> there<00:04:21.750> are<00:04:21.780> millions<00:04:22.289> of

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
see it look wow there are millions of

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.500 
see it look wow there are millions of
them<00:04:22.650> on<00:04:22.770> here<00:04:22.979> cool<00:04:23.310> tiny<00:04:23.789> little<00:04:24.060> dots<00:04:24.330> so

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
them on here cool tiny little dots so

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.910 
them on here cool tiny little dots so
small<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:24.930> you<00:04:24.990> can't<00:04:25.320> see<00:04:25.410> it<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.740> we

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
small that you can't see it and we

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.500 
small that you can't see it and we
have<00:04:26.040> to<00:04:26.160> locate<00:04:26.340> it<00:04:26.580> incredibly<00:04:27.030> precisely

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
have to locate it incredibly precisely

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.680 
have to locate it incredibly precisely
but<00:04:28.020> this<00:04:28.260> says<00:04:28.560> on<00:04:29.040> when<00:04:30.030> we<00:04:30.180> see<00:04:30.390> it<00:04:30.420> like

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
but this says on when we see it like

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.100 
but this says on when we see it like
that

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
that

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.340 
that
now<00:04:31.260> watch<00:04:31.590> this<00:04:32.070> if<00:04:32.280> it<00:04:32.760> keeps<00:04:33.060> spinning<00:04:33.540> see

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
now watch this if it keeps spinning see

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.170 
now watch this if it keeps spinning see
we're<00:04:34.620> going<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.830> have<00:04:35.010> this<00:04:35.250> moved<00:04:35.700> over<00:04:36.150> a

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
we're going to have this moved over a

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.830 
we're going to have this moved over a
little<00:04:36.450> bit

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
little bit

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.740 
little bit
a<00:04:36.870> moment<00:04:37.470> later<00:04:37.920> we've<00:04:38.370> got<00:04:38.610> velocity<00:04:39.480> still

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
a moment later we've got velocity still

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.080 
a moment later we've got velocity still
that<00:04:39.990> direction<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.860> we<00:04:41.070> got<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.400> beam<00:04:41.640> down

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
that direction and we got the beam down

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.810 
that direction and we got the beam down
here<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.290> beam<00:04:43.560> wait<00:04:44.100> a<00:04:44.130> second<00:04:44.700> I'm

here and the beam wait a second I'm

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.190 
here and the beam wait a second I'm
going<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.030> say<00:04:45.150> that<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.360> block<00:04:45.810> will<00:04:46.020> have

going to say that that block will have
gone<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:47.010> right<00:04:47.310> here<00:04:48.860> and<00:04:49.860> now<00:04:50.130> this<00:04:50.490> path

gone to right here and now this path

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.940 
gone to right here and now this path
this<00:04:51.360> Ray<00:04:51.660> one<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.410> this<00:04:53.100> ray<00:04:53.460> two<00:04:53.520> they<00:04:54.510> are

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
this Ray one and this ray two they are

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.110 
this Ray one and this ray two they are
experiencing<00:04:55.950> different<00:04:56.220> things<00:04:56.460> you<00:04:56.910> see

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
experiencing different things you see

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.910 
experiencing different things you see
there's<00:04:57.330> been<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.570> little<00:04:57.960> bit<00:04:58.140> of<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.590> phase

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
there's been a little bit of a phase

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.000 
there's been a little bit of a phase
shift<00:04:59.430> of<00:04:59.580> Ray<00:05:00.510> two<00:05:00.570> because<00:05:01.320> it<00:05:01.470> doesn't<00:05:01.860> have

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
shift of Ray two because it doesn't have

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.890 
shift of Ray two because it doesn't have
to<00:05:02.190> go<00:05:02.370> as<00:05:02.580> far<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:03.000> get<00:05:03.120> back<00:05:03.330> up<00:05:03.510> into<00:05:03.690> the

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
to go as far to get back up into the

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.530 
to go as far to get back up into the
optical<00:05:04.380> sensor<00:05:04.650> now<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.580> clever<00:05:06.030> thing<00:05:06.180> is

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
optical sensor now the clever thing is

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.690 
optical sensor now the clever thing is
this<00:05:06.660> is<00:05:06.780> incredibly<00:05:07.260> clever<00:05:07.440> how<00:05:07.950> can<00:05:08.280> we<00:05:08.460> get

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
this is incredibly clever how can we get

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.330 
this is incredibly clever how can we get
it<00:05:09.140> so<00:05:10.140> that<00:05:10.260> we<00:05:10.350> have<00:05:10.470> an<00:05:10.560> effective<00:05:10.680> path

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
it so that we have an effective path

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.340 
it so that we have an effective path
length<00:05:11.670> difference<00:05:11.730> of<00:05:12.180> half<00:05:12.420> a<00:05:12.600> lambda<00:05:12.810> how

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
length difference of half a lambda how

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.320 
length difference of half a lambda how
tall<00:05:13.680> do<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:13.950> want<00:05:14.160> this<00:05:14.310> block<00:05:14.550> to<00:05:14.580> be<00:05:14.880> pause

okay thank you for pausing it then we

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.430 
okay thank you for pausing it then we
shall<00:05:31.740> go<00:05:31.920> on<00:05:31.950> my<00:05:32.670> point<00:05:32.970> is<00:05:33.240> if<00:05:33.630> you<00:05:33.900> have<00:05:34.200> this

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
shall go on my point is if you have this

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.110 
shall go on my point is if you have this
one<00:05:35.390> quarter<00:05:36.390> of<00:05:36.720> a<00:05:36.810> wavelength<00:05:37.760> then<00:05:38.760> this

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
one quarter of a wavelength then this

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.120 
one quarter of a wavelength then this
will<00:05:39.330> be<00:05:39.480> saving<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.230> downward<00:05:40.590> trip<00:05:40.800> of<00:05:40.920> one

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
will be saving the downward trip of one

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.620 
will be saving the downward trip of one
quarter<00:05:41.340> of<00:05:41.460> wavelength<00:05:41.760> and<00:05:41.940> saving<00:05:42.420> up<00:05:42.510> a

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
quarter of wavelength and saving up a

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.240 
quarter of wavelength and saving up a
trip<00:05:42.810> of<00:05:42.960> one<00:05:43.260> quarter<00:05:43.530> of<00:05:43.590> wavelength<00:05:44.040> and<00:05:44.220> we

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
trip of one quarter of wavelength and we

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.980 
trip of one quarter of wavelength and we
will<00:05:44.670> have<00:05:44.850> a<00:05:45.000> path<00:05:45.240> length<00:05:45.420> difference<00:05:45.540> of

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
will have a path length difference of

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.710 
will have a path length difference of
one<00:05:46.200> half<00:05:46.440> of<00:05:46.530> a<00:05:46.650> wavelength<00:05:47.010> and<00:05:47.160> so<00:05:47.550> now

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
one half of a wavelength and so now

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.660 
one half of a wavelength and so now
light<00:05:48.720> beam<00:05:49.110> one<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:49.830> light<00:05:50.070> beam<00:05:50.250> two<00:05:50.490> when

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
light beam one and light beam two when

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.980 
light beam one and light beam two when
they<00:05:50.730> come<00:05:50.910> back<00:05:50.970> up<00:05:51.180> to<00:05:51.270> the<00:05:51.390> optical<00:05:51.720> sensor

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
they come back up to the optical sensor

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.010 
they come back up to the optical sensor
are<00:05:52.710> completely<00:05:53.430> out<00:05:53.580> of<00:05:53.760> phase<00:05:53.970> and<00:05:54.360> this<00:05:54.750> is

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
are completely out of phase and this is

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.300 
are completely out of phase and this is
therefore<00:05:55.550> off<00:05:56.550> and<00:05:57.270> you<00:05:57.900> don't<00:05:58.170> detect<00:05:58.890> light

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
therefore off and you don't detect light

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.700 
therefore off and you don't detect light
when<00:05:59.850> you're<00:06:00.000> half<00:06:00.240> on<00:06:00.480> a<00:06:00.510> bump<00:06:00.870> and<00:06:00.990> half<00:06:01.500> off

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
when you're half on a bump and half off

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.740 
when you're half on a bump and half off
a<00:06:01.740> bump<00:06:02.130> Oh<00:06:02.310> times<00:06:02.850> up<00:06:03.030> just<00:06:03.360> kidding<00:06:03.630> we're

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
a bump Oh times up just kidding we're

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.960 
a bump Oh times up just kidding we're
going<00:06:03.870> to<00:06:03.930> keep<00:06:03.990> going<00:06:04.110> in<00:06:04.380> the<00:06:04.830> bumps<00:06:05.370> in<00:06:05.550> the

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
going to keep going in the bumps in the

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.250 
going to keep going in the bumps in the
case<00:06:06.270> where<00:06:06.480> the<00:06:06.540> bump<00:06:06.720> is<00:06:06.870> directly

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
case where the bump is directly

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.860 
case where the bump is directly
underneath<00:06:07.680> both<00:06:08.070> of<00:06:08.280> them<00:06:08.480> this<00:06:09.480> is<00:06:09.660> pretty

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
underneath both of them this is pretty

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.320 
underneath both of them this is pretty
cool<00:06:10.110> we've<00:06:10.500> still<00:06:10.770> got<00:06:10.950> the<00:06:11.340> CD<00:06:11.700> rapidly

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
cool we've still got the CD rapidly

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.910 
cool we've still got the CD rapidly
spinning<00:06:12.600> underneath<00:06:13.140> us<00:06:13.320> it's<00:06:13.500> going<00:06:13.770> that

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
spinning underneath us it's going that

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.740 
spinning underneath us it's going that
direction<00:06:14.160> and<00:06:14.640> I'm<00:06:15.000> going<00:06:15.150> to<00:06:15.210> say<00:06:15.390> we've<00:06:15.540> got

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
direction and I'm going to say we've got

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.590 
direction and I'm going to say we've got
an<00:06:15.840> incoming<00:06:16.320> beam<00:06:16.650> here<00:06:17.190> that's<00:06:17.400> two<00:06:17.790> and<00:06:18.240> an

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
an incoming beam here that's two and an

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.080 
an incoming beam here that's two and an
incoming<00:06:19.050> beam<00:06:19.320> here<00:06:19.770> that's<00:06:20.040> one<00:06:20.460> what<00:06:21.000> is

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
incoming beam here that's one what is

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.460 
incoming beam here that's one what is
the<00:06:21.210> path<00:06:21.390> length<00:06:21.630> difference<00:06:21.720> between<00:06:22.320> them

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
the path length difference between them

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.470 
the path length difference between them
now<00:06:22.620> well<00:06:23.100> they're<00:06:23.340> exactly<00:06:23.790> the<00:06:23.910> same<00:06:24.210> again

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
now well they're exactly the same again

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.410 
now well they're exactly the same again
we<00:06:24.840> are<00:06:24.990> still<00:06:25.380> on<00:06:25.680> and<00:06:26.160> when<00:06:26.400> Ray<00:06:26.640> one<00:06:26.910> bumps

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.420 
we are still on and when Ray one bumps

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.120 
we are still on and when Ray one bumps
off<00:06:27.570> and<00:06:27.960> hits<00:06:28.110> the<00:06:28.260> regular<00:06:28.560> surface<00:06:28.770> of<00:06:29.070> the

off and hits the regular surface of the
CD<00:06:29.430> then<00:06:29.790> we'll<00:06:29.940> be<00:06:30.030> off<00:06:30.210> again<00:06:30.540> so<00:06:31.110> notice<00:06:31.530> we

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
CD then we'll be off again so notice we

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.250 
CD then we'll be off again so notice we
can<00:06:31.800> extremely<00:06:32.310> precisely<00:06:33.240> put<00:06:33.690> ones<00:06:33.960> and

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
can extremely precisely put ones and

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.590 
can extremely precisely put ones and
zeros<00:06:34.620> down<00:06:34.920> as<00:06:35.100> ons<00:06:35.670> and<00:06:35.880> offs<00:06:36.000> where<00:06:36.480> the

bumps end and where they start it's not

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.720 
bumps end and where they start it's not
about

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
about

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.310 
about
there's<00:06:39.970> a<00:06:40.030> bump<00:06:40.270> or<00:06:40.390> not<00:06:40.570> it's<00:06:40.840> about<00:06:41.080> whether

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
there's a bump or not it's about whether

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.560 
there's a bump or not it's about whether
we're<00:06:41.560> transitioning<00:06:42.310> between<00:06:42.730> a<00:06:42.760> bump<00:06:43.120> or<00:06:43.510> a

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
we're transitioning between a bump or a

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.590 
we're transitioning between a bump or a
not<00:06:44.110> bump<00:06:44.890> and<00:06:45.190> those<00:06:45.580> bumps<00:06:45.970> are<00:06:46.090> only<00:06:46.270> one

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
not bump and those bumps are only one

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.180 
not bump and those bumps are only one
quarter<00:06:47.020> of<00:06:47.050> a<00:06:47.230> wavelength<00:06:47.260> thick<00:06:47.950> and<00:06:48.130> if

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
quarter of a wavelength thick and if

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.560 
quarter of a wavelength thick and if
we're<00:06:48.340> talking<00:06:48.490> about<00:06:48.700> red<00:06:49.090> we're<00:06:49.300> talking

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
we're talking about red we're talking

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.740 
we're talking about red we're talking
about<00:06:49.660> what<00:06:50.610> 750<00:06:51.610> nanometers<00:06:51.850> or<00:06:52.420> something

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
about what 750 nanometers or something

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.280 
about what 750 nanometers or something
like<00:06:52.870> that

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
like that

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.140 
like that
I'm<00:06:53.620> just<00:06:53.860> making<00:06:54.130> up<00:06:54.220> some<00:06:54.430> stupid<00:06:54.880> number

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
I'm just making up some stupid number

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.720 
I'm just making up some stupid number
what<00:06:55.540> about<00:06:55.720> that<00:06:55.870> no<00:06:56.080> gosh<00:06:56.380> that's<00:06:56.730> this

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
what about that no gosh that's this

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.270 
what about that no gosh that's this
green<00:06:58.030> laser<00:06:58.210> is<00:06:58.510> 5:30<00:06:59.170> -<00:06:59.380> yeah<00:06:59.860> maybe<00:07:00.100> we're

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
green laser is 5:30 - yeah maybe we're

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.940 
green laser is 5:30 - yeah maybe we're
talking<00:07:00.520> about<00:07:00.580> 700<00:07:01.210> 600<00:07:01.600> nanometers<00:07:01.750> then<00:07:02.440> if

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
talking about 700 600 nanometers then if

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.770 
talking about 700 600 nanometers then if
you're<00:07:03.130> talking<00:07:03.250> about<00:07:03.460> 1/4<00:07:04.150> of<00:07:04.240> that<00:07:04.420> these

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
you're talking about 1/4 of that these

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.570 
you're talking about 1/4 of that these
bumps<00:07:05.380> are<00:07:05.560> only<00:07:06.240> approximately<00:07:07.240> 200<00:07:08.170> to<00:07:08.620> 150

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580 
bumps are only approximately 200 to 150

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.840 
bumps are only approximately 200 to 150
nanometers<00:07:10.150> tall<00:07:10.900> ding<00:07:11.710> so<00:07:12.370> you<00:07:12.460> can<00:07:12.640> sneak

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.850 
nanometers tall ding so you can sneak

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.160 
nanometers tall ding so you can sneak
lots<00:07:13.090> of<00:07:13.210> them<00:07:13.360> together<00:07:13.510> but<00:07:13.870> wait<00:07:14.400> what<00:07:15.400> if

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.170 
lots of them together but wait what if

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.130 
lots of them together but wait what if
what<00:07:17.170> if<00:07:17.200> we<00:07:17.650> had<00:07:17.860> a<00:07:17.890> brighter<00:07:18.400> we<00:07:19.360> had<00:07:19.510> an<00:07:19.630> even

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.140 
what if we had a brighter we had an even

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.920 
what if we had a brighter we had an even
brighter<00:07:20.710> light<00:07:21.370> I<00:07:21.640> talked<00:07:22.270> about<00:07:22.300> brightness

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
brighter light I talked about brightness

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.630 
brighter light I talked about brightness
no<00:07:23.200> what<00:07:23.560> if<00:07:23.650> we<00:07:23.710> had<00:07:23.800> a<00:07:23.830> smaller<00:07:24.190> wavelength

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:24.640 
no what if we had a smaller wavelength

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.830 
no what if we had a smaller wavelength
we<00:07:24.790> had<00:07:24.880> our<00:07:24.970> smaller<00:07:25.210> width<00:07:25.390> like<00:07:25.570> we<00:07:25.690> could

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 
we had our smaller width like we could

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.440 
we had our smaller width like we could
slam<00:07:26.200> more<00:07:26.500> dots<00:07:26.710> in<00:07:26.920> there<00:07:27.100> that's<00:07:27.550> why<00:07:28.240> they

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.450 
slam more dots in there that's why they

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.680 
slam more dots in there that's why they
invented<00:07:28.500> blue<00:07:29.500> ray<00:07:29.830> because<00:07:30.700> it's<00:07:30.970> a<00:07:31.210> smaller

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:31.690 
invented blue ray because it's a smaller

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.010 
invented blue ray because it's a smaller
wavelength<00:07:33.360> awesome<00:07:34.360> what<00:07:34.720> do<00:07:34.780> they<00:07:34.840> call<00:07:34.990> it

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.020 
wavelength awesome what do they call it

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.870 
wavelength awesome what do they call it
blue<00:07:35.500> ray<00:07:35.740> I<00:07:35.770> think<00:07:36.070> they<00:07:36.160> dropped<00:07:36.400> the<00:07:36.490> e<00:07:36.520> cuz

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880 
blue ray I think they dropped the e cuz

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.840 
blue ray I think they dropped the e cuz
that's<00:07:37.060> cool<00:07:37.330> bye-bye
