00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
you know at least I do and I think

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.800 
you know at least I do and I think
that's<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.650> big<00:03:00.830> part<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.600> anyway<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.750> see

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
that's a big part of it anyway to see

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.770 
that's a big part of it anyway to see
from<00:03:03.140> my<00:03:03.350> age<00:03:03.500> or<00:03:03.709> landlord<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:05.150> know<00:03:05.270> he

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
from my age or landlord you know he

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.470 
from my age or landlord you know he
throws<00:03:06.080> along<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.739> long<00:03:07.370> ball<00:03:07.670> in<00:03:08.000> my<00:03:08.180> opinion

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
throws along the long ball in my opinion

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.600 
throws along the long ball in my opinion
exceptionally<00:03:09.170> well<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.590> we<00:03:09.950> felt<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.370> same

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
exceptionally well and we felt the same

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.320 
exceptionally well and we felt the same
way<00:03:10.820> last<00:03:11.090> year<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.570> think<00:03:11.959> he<00:03:12.730> manager<00:03:13.730> offense

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
way last year I think he manager offense

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.520 
way last year I think he manager offense
very<00:03:15.050> well<00:03:16.000> he's<00:03:17.000> been<00:03:17.600> beat<00:03:17.840> up<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:18.170> little<00:03:18.380> bit

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
very well he's been beat up a little bit

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.350 
very well he's been beat up a little bit
i<00:03:18.560> know<00:03:18.709> this<00:03:19.040> year<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.610> i'm<00:03:19.940> sure<00:03:20.150> that's

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
i know this year and i'm sure that's

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.900 
i know this year and i'm sure that's
affected<00:03:20.950> some<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.160> things<00:03:22.459> in<00:03:22.790> the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
affected some of the things in the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.540 
affected some of the things in the
course<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.480> year<00:03:23.540> but<00:03:24.050> i<00:03:24.110> think<00:03:24.680> he's<00:03:25.520> a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
course of a year but i think he's a

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.550 
course of a year but i think he's a
tremendous<00:03:25.790> quarterback<00:03:26.690> i<00:03:26.720> guess<00:03:27.170> it<00:03:27.320> you

offensively<00:05:35.190> in<00:05:35.610> we<00:05:36.540> were<00:05:36.690> down<00:05:36.900> I<00:05:36.930> think<00:05:37.260> 37

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
offensively in we were down I think 37

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.910 
offensively in we were down I think 37
and<00:05:38.340> nothing<00:05:38.580> that<00:05:38.610> half<00:05:38.850> them<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.770> you<00:05:40.770> know

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
and nothing that half them and you know

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.530 
and nothing that half them and you know
the<00:05:41.160> second<00:05:41.550> half<00:05:41.730> we<00:05:41.940> go<00:05:42.060> out<00:05:42.240> and<00:05:42.270> we<00:05:42.840> we<00:05:43.590> play

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
the second half we go out and we we play

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.180 
the second half we go out and we we play
much<00:05:45.540> better<00:05:45.750> football<00:05:46.230> game<00:05:46.440> for<00:05:46.800> one<00:05:46.980> reason

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
much better football game for one reason

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.990 
much better football game for one reason
or<00:05:47.460> another<00:05:47.550> you<00:05:48.270> know<00:05:48.420> and<00:05:49.580> I'm<00:05:50.580> not<00:05:50.790> going<00:05:50.910> to

or another you know and I'm not going to

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.850 
or another you know and I'm not going to
get<00:05:51.090> into<00:05:51.270> what<00:05:51.630> reason<00:05:52.050> that<00:05:52.200> was<00:05:52.410> or<00:05:52.650> wasn't

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860
