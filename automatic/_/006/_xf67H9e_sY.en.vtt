00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
I'm not sure if my lighting is - let me

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.510 
I'm not sure if my lighting is - let me
see<00:02:14.350> if<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.500> could<00:02:14.680> zoom<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.250> little

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
see if I could zoom it in a little

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.270 
see if I could zoom it in a little
better<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:17.020> there<00:02:17.260> we've<00:02:17.440> created<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.950> swirl

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
better so there we've created the swirl

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.940 
better so there we've created the swirl
in<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.490> middle<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.090> then<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.630> C<00:02:20.350> coming<00:02:20.650> this

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
in the middle and then a C coming this

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.300 
in the middle and then a C coming this
way<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.400> another<00:02:22.090> C<00:02:22.420> coming<00:02:23.350> up<00:02:23.500> over<00:02:24.160> at<00:02:24.250> the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
way and another C coming up over at the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.360 
way and another C coming up over at the
top<00:02:25.080> I'm<00:02:26.080> gonna<00:02:26.320> come<00:02:26.590> up<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.890> little<00:02:27.100> bit

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
top I'm gonna come up a little bit

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.740 
top I'm gonna come up a little bit
higher<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:27.940> turned<00:02:28.209> off<00:02:28.330> my<00:02:28.510> lights

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
higher and I turned off my lights

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.560 
higher and I turned off my lights
hopefully<00:02:29.260> um<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.520> looks<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.970> little<00:02:31.120> bit<00:02:31.390> more

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
hopefully um it looks a little bit more

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.590 
hopefully um it looks a little bit more
clear<00:02:31.989> I'm<00:02:32.680> gonna<00:02:32.890> go<00:02:33.100> around<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:34.090> I'm

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
clear I'm gonna go around and I'm

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.530 
clear I'm gonna go around and I'm
creating<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:35.290> new<00:02:35.320> swirl<00:02:36.030> I'm<00:02:37.030> gonna<00:02:37.209> go<00:02:37.330> all

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
creating a new swirl I'm gonna go all

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.000 
creating a new swirl I'm gonna go all
the<00:02:37.660> way<00:02:37.690> around<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.410> want<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.890> be

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
the way around and I want it to be

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.920 
the way around and I want it to be
pretty<00:02:39.250> spacious<00:02:39.580> just<00:02:40.090> like<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.360> first<00:02:40.660> one

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
pretty spacious just like the first one

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.160 
pretty spacious just like the first one
we<00:02:41.050> created<00:02:42.030> I'm<00:02:43.030> gonna<00:02:43.209> go<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.660> center

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
we created I'm gonna go to the center

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.790 
we created I'm gonna go to the center
I'm<00:02:44.739> gonna<00:02:44.950> bring<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.400> inward<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.470> I'm<00:02:47.650> gonna

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
I'm gonna bring it inward and I'm gonna

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.050 
I'm gonna bring it inward and I'm gonna
go<00:02:47.980> all<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.340> way<00:02:48.370> around<00:02:49.410> all<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.739> way<00:02:50.769> around

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
go all the way around all the way around

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.560 
go all the way around all the way around
create<00:02:52.060> event

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
create event

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.290 
create event
very<00:02:53.530> simple<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.220> do<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.400> little<00:02:54.610> swirl<00:02:55.000> you

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
very simple to do a little swirl you

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.720 
very simple to do a little swirl you
could<00:02:55.480> do<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.720> in<00:02:55.840> sections<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.590> pieces<00:02:57.100> if

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
could do it in sections and in pieces if

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.540 
could do it in sections and in pieces if
that<00:02:58.030> makes<00:02:58.269> it<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.570> little<00:02:58.780> bit<00:02:58.959> easier<00:02:59.550> I'm

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
that makes it a little bit easier I'm

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.930 
that makes it a little bit easier I'm
gonna<00:03:00.700> come<00:03:00.970> down<00:03:01.209> here<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:02.400> I'm<00:03:03.400> gonna<00:03:03.519> start

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
gonna come down here and I'm gonna start

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.990 
gonna come down here and I'm gonna start
another<00:03:04.239> seat<00:03:04.600> so<00:03:05.019> I'm<00:03:05.110> going<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:06.000> connecting

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
another seat so I'm going in connecting

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.759 
another seat so I'm going in connecting
to<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.269> first<00:03:07.570> one<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.050> I'm<00:03:08.170> going<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.440> curl

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
to the first one and I'm going to curl

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.199 
to the first one and I'm going to curl
it<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.390> side<00:03:10.950> I'm<00:03:11.950> gonna<00:03:12.340> come<00:03:12.580> up<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:12.850> the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
it to the side I'm gonna come up to the

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.620 
it to the side I'm gonna come up to the
top<00:03:13.739> area<00:03:14.739> of<00:03:14.890> my<00:03:15.070> swirl<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.760> I'm<00:03:16.269> going<00:03:16.510> to

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
top area of my swirl and I'm going to

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.979 
top area of my swirl and I'm going to
begin<00:03:16.780> another<00:03:17.320> one<00:03:18.300> this<00:03:19.300> is<00:03:19.480> just<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.810> matter

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
begin another one this is just a matter

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.100 
begin another one this is just a matter
of<00:03:20.140> creating<00:03:21.010> several<00:03:21.820> swirls<00:03:22.510> over<00:03:22.989> your

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
of creating several swirls over your

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.479 
of creating several swirls over your
nail<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.380> if<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.769> have<00:03:23.890> short<00:03:24.190> nails<00:03:24.340> just

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
nail and if you have short nails just

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.920 
nail and if you have short nails just
bring<00:03:25.390> those<00:03:25.540> swirls<00:03:25.750> down<00:03:25.959> lower<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
bring those swirls down lower and the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.150 
bring those swirls down lower and the
thing<00:03:29.290> here<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:29.710> to<00:03:29.860> connect

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
thing here is to connect

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.250 
thing here is to connect
all<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.820> swirls<00:03:33.120> with<00:03:33.450> one<00:03:33.660> another<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.140> they

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
all the swirls with one another so they

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.500 
all the swirls with one another so they
could<00:03:34.470> be<00:03:34.620> running<00:03:35.400> alongside<00:03:35.820> each<00:03:36.330> other

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
could be running alongside each other

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.600 
could be running alongside each other
I'm<00:03:36.930> going<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.320> move<00:03:37.440> over<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.710> this<00:03:38.010> side<00:03:38.340> and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
I'm going to move over to this side and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:49.059 
I'm going to move over to this side and
I'm<00:03:39.060> going<00:03:39.240> to<00:03:39.390> begin<00:03:39.510> another<00:03:39.900> swirl

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:57.600 

you
