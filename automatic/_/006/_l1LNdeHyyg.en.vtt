spaceship anytime anywhere I was always

spaceship anytime anywhere I was always
interested<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.390> science<00:00:25.050> fiction<00:00:25.680> and

interested in science fiction and

frankly and was always interested in the
opportunity<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.550> us<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.880> not<00:00:30.060> only<00:00:30.210> send

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
opportunity for us to not only send

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
machines out into deep space but to say

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.090

prior<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.129> had<00:00:38.309> been<00:00:38.430> pretty<00:00:38.670> much<00:00:38.730> an

watched Neil Armstrong take the first
steps<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.059> moon<00:00:45.410> that<00:00:46.410> was<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.219> exciting

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
steps on the moon that was so exciting

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.819 
steps on the moon that was so exciting
at<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.120> time<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.629> know<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:49.289> had<00:00:49.379> no<00:00:49.530> idea<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
at that time you know we had no idea of

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.290 
at that time you know we had no idea of
what<00:00:50.010> was<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.399> happen<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.879> turns<00:00:51.030> out

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
what was going to happen it turns out

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.840 
what was going to happen it turns out
that<00:00:51.480> where<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.410> grew<00:00:52.590> up<00:00:52.620> was<00:00:53.039> over<00:00:53.460> flown<00:00:53.670> by

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
that where I grew up was over flown by

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.790 
that where I grew up was over flown by
military<00:00:54.329> aircraft<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.989> test<00:00:55.199> flights<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
military aircraft on test flights and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.200 
military aircraft on test flights and
mother<00:00:56.250> used<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> take<00:00:56.699> us<00:00:56.850> down<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
mother used to take us down to the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.029 
mother used to take us down to the
flightline<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.989> basically<00:00:58.410> sit<00:00:58.710> right

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
flightline and basically sit right

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
flightline and basically sit right
beneath<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.090> runway<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.109> basically

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
beneath the runway so I can basically

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.039 
beneath the runway so I can basically
just<00:01:01.920> stay<00:01:02.370> there<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.820> four<00:01:03.539> or<00:01:03.570> five<00:01:03.809> hours

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
just stay there for four or five hours

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.299 
just stay there for four or five hours
and<00:01:04.170> watch<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.409> plane's<00:01:04.589> take<00:01:04.799> off<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.159> land

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and watch a plane's take off and land

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
and watch a plane's take off and land
and<00:01:05.600> there<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.689> no<00:01:06.810> better<00:01:06.930> way<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.170> spend<00:01:07.290> my

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and there is no better way to spend my

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.980 
and there is no better way to spend my
free<00:01:07.680> time

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.300 

it's<00:01:16.530> sort<00:01:16.800> of<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.990> community<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.350> people<00:01:19.770> who

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
it's sort of a community of people who

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.270 
it's sort of a community of people who
really<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.770> aerospace<00:01:22.770> engineering<00:01:23.160> is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
really see that aerospace engineering is

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.680 
really see that aerospace engineering is
really<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.580> coolest<00:01:23.910> thing<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.600> of

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
really the coolest thing we do and of

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.720 
really the coolest thing we do and of
course<00:01:24.960> what<00:01:25.890> else<00:01:26.010> could<00:01:26.280> there<00:01:26.490> be

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
course what else could there be

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.850 
course what else could there be
what's<00:01:27.660> cooler<00:01:27.900> than<00:01:28.050> going<00:01:28.290> into<00:01:28.530> aerospace

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
what's cooler than going into aerospace

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.980 
what's cooler than going into aerospace
you<00:01:29.580> get<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.850> see<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.120> whole<00:01:30.270> earth<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> go

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you get to see the whole earth if you go

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.640 
you get to see the whole earth if you go
high<00:01:31.140> enough<00:01:31.280> many<00:01:32.280> places<00:01:32.729> were<00:01:33.650> approached

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
high enough many places were approached

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.609 
high enough many places were approached
a<00:01:35.130> hundred<00:01:35.760> years<00:01:35.970> ago<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.450> create<00:01:37.260> a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
a hundred years ago to create a

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.040 
a hundred years ago to create a
curriculum<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.630> aeronautics<00:01:39.680> but<00:01:40.850> Michigan

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
curriculum in aeronautics but Michigan

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.960 
curriculum in aeronautics but Michigan
really<00:01:43.050> said<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:44.010> this<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.430> an<00:01:44.550> important

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
really said we know this is an important

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.150 
really said we know this is an important
area<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.600> actually<00:01:46.050> seize<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.500> opportunity

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
area and actually seize the opportunity

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.440 
area and actually seize the opportunity
I<00:01:47.280> think<00:01:47.550> we've<00:01:47.729> been<00:01:47.850> doing<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.240> all<00:01:48.420> along

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
I think we've been doing that all along

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.630 
I think we've been doing that all along
it's<00:01:49.140> kind<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.380> indicative<00:01:49.800> of<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it's kind of indicative of the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.370 
it's kind of indicative of the
experimental<00:01:51.330> attitude<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.050> lot<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
experimental attitude that a lot of the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.690 
experimental attitude that a lot of the
professor's<00:01:52.830> have<00:01:53.009> here<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.399> even<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
professor's have here and even the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.790 
professor's have here and even the
students<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.149> well<00:01:54.300> it's<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.320> attitude<00:01:55.470> that

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
students as well it's the attitude that

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.680 
students as well it's the attitude that
you<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.550> approach<00:01:56.880> aerospace<00:01:57.300> engineering

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
you you approach aerospace engineering

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.230 
you you approach aerospace engineering
with<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> hands-on<00:01:58.410> type<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.890> perspective

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
with a hands-on type of perspective

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.389 
with a hands-on type of perspective
students<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.509> come<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:00.960> ask<00:02:01.399> simple

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
students really come in and ask simple

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.160 
students really come in and ask simple
questions<00:02:02.460> sometimes<00:02:03.330> very<00:02:03.720> difficult

should be a leader in education and
research<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:39.200> also<00:04:39.530> hope<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.800> department<00:04:40.340> is

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
research I also hope the department is

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
next hundred years and beyond so that

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.590 
next hundred years and beyond so that
whatever<00:04:45.470> we<00:04:45.740> think<00:04:46.010> is<00:04:46.340> what<00:04:46.729> the<00:04:46.940> world<00:04:47.360> that

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
whatever we think is what the world that

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.719

the 22nd century should be that we're in

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.120 
the 22nd century should be that we're in
a<00:04:49.789> position<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.330> help<00:04:50.479> shape<00:04:50.750> that<00:04:51.020> I<00:04:51.410> can't

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
a position to help shape that I can't

a position to help shape that I can't
think<00:04:52.310> of<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.430> better<00:04:52.690> aerospace<00:04:53.690> engineering

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
think of a better aerospace engineering

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.870 
think of a better aerospace engineering
department<00:04:54.590> in<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:54.710> country<00:04:54.860> frankly<00:04:55.310> not<00:04:55.700> in
