00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
all amplifiers feature this TSI which is

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.700 
all amplifiers feature this TSI which is
shown<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.130> these<00:01:50.369> LEDs<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:52.200> what<00:01:52.590> this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
shown on these LEDs here now what this

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.789 
shown on these LEDs here now what this
does<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.720> stands<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.020> tube<00:01:55.320> status

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
does is it so it stands for tube status

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.430 
does is it so it stands for tube status
indication<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.450> does<00:01:57.600> exactly<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.170> that

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
indication and it does exactly what that

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.210 
indication and it does exactly what that
describes<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.390> analyzing<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:01.320> state<00:02:01.680> and

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
describes it is analyzing the state and

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.090 
describes it is analyzing the state and
tubes<00:02:02.460> at<00:02:02.640> all<00:02:02.759> times<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.360> power<00:02:04.020> tubes<00:02:04.289> and

tubes at all times the power tubes and
then<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.520> or<00:02:05.610> indicate<00:02:06.000> if<00:02:06.180> there's<00:02:06.450> any

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.250 
there not biased properly or variable
reasonable<00:02:13.319> rate<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.450> my<00:02:15.450> turn<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.780> stand<00:02:16.020> by

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
reasonable rate and my turn to stand by

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.809 
reasonable rate and my turn to stand by
that<00:02:16.290> shows<00:02:16.800> when<00:02:17.130> they're<00:02:17.340> when<00:02:17.580> they're<00:02:17.610> not

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
that shows when they're when they're not

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.990 
that shows when they're when they're not
being<00:02:17.970> used<00:02:18.090> then<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.200> babies<00:02:19.680> are<00:02:19.830> red<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.640> if

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
being used then the babies are red so if

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.640 
being used then the babies are red so if
there's<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.360> fault<00:02:21.660> then<00:02:22.050> one<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.350> these<00:02:22.470> would

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
there's a fault then one of these would

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.699 
there's a fault then one of these would
go<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.920> red<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:24.120> can't<00:02:24.540> make<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:25.050> go<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.440> fault

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
go to red I can't make it go to a fault

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.220 
go to red I can't make it go to a fault
mode<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.519> so<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.180> have<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.510> take<00:02:27.690> word<00:02:27.959> for<00:02:28.170> it

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
mode and so you have to take word for it

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.949 
mode and so you have to take word for it
but<00:02:28.410> yeah<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.739> fact<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.160> go<00:02:29.280> raisins

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
but yeah the fact that we go raisins

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.410 
but yeah the fact that we go raisins
between<00:02:30.959> stem<00:02:31.170> ion<00:02:31.500> shows<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.970> sensing

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
expect to juggle the TSI any days and

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.170 
expect to juggle the TSI any days and

then all the rear panels is like the

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.030 
then all the rear panels is like the

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
same as their as the classic so you've

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.839 
same as their as the classic so you've
got<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.340> same

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
yeah arguably it makes it a little bit

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.040 
yeah arguably it makes it a little bit
more<00:06:31.640> versatile<00:06:32.120> as<00:06:32.270> well<00:06:32.420> because<00:06:32.600> you<00:06:32.720> you

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
more versatile as well because you you

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:43.140 
more versatile as well because you you
