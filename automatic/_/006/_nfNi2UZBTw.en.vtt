00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.519
 if there is something to highlight in the last 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.200
 five years 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.840
 it is the quantity the investment quality 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.939
 in infrastructure apart from that 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.169
 has advanced in a first stage of a 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.710
 very important infrastructure of 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.869
 market and the amount of investment of 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.669
 millions of dollars that surpass the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.320
 we corrected a mistake but around 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:38.660
 of 25-30 in pinion equipment the last 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.430
 five years that before did not exist then 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.909
 they are millions of dollars have been invested 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.819
 in cold equipment in providing development 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.280
 to our customers fundamentally to 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:50.750
 Warehouses Warehouses a series of 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.090
 teams 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.700
 of extra exhibitors so they have the 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.230
 space to show then that for 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.690
 the products that is part of this 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.190
 infrastructure second chapter of 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.699
 infrastructure and infrastructure 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.490
 production nowadays we can 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.649
 as a global coke that I speak to you as 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.619
 a coca-cola system be proud of 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:16.939
 count in Peru with one of the mega 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:20.380
 most modern plants in Latin America 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.380
 and this one is in trujillo 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.049
 2010 the first truth was of 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.950
 repower the plant that we have in the 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.899
 Callao that by location of both is 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.490
 well located but I was still with 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.720
 equipment a little old between 2010 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.490
 have been imagining repowering 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.460
 plants that we had as arequipa and 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.220
 as quiet what is the floor of 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.110
 trujillo the mega plant of trujillo is 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.850
 that we inaugurated last year that we 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.689
 allowed for example to close two floors 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.670
 in the north 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.009
 we had an old trujillo and one in 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.120
 sullana those could not be closed to 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.430
 root of this new plant that we saw 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.350
 and this plant is better to say that it is 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.210
 a land of 20 hectares of which 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.340
 female we are today using only the 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.740
 half the next media project 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.150
 Pucusana plant is because we have 60 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.250
 hectares where we would also see here 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.170
 initially only a part what 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.820
 would do the pucusana is allow close 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.440
 the plant of the rímac that is the most 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.980
 old where we have fulfilled the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.350
 103 years that the company has with 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.030
 which Lima would be with Pucusana and with the 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.760
 from Callao and in the south we all have to 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.440
 define what is the final plan in your 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.700
 moment if there was talk of being one 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.350
 great half plant for all the south 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.340
 we have to go evaluating really 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.530
 because the south has certain 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.350
 complexities this more infrastructure 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.300
 vial geography is also making 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.100
 growths in other parts of the south 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.780
 that when the plan was made they were not seen 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.460
 as potential market growth 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.780
 today they are seeing the plan then 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.090
 Southern teacher we still lack 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.920
 define what the final photo is and we 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.330
 they talk about that we have that digit that 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.070
 that is a plant that also has a 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.260
 strategic role for the location that 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.420
 has gives you a level of competitiveness 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.010
 before the topics of the climates for example 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.280
 when you can not access the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.280
 cell 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.430
 the area of ​​specialization in engineering 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.590
 of corporation and law gets in touch 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.380
 with the Coca-Cola engineers company 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.350
 and I also remember clearly that we were 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.780
 of visiting to see some facilities in 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.600
 Spain and we went to see an installation in 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.060
 hungary in budapest and technical people 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.020
 I do not lie to them, or whether they were due to 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.540
 visit 15 countries to know better 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.330
 best practices facilities where 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:35.980
 Coca-Cola having this global system 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.980
 well but I do not want to sin of old age 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.360
 as it is said arrogant but the 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.250
 amount you have to be able to see 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.140
 It is probably unique as it accompanies 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.990
 this new vision of the country forward the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.910
 bar is to help in improving the 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.290
 organizational capabilities that 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.320
 finally what is happening in Peru 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.970
 today it has passed as a dynamic of evolution 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.190
 of industry and socioeconomic in another 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.070
 part of the world at another time and there it is 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.540
 expertise that has it is cocacola theme 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.890
 this is to provide us eg travel 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.660
 as humberto says to know other 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.860
 operations learn things that also 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.990
 they have arrived but that probably what 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.670
 that comes to you or develop skills and 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.500
 knowledge that still here is not 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.390
 developed because it has not been handled and 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.860
 I am that is a contribution this quite 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.780
 important and that in addition to one with 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.510
 kicker to definitely feel that 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.560
 If you are part of a large network, what 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.150
 that we have as conventions 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.070
 bottlers are exchanged many 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.140
 experiences between ones and others I think that 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.100
 there are many there is much to share 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.100
 Press knowledge
