00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
I'm here with another C++ program that I

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.099 
I'm here with another C++ program that I
just<00:00:06.299> created

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
just created

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.530

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
anyways this program that I made here is

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.599 
anyways this program that I made here is
a<00:00:15.000> game<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> game<00:00:16.619> called<00:00:16.650> hangman

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
a game and it is a game called hangman

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.730 
a game and it is a game called hangman
this<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> little<00:00:18.840> enter<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.230> made<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.680> I

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
this is a little enter that I made and I

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.980 
this is a little enter that I made and I
just<00:00:19.770> had<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.039> do<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.369> confusing<00:00:20.760> way<00:00:20.970> um<00:00:21.300> but

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
just had to do it a confusing way um but

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.640 
just had to do it a confusing way um but
anyways

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
yeah it's pretty much the game of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.269 
yeah it's pretty much the game of
hangman<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.930> or<00:00:25.050> two<00:00:25.199> players<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.830> person

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
hangman it's or two players one person

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.910 
hangman it's or two players one person
types<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.180> word<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:28.050> then<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.289> next<00:00:28.619> person

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
types in a word and then the next person

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.290 
types in a word and then the next person
has<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.189> guess<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.640> they<00:00:29.699> only<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:30.029> six

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
has to guess and they only have six

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.630 
has to guess and they only have six
lives<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.779> guess<00:00:31.099> if<00:00:32.099> they<00:00:32.250> don't<00:00:32.430> guess<00:00:32.610> it

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
lives to guess if they don't guess it

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.479 
lives to guess if they don't guess it
within<00:00:32.850> those<00:00:33.059> six<00:00:33.300> lives<00:00:33.570> then<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.469> game<00:00:34.920> is

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
within those six lives then the game is

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.270 
within those six lives then the game is
over<00:00:35.850> they<00:00:36.360> lose<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.649> tells<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> word

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
over they lose and it tells you the word

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.790 
over they lose and it tells you the word
that<00:00:38.550> was<00:00:38.700> originally<00:00:39.210> entered<00:00:39.649> so<00:00:40.649> it's

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
that was originally entered so it's

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.260 
that was originally entered so it's
pretty<00:00:41.040> cool<00:00:41.399> let's<00:00:41.610> go<00:00:41.760> ahead<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.090> run<00:00:42.210> it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
pretty cool let's go ahead and run it
