00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.940
 youtube I am dissatisfied I resent 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.280
 Welcome to this gameplay 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.220
 completely live halo 4 flag 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.990
 graph back in Spanish is called bolsa de 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.500
 flags nonsense yes and good to do it 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.820
 the law 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.200
 Chuck Norris and for the new 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.060
 writers wonder what each host is 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.070
 the wing chuck norris is very simple is 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.450
 play the first game of the new 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.320
 playlists that take out the 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.060
 garbage from 343 industries so so 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.610
 is the first game evidently touched 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.110
 to cruyff and really always tried 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.420
 get me nothing from there more or less 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.370
 decent I'm not the best player in the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.079
 world but sometimes I took out game is 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.540
 more or less good decent as I said 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.460
 so that's the point of the point 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.110
 Lazio flowers usually let me know 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.680
 by twitter on facebook but in this 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.200
 occasion the little message did not appear 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.300
 that the master's collection was 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.339
 chief and I do not know how much the image of 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.350
 this playlist of when it comes out and 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.900
 also how was all this success 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.180
 of these things my 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.280
 facebook and twitter tray 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.170
 then I did not find the ones that every time 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.140
 is that broker ivÃ¡n from there I did not find 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.080
 the fucked 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.280
 There were very few messages and I decided better 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.550
 do not put any because if not after 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.140
 they were going to bother and here I already know them 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.700
 so you and I to all those who 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.640
 tell where is elisa walk the truth 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.550
 they were quite as I said in this series 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.320
 Many like to tell me 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.580
 to come out in the video but then in this 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.200
 occasion are enough and not to cause 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.479
 differences and that kind of thing prefer 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.909
 better not here down there is a good art 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.890
 a good one and the one that you have preferred not to put 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.619
 no one for if the doubts so that no 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.200
 there is here that there is a law I tell you 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.060
 I sent it is a garbage I have then in 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.369
 twitter 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.470
 and you did not listen to me then for the better 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.750
 avoid that is by markit to avoid 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.380
 That better because nobody comes that 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.630
 rockets rockets flag to that is very 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.000
 strange 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.100
 come, come alone, I think I have 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.390
 I do not know much 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.390
 and I do not know in fact 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.010
 is down I here there are no skills 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.830
 armor only run you run 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.849
 as if it were in a call of duty with the 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.239
 sic left and nothing else but no no 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:35.060
 family or weird skills I do not know 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.950
 it would have happened to a fucking game of 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.810
 flags and rockets why 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.670
 obviously if you bring equipment like almost 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.519
 all halo playlists 4 and in 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.440
 general halo is easy but if not 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.239
 you bring equipment like right now 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.260
 is happening I do not know what the fuck 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:55.330
 It was that guy like nothing because they fuck you 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.660
 easily so look at your guy already going to 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.660
 to put 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.040
 this first death to double death 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.319
 It's too much for our flag 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.709
 us appearing down here to the 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.709
 beast 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.860
 pray trash 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.180
 but if you meet guys who do not 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.620
 They know how to play because I think if you 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.810
 you find guys who always use the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.980
 rock of ok more or less and they know the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.380
 rock 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.710
 that you 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.569
 only a mega monk 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.090
 I follow that I have 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.380
 because to some extent it's easy with 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.540
 the rocket 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.990
 you have to have as much technique as with 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.990
 other weapons 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.330
 Refill this garbage pass me the flag I 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.330
 I'm going to put it 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:59.840
 come on let's go let's be ready 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.840
 very good I super loaded there 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.290
 I think it's not so bad at all good 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.600
 are these types of lists that depend on 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.850
 your team if you touch a team like this all 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.920
 I think that it is the worst list of 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.390
 game that may be in halo but if you 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.390
 he plays in a more or less normal team 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.810
 exit seconds locate it exit as 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.810
 normal 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.730
 is where you are down here 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:42.880
 and that guy who is this crap that says 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.830
 because it's the worst thing that recruits is in fact 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.590
 the ex termination but not 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.660
 who recruits this guy 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.760
 Let's see 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.680
 like this one 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.810
 Now I have got back behind 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.729
 here this can help me are 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.770
 doing 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:06.560
 because it's at five flags because yes 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:10.120
 is to the three flags it would be very little 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.800
 strong two goods to double those ballasts 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.650
 and how they saw the victory 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.730
 navas getting into the flag because in fact 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.560
 they put it at the end which in the end 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.810
 I got when they killed my company it or 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.580
 be almost almost steal and his last 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.530
 doubles death there was quite but as 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.410
 good is is good is good list of 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.150
 I liked the game but if I recommend them 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.860
 completely that they play with equipment 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.740
 because I think that right now I was lucky 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.169
 a little bit of that I played in more team or 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.790
 less decent then if I had 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.020
 I touched a computer has downloaded the 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.610
 saint marc if I had touched a 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.860
 team more trash very well tucked a rap 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.320
 that I killed you to tithe and twice that 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.479
 they give the noise of more 8 pretty 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.060
 well good higher here really 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.190
 also in my account as almost 1 game 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.230
 halo 4 in fact nothing else game when 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.330
 recorded in general 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.070
 Well, he does not have much skill 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.800
 then it touched me in types pretty much 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.150
 half recruits then well just 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.040
 start that good games here 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.690
 then, nothing says about subscribe 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.850
 little fingers up follows me on the networks 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:16.310
 social that all the links are here 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.310
