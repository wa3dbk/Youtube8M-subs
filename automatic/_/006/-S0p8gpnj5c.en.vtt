exact<00:01:54.759> pattern<00:01:55.090> I<00:01:55.509> just<00:01:55.990> use<00:01:56.139> a<00:01:56.170> different

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
exact pattern I just use a different

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
hook size and different yarn so you can

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.550 
hook size and different yarn so you can
see<00:02:00.969> the<00:02:01.149> size<00:02:01.420> difference<00:02:01.450> but<00:02:02.229> it's<00:02:02.380> the

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
see the size difference but it's the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.649 
see the size difference but it's the
same<00:02:02.859> exact<00:02:03.369> pattern<00:02:03.639> so<00:02:04.359> we're<00:02:04.509> going<00:02:04.600> to

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
same exact pattern so we're going to

going to put a slip knot on our hook

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.310 
going to put a slip knot on our hook
like<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:18.940> flower<00:02:19.210> is<00:02:19.780> worked<00:02:20.140> in

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
like that and this flower is worked in

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.620 
like that and this flower is worked in
the<00:02:20.440> round<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.600> you're<00:02:22.600> going<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.780> make<00:02:22.990> two

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
the round and you're going to make two

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.660 
the round and you're going to make two
I<00:02:23.720> mean<00:02:24.080> alternatively<00:02:24.740> you<00:02:25.130> could<00:02:25.280> just<00:02:25.490> make

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
I mean alternatively you could just make

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.850 
I mean alternatively you could just make
one<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.840> kind<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.200> look<00:02:27.380> like<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.870> it's

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
one just kind of look like that so it's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.200 
one just kind of look like that so it's
totally<00:02:31.250> up<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.810> make<00:02:32.930> our<00:02:33.050> flower

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210

we're going to join our circle with a

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.140 
we're going to join our circle with a
slip<00:04:15.800> stitch<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.720> close<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.930> up<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:19.000> then<00:04:20.000> you

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
slip stitch to close it up and then you

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.230 
slip stitch to close it up and then you
can<00:04:20.359> give<00:04:20.510> this<00:04:20.690> some<00:04:21.049> tail<00:04:21.739> here<00:04:22.220> if<00:04:22.820> you<00:04:22.940> flip

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
can give this some tail here if you flip

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.430 
can give this some tail here if you flip
it<00:04:23.330> over<00:04:23.830> as<00:04:24.830> i<00:04:25.070> worked<00:04:25.430> i<00:04:25.850> also<00:04:26.450> crocheted

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
it over as i worked i also crocheted

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.710 
it over as i worked i also crocheted
this<00:04:27.770> tail<00:04:28.100> in<00:04:28.400> i<00:04:28.700> wrapped<00:04:29.210> it<00:04:29.390> around<00:04:29.450> the

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
this tail in i wrapped it around the

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.100 
this tail in i wrapped it around the
tail<00:04:29.930> as<00:04:30.110> well<00:04:30.140> and<00:04:30.770> that<00:04:31.100> weaves<00:04:31.880> it<00:04:32.180> in<00:04:32.330> that

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
tail as well and that weaves it in that

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.240 
tail as well and that weaves it in that
way<00:04:33.200> you<00:04:33.290> don't<00:04:33.440> have<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.710> do<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:33.919> later<00:04:34.100> it

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
way you don't have to do it later it

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.280 
way you don't have to do it later it
saves<00:04:34.490> a<00:04:34.640> ton<00:04:34.790> of<00:04:34.850> time<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.750> i<00:04:35.780> just<00:04:35.960> give<00:04:36.169> this

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
saves a ton of time so i just give this

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.420 
saves a ton of time so i just give this
a<00:04:36.350> pole

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
a pole

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.510 
a pole
you<00:04:37.880> can<00:04:38.030> trim<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.420> back<00:04:38.480> later<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.520> then

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
you can trim that back later and then

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.580 
you can trim that back later and then

we're gonna chain one and then in each

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.250 
we're gonna chain one and then in each
space<00:04:48.620> this<00:04:49.550> is<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:49.790> space<00:04:50.360> not<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.990> stitch
