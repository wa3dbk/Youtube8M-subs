00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
of elements to it my only concern with

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.950 
of elements to it my only concern with
the<00:00:50.400> case<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.970> whether<00:00:51.330> or<00:00:51.570> not<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.810> little

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the case was whether or not the little

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.480 
the case was whether or not the little
candies<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.470> stuff<00:00:52.830> would<00:00:52.980> fall<00:00:53.190> off<00:00:53.220> because

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
candies and stuff would fall off because

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.430 
candies and stuff would fall off because
then<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.790> would<00:00:53.970> look<00:00:54.210> ugly<00:00:54.570> right<00:00:54.720> so<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
then that would look ugly right so the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.350 
then that would look ugly right so the
brown<00:00:55.650> around<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.460> chocolate<00:00:56.880> and<00:00:57.300> then

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
brown around it is chocolate and then

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360 
brown around it is chocolate and then
the<00:00:57.510> white<00:00:57.750> part<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.500> whipped<00:00:59.040> cream<00:00:59.130> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the white part is a whipped cream and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.270 
the white part is a whipped cream and
it's<00:00:59.550> actually<00:00:59.730> soft<00:01:00.450> the<00:01:01.110> little<00:01:01.710> candy<00:01:02.100> some

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it's actually soft the little candy some

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.800 
it's actually soft the little candy some
of<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.460> little<00:01:02.610> candies<00:01:02.970> are<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.450> soft

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
of the little candies are actually soft

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.080 
of the little candies are actually soft
they're<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.320> hard<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.070> thought<00:01:05.100> some<00:01:05.969> of

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
they're not hard as I thought some of

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.490 
they're not hard as I thought some of
them<00:01:06.179> are<00:01:06.240> hard<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:06.929> feel<00:01:07.170> pretty

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
them are hard but they feel pretty

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
sturdy so far so good nothing has really

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.520 
sturdy so far so good nothing has really
fallen<00:01:10.320> off<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.640> piece<00:01:11.789> right<00:01:12.390> here<00:01:12.659> has

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
can't just use my thumb because there's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.840 
can't just use my thumb because there's
not<00:01:52.350> enough<00:01:52.409> space<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:53.130> me<00:01:53.249> to<00:01:53.399> get<00:01:53.549> into<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
not enough space for me to get into the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.609 
not enough space for me to get into the
corner<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.389> know<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.840> iPhone<00:01:55.200> 5<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
corner and you know the iPhone 5 is a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.789 
corner and you know the iPhone 5 is a
little<00:01:55.889> bit<00:01:55.979> narrower<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.850> uh<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.590> a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
little bit narrower and uh it's just a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.139 
little bit narrower and uh it's just a
little<00:01:59.039> bit<00:01:59.130> different<00:01:59.670> than<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.030> other

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
little bit different than the other

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.359 
little bit different than the other
iphones<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:01.229> whatever<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.859> came<00:02:02.159> with<00:02:02.340> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
iphones but whatever it came with a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.830 
iphones but whatever it came with a
funny<00:02:02.819> smell<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.270> don't<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:03.509> if<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
funny smell I don't know if it's the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.820 
funny smell I don't know if it's the
glue<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:05.490> smell<00:02:05.789> is<00:02:05.939> kind<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.359> wearing

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
glue the smell is kind of wearing

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.020 
glue the smell is kind of wearing
I<00:02:06.890> don't<00:02:07.100> know<00:02:07.190> if<00:02:07.280> it's<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.520> glue<00:02:07.730> or<00:02:08.000> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
I don't know if it's the glue or the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.520 
I don't know if it's the glue or the
packaging<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.930> was<00:02:09.020> in<00:02:09.140> it's<00:02:09.290> a<00:02:09.350> very

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
packaging that it was in it's a very

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.050 
packaging that it was in it's a very
strong<00:02:09.860> scent<00:02:10.220> like<00:02:10.400> when<00:02:10.580> I'm<00:02:10.670> on<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.820> phone

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
strong scent like when I'm on the phone

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.930 
strong scent like when I'm on the phone
I<00:02:11.330> can<00:02:11.540> smell<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:12.050> that<00:02:12.740> kind<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.220> bothers<00:02:13.700> me

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
I can smell it that kind of bothers me

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.200 
I can smell it that kind of bothers me
but<00:02:14.540> it's<00:02:14.810> slowly<00:02:15.170> going<00:02:15.740> away<00:02:16.010> I'm<00:02:16.640> assuming

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
but it's slowly going away I'm assuming

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.580 
but it's slowly going away I'm assuming
it's<00:02:17.270> probably<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.630> glue<00:02:17.780> or<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:17.990> bonding

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
it's probably the glue or the bonding

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.010 
it's probably the glue or the bonding
that<00:02:18.740> they<00:02:18.890> used<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.250> put<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.520> candies<00:02:19.940> on<00:02:20.150> but

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
that they used to put the candies on but

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.720 
that they used to put the candies on but
yeah<00:02:21.440> other<00:02:21.470> than<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.160> don't<00:02:22.280> have<00:02:22.520> any

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
yeah other than that I don't have any

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.250
