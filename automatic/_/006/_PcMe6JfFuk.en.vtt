00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
at all for a lot of reasons mainly

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.650 
at all for a lot of reasons mainly
because<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.320> range<00:00:44.239> you'd<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.539> get

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
because just the range you'd have to get

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.130 
because just the range you'd have to get
in<00:00:45.840> very<00:00:45.870> very<00:00:46.440> close<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.160> use<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:49.010> mean

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
in very very close to use this I mean

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.910 
in very very close to use this I mean
offensively<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.320> defensively<00:00:53.059> um<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.680> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
offensively or defensively um you know I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.369 
offensively or defensively um you know I
can<00:00:56.219> foresee<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.210> maybe<00:00:57.600> if<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.230> get

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
can foresee you know maybe if you get

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.569 
can foresee you know maybe if you get
knocked<00:00:58.559> down<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.309> all<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.550> can

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
knocked down and this is all you can

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.200 
knocked down and this is all you can
grab<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.840> grab<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.879> hit<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> guy

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
grab and you grab it you hit the guy

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.850 
grab and you grab it you hit the guy
who's<00:01:03.480> attacking<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> few<00:01:04.290> times<00:01:04.439> maybe

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
cut them up a little bit you know yet

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.920 
cut them up a little bit you know yet
great<00:01:07.760> but<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.330> need<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.630> run<00:01:09.810> away

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
great but then you just need to run away

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.050 
great but then you just need to run away
I'd<00:01:10.350> actually<00:01:10.950> rather<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.580> run<00:01:11.820> away

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
I'd actually rather just run away

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820 
I'd actually rather just run away
instead<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.600> trying<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.990> use<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> defend

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
instead of trying to use this to defend

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.880 
instead of trying to use this to defend
my<00:01:13.979> life<00:01:15.080> that's<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> only<00:01:16.500> foreseeable

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
my life that's the only foreseeable

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.149 
my life that's the only foreseeable
instance<00:01:17.580> where<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.790> could<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.619> using<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.950> in

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
instance where I could see using this in

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.230 
instance where I could see using this in
a<00:01:20.430> defensive<00:01:22.009> role<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.430> know<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.060> should

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
a defensive role you know as it should

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.370 
a defensive role you know as it should
be<00:01:24.420> used<00:01:25.790> this<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.150> means<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.570> an<00:01:27.630> end<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
be used this just a means to an end and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.010 
be used this just a means to an end and
the<00:01:28.770> end<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.180> running<00:01:30.180> away<00:01:30.420> with<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.750> knife

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the end is running away with this knife

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.940 
the end is running away with this knife
you<00:01:31.259> know<00:01:31.409> um<00:01:33.110> having<00:01:34.110> said<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.920> a

great utility EDC knife I've carried
this<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.790> about<00:01:39.950> about<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> year<00:01:41.310> next<00:01:41.549> week<00:01:41.820> or

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
this for about about a year next week or

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.160 
this for about about a year next week or
so<00:01:42.680> give<00:01:43.680> or<00:01:43.710> take<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.490> love<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.600> got<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
so give or take I love it I got it

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.859 
so give or take I love it I got it
because<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.640> small<00:01:47.970> low<00:01:48.360> profile

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
because it's just so small low profile

you can easily cut with this side of the
blade<00:01:52.049> whip<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.460> easily<00:01:53.700> cut<00:01:54.600> with<00:01:54.990> this

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
blade whip you can easily cut with this

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.289 
blade whip you can easily cut with this
portion<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> blade<00:01:55.890> which<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.189> about<00:01:56.369> 3/8

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
portion of the blade which is about 3/8

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.300 
portion of the blade which is about 3/8
of<00:01:57.450> an<00:01:57.570> inch<00:01:57.659> long<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.530> serrated<00:01:59.070> it's

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
of an inch long it's not serrated it's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.550 
of an inch long it's not serrated it's
very<00:01:59.579> very<00:01:59.790> sharp<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.329> do<00:02:00.810> fine<00:02:01.110> work<00:02:01.320> like

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
very very sharp you do fine work like

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.069 
very very sharp you do fine work like
this<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.759> solve<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.420> serrated<00:02:03.689> part

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
this you can solve the serrated part

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.510 
this you can solve the serrated part
like<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> lot<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.009> force<00:02:05.310> behind

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
like this and get a lot of force behind

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.419 
like this and get a lot of force behind
that<00:02:05.909> also<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:07.259> use<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:08.009> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that also you can use it like this and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.150 
that also you can use it like this and
then

role is just a utility EDC knife um but
I<00:05:47.789> mean<00:05:48.139> it<00:05:49.139> can<00:05:49.830> be<00:05:49.860> a<00:05:50.279> very<00:05:51.210> very<00:05:51.419> lethal

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
I mean it can be a very very lethal

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.290 
I mean it can be a very very lethal
thing<00:05:52.680> but<00:05:53.159> also<00:05:53.310> you<00:05:53.759> know<00:05:53.849> if<00:05:54.150> you're
