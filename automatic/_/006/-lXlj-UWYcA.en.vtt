in a couple of seconds your mullet has

in a couple of seconds your mullet has
turned<00:02:16.739> into<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.280> pink<00:02:17.670> one<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.819> should

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
turned into a pink one so this should

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.880 
turned into a pink one so this should
work<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.569> all<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.109> your<00:02:22.319> hat<00:02:23.099> needs<00:02:23.640> or<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:25.319> the

work for all of your hat needs or in the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
sake of the camera berry my luck wears

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.649 
sake of the camera berry my luck wears
and<00:02:27.719> this<00:02:27.810> might<00:02:27.989> like<00:02:28.260> turn<00:02:28.609> very<00:02:29.609> bright<00:02:30.420> and

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
and this might like turn very bright and

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.339 
and this might like turn very bright and
whatnot<00:02:30.959> but<00:02:31.680> at<00:02:31.829> least<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.400> mullet<00:02:33.349> this

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
whatnot but at least for the mullet this

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.020 
whatnot but at least for the mullet this
technique<00:02:34.859> works<00:02:35.159> so<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.150> would<00:02:36.599> think<00:02:36.629> that

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
technique works so I would think that

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.080 
technique works so I would think that
the<00:02:39.030> same<00:02:39.329> thing<00:02:39.389> work<00:02:39.989> for<00:02:40.489> many<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.909> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
the same thing work for many of the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.080 
the same thing work for many of the
other<00:02:42.120> hats<00:02:42.950> at<00:02:43.950> least<00:02:44.189> now<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.760> get<00:02:44.939> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
other hats at least now you can get the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.140 
other hats at least now you can get the
mullets<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.599> a<00:02:46.079> nice<00:02:46.290> pink<00:02:46.680> color<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.519> if<00:02:48.000> we

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
mullets and a nice pink color so if we

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.550 
mullets and a nice pink color so if we
wanted<00:02:48.419> to<00:02:48.480> change<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.900> color<00:02:49.079> again<00:02:49.139> we

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
wanted to change the color again we

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.970 
wanted to change the color again we
could<00:02:49.680> do<00:02:49.799> muscle<00:02:50.250> man<00:02:50.609> or<00:02:50.909> muscle<00:02:51.359> man<00:02:51.480> Brown

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
could do muscle man or muscle man Brown

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.379 
could do muscle man or muscle man Brown
so<00:02:52.980> I'll<00:02:53.099> just<00:02:53.250> copy<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:54.030> most<00:02:54.239> well-known
