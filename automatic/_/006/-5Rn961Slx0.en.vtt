00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.729
 ken 200mm a month after you have to pay a license about 8% 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.240

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.050
 and you do a little shop after that you're going to have the app 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.120
 Mass speed you will have beat sms 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020
 Thursday it was the audience at his service 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.310
 to add safe functions 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.580
 on sending sms 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.449
 so you are you will have something 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.600
 you have appeared 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.670
 like the one that's not going that way 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.210
 so there you have settings on two wheels 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.630
 unfortunately not send sms so you are here for the settings 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.830
 by the way, it gives you 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.680
 his training on them the license that we have so you're going to pay the license and 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.220

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.220
 accounts the coast and everything and everything that's all 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.240
 after you can send your sms either not pitt sms or by the operator 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.410
 so to send sms by bit sms you have to have 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.770
 Swiss credit 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.990
 you have to have credit you have to buy so you have in bye 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.630
 and the sms or the prices are to this network nas white approximately so 4 euros 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.330
 for 50 cm to his duty 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
 I think we can do more 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.850
 especially I do not have to go over time 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.310
 so here you can send for four or five years sms 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.329
 the bulls are five to six masses fr we bought more 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.479
 you have free sms like the 80 euros you have a thousand 200 sms 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.519
 and 201 semester poster is about 6 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.519
 although this hundredth the the sms 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:20.889
 after the mentalist 106 8 euros saint-quentin 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.339
 could pay by paypal by bank cards correct 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.839
 after he talks about the package we have to our project unlimited plan 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.839
 the number of scenes that we sent previously 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.539
 here 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:34.320
 we see that people find that what is 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.569
 cat provides afp the functions 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.849
 sending sme shows that what his quick answers if m 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.979
 orientation not needed 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.979
 discretion at the cei to have information about the draftsman 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.349
 if you want to have 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.129
 so if you want him to post message to parents no text this is the 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.519
 message the displayed name is like the other and the echo alert is 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.229
 the second 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:59.779
 it 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.300
 after an ultimate signature what are six nations 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.949
 in fact what you write in e 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.019
 anything I think is playable 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.299
 and percent when 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.650
 you write a message 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.650
 johanne am always at the end 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.639
 when they are all the foufous the current application the name of 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.329
 the application they get lost 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.519
 who is paying on the cydia store about 1 euro 30 that can correct 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.219
 mistakes 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.289
 so that if you have it activate 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.289
 either he is so close to sowing and drawings and everything 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.289
 what a funny thing huh 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:35.639
 acknowledgment of receipt it's dead 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.689
 to see if your ten senators got the message 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.949
 lock by simple security code ans for them if you want 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.459
 not that people are reviewing or sms that you have sent all 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.200
 image kontakt it's for them 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.809
 show% 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:53.399
 lol the contact photo of the disk intervene 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.069
 legislator towers 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.849
 or not so 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.849
 and you have finished costs at home whatever you want you 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.569
 more given some examples 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.329
 for example there I sell an unlock I do not want to 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.469
 bothering me go into the messages application 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:12.559
 so you need 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.559
 tap the volume is no longer safe sleeve then on more sub 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:20.019
 more and you want something like those who want his loss no matter 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.099
 so not these designers my ancestors door to door 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.060
 and as you see the jouanne so the signature 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.069
 any child 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:28.930
 so the game 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.930
 some sites 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.520
 for you can you send us so send you 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.319
 why it comes out 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.530
 so it's a son like that 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.670
 portable what shocks he will have the answer very clear 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.670
 the oldest action of the true that's why I want that's all 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.559
 and why pessacais just press the red cross 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.789
 just here 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.380
 Finally you can also send your sms depending on what you are doing 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.849
 make a game for when you are on an application presents sunday m 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.419
 here I do not want qt the application mostly nothing 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.020
 this is enough since on the volume alas to press three fast lanes 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:15.930
 rapid dispatch 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.210
 that's the same thing that's going to go wrong 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.820
 to classify the same things to do so type turns and also 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.469
 for example open his accounts 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:29.839
 it's actually when you open you have all the sms that you sent 

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.039
 previously 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.520
 at your death intervening as the laptop 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.520
 so they show all the sms we sent 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.430
 and then afterwards called to observe knowledge 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.430
 apple had appropriated the draftsman 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.580
 so the look is everything I think private 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.949
 quite fast 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.939
 you can also send your messages to this message 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.409
 so the 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.980
 you find that the sites they display the 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.980
 many plans this about too well 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.059
 m sms that you are describing and the number of letters that 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:09.830
 you used 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.830
 but its cost 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.529
 not much 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.550
 in short, the French hierarchy 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.719
 out of 5,954 with them 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.489
 rainville to shoot a year and after a side sense rent 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.259
 a text message 26% 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.219
 rescue 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.979
 we have the quality the principle a little 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.059
 not very good 

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:33.059
 so there it's really not bad for those who have passed massimi earth 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.090
 you want to know how much I sent you 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.949
 and how much is left 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:38.760
 e 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.750
 to be to send by SMS or two semesters with this buyers here is 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.490
 that's all 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.530
 no it was game 67 7 to talk to you about the application of the stationary 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.960
 only for not women 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.069
 of course 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.410
