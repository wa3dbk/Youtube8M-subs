00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
and just show you know how that works so

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.649 
and just show you know how that works so

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
we can see that when we set up the tent

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.969 
we can see that when we set up the tent
we<00:03:54.810> just<00:03:55.019> need<00:03:55.139> to<00:03:55.229> simply<00:03:55.530> wrap<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:55.919> around

these on the poles on the side here and
that's<00:04:05.310> where<00:04:05.489> our<00:04:05.519> guy<00:04:05.759> lanes<00:04:06.030> are<00:04:06.180> attached

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:06.509 
that's where our guy lanes are attached

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.780 
that's where our guy lanes are attached
what<00:04:07.259> we<00:04:07.379> do<00:04:07.500> need<00:04:07.889> to<00:04:07.919> do<00:04:08.129> is<00:04:08.310> take<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.609> guide

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
what we do need to do is take the guide

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.159 
what we do need to do is take the guide
lines<00:04:09.000> out<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.299> peg<00:04:09.449> them<00:04:09.659> into<00:04:09.930> place<00:04:10.139> and

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
lines out and peg them into place and

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.449 
lines out and peg them into place and
what<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.650> does<00:04:10.799> is<00:04:10.949> it<00:04:11.069> pulls<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.400> entire

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
what that does is it pulls the entire

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.399 
what that does is it pulls the entire
flight<00:04:12.030> sheet<00:04:12.269> against<00:04:12.659> a<00:04:12.750> frame<00:04:12.959> of<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.139> tent

flight sheet against a frame of the tent

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:14.719 
flight sheet against a frame of the tent
going<00:04:13.919> to<00:04:13.979> make<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.189> whole<00:04:14.340> thing<00:04:14.549> much<00:04:14.699> more

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
going to make the whole thing much more

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.779 
going to make the whole thing much more
taut<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.479> much<00:04:15.840> more<00:04:16.079> stable<00:04:16.370> so<00:04:17.370> great<00:04:17.609> for

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
taut and much more stable so great for

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.360 
taut and much more stable so great for
use<00:04:17.940> even<00:04:18.090> in<00:04:18.329> stronger<00:04:18.630> winds<00:04:19.130> each<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.280> the

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
use even in stronger winds each of the

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.189 
use even in stronger winds each of the
guylines<00:04:20.729> also<00:04:21.060> has<00:04:21.239> its<00:04:21.389> own<00:04:21.479> retainer<00:04:21.900> so

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
guylines also has its own retainer so

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.480 
guylines also has its own retainer so
this<00:04:22.289> is<00:04:22.409> just<00:04:22.530> what<00:04:22.710> this<00:04:22.800> little<00:04:22.979> loop<00:04:23.220> here

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
this is just what this little loop here

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.370 
this is just what this little loop here
is<00:04:23.580> for<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.360> we<00:04:24.419> can<00:04:24.539> wrap<00:04:24.690> up<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.990> guy<00:04:25.139> lines

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
is for so we can wrap up the guy lines

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.200 
is for so we can wrap up the guy lines
and<00:04:25.620> pop<00:04:25.770> them<00:04:25.950> in<00:04:26.070> there<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:26.789> that<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.000> next

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
and pop them in there so that the next

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.850 
and pop them in there so that the next
time<00:04:27.389> we<00:04:27.539> come<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:27.870> use<00:04:28.050> I'm<00:04:28.229> going<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.710> be
