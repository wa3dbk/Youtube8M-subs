00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.930
 you in this that is the bookseller of 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.560
 elias hernandez my name is the is and 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.560
 we start 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.640
 I want to talk about one of my novels 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.710
 favorites and that although I've already seen 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.300
 several reviews of him on various channels 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.980
 from YouTube, I did not want to spend 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.880
 opportunity to give you my opinion 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.580
 about this book and I'm talking about 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.100
 1984 George Orwell I knew this 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.660
 book thank my brother when it came out 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.320
 the first movie of the games of the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.080
 hungry' 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.970
 not knowing then I was so fascinated 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.930
 with that movie he told me good if 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.540
 you liked it so much because I did not 1984 and you 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.360
 I will also like to confess 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.290
 something I have not read the games of 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.219
 hungry 'if I really want to but for 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.739
 X because I could not but this 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:03.190
 year it does not happen that I already read them the three this 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.890
 novel was written in 1948 then 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.500
 George Orwell here embodied what would be 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.810
 his idea of ​​a society 40 years more 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.990
 forward obviously we already passed 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.259
 for that year and nothing that is here 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.210
 writing happened so far but what did 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.940
 it seems if we go back in time 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.250
 we return to the year of 1984 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.200
 and I tell you how things would be if 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.660
 it really would have happened what George 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.850
 Orwell wrote but first of all the 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.930
 planet is divided into three regions that 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.990
 are oceania east towards euro asia oceania 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.570
 is governed by the one called the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.060
 big brother or big brother and he can 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.700
 see it and listen to everything there are cameras and 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.300
 TV screens everywhere in your 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.760
 home at work on the streets in 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.710
 schools everywhere there is there 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.870
 a screen that is watching you and a 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.390
 microphone that can hear everything that 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.600
 you say so forget about you going to 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.630
 have privacy within this society 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.590
 well that is mine is in constant war 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.440
 with euro-asia or in certain occasions 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.680
 also with this second asia will be what 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.610
 that the party agrees at that moment 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.760
 he is the one who is going to say all the truths 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.220
 and always what the day is the truth not 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.020
 is questioned and if it is necessary to have to 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.570
 change the past so that that truth 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.880
 it's true he's going to do it 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.220
 Wilson Smith is a common citizen and 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.470
 current as you as I eat 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.240
 anyone and he works in the ministry 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.610
 of the truth one of the four 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.340
 ministries that are responsible for regulating 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.920
 all the activities that exist within 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.160
 from this society of oceania the ironic 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.100
 here is that these ministries have 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.470
 totally contrary functions 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.630
 to their names the ministry of truth 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.190
 is responsible for destroying and manipulating everything 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.640
 the kind of historical information that 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.200
 exists if there is certain information that does not 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.180
 goes according to what is right now 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.100
 saying the party is going to destroy him 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.260
 under the means that are necessary for 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.570
 that there is no trace of it and so 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.430
 they say is the only truth the 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.170
 ministry of abundance is in charge 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.170
 to keep the whole population in a 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.760
 permanent state of poverty ministry 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.710
 of peace takes care of all 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.650
 matters related to war and that 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.690
 this is in constant permanence for 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.430
 last the ministry of love is the one that 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.890
 is in charge of torture and 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.810
 punishments another of the things that exist 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.320
 here in this society are the so-called 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.080
 two minutes of hate where all the 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.810
 population comes together in a certain place to 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.990
 where they show us images and videos 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.330
 about the person who supposedly 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.970
 betrayed to oceania here the population is 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.790
 charge to insult this apparent 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.620
 traitor and in this way the party them 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.630
 It shows that they are the only ones 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.910
 have worried about the welfare of the 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.400
 population another of the things that here 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.690
 there is that there is no sex for pleasure 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.640
 the only sex that is conceived by 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.220
 those of the party is for purposes 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.050
 reproductive factors between husband and wife 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.780
 well this book is divided into three 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.060
 The first part is an introduction to 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.030
 all this that I just explained to you 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.160
 what is it that makes big brother what 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.070
 it is the game what it is to live in oceania 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.640
 and what are these four ministries 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.750
 then winson is telling us his 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.970
 normal life and how suddenly he starts 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.070
 to have a totally thought 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.080
 different from the one they have been manipulating 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.630
 he starts to think for himself and he 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.210
 begins to question and really what 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.860
 the party does the second is fine 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.610
 part tells us about romance 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.480
 prohibited that exists between winston and 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.860
 characters that are introduced more 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.319
 forward in the novel 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.780
 Here he shows us I'm not going to overtake him 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.789
 a lot of this part just how is 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.520
 this forbidden love that exists between 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.280
 they are basically this second part 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.990
 the third part I will not tell you about 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.990
 what is it because it is practically 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.819
 make a spoiler of the story and I want to 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.310
 I get home I want you to read 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.919
 I want you to get to this part and stay 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.930
 as surprised as I am 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.289
 I qualified this book with five out of five 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.439
 stars in good guys I really liked what 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:28.500
 I highly recommend that I hope that you 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:31.830
 like those who have not read it as 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.810
 that I was reading this book 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.150
 I questioned quite a lot in many things that 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.669
 here passed for example law to certain 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.340
 part mainly when you started 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.949
 to explain how you lived here then 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.820
 there were times when I said where I've 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.670
 heard this where have I seen this 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.320
 because although we do not want to believe it, 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.420
 are living many of the things that 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.910
 here they are in the society that we are 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.850
 living 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.250
 Well, it's not good at all 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.890
 I mentioned at the beginning or is already tele 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.800
 microphones screens that follow you 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:10.160
 everywhere and you do not have the capacity 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.190
 to think for yourself and only what 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.770
 that they impose on you be the only truth be 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.990
 right or wrong that's the truth so 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.690
 good is a book highly recommended 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.190
 time is help certification that yes 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.280
