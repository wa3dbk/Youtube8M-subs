00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.950 
be quite honest but we'll give it a try
so<00:01:44.790> let's<00:01:44.939> move<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.299> over<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.810> wee<00:01:45.930> bit

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
so let's move it over just a wee bit

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.639 
so let's move it over just a wee bit
more<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:47.450> moved<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.570> too<00:01:48.720> far<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.990> time<00:01:49.380> so

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
more I moved it too far that time so

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.800 
more I moved it too far that time so
let's<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.100> try<00:01:50.220> again<00:01:50.399> maybe<00:01:51.240> back<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> wee

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
let's just try again maybe back a wee

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.929 
let's just try again maybe back a wee
bit<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.979> that's<00:01:53.040> good<00:01:53.340> enough<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.759> easy

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
bit so that's good enough it's easy

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.270 
bit so that's good enough it's easy
enough<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> put<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.810> at<00:01:55.079> some<00:01:55.320> extra<00:01:55.829> sounds

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
enough to put in at some extra sounds

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160 
enough to put in at some extra sounds
and<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.060> notice<00:01:57.360> stamped<00:01:57.719> further<00:01:57.990> on

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.460 
quite loud enough so you kind of have to
mess<00:03:51.450> around<00:03:51.570> with<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:51.990> they're<00:03:52.200> just

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
mess around with that they're just

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.640 
mess around with that they're just
together<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.950> setting<00:03:53.340> just<00:03:53.370> right<00:03:54.650> let's

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
together the setting just right let's

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.200

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
just tap on that there and you've got

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.810 
just tap on that there and you've got
the<00:03:57.420> audio<00:03:57.570> clips<00:03:58.260> on<00:03:58.470> this<00:03:58.740> yeah<00:03:59.130> so<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.670> I

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
the audio clips on this yeah so that I

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.300 
the audio clips on this yeah so that I
can<00:04:00.030> change<00:04:00.270> how<00:04:00.600> loud<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.410> want<00:04:01.740> it<00:04:01.860> there<00:04:02.010> too

let's<00:04:03.000> press<00:04:03.300> play<00:04:03.330> again<00:04:08.870> so<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.320> music<00:04:10.680> that

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
let's press play again so the music that

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.770 
let's press play again so the music that
goes<00:04:11.370> with<00:04:11.550> this<00:04:11.670> doesn't<00:04:12.000> go<00:04:12.420> far<00:04:12.720> enough

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
goes with this doesn't go far enough

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.840 
goes with this doesn't go far enough
down<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.290> timeline<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:13.950> what<00:04:14.310> we<00:04:14.400> can<00:04:14.550> do<00:04:14.730> with

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
down the timeline so what we can do with

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.699 
down the timeline so what we can do with
this<00:04:14.940> here<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.270> we<00:04:15.420> can<00:04:15.660> tell<00:04:15.959> it<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.140> loop

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
this here is we can tell it to loop

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.270 
this here is we can tell it to loop
background<00:04:17.370> music<00:04:18.079> so<00:04:19.079> once<00:04:19.290> it's<00:04:19.470> completely

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
background music so once it's completely

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.740 
background music so once it's completely
that's<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.700> music<00:04:20.850> you'll<00:04:21.269> all<00:04:21.359> loop<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.720> back

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
that's the music you'll all loop it back

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.780 
that's the music you'll all loop it back
round<00:04:22.079> again<00:04:22.200> so<00:04:22.560> there<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.430> go<00:04:23.520> that's<00:04:23.669> how

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
round again so there you go that's how

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.790 
round again so there you go that's how
to<00:04:23.910> do<00:04:24.150> that<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:24.660> if<00:04:25.140> you<00:04:25.260> want<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.470> take<00:04:25.650> this
