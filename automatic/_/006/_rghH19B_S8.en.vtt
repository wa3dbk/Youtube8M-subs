00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.290
 Y 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.289
 Hello everyone, I have another trick 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.189
 of magic to thank you our 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.900
 visits and as there is no I'm in 99 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.820
 subscribers that seems to rise 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.410
 it costs to go up to 100 maybe it's gone up 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.910
 but good at this moment a while ago 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.850
 I got in and I was in 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.320
 the 99 subscribers if it is already 100 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.590
 subscribers anyway I'm going to 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.420
 have a trick the truth that very nice 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.920
 ok let's start doing it 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.660
 We will need as you have seen 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.730
 a deck 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.790
 which can be marked by the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.670
 viewer 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.720
 and also cut by the viewer as 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.630
 it's not a good cut once this is done 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.940
 we tell the viewer to tell us 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.400
 stop at the moment you want to say 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.809
 let's say it does not say that we stop 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.370
 about here I want to 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.770
 service comes your letter and we close 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.200
 accompaniment I brought a mobile my 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.410
 mobile that effectively does not work for 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.080
 boast of much less but to do 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.520
 the trick because if we put there 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.520
 the deck and we hit 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:35.270
 effectively your letter 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.270
 teleports from the deck here 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:44.190
 and from here it has completely disappeared 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.950
 however, we can give you 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.020
 deck the viewer to check 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.310
 the letters and realize that the letter 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.140
 from here it has completely disappeared 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.390
 I repeat it could be given by the viewer 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.520
 to review it without any kind of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.600
 inconvenience or nothing can look at it 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.600
 as many times as you want 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.620
 and well this is the turn well I'll 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.070
 move on to realize the revelation I hope 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.070
 I wish you like it 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.210
 well for this trick you're going to need two 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.850
 equal letters 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.030
 I would have done with basic letters for 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.640
 example but is that as I do not have 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:34.140
 repeated, I've done it with this 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.650
 shuffles that the Chinese's well of 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.819
 used 24 this 4 and a 4 that will be 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.520
 here that now I will explain 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.260
 the preparation well 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.880
 as you see 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.690
 at first sight is a lady of clubs 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.660
 but in the part of here 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.440
 It not is well appreciated the chamber is as 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:04.800
 a cut so that the lady is more 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:07.150
 girl is more cropped than the 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.900
 what 4 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.970
 and then when passing 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.690
 in this way 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.770
 and I have the prepared one above all 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.190
 when shuffling the pass down 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.360
 and when making a cut 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.060
 well we know that it stays 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.980
 approximately in the middle 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.550
 then synchronizing when 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.840
 viewer or you say you have to stop 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:38.030
 where the 4 automatically are for the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.050
 well you can also do it through 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.500
 time of a number on 2 because one and 2 and 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.810
 parents at the exact moment that's what 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.410
 practice a little but you must continue 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.740
 well then once done this when 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.660
 do you put the other 4 prepared or 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.910
 an accomplice of yours who is out there 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.610
 watching that the viewer is given a goal in 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.270
 the pocket otherwise make it 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.510
 pre transport well once you get 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.370
 transportation by giving the mallet to 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.410
 viewer to be examined as they 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.170
 they will not look like 4 if they do not care 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.209
 4 of clubs have disappeared or 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.790
 of air you give him the mallet in such a way 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.750
 that in his sight 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.750
 when passing them 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.879
 in his sight when passing them 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.530
 the cut is below 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.479
 or in view of the imaginary viewer 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.919
 of you in the tasting you and the 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.729
 spectator and you have the tasting our hand 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.249
 at the time of you pass them 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:46.699
 that the fault is like this 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.899
 because like that because if the base is like this if 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.839
 have a bit of a view and they fix the 

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:52.969
 cut up here fucked then it reads 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:55.549
 so that the cut is like this then 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.719
 when passing them, he disguises himself more and better 

00:04:55.549 --> 00:04:58.470
 it will not take importance none 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.330
 put to pass letters 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.800
 and indeed on account that has 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.789
 missing 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.770
 now it's a very easy easy trick there 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:12.530
 I know how to give you that magic feeling 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.550
 to the effect is a very easy trick 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.610
 it simply requires that preparation 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.099
 and the truth is that it is very very 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.949
 surprising especially if you do it with 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:25.620
 a buddy of yours who is there 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:28.379
 making the video is liquefied the trick 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.560
 someone who sneaks to the viewer in 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:33.360
 a pocket there are different way this 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.449
 trick does not perform angel crisis even 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.180
 dynamo each one differently 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:43.889
 well up since this is all I hope 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.460
 that you liked that if it's like that 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.699
