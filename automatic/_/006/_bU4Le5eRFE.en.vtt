you're gonna do is you're gonna fill it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.190 
you're gonna do is you're gonna fill it
with<00:01:42.740> your<00:01:42.920> own<00:01:43.329> extra-virgin<00:01:44.329> olive<00:01:44.360> oil<00:01:44.840> and

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
with your own extra-virgin olive oil and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.950 
with your own extra-virgin olive oil and
the<00:01:45.710> key<00:01:45.979> is<00:01:46.130> do<00:01:46.369> not<00:01:46.640> fill<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.149> up<00:01:47.240> more<00:01:47.509> than

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
the key is do not fill it up more than

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.120 
the key is do not fill it up more than
halfway<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:51.229> has<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.560> have<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.710> certain<00:01:52.070> amount

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
halfway it has to have a certain amount

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.670 
halfway it has to have a certain amount
of<00:01:52.369> air<00:01:52.640> or<00:01:53.090> little<00:01:53.659> space<00:01:53.899> in<00:01:54.110> there<00:01:54.229> for<00:01:54.530> the

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
of air or little space in there for the

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.170 
of air or little space in there for the
air<00:01:54.799> because<00:01:55.189> it's<00:01:55.369> basically<00:01:55.790> you're<00:01:56.030> going

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
air because it's basically you're going

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.219 
air because it's basically you're going
to<00:01:56.240> pump<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:56.899> create<00:01:57.770> air<00:01:58.040> pressure<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.229> I

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
to pump it and create air pressure so I

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.710 
to pump it and create air pressure so I
already<00:02:00.799> have<00:02:01.130> some

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
already have some

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.270 
already have some
a<00:02:01.750> little<00:02:02.620> bit<00:02:02.710> more<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.890> you're<00:02:06.040> gonna<00:02:06.130> do

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
a little bit more what you're gonna do

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.390 
a little bit more what you're gonna do
is<00:02:06.370> put<00:02:06.580> this<00:02:06.700> back<00:02:07.210> in<00:02:07.480> here<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.950> then<00:02:11.950> screw

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
is put this back in here and then screw

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.450 
is put this back in here and then screw
this<00:02:12.580> on<00:02:12.820> nice<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.050> tight<00:02:14.230> then<00:02:15.190> what<00:02:15.310> you're

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
this on nice and tight then what you're

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.570 
this on nice and tight then what you're
gonna<00:02:15.520> do<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:16.350> insert<00:02:17.350> this<00:02:17.590> over<00:02:17.980> top<00:02:18.280> and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
gonna do is insert this over top and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.280 
gonna do is insert this over top and
you're<00:02:18.730> actually<00:02:19.030> going<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.210> pump<00:02:19.570> this<00:02:19.870> and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
you're actually going to pump this and

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.680 
you're actually going to pump this and
right<00:02:20.980> now<00:02:21.130> it's<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:22.000> very<00:02:22.030> much<00:02:22.300> air<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.570> there

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
right now it's a very much air in there

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.000 
right now it's a very much air in there
so<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:22.930> very<00:02:22.990> easy<00:02:23.320> but<00:02:23.590> if<00:02:23.740> you've<00:02:23.920> ever

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
so it's very easy but if you've ever

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.940 
so it's very easy but if you've ever
done<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> bike<00:02:24.640> air<00:02:25.360> pump<00:02:25.690> it's<00:02:25.930> similar<00:02:26.200> where

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
done a bike air pump it's similar where

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.280 
done a bike air pump it's similar where
as<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.280> gets<00:02:27.490> harder<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.210> pump<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:29.050> means

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
as it gets harder to pump that means

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.450 
as it gets harder to pump that means
it's<00:02:29.440> actually<00:02:29.650> full

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
it's actually full

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.530 
it's actually full
so<00:02:30.850> if<00:02:31.150> recommended<00:02:31.750> in<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.960> guy<00:02:32.110> ten<00:02:32.470> times<00:02:32.800> I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
so if recommended in the guy ten times I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.180 
so if recommended in the guy ten times I
just<00:02:34.540> do<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.900> until<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.560> can't<00:02:35.650> do<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.040> anymore

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
just do it until I can't do it anymore

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.610 
just do it until I can't do it anymore
and<00:02:39.570> then<00:02:40.570> I'm<00:02:40.720> just<00:02:40.840> gonna<00:02:40.990> spray<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.380> show

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
and then I'm just gonna spray to show

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.070 
and then I'm just gonna spray to show
you<00:02:41.680> how<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.890> use<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:45.450> okay<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.780> just<00:02:46.930> take

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
you how to use it okay so you just take

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.630 
you how to use it okay so you just take
this<00:02:47.260> off<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.500> then<00:02:47.920> there's<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.340> spray

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
this off and then there's the spray

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.560 
this off and then there's the spray
spout<00:02:48.970> right<00:02:49.180> there

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
spout right there

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.070 
spout right there
and<00:02:50.050> then<00:02:50.230> just<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:52.600> is<00:02:52.720> all<00:02:52.870> there<00:02:52.959> is

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
and then just and that is all there is

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.199 
and then just and that is all there is
to<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.680> more<00:02:53.890> air<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.490> there<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.970> lighter

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
to it the more air in there the lighter

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.750 
to it the more air in there the lighter
the<00:02:55.420> spray<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:56.080> could<00:02:56.590> be<00:02:56.860> adding<00:02:57.459> some<00:02:57.640> more

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
the spray so I could be adding some more

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.820 
the spray so I could be adding some more
here<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.120> there<00:02:58.240> for<00:02:58.420> sure<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.990> then<00:02:59.620> that's

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
here and there for sure and then that's

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.470 
here and there for sure and then that's
all<00:02:59.980> there<00:03:00.160> is<00:03:00.190> all<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.820> do<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.240> you<00:03:01.330> just

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
all there is all you do and you just

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.150 
all there is all you do and you just
store<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:01.930> way<00:03:02.200> before<00:03:02.680> you're<00:03:02.980> going<00:03:03.100> to

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
store it that way before you're going to

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.340 
store it that way before you're going to
use<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.459> pump<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.850> up<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.060> little<00:03:04.240> bit<00:03:04.420> and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
use it pump it up a little bit and

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.600 
use it pump it up a little bit and
you'll<00:03:05.530> get<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.830> done<00:03:05.980> like<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:06.430> doesn't
