00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:16.049
 Tell me guys 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 Tag Fight 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.460
 let's go for another android video 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.920
 end of the session is worth buying or 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.840
 not where once a week brings a 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.019
 pre paid story game 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.090
 We are analyzing together and thank you. 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.890
 also the partnership for the news site 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.020
 technology speaking in portuguese 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.020
 I then went there to meet you. 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.369
 The game that I bring today is the launch. 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.970
 that left the pole of November of 2014 the 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.070
 android called ex with m with him that is 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.350
 a principle of pc platform gamers 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.759
 and consoles that has now arrived for our 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.770
 cell phone screen 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.350
 the game is a mixture of combat 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.110
 strategic management shifts 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.970
 and resources at the beginning will 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.009
 very complicated because people 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.380
 there are many different options for 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.810
 to do but as time goes by you will 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.390
 taking the dynamics of the thing will see that 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.810
 It's not as complicated as that 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.670
 will see that the game is addictive and if you 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.000
 is considering a different game than 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.159
 traditional quit some of the fps games 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.470
 and at the same time get a 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.130
 surrounding game I recommend that you 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.899
 know why it's cool and confrontation 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.360
 of the game story 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.789
 basically you are the commander of a 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.069
 paramilitary force that is fighting 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.170
 against alien invasion and its 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.880
 goal is to avoid world panic and 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.390
 Eject the aliens 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.430
 just this is not simple or just do not know 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.070
 that the game requires a lot of strategy 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.440
 macro management and will not only 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.019
 ets that are your enemies were not born 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.109
 then I discovered some discoveries there 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.180
 during a game are only very interesting 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.160
 ex1 and does not belong to a country 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.620
 you basically help the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.359
 governments around the world and it is 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.430
 you provide that help has this 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:43.370
 diplomacy with governments because in 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.160
 exchange you receive resources you also receive 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.200
 scientist engineers and there was a 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.450
 favors and all this is important for 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.510
 that you might be expanding by doing 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.690
 the upgrades there gives so much of the technical part 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.600
 of the soldiers ornaments as 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.970
 technology that scientists do not 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.500
 researching and you will make the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.420
 genetic improvements soldier 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.100
 including these experiments with edson 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.440
 skeletons and you will see that the parade 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.500
 It's going to be sinister during a game. 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.730
 it's very easy everything is band roth displays 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.730
 I still weave and sado 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.760
 in the phishing jungle messy decade 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.420
 talking about the gameplay on the page 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.700
 everything works in shifts or 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.130
 whether you have your squad to 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.050
 command and according to your patent 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.090
 You can have up to six soldiers in 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.240
 field and you command them all 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.310
 alternately the white line indicates until 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.160
 where a soldier can walk with a certain 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.770
 without tearing away from the 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.380
 squadron and the maximum to the yellow line 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.540
 the soldier can occur in that move in 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.459
 very important in this game people 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.890
 that is, coverage 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.590
 nothing soldiered and unprotected 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.950
 open chest that fit right into 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.600
 this shield against some scenario 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.360
 shows whether you are protected or not 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.910
 you may notice that it in half indicates 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.470
 that you will be partially 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.350
 protected and if you and if it is 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.419
 totally green in that direction you 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.669
 will be fully covered 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.340
 although nothing prevents you from getting a 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.680
 grenade to be surrounded by it is also 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.620
 It's important for you to be strategically 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.960
 not distancing the soldier from the more because 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.530
 he may end up in an ambush and the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.240
 weapons 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.370
 in the beginning they are basically the forms 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.750
 terrestrial we know today and 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.010
 during the fighting 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.500
 Can you collect some 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.020
 alien technologies that you later 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.910
 research with its scientists 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.190
 numbers to make the famous engineering 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.500
 reverse and so you just ask 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.280
 new technologies, both technical and 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.280
 genetic 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.820
 Wow 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.340
 in relation to management you have a 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.160
 basis for care but only took care will 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.930
 need to expand it at the same time as 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.540
 You have the whole diplomatic and 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.120
 policy and is helping countries to 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.520
 that they do not leave the county and leave 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.620
 send resource and you see that sometimes 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.530
 can not really walk all because your 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.669
 Main well the game is your squad 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.090
 so nothing sent to missions 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.770
 suicide bombers and why the soldiers 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.169
 gain experience in combat that they 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.050
 are being promoted by specializing 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.330
 in classes like assault sniper 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.030
 if he dies, neighborhood will have to train 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.770
 in another soldier and practically from scratch 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.289
 so it's important that you take good care of yourself 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.090
 of his soldiers in another detail 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.010
 important is that these soldiers 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.050
 hurt in battle they will need 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.970
 to soak for a few days and then you will 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.949
 have to recruit other team soldiers 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.130
 And so it's important that you have a team. 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:01.800
 complete almost a whole soldier of the same 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:05.039
 level so that this substitution in 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.889
 harmonic and then the strategy that I 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:10.169
 Following is're always putting a soldier one 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.120
 newcomer to the squadron for that 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:15.360
 father gradually gaining experience 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.910
 along with the others and early edson 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.599
 It's much more than it looks on the galley. 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.000
 like this 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.550
 are many variables is quite something 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.830
 to manage quite tactically enough 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.270
 strategy is a game as soon as 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.300
 pleased enough 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.490
 Overall, the graphics are pretty challenging. 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.710
 edit are very cool 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.169
 the plot is not he is very well reckoned with 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.479
 the pecs and the animations are fine 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.430
 made him an exquisite work from here 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.120
 I see you have been highlighting us 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.380
 recent years the mobile games market 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.750
 concluding if you want to escape the 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.180
 to pick up a game to use the 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.190
