looking<00:00:15.870> at<00:00:15.990> getting<00:00:16.080> one<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.379> these

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
looking at getting one of these

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.270 
looking at getting one of these
cylinders<00:00:16.920> sleeved<00:00:18.770> and<00:00:19.770> when<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> machine

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.280 
cylinders sleeved and when the machine

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.240 
cylinders sleeved and when the machine
shop<00:00:20.520> got<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> hold<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> block<00:00:22.250> they

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
shop got a hold of the block they

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.640 
shop got a hold of the block they
decided<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.360> other<00:00:24.690> cylinders<00:00:25.380> were

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
decided that the other cylinders were

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.450 
decided that the other cylinders were
too<00:00:25.980> far<00:00:27.020> too<00:00:28.020> far<00:00:28.230> rusted<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.010> was<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.310> too

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
too far too far rusted it was just too

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.359 
too far too far rusted it was just too
close<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.770> fortunately<00:00:31.770> for<00:00:32.009> me<00:00:32.039> they<00:00:32.250> had

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
close so fortunately for me they had

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.299 
close so fortunately for me they had
another<00:00:32.579> block<00:00:32.879> and<00:00:33.440> I<00:00:34.440> was<00:00:34.589> able<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.890> scavenge

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
another block and I was able to scavenge

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.559 
another block and I was able to scavenge
that<00:00:35.489> one<00:00:35.640> off<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.789> them<00:00:36.030> for<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.239> pretty<00:00:36.420> good

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:36.569 
that one off of them for a pretty good

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:39.169 
that one off of them for a pretty good
deal<00:00:37.039> and<00:00:38.039> they<00:00:38.699> have<00:00:38.819> reassembled

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
deal and they have reassembled

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.419 
deal and they have reassembled
everything<00:00:39.690> board<00:00:40.079> at<00:00:40.199> 30,000<00:00:40.859> sober<00:00:41.159> on<00:00:41.280> all

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 
everything board at 30,000 sober on all

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:43.729 
everything board at 30,000 sober on all
the<00:00:41.519> cylinders<00:00:41.729> to<00:00:42.449> match<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.140> Pistons<00:00:43.530> from

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the cylinders to match the Pistons from

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.389 
the cylinders to match the Pistons from
my<00:00:43.890> old<00:00:44.039> block<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:46.920> now<00:00:47.069> it's<00:00:47.219> just

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
my old block and now it's just

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.219 
my old block and now it's just
reassembly<00:00:48.059> time<00:00:49.339> so<00:00:50.339> I<00:00:50.749> think<00:00:51.749> the<00:00:51.929> rest<00:00:52.049> is

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
reassembly time so I think the rest is

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.669 
reassembly time so I think the rest is
downhill<00:00:52.440> from<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:52.889> but<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.609> course<00:00:54.679> the

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
downhill from here but of course the

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.520 
downhill from here but of course the
outdrive<00:00:55.979> still<00:00:56.339> remains<00:00:56.609> to<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.789> tested<00:00:56.909> the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
outdrive still remains to be tested the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.739 
outdrive still remains to be tested the
impeller<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.769> it<00:00:59.030> as<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.149> know<00:01:00.299> is<00:01:00.329> always<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
impeller in it as you know is always a

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:06.109 
impeller in it as you know is always a
source<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.399> anguish<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:04.369> of<00:01:05.369> course<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.789> 60

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
source of anguish and of course the 60

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.279 
source of anguish and of course the 60
gallon<00:01:06.450> aluminum<00:01:06.869> fuel<00:01:07.079> tank<00:01:09.049> seems<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.200> be

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
gallon aluminum fuel tank seems to be

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.300 
gallon aluminum fuel tank seems to be
fine<00:01:10.500> now<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:12.649> that's<00:01:13.649> because<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.100> hardly

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
fine now but that's because it hardly

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.120 
fine now but that's because it hardly
has<00:01:14.490> anything<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.930> anyway<00:01:18.979> as<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.070> can

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
has anything in it so anyway as you can

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.080 
has anything in it so anyway as you can
see<00:01:20.960> looks<00:01:21.960> pretty<00:01:22.140> good

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.330 

I<00:01:25.149> don't<00:01:25.810> foresee<00:01:26.170> us<00:01:26.200> having<00:01:26.350> any<00:01:26.859> issues

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340
