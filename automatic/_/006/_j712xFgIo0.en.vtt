game<00:00:59.390> did<00:01:00.390> okay<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> mean<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.680> wasn't<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
game did okay I mean it wasn't the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.939

okay<00:01:05.519> i<00:01:05.909> think<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> online<00:01:07.740> aspect<00:01:08.310> of

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
okay i think that the online aspect of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.030 
okay i think that the online aspect of
it<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:09.299> was<00:01:09.479> fairly<00:01:09.780> okay<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.500> was<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> lot

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it it was fairly okay it was not a lot

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.700 
it it was fairly okay it was not a lot
of<00:01:11.070> land<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:12.060> least<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.600> felt<00:01:12.990> things<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.439> didn't

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
of land at least I felt things I didn't

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.200 
of land at least I felt things I didn't
play<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> game<00:01:14.130> when<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.340> was<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.610> its<00:01:14.729> prime<00:01:14.880> so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
play the game when I was in its prime so

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.600

that was a big thing now a lot of people

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.969 
that was a big thing now a lot of people
really<00:01:45.420> wanted<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.710> know<00:01:47.100> from<00:01:48.320> least<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.530> felt

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
really wanted you know from least I felt

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.859 
really wanted you know from least I felt
from<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> lot<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.610> other<00:01:50.700> bands<00:01:51.000> being<00:01:51.479> able<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
from a lot of other bands being able to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.899 
from a lot of other bands being able to

watch your friends in a flight and plane

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.429 
watch your friends in a flight and plane
I<00:01:54.090> think<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.450> was<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.929> of<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> things<00:01:55.320> that

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
I think that was one of the things that

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.490 
I think that was one of the things that
EA<00:01:55.970> actually<00:01:56.970> did<00:01:57.329> with<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> anime<00:01:58.079> series

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
EA actually did with that anime series

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.559 
EA actually did with that anime series
