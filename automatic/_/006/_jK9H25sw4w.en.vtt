00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
holding it in place so I'm going to have

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.720 
holding it in place so I'm going to have
my<00:01:04.570> pink<00:01:04.780> cord<00:01:05.170> be<00:01:05.620> my<00:01:05.800> base<00:01:05.980> cord<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.580> the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
my pink cord be my base cord and the

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.030 
my pink cord be my base cord and the
black<00:01:06.940> cord<00:01:07.240> be<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:08.440> core<00:01:08.620> time<00:01:08.740> knotting

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
black cord be the core time knotting

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.630 
black cord be the core time knotting
around<00:01:09.310> it<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:10.150> to<00:01:10.330> do<00:01:10.540> a<00:01:10.570> half<00:01:10.810> hitch<00:01:11.640> you're

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
around it so to do a half hitch you're

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.510 
around it so to do a half hitch you're
going<00:01:12.910> to<00:01:13.030> take<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:15.250> knotting<00:01:15.610> cord<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:16.380> go

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
going to take your knotting cord and go

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.200 
going to take your knotting cord and go
over<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:19.270> cord<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:19.950> make<00:01:20.950> like<00:01:21.220> a<00:01:21.250> number

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
over the cord and make like a number

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.320 
over the cord and make like a number
four<00:01:22.980> then<00:01:23.980> you're<00:01:24.130> going<00:01:24.370> to<00:01:24.520> go<00:01:24.670> through<00:01:25.090> the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
four then you're going to go through the

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.350 
four then you're going to go through the
loop<00:01:25.480> you<00:01:25.510> created<00:01:26.910> and<00:01:28.650> pull<00:01:29.650> so<00:01:30.610> that's<00:01:31.150> your

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
loop you created and pull so that's your

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.390 
loop you created and pull so that's your
basic<00:01:31.510> half<00:01:31.900> hitch<00:01:32.170> knot<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.710> if<00:01:33.010> you<00:01:33.160> did

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
basic half hitch knot and if you did

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.740 
basic half hitch knot and if you did
this<00:01:34.440> over<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.620> over<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:35.950> over<00:01:36.190> again<00:01:36.750> it's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
this over and over and over again it's

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.790 
this over and over and over again it's
going<00:01:38.080> to<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:39.220> loop<00:01:39.460> around<00:01:39.730> the<00:01:40.300> core<00:01:40.800> now

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
going to just loop around the core now

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.720 
going to just loop around the core now
there<00:01:42.250> is<00:01:42.460> one<00:01:42.940> thing<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.830> consider<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.400> that

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
there is one thing to consider and that

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.030 
there is one thing to consider and that
is<00:01:45.970> as<00:01:46.510> you<00:01:46.690> can<00:01:46.870> see<00:01:47.080> here<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.630> have<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.740> not

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
is as you can see here you have this not

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.180 
is as you can see here you have this not
going<00:01:51.460> over<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.420> loops<00:01:52.630> off<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:54.040> that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
going over and the loops off to that

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.890 
going over and the loops off to that
side<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.760> not<00:01:54.970> going<00:01:55.120> under<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.540> loops<00:01:55.750> off

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
side this not going under the loops off

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.360 
side this not going under the loops off
to<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.200> side<00:01:56.440> this<00:01:56.620> one<00:01:56.830> going<00:01:56.980> over<00:01:57.130> the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
to that side this one going over the

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.820 
to that side this one going over the
loops<00:01:57.550> off<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:57.970> side<00:01:58.240> so<00:01:58.540> it<00:01:59.260> does<00:01:59.530> make<00:01:59.800> a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
loops off to that side so it does make a

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.890 
loops off to that side so it does make a
difference<00:01:59.950> in<00:02:00.610> your<00:02:00.880> not<00:02:01.060> whether<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.720> go

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
difference in your not whether you go

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.590 
difference in your not whether you go
with<00:02:02.140> your<00:02:02.670> knotting<00:02:03.670> cord<00:02:03.700> over<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.360> core

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
with your knotting cord over the core

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.690 
with your knotting cord over the core
and<00:02:04.870> through<00:02:06.150> or<00:02:07.150> if<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:08.320> go<00:02:08.500> under<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.340> core

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
and through or if you go under the core

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.029 
and through or if you go under the core
and<00:02:09.910> through

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
and through

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.080 
and through
so<00:02:11.790> those<00:02:11.970> are<00:02:12.120> both<00:02:12.209> half<00:02:12.510> hitch<00:02:12.780> knots<00:02:13.080> but

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
so those are both half hitch knots but

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.339 
so those are both half hitch knots but
usually<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.239> your<00:02:15.420> project<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.989> will<00:02:16.110> make<00:02:16.319> a

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
usually in your project it will make a

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.530 
usually in your project it will make a
difference<00:02:16.739> you<00:02:17.519> usually<00:02:17.700> want<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.150> keep<00:02:18.360> them

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
difference you usually want to keep them

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.289 
difference you usually want to keep them
all<00:02:18.689> going<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.560> one<00:02:19.709> direction<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.879> keep<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.209> a

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
all going to one direction to keep it a

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.410 
all going to one direction to keep it a
nice<00:02:21.420> consistent<00:02:22.519> look<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.939> your<00:02:24.090> finished

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
nice consistent look to your finished

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.619 
nice consistent look to your finished
piece<00:02:25.819> that's<00:02:26.819> how<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.060> do<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.239> half<00:02:27.390> hitch

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
piece that's how you do a half hitch

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:36.450 
piece that's how you do a half hitch
knot
