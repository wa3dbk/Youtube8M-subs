smoothly<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.130> feed<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> culture

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
smoothly you have to feed the culture

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.910 
smoothly you have to feed the culture
every<00:01:51.149> two<00:01:51.360> days<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.869> sugar<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.320> molasses

every two days with sugar and molasses

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.639 
every two days with sugar and molasses
to<00:01:53.130> keep<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.460> alive<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.689> got<00:01:54.960> thinking<00:01:55.380> about

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
to keep it alive so I got thinking about

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.789 
to keep it alive so I got thinking about
this<00:01:55.799> culture<00:01:56.250> being<00:01:56.460> alive<00:01:57.000> living

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
this culture being alive living

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.139 
this culture being alive living
microorganisms<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.950> yeast<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.490> bacteria<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
microorganisms of yeast and bacteria I

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.690 
microorganisms of yeast and bacteria I
wanted<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.750> grow<00:02:00.930> then<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.829> got<00:02:02.040> thinking<00:02:02.310> about

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
wanted to grow then I got thinking about

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.999 
wanted to grow then I got thinking about
life<00:02:02.969> support<00:02:03.450> water<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> total

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
life support water this is the total

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.980 
life support water this is the total

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
filtered water it is an antioxidant

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.630 
filtered water it is an antioxidant
which<00:02:09.780> means<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.319> has<00:02:10.500> electrons<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.280> donate

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
which means it has electrons to donate

and that supports life

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.870 
and that supports life
it<00:02:13.630> also<00:02:13.810> has<00:02:14.170> an<00:02:14.350> alkaline<00:02:14.740> pH<00:02:15.130> which<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.610> the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
wanted to support holy guacamole is all

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.700 
wanted to support holy guacamole is all
I<00:02:29.050> can<00:02:29.260> say

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
I can say

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.060 
I can say
my<00:02:30.250> kefir<00:02:30.670> grains<00:02:30.940> flourished<00:02:31.510> no<00:02:32.020> that's<00:02:32.770> too

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
my kefir grains flourished no that's too

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.350 
my kefir grains flourished no that's too
much<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.280> an<00:02:33.520> understatement

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
much of an understatement

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.020 
much of an understatement
they<00:02:34.720> grew<00:02:34.960> like<00:02:35.200> weeds<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.430> my<00:02:36.550> surprise

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.300 
they grew like weeds and to my surprise
it<00:02:37.330> improved<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.110> taste<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.680> end<00:02:38.830> product

the<00:02:39.520> lesson<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.420> me<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.780> if<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.110> use<00:02:41.320> optimized

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
the lesson to me is if you use optimized
