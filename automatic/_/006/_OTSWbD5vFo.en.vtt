00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.430 

in<00:00:06.670> our<00:00:06.819> solo<00:00:07.180> we<00:00:07.809> were<00:00:07.930> doing<00:00:08.170> a<00:00:08.230> lot<00:00:08.380> of

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
in our solo we were doing a lot of

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.820 
in our solo we were doing a lot of
sliding<00:00:08.920> and<00:00:09.309> some<00:00:09.820> double<00:00:10.210> stops<00:00:10.710> we<00:00:11.710> were

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
sliding and some double stops we were

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.340 
sliding and some double stops we were
going<00:00:12.190> back<00:00:12.370> and<00:00:12.520> forth<00:00:13.080> another<00:00:14.080> thing<00:00:14.320> we

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.350 
going back and forth another thing we

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.960 
going back and forth another thing we
can<00:00:14.590> do<00:00:14.680> because<00:00:14.980> the<00:00:15.100> progression<00:00:15.640> is<00:00:15.730> pretty

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:15.970 
can do because the progression is pretty

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.670 
can do because the progression is pretty
open<00:00:16.180> is<00:00:16.539> to<00:00:16.960> play<00:00:17.170> a<00:00:17.199> little<00:00:17.349> bit<00:00:17.529> more

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
open is to play a little bit more

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.950 
open is to play a little bit more
interval<00:00:18.160> type<00:00:18.369> licks<00:00:18.670> some<00:00:19.599> of<00:00:19.689> our<00:00:19.749> inner

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
interval type licks some of our inner

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.560 
interval type licks some of our inner
Valley<00:00:20.230> clicks<00:00:20.589> sound<00:00:21.130> good<00:00:21.550> over<00:00:21.849> when<00:00:22.480> we

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
Valley clicks sound good over when we

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.960 
Valley clicks sound good over when we
have<00:00:22.689> a<00:00:22.720> little<00:00:22.900> space<00:00:23.199> to<00:00:23.259> play<00:00:23.560> them<00:00:23.829> so<00:00:24.489> one

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
have a little space to play them so one

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.609 
have a little space to play them so one
one<00:00:25.269> thing<00:00:25.449> we'll<00:00:25.570> do<00:00:25.689> right<00:00:26.079> off<00:00:26.199> the<00:00:26.230> bat<00:00:26.470> is

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
one thing we'll do right off the bat is

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.050 
one thing we'll do right off the bat is
we<00:00:26.859> stay<00:00:27.039> right<00:00:27.220> here<00:00:27.429> in<00:00:27.550> our<00:00:27.609> a<00:00:27.819> minor

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
we stay right here in our a minor

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.700 
we stay right here in our a minor
pentatonic<00:00:28.480> scale<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.480> log<00:00:31.960> I<00:00:32.110> say<00:00:32.320> gee<00:00:32.529> I've

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
pentatonic scale and log I say gee I've

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.080 
pentatonic scale and log I say gee I've
played<00:00:33.070> everything<00:00:33.310> I<00:00:33.520> can<00:00:33.670> play<00:00:33.820> with<00:00:33.850> the

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
played everything I can play with the

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.819 
played everything I can play with the
minor<00:00:34.660> pentatonic<00:00:34.870> I<00:00:35.380> want<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.559> do<00:00:35.620> something

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
minor pentatonic I want to do something

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.740 
minor pentatonic I want to do something
different<00:00:35.980> but<00:00:36.850> usually<00:00:37.359> they<00:00:37.449> haven't

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
different but usually they haven't

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.240 
different but usually they haven't
looked<00:00:37.899> at<00:00:37.960> all<00:00:38.079> the<00:00:38.199> interval<00:00:38.590> possibilities

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
looked at all the interval possibilities

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.790 
looked at all the interval possibilities
and<00:00:39.460> this<00:00:39.940> particular<00:00:40.120> lick<00:00:40.629> will<00:00:40.809> do<00:00:43.800> is

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
and this particular lick will do is

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.110 
and this particular lick will do is
really<00:00:45.070> pretty<00:00:45.219> simple<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.850> straightforward

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
really pretty simple and straightforward

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.669 
really pretty simple and straightforward
going<00:00:46.570> down<00:00:46.719> the<00:00:46.840> scale<00:00:47.019> but<00:00:47.230> it's<00:00:47.350> not<00:00:47.500> going

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
going down the scale but it's not going

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.720 
going down the scale but it's not going
down<00:00:47.769> our<00:00:48.039> scale<00:00:48.280> in<00:00:48.460> our<00:00:48.579> conventional<00:00:49.269> way

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
down our scale in our conventional way

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.680 
down our scale in our conventional way
which<00:00:51.730> is<00:00:51.879> what<00:00:52.000> most<00:00:52.120> guys<00:00:52.329> are<00:00:52.480> doing

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
which is what most guys are doing

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.910 
which is what most guys are doing
they're<00:00:52.809> playing<00:00:53.019> the<00:00:53.170> same<00:00:53.379> blue<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.800> if<00:00:56.890> we

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
they're playing the same blue but if we

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.170 
they're playing the same blue but if we
break<00:00:57.160> it<00:00:57.399> up<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.609> little<00:00:57.730> bit

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.270 

in<00:01:02.110> this<00:01:02.170> case<00:01:02.350> we're<00:01:02.530> on<00:01:02.620> our<00:01:02.710> eighth<00:01:02.920> fret

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
in this case we're on our eighth fret

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.430 
in this case we're on our eighth fret
and<00:01:03.640> we're<00:01:03.790> gonna<00:01:03.880> bar<00:01:04.300> instead<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.320> just

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
and we're gonna bar instead of just

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.470 
and we're gonna bar instead of just
flat-out<00:01:05.800> barring<00:01:06.400> I<00:01:06.550> kind<00:01:06.880> of<00:01:06.940> roll<00:01:07.210> my

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
flat-out barring I kind of roll my

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.370 
flat-out barring I kind of roll my
finger<00:01:07.900> so<00:01:08.050> I<00:01:08.080> play<00:01:08.410> 8th<00:01:08.680> fret<00:01:09.040> second<00:01:09.490> string

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
finger so I play 8th fret second string

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.310 
finger so I play 8th fret second string
and<00:01:11.380> then<00:01:11.920> come<00:01:12.190> over<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.550> kick<00:01:12.930> my<00:01:13.930> first

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
and then come over and kick my first

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.780 
and then come over and kick my first
ring<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:16.150> I<00:01:16.210> go<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.360> my<00:01:16.570> fifth<00:01:16.630> fret<00:01:17.790> so

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
ring and then I go to my fifth fret so

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.990 
ring and then I go to my fifth fret so
it's<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.680> then<00:01:21.280> I'm<00:01:21.369> gonna<00:01:21.490> do<00:01:21.670> that<00:01:21.790> on<00:01:21.910> the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
it's and then I'm gonna do that on the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.969 
it's and then I'm gonna do that on the
next<00:01:22.119> 2<00:01:22.360> strings<00:01:22.540> going<00:01:23.080> right<00:01:23.290> down<00:01:23.320> my<00:01:23.680> scale

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
next 2 strings going right down my scale

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:33.300 
next 2 strings going right down my scale
so<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.340> 7th<00:01:24.670> fret<00:01:24.790> 2<00:01:25.060> 8th<00:01:25.240> fret<00:01:31.920> i'm<00:01:32.920> using

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
so the 7th fret 2 8th fret i'm using

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.590 
so the 7th fret 2 8th fret i'm using
alternate<00:01:33.640> picking<00:01:33.759> with<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:34.180> right<00:01:34.420> so

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
alternate picking with this right so

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.600 
alternate picking with this right so
we're<00:01:34.690> going<00:01:34.869> down

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.910 

obviously<00:01:42.510> be<00:01:42.630> variation

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.539 

a<00:01:49.259> lot<00:01:50.259> more<00:01:50.409> interval<00:01:50.890> type<00:01:51.070> playing<00:01:51.369> going

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
a lot more interval type playing going

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.630 
a lot more interval type playing going
on<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:53.020> that's<00:01:53.170> one<00:01:53.350> we<00:01:53.740> can<00:01:53.830> also<00:01:54.009> do<00:01:54.610> a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
on so that's one we can also do a

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.370 
on so that's one we can also do a
different<00:01:54.970> interval<00:01:55.390> shape<00:01:55.840> where<00:01:56.200> we're

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
different interval shape where we're

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.480 
different interval shape where we're
actually<00:01:56.530> going<00:01:56.799> to<00:01:56.890> be<00:01:56.950> stretching<00:01:57.220> out<00:01:57.460> a

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
actually going to be stretching out a

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.789 
actually going to be stretching out a
little<00:01:57.700> bit<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.030> going<00:01:58.509> from<00:01:59.080> our<00:01:59.259> fifth<00:01:59.500> fret

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
little bit and going from our fifth fret

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.620 
little bit and going from our fifth fret
on<00:01:59.950> our<00:02:00.130> six<00:02:00.310> string<00:02:03.090> which<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.240> really<00:02:04.450> like

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
on our six string which I really like

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.979 
on our six string which I really like
these<00:02:04.780> beads<00:02:05.020> are<00:02:05.289> 50<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.100> then<00:02:06.190> I<00:02:09.959> will<00:02:10.959> go

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
these beads are 50 and then I will go

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.110 
these beads are 50 and then I will go
ahead<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.380> do<00:02:11.470> that<00:02:11.500> off<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:12.069> our<00:02:12.220> 5th<00:02:12.880> fret

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
ahead and do that off of our 5th fret

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.750 
ahead and do that off of our 5th fret
6th<00:02:13.600> string<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:14.950> second<00:02:15.340> string<00:02:15.550> at<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
6th string to the second string at the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.690 
6th string to the second string at the
7th<00:02:16.060> fret<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:17.349> more<00:02:17.560> spring<00:02:17.950> at<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.430> 9th

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
7th fret and the more spring at the 9th

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.040 
7th fret and the more spring at the 9th
fret<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.280> good<00:02:21.430> up<00:02:21.670> basically<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.510> shape<00:02:22.870> to

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
fret just a good up basically a shape to

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.370 
fret just a good up basically a shape to
pry<00:02:27.600> some<00:02:28.600> different<00:02:28.900> things<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.170> can<00:02:29.260> do

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
pry some different things you can do

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.130 
pry some different things you can do
with<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.220> here<00:02:30.459> we're<00:02:30.610> going<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.790> do<00:02:30.880> that

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
with that so here we're going to do that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.240 
with that so here we're going to do that
then<00:02:32.140> we<00:02:32.230> move<00:02:32.380> over<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.799> next<00:02:33.010> string<00:02:33.100> and

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
then we move over to the next string and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.690 
then we move over to the next string and
do<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.430> exact<00:02:33.670> same<00:02:33.700> thing<00:02:38.310> step<00:02:39.310> right<00:02:39.340> down

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
do the exact same thing step right down

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.510 
do the exact same thing step right down
there

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.000 

remember<00:02:43.510> our<00:02:43.660> chord<00:02:44.290> progression<00:02:44.740> is<00:02:44.860> in

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
remember our chord progression is in

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:58.520 
remember our chord progression is in
actually<00:02:45.970> an<00:02:46.090> adorian<00:02:46.750> so

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.660 

okay<00:02:59.530> some<00:02:59.770> different<00:03:00.040> interval<00:03:00.340> things<00:03:00.520> we

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
okay some different interval things we

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.230 
okay some different interval things we
can<00:03:00.819> do<00:03:00.910> there<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.930> other<00:03:02.080> thing<00:03:02.230> we<00:03:02.350> can<00:03:02.500> do

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
can do there the other thing we can do

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.130 
can do there the other thing we can do
that<00:03:04.240> we<00:03:04.270> haven't<00:03:04.420> talked<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.600> lot<00:03:04.750> about<00:03:04.810> but

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
that we haven't talked a lot about but

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.930 
that we haven't talked a lot about but
is<00:03:05.290> doing<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.770> real<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.069> simple<00:03:06.520> hammer-on<00:03:06.880> and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
is doing a real a simple hammer-on and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.280 
is doing a real a simple hammer-on and
pull-off<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:08.140> as<00:03:08.709> opposed<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.160> doing<00:03:10.290> three

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
pull-off and as opposed to doing three

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.430 
pull-off and as opposed to doing three
notes<00:03:11.500> on<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.709> string<00:03:11.980> just<00:03:12.459> do<00:03:12.580> two<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.440> simple

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
notes on a string just do two and simple

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.449 
notes on a string just do two and simple
as<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:15.090> fret<00:03:16.090> on<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:16.330> third<00:03:16.690> string<00:03:17.459> fret

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
as that fret on the third string fret

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.270 
as that fret on the third string fret
but<00:03:19.180> then<00:03:19.300> we're<00:03:19.390> going<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.540> move<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.870> down

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
but then we're going to move that down

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.479 
but then we're going to move that down
and<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:21.940> we're<00:03:22.060> gonna<00:03:22.150> go

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.500 

actually<00:03:27.489> just<00:03:27.670> go<00:03:27.760> move<00:03:27.970> back<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.299> forth

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
actually just go move back and forth

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.800 
actually just go move back and forth
within<00:03:28.720> our<00:03:28.959> scale<00:03:29.230> within<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.650> door<00:03:30.810> with

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
within our scale within the door with

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.690 
within our scale within the door with
some<00:03:31.989> hammer-ons<00:03:32.349> and<00:03:32.439> pull-offs<00:03:32.579> so<00:03:33.579> now

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
some hammer-ons and pull-offs so now

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.890 
some hammer-ons and pull-offs so now
let's<00:03:33.909> take<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.060> listen<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.480> track<00:03:34.689> and

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
let's take a listen to the track and

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.479 
let's take a listen to the track and
we'll<00:03:35.260> see<00:03:35.409> how<00:03:35.500> we<00:03:35.560> can<00:03:35.799> apply<00:03:36.010> these<00:03:36.129> over

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
we'll see how we can apply these over

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.150 
we'll see how we can apply these over
the<00:03:36.579> top<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.879> the<00:03:36.939> track
