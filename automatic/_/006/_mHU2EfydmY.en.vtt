00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
add some translucent contact paper

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.179 
add some translucent contact paper
around<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> book<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.540> secure<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.110> for<00:01:59.040> this

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
around the book to secure it for this

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.950 
around the book to secure it for this
step<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.460> almost<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.240> repeat<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> same

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
step you almost have to repeat the same

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.840 
step you almost have to repeat the same
steps<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.890> by<00:02:02.070> covering<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> book

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
steps as you do it by covering the book

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.330

to<00:02:03.540> avoid<00:02:03.899> bubbles<00:02:04.409> underneath<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.159> use

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
to avoid bubbles underneath you can use

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.490 
to avoid bubbles underneath you can use
a<00:02:05.549> ruler<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.090> slowly<00:02:06.479> move<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.990> towards<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
a ruler and slowly move it towards the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.290 
a ruler and slowly move it towards the
edge<00:02:07.680> while<00:02:08.160> releasing<00:02:08.550> more<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.149> more

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300

contact paper

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.149 
contact paper
then<00:02:11.629> just<00:02:11.840> cut<00:02:12.049> off<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.260> excess<00:02:12.709> contact

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
then just cut off the excess contact

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.979 
then just cut off the excess contact
paper<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.700> go<00:02:13.849> on<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.209> rest<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.659> the<00:02:14.750> paper

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
paper and go on the rest of the paper

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.180 
paper and go on the rest of the paper
and<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.650> get<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:15.799> cute<00:02:16.099> notebook<00:02:16.340> cover<00:02:18.190> but

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190

washi tape and fold over the excess tip
to<00:02:28.879> the<00:02:29.000> inside<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.750> decided<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.799> decorate<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.619 
front only so I cut off the tape around
the<00:02:33.650> spine<00:02:33.950> if<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.670> covered<00:02:34.970> everything<00:02:35.269> as

now let's decorate our pants there are

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.150 
now let's decorate our pants there are
several<00:02:47.599> ways<00:02:47.930> how<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.230> can<00:02:48.470> decorate<00:02:48.620> them

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
several ways how you can decorate them

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.220 
several ways how you can decorate them
first<00:02:49.609> you<00:02:49.790> can<00:02:49.940> take<00:02:50.150> washi<00:02:50.420> tape<00:02:50.750> around<00:02:51.049> the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
first you can take washi tape around the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.410 
first you can take washi tape around the
whole<00:02:51.440> bald<00:02:51.769> pan<00:02:52.099> by<00:02:52.340> turning<00:02:52.700> around<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.120> pan

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
whole bald pan by turning around the pan

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.680 
whole bald pan by turning around the pan
while<00:02:53.720> adding<00:02:54.230> more<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.620> more<00:02:54.680> tape<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.430> it

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
while adding more and more tape to it

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.360 
while adding more and more tape to it
but<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.840> can<00:02:56.989> also<00:02:57.200> attach<00:02:57.739> washi<00:02:58.040> tape

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
but you can also attach washi tape

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.420 
but you can also attach washi tape
around<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.819> refill<00:02:59.359> as<00:02:59.510> well<00:02:59.810> or<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.769> can<00:03:01.129> cut

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
around the refill as well or you can cut

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.250 
around the refill as well or you can cut
off<00:03:01.579> some<00:03:01.790> decorative<00:03:02.120> paper<00:03:02.599> that<00:03:02.930> has<00:03:03.109> the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
off some decorative paper that has the

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.039 
off some decorative paper that has the
same<00:03:03.470> size<00:03:03.799> as<00:03:04.099> your<00:03:04.280> PIN<00:03:04.549> and<00:03:04.780> then<00:03:05.780> wrap<00:03:06.019> it

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
same size as your PIN and then wrap it

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.899 
same size as your PIN and then wrap it
around<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.620> refill<00:03:07.069> so<00:03:07.340> it's<00:03:07.489> a<00:03:07.549> bit<00:03:07.730> easier

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
around the refill so it's a bit easier

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.479 
around the refill so it's a bit easier
to<00:03:08.150> roll<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.690> then<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.620> just<00:03:09.650> need<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.129> put<00:03:10.370> the
