 here where it says look for software from 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.979

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.060
 unknown as to the device 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.280
 unknown again be the same 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.470
 process to update software 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.030
 we are going to give here in search with software 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.700
 of controller we will give you in 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:34.369
 examine and we're going to select the one that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:37.280
 says win 7 to 64 or if you want you can 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.990
 do with the one that says and if cappa is acy 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.000
 cab driver I'm going to leave these 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.340
 files in the description of the video well 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.830
 How good I am going to do with the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.400
 windows 7 64 will give you to accept the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.970
 next and as you see is already 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.700
 the controller once it has 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.730
 installed, we close it and now it's going 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.900
 to appear here where this says 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.940
 sound and video controllers and 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.880
 game devices here is ok 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.179
 then once this has happened already 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.750
 you can disconnect the sicab aei 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.930
 port and so direct to the compu and you're going 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.420
 to connect now your extension usb ok and 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.210
 you have to admit that you do not 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.430
 he recognizes why he does not recognize her 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.940
 it's something I do not know what fart so I 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.940
 allow 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.810
 personally, I think that what 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.030
 happens is that the extension of that brings 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.780
 so it does not work so I'm going to 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.780
 try another extension to see if 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.780
 works 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.220
 ok apparently if the extension works 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.860
 that came with the sicab serves us so 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.800
 is from the do not be done in 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.690
 anything with it ok now I'm going 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.490
 to connect to the new extension that 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.470
 I just put 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.960
 waiting for her to recognize her or that she 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.930
 it seems already recognized it well let's go 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.090
 here my documents 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.000
 let's go to team let's see 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.800
 properties 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.830
 let's go to administration of 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.890
 devices or administrator excuse 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:20.610
 I'm confused and we're going to see in these 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.530
 jockey and the extension appears confirmed 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.380
 usb that brings and if here it serves us in 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.900
 windows 8 and the only way that what 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.330
 occupy is using an extension 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.770
 extra in this case I did it now I'm going 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.250
 to proceed to connect the sicab 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:40.110
 to see how it is ok so good 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.110
 I hope and serve you this video tutorial
