00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
and they're funny funny rendering which

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.540 
and they're funny funny rendering which
just<00:00:43.840> is<00:00:44.320> a<00:00:44.380> little<00:00:44.500> bit<00:00:44.770> strange<00:00:45.040> let's<00:00:45.340> start

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
just is a little bit strange let's start

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.060 
just is a little bit strange let's start
up<00:00:45.640> this<00:00:45.760> clock<00:00:46.060> over<00:00:46.300> here<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.630> if<00:00:47.500> i<00:00:47.650> go<00:00:47.890> into

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
up this clock over here and if i go into

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.980 
up this clock over here and if i go into
game<00:00:48.940> mood<00:00:49.620> survival<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:51.630> and<00:00:52.630> i<00:00:52.780> just

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
game mood survival and and i just

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.180 
game mood survival and and i just
figured<00:00:53.320> that<00:00:53.350> this<00:00:53.560> was<00:00:53.710> quite<00:00:53.890> a<00:00:53.980> nice

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
figured that this was quite a nice

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.630 
figured that this was quite a nice
little<00:00:55.090> bridge<00:00:55.450> here<00:00:55.770> look<00:00:56.770> at<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:56.950> bridge

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
little bridge here look at a bridge

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.790 
little bridge here look at a bridge
design<00:00:58.000> because<00:00:58.180> schultz<00:00:58.570> shoka's<00:00:59.020> are<00:00:59.230> a

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
design because schultz shoka's are a

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.690 
design because schultz shoka's are a
very<00:01:00.550> unique<00:01:00.940> mob<00:01:01.740> in<00:01:02.740> terms<00:01:03.070> of<00:01:03.220> properties

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
very unique mob in terms of properties

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.450 
very unique mob in terms of properties
that<00:01:03.730> they<00:01:04.030> have<00:01:04.299> and<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:05.649> very<00:01:05.799> sort<00:01:06.159> of<00:01:06.219> new

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
that they have and and very sort of new

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.190 
that they have and and very sort of new
they<00:01:07.030> are<00:01:07.240> they<00:01:08.170> have<00:01:08.350> a<00:01:08.609> sort<00:01:09.609> of<00:01:09.670> collision

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
they are they have a sort of collision

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.410 
they are they have a sort of collision
just<00:01:11.200> like<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> normal<00:01:11.679> block<00:01:12.340> so<00:01:12.909> you<00:01:12.969> can<00:01:13.179> walk

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
just like a normal block so you can walk

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.270 
just like a normal block so you can walk
over<00:01:13.780> them<00:01:13.929> without<00:01:14.049> any<00:01:14.409> problems<00:01:14.859> now<00:01:15.070> this

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
over them without any problems now this

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.520 
over them without any problems now this
is<00:01:15.490> amazing<00:01:16.149> because<00:01:16.569> they're<00:01:16.840> also<00:01:17.020> while

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
is amazing because they're also while

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.260 
is amazing because they're also while
having<00:01:17.950> this<00:01:18.100> collision<00:01:18.640> which<00:01:18.939> is<00:01:19.060> like<00:01:19.240> a

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
having this collision which is like a

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.959 
having this collision which is like a
block<00:01:19.979> they<00:01:20.979> still<00:01:21.429> act<00:01:21.640> like<00:01:22.679> entities<00:01:23.969> which

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
block they still act like entities which

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.370 
block they still act like entities which
means<00:01:25.210> we<00:01:25.329> can<00:01:25.450> teleport<00:01:25.719> them<00:01:25.869> around<00:01:26.079> and<00:01:26.319> we

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
means we can teleport them around and we

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.410 
means we can teleport them around and we
can<00:01:26.499> move<00:01:26.649> them<00:01:26.920> or<00:01:27.100> we<00:01:27.609> should<00:01:27.909> be<00:01:28.060> able<00:01:28.179> to

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
can move them or we should be able to

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.230 
can move them or we should be able to
teleport<00:01:28.569> them<00:01:28.869> around<00:01:29.079> and<00:01:29.350> move<00:01:29.530> them

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
teleport them around and move them

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.760 
teleport them around and move them
currently<00:01:31.240> we<00:01:31.569> can<00:01:31.840> I've<00:01:32.079> tried<00:01:32.409> I've<00:01:32.439> tried

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
currently we can I've tried I've tried

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.580 
currently we can I've tried I've tried
doing<00:01:33.310> let's<00:01:33.999> go<00:01:34.539> back<00:01:34.689> into<00:01:34.840> creative<00:01:35.200> mode<00:01:35.380> I

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
doing let's go back into creative mode I

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.039 
doing let's go back into creative mode I
tried<00:01:36.130> doing<00:01:36.639> all<00:01:36.909> kinds<00:01:37.389> of<00:01:37.479> stuff<00:01:37.749> and

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
tried doing all kinds of stuff and

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.499 
tried doing all kinds of stuff and
teleporting<00:01:38.799> them<00:01:38.889> and<00:01:39.189> whatnot<00:01:39.729> but<00:01:40.270> they

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
teleporting them and whatnot but they

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.260 
teleporting them and whatnot but they
they<00:01:40.869> don't<00:01:40.990> quite<00:01:41.319> like<00:01:42.039> being<00:01:42.490> teleported

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
they don't quite like being teleported

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.719 
they don't quite like being teleported
but<00:01:43.659> once<00:01:43.840> they<00:01:44.020> can<00:01:44.229> be<00:01:44.350> teleported<00:01:44.859> what<00:01:45.639> we

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
but once they can be teleported what we

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:46.919 
but once they can be teleported what we
should<00:01:45.909> be<00:01:45.999> able<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.240> do<00:01:46.329> is<00:01:46.389> make<00:01:46.569> moving

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
should be able to do is make moving

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.010 
should be able to do is make moving
platforms<00:01:48.149> before<00:01:49.149> you<00:01:49.389> could<00:01:49.630> do<00:01:49.780> moving

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
platforms before you could do moving

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.599 
platforms before you could do moving
platforms<00:01:50.619> but<00:01:50.740> you'd<00:01:50.859> have<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.039> use<00:01:51.280> stuff

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
platforms but you'd have to use stuff

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:52.889 
platforms but you'd have to use stuff
like<00:01:51.700> barrier<00:01:52.179> blocks<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.689> what<00:01:52.780> have<00:01:52.869> you

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
like barrier blocks and what have you

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.020 
like barrier blocks and what have you
the<00:01:53.770> barrier<00:01:54.069> blocks<00:01:54.280> are<00:01:54.429> underneath<00:01:54.729> this

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
the barrier blocks are underneath this

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.069 
the barrier blocks are underneath this
bridge<00:01:55.389> currently<00:01:56.289> because<00:01:57.959> another<00:01:58.959> thing

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
bridge currently because another thing

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.870 
bridge currently because another thing
is<00:01:59.560> even<00:02:00.130> if<00:02:00.219> you<00:02:00.399> summon<00:02:00.759> them<00:02:01.029> with<00:02:01.209> no<00:02:01.869> AI<00:02:02.880> if

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
is even if you summon them with no AI if

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.789 
is even if you summon them with no AI if
you<00:02:04.029> summon<00:02:04.209> them<00:02:04.359> with<00:02:04.450> no<00:02:04.600> way<00:02:04.719> I<00:02:04.749> they<00:02:05.200> still

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
you summon them with no way I they still

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.160 
you summon them with no way I they still
just<00:02:06.479> teleport<00:02:07.479> away<00:02:07.569> from<00:02:07.869> you<00:02:07.959> oh<00:02:08.140> I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
just teleport away from you oh I

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.020 
just teleport away from you oh I
currently<00:02:08.439> have<00:02:08.709> that<00:02:08.890> thing<00:02:09.459> on<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:09.789> every

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
currently have that thing on so every

all of the shelters are being turned
invisible<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:12.069> that's<00:02:12.760> another<00:02:12.849> thing<00:02:13.120> about

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
invisible and that's another thing about

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.020 
invisible and that's another thing about
them<00:02:13.540> what

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
them what

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.620 
them what

white<00:02:17.630> boxers<00:02:18.200> this<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.500> where<00:02:18.650> their<00:02:18.770> heads

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
white boxers this is where their heads

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.660 
white boxers this is where their heads
would<00:02:19.400> be<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:20.569> funny<00:02:20.810> thing<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:21.980> there

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
would be and a funny thing is is there

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.660 
would be and a funny thing is is there
rendering<00:02:25.510> for<00:02:26.510> their<00:02:26.840> heads<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.890> broken

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
rendering for their heads is is broken

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.220 
rendering for their heads is is broken
but<00:02:28.819> not<00:02:28.940> like<00:02:29.120> completely<00:02:29.600> broken<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.050> if<00:02:30.140> i

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
but not like completely broken so if i

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.620 
but not like completely broken so if i
go<00:02:30.260> into<00:02:30.500> like<00:02:30.770> five<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.100> i<00:02:31.400> stand<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:31.940> this<00:02:32.120> so

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
go into like five and i stand on this so

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.180 
go into like five and i stand on this so
this<00:02:32.780> schalke<00:02:33.230> doesn't<00:02:33.650> have<00:02:33.800> invisibility

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
this schalke doesn't have invisibility

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.059 
this schalke doesn't have invisibility
and<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.700> rest<00:02:34.940> do<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.840> now<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.350> can<00:02:36.680> see<00:02:36.920> the

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
and the rest do and now you can see the

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.760 
and the rest do and now you can see the
face<00:02:37.280> but<00:02:38.000> if<00:02:38.090> i<00:02:38.180> move<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.630> one<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.170> one

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
face but if i move to this one the one

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.030 
face but if i move to this one the one
over<00:02:39.800> there<00:02:40.569> has<00:02:41.569> no<00:02:41.810> texture<00:02:42.290> but<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.800> ones

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
over there has no texture but the ones

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.790 
over there has no texture but the ones
past<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:44.060> one<00:02:44.360> without<00:02:44.720> invisibility<00:02:45.350> are

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
past the one without invisibility are

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.720 
past the one without invisibility are
rendered<00:02:46.690> with<00:02:47.690> texture<00:02:48.380> which<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.220> totally

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
rendered with texture which is totally

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.100 
rendered with texture which is totally
strange<00:02:50.060> that's<00:02:50.630> just<00:02:50.959> ice<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.620> because

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
strange that's just ice it because

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.100 
strange that's just ice it because
positive<00:02:54.110> x<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.500> this<00:02:54.739> way<00:02:55.840> positive<00:02:56.840> zed<00:02:57.080> is

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
positive x is this way positive zed is

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.660 
positive x is this way positive zed is
this<00:02:57.470> way<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:57.950> game<00:02:58.100> renders<00:02:58.489> in<00:02:58.580> that

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
this way and the game renders in that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.949 
this way and the game renders in that
direction<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.090> i<00:02:59.120> guess<00:02:59.300> what<00:02:59.450> happens<00:02:59.750> as<00:02:59.870> it

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
direction so i guess what happens as it

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.690 
direction so i guess what happens as it
goes<00:03:00.110> through<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.950> then<00:03:01.040> once<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.400> gets<00:03:01.580> to

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
goes through and then once it gets to

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.640 
goes through and then once it gets to
the<00:03:01.850> one<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:02.390> actually<00:03:02.780> isn't<00:03:03.620> invisible

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
the one that actually isn't invisible

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.900 
the one that actually isn't invisible
these<00:03:06.650> ones<00:03:06.920> then<00:03:08.410> get<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.440> texture<00:03:09.890> because<00:03:10.790> of

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
these ones then get a texture because of

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.380 
these ones then get a texture because of
this<00:03:11.060> one<00:03:11.300> I<00:03:11.800> thinking<00:03:12.800> that<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.100> means<00:03:13.970> that

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
this one I thinking that that means that

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.590 
this one I thinking that that means that
actually<00:03:15.319> displaying<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:17.120> head<00:03:17.330> at<00:03:17.450> all

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
actually displaying the the head at all

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.360 
actually displaying the the head at all
is<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.230> bargain<00:03:18.500> I'm<00:03:18.769> hoping<00:03:18.950> that's<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.280> case

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
is a bargain I'm hoping that's the case

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.120 
is a bargain I'm hoping that's the case
I'm<00:03:20.209> hoping<00:03:20.480> once<00:03:20.750> 1.9<00:03:21.440> actually<00:03:21.829> comes<00:03:21.980> out

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
I'm hoping once 1.9 actually comes out

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.400 
I'm hoping once 1.9 actually comes out
and<00:03:22.310> they've<00:03:22.400> lined<00:03:22.670> out<00:03:22.880> these<00:03:23.090> bugs<00:03:23.360> what<00:03:24.290> it

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
and they've lined out these bugs what it

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.039 
and they've lined out these bugs what it
will<00:03:24.560> mean<00:03:24.590> is<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.910> don't<00:03:26.420> don't<00:03:26.600> even<00:03:26.780> ask<00:03:26.870> me

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
will mean is it don't don't even ask me

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.569 
will mean is it don't don't even ask me
about<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.320> black<00:03:27.500> box<00:03:27.799> one<00:03:28.070> because<00:03:28.400> that's

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
about the black box one because that's

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:29.890 
about the black box one because that's
strange<00:03:28.880> it<00:03:29.030> seems<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.329> depend<00:03:29.600> on<00:03:29.720> Y

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
strange it seems to depend on Y

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.509 
strange it seems to depend on Y
coordinates<00:03:30.170> see<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.769> one<00:03:30.950> there<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.250> turns

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
coordinates see that one there it turns

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.120 
coordinates see that one there it turns
strange<00:03:32.360> I<00:03:32.540> think<00:03:33.290> what<00:03:33.410> this<00:03:33.530> will<00:03:33.739> mean<00:03:33.769> is

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
strange I think what this will mean is

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.460 
strange I think what this will mean is
when<00:03:34.610> we<00:03:34.790> make<00:03:35.000> them<00:03:35.209> invisible<00:03:35.299> they<00:03:36.230> will<00:03:36.440> be

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
when we make them invisible they will be

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.060 
when we make them invisible they will be
entirely<00:03:37.220> invisible<00:03:37.489> in<00:03:38.030> 1.9<00:03:38.480> III<00:03:39.230> think<00:03:39.530> I'm

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
entirely invisible in 1.9 III think I'm

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.069 
entirely invisible in 1.9 III think I'm
not<00:03:40.340> entirely<00:03:40.610> sure<00:03:40.790> I'm<00:03:41.150> just<00:03:41.450> assuming<00:03:41.720> here

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
not entirely sure I'm just assuming here

not entirely sure I'm just assuming here
this<00:03:42.260> is<00:03:42.380> this<00:03:42.620> entire<00:03:42.920> thing<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.280> speculation

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
this is this entire thing is speculation

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.349 
this is this entire thing is speculation
science<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:46.100> thinking<00:03:46.880> about<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.180> future

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
science and thinking about the future

science and thinking about the future
but<00:03:48.350> if<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.769> is<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:49.220> case<00:03:49.250> what<00:03:49.700> we<00:03:49.820> can<00:03:50.120> do

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
but if that is the case what we can do

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.970 
but if that is the case what we can do
is<00:03:50.570> we<00:03:50.780> because<00:03:51.230> I<00:03:51.380> once<00:03:51.560> again<00:03:51.829> they're

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
is we because I once again they're

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.890 
is we because I once again they're
entities<00:03:52.370> we<00:03:52.549> can<00:03:52.670> run<00:03:52.850> commands<00:03:53.390> very<00:03:53.600> easily

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
entities we can run commands very easily

by<00:03:54.260> them<00:03:54.530> is<00:03:54.739> we<00:03:55.609> can<00:03:55.730> make<00:03:55.850> a<00:03:55.880> moving<00:03:56.359> bridge

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660

by them is we can make a moving bridge
that's<00:03:56.959> essentially<00:03:57.410> made<00:03:57.590> out<00:03:57.739> any<00:03:57.980> material

or<00:03:58.880> at<00:03:59.180> least<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.660> looks<00:03:59.989> like<00:04:00.230> it's<00:04:00.410> made<00:04:00.590> of

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
or at least it looks like it's made of

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.229 
or at least it looks like it's made of
any<00:04:00.829> material<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:01.519> we<00:04:01.579> can<00:04:01.730> make<00:04:01.850> it<00:04:02.030> move

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
any material and we can make it move

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.560 
any material and we can make it move
backwards<00:04:02.959> and<00:04:03.109> forwards<00:04:03.530> we<00:04:03.680> can<00:04:03.829> make<00:04:04.570> using

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
backwards and forwards we can make using

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.900 
backwards and forwards we can make using
custom<00:04:05.959> resource<00:04:06.260> packs<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.859> the<00:04:07.489> new<00:04:07.609> damage

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
custom resource packs and the new damage

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.390 
custom resource packs and the new damage
models<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.359> stuff<00:04:08.540> we<00:04:09.079> could<00:04:09.260> have<00:04:09.440> armor

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
models and stuff we could have armor

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.220 
models and stuff we could have armor
stands<00:04:10.670> at<00:04:11.090> their<00:04:11.269> location<00:04:11.570> or<00:04:11.870> have<00:04:12.049> you

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
stands at their location or have you

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.050 
stands at their location or have you
holding<00:04:13.540> holding<00:04:15.039> blocks<00:04:16.039> or<00:04:16.370> whatever<00:04:16.669> which

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
holding holding blocks or whatever which

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.930 
holding holding blocks or whatever which
are<00:04:17.510> displayed<00:04:18.079> like<00:04:18.260> boats<00:04:18.709> so<00:04:19.220> you<00:04:19.789> could

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
are displayed like boats so you could

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.870 
are displayed like boats so you could
imagine<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:20.539> we<00:04:20.660> actually<00:04:21.169> have<00:04:21.320> a

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
imagine that we actually have a

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.339 
imagine that we actually have a
something<00:04:22.880> which<00:04:23.150> physically<00:04:23.810> looks<00:04:24.110> like<00:04:24.320> a

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
something which physically looks like a

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.899 
something which physically looks like a
boat<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.710> you<00:04:24.800> could<00:04:24.919> add<00:04:25.070> up<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.370> pieces<00:04:25.580> of

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
boat and you could add up the pieces of

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.620 
boat and you could add up the pieces of
the<00:04:26.000> vote<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.570> you<00:04:26.659> can<00:04:26.870> have<00:04:27.020> an<00:04:27.110> armistice

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
the vote so you can have an armistice

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.490 
the vote so you can have an armistice
and<00:04:27.770> like<00:04:28.770> here<00:04:29.100> with<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:30.090> front<00:04:30.420> half<00:04:30.660> of

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
and like here with the front half of

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.200 
and like here with the front half of
this<00:04:31.650> part<00:04:31.980> on<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.220> front<00:04:32.460> half<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.790> that<00:04:32.910> part

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
this part on the front half of that part

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.030 
this part on the front half of that part
than<00:04:33.420> two<00:04:33.630> middle<00:04:33.990> pieces<00:04:34.200> and<00:04:34.590> then<00:04:34.680> two<00:04:34.860> end

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
than two middle pieces and then two end

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.770 
than two middle pieces and then two end
pieces<00:04:35.280> or<00:04:35.700> whatever<00:04:35.940> it's<00:04:36.150> difficult<00:04:36.540> for<00:04:36.630> me

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
pieces or whatever it's difficult for me

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.290 
pieces or whatever it's difficult for me
to<00:04:36.900> actually<00:04:37.050> explain<00:04:37.500> in<00:04:37.710> blocks<00:04:38.120> but<00:04:39.120> this

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
to actually explain in blocks but this

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.900 
to actually explain in blocks but this
is<00:04:39.450> sort<00:04:39.750> of<00:04:39.840> my<00:04:39.900> vision<00:04:40.410> for<00:04:40.770> what<00:04:40.890> we<00:04:41.040> can<00:04:41.220> use

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
is sort of my vision for what we can use

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.110 
is sort of my vision for what we can use
in<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.150> future<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.570> I<00:04:42.660> think<00:04:42.840> that<00:04:42.990> that

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
in the future and I think that that

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.700 
in the future and I think that that
smarter<00:04:45.120> people<00:04:45.240> than<00:04:45.420> I<00:04:45.600> will<00:04:45.810> try<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:46.560> do

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
smarter people than I will try and do

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.000 
smarter people than I will try and do
these<00:04:46.860> kinds<00:04:47.160> of<00:04:47.220> things<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.700> I<00:04:48.630> have

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
these kinds of things and I have

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.410 
these kinds of things and I have
basically<00:04:50.010> platforms<00:04:50.670> which<00:04:50.820> can<00:04:51.000> move<00:04:51.180> and

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
basically platforms which can move and

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.480 
basically platforms which can move and
I'll<00:04:51.540> have<00:04:51.720> collision<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:52.920> can<00:04:53.040> walk<00:04:53.220> on

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
I'll have collision and you can walk on

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.190 
I'll have collision and you can walk on
them<00:04:53.670> and<00:04:53.910> players<00:04:54.240> can<00:04:54.420> stand<00:04:54.690> on<00:04:54.870> them<00:04:55.020> and

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
them and players can stand on them and

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.520 
them and players can stand on them and
captains<00:04:55.740> will<00:04:55.890> move<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:56.700> what<00:04:57.330> have<00:04:57.480> you

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
captains will move and and what have you

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.050 
captains will move and and what have you
so<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.830> future<00:04:59.040> is<00:04:59.160> bright<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.520> future<00:05:00.000> is

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
so the future is bright the future is

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.580 
so the future is bright the future is
bright<00:05:00.240> in<00:05:00.390> the<00:05:00.450> future<00:05:00.720> of<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.840> Schalke<00:05:01.200> and

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
bright in the future of the Schalke and

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.690 
bright in the future of the Schalke and
its<00:05:02.070> use<00:05:02.340> spire<00:05:02.820> or<00:05:03.390> abuse<00:05:03.990> by<00:05:04.550> custom<00:05:05.550> map

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
its use spire or abuse by custom map

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.640 
its use spire or abuse by custom map
makers<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:06.210> stuff<00:05:06.390> is<00:05:06.570> going<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.170> be<00:05:07.320> great

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
makers and stuff is going to be great

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.490 
makers and stuff is going to be great
yeah<00:05:08.550> i<00:05:08.580> just<00:05:08.790> figured<00:05:09.240> i<00:05:09.330> throw<00:05:09.690> my<00:05:09.720> two<00:05:09.930> cents

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
yeah i just figured i throw my two cents

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.760 
yeah i just figured i throw my two cents
out<00:05:10.770> there<00:05:11.510> obviously<00:05:12.510> as<00:05:12.690> snapshots<00:05:13.500> are

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
out there obviously as snapshots are

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.440 
out there obviously as snapshots are
released<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.340> we<00:05:14.460> get<00:05:14.580> closer<00:05:14.820> today<00:05:15.120> we'll

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
released and we get closer today we'll

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.030 
released and we get closer today we'll
see<00:05:15.690> whether<00:05:15.870> or<00:05:16.080> not<00:05:16.200> these<00:05:16.650> invisible

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
see whether or not these invisible

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.860 
see whether or not these invisible
middle<00:05:17.670> bits<00:05:17.850> are<00:05:18.090> meant<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.450> be<00:05:18.480> here<00:05:18.750> or<00:05:18.930> not

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
middle bits are meant to be here or not

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.580 
middle bits are meant to be here or not
obviously<00:05:21.870> i<00:05:21.900> don't<00:05:22.020> think<00:05:22.260> they're<00:05:22.380> meant<00:05:22.560> to

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
obviously i don't think they're meant to

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.840 
obviously i don't think they're meant to
be<00:05:22.680> white<00:05:22.980> i<00:05:23.010> think<00:05:23.340> they're<00:05:23.460> meant<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.640> look

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
be white i think they're meant to look

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.670 
be white i think they're meant to look
like<00:05:23.910> heads<00:05:24.720> like<00:05:25.350> that<00:05:26.180> but<00:05:27.180> we<00:05:27.420> will<00:05:28.050> see<00:05:28.380> we

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
like heads like that but we will see we

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.020 
like heads like that but we will see we
will<00:05:28.710> see<00:05:29.100> how<00:05:29.280> everything<00:05:29.610> progresses<00:05:30.000> but

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
will see how everything progresses but

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.390 
will see how everything progresses but
this<00:05:30.240> is<00:05:30.360> just<00:05:30.390> a<00:05:30.570> cool<00:05:30.720> idea<00:05:31.100> this<00:05:32.100> could<00:05:32.310> have

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
this is just a cool idea this could have

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.400 
this is just a cool idea this could have
been<00:05:32.430> used<00:05:32.820> as<00:05:33.210> an<00:05:33.420> invisible<00:05:33.630> bridge<00:05:34.080> instead

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
been used as an invisible bridge instead

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.040 
been used as an invisible bridge instead
and<00:05:34.680> then<00:05:34.710> as<00:05:34.890> you<00:05:35.040> walk<00:05:35.190> across<00:05:35.340> it<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:36.840> sort

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
and then as you walk across it it sort

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.110 
and then as you walk across it it sort
of<00:05:37.170> becomes<00:05:37.680> visible<00:05:38.190> that's<00:05:38.670> what<00:05:38.850> this<00:05:38.940> was

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
of becomes visible that's what this was

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.630 
of becomes visible that's what this was
meant<00:05:39.390> to<00:05:39.480> be<00:05:39.570> but<00:05:39.810> of<00:05:39.930> course<00:05:40.140> the<00:05:40.640> Schalke

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
meant to be but of course the Schalke

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.210 
meant to be but of course the Schalke
heads<00:05:41.910> kind<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.390> ruin<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:42.810> aesthetic<00:05:43.350> just<00:05:44.070> a

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
heads kind of ruin the aesthetic just a

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.790
