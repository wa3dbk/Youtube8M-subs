that's<00:02:06.709> sort<00:02:06.889> of<00:02:06.919> an<00:02:07.039> amazing<00:02:07.669> statement<00:02:08.450> for

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
that's sort of an amazing statement for

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.690 
that's sort of an amazing statement for
somebody<00:02:09.200> like<00:02:09.229> Ken<00:02:09.590> Starr<00:02:09.890> who<00:02:10.070> devoted<00:02:10.430> so

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
somebody like Ken Starr who devoted so

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.490 
somebody like Ken Starr who devoted so
many<00:02:10.880> years<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.330> investigating<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.170> Clinton

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
many years to investigating the Clinton

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.610 
many years to investigating the Clinton
so<00:02:12.710> I<00:02:12.740> think

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
so I think

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.649 
so I think
the<00:02:13.920> they<00:02:14.700> understand<00:02:15.209> how<00:02:15.269> relationships

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
the they understand how relationships

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.860 
the they understand how relationships
drive<00:02:16.500> politics<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.370> how<00:02:17.489> how<00:02:18.299> humans

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
drive politics and how how humans

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.170 
drive politics and how how humans
interacting<00:02:19.620> with<00:02:19.799> each<00:02:19.830> other<00:02:20.099> is<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.670> basis

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
interacting with each other is the basis

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.240 
interacting with each other is the basis
of<00:02:21.209> politics<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.230> that's<00:02:22.860> what<00:02:23.099> they've

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
of politics and that's what they've

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.369 
of politics and that's what they've
tried<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.730> accomplish<00:02:24.060> by<00:02:24.450> trying<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.140> win

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
tried to accomplish by trying to win

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.229 
tried to accomplish by trying to win
over<00:02:25.620> all<00:02:25.980> these<00:02:26.159> Republican<00:02:26.849> system

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
over all these Republican system

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.759 
over all these Republican system
adequate<00:02:27.659> have<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:27.930> won<00:02:28.140> over<00:02:28.379> enough<00:02:28.620> this

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
adequate have they won over enough this

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:29.839 
adequate have they won over enough this
is<00:02:28.890> kind<00:02:29.069> of<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.159> question<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.519> comes<00:02:29.640> out<00:02:29.819> of

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
is kind of a question that comes out of

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.550 
is kind of a question that comes out of
your<00:02:29.940> book<00:02:30.329> had<00:02:30.720> they<00:02:30.870> won<00:02:31.049> over<00:02:31.290> enough

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
your book had they won over enough

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.680 
your book had they won over enough
people<00:02:31.890> on<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> Republican<00:02:32.640> side<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:33.390> it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
people on the Republican side that it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.789 
people on the Republican side that it
would<00:02:33.840> be<00:02:33.959> hard<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.290> build<00:02:34.440> kind<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.739> a

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
would be hard to build kind of a

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.250 
would be hard to build kind of a
coalition<00:02:35.010> against<00:02:35.849> Hillary<00:02:36.180> well<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.140> think

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
coalition against Hillary well I think

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.670 
coalition against Hillary well I think
so<00:02:37.950> my<00:02:38.190> book<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.640> they<00:02:38.909> basically<00:02:39.530> leave<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
so my book is they basically leave the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.930 
so my book is they basically leave the
White<00:02:40.829> House<00:02:41.010> really<00:02:41.340> have<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.549> problem<00:02:41.760> with

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
White House really have a problem with

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.750 
White House really have a problem with
Republicans<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.810> then<00:02:43.049> they<00:02:43.379> lose<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:44.010> 2008

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
Republicans and then they lose in 2008

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.920 
Republicans and then they lose in 2008
too<00:02:44.970> because<00:02:45.390> they<00:02:45.510> don't<00:02:45.660> have<00:02:45.690> enough

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
too because they don't have enough

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.259 
too because they don't have enough
Democratic<00:02:46.440> support<00:02:46.829> they<00:02:47.190> had<00:02:47.370> given<00:02:48.150> too

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
Democratic support they had given too

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.670 
Democratic support they had given too
much<00:02:48.359> focus<00:02:48.629> to<00:02:48.840> Republicans<00:02:49.349> they<00:02:49.440> sort<00:02:49.650> of

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
much focus to Republicans they sort of

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.500 
much focus to Republicans they sort of
forgotten<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.340> sort<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.879> took<00:02:51.000> for<00:02:51.480> granted

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
forgotten and sort of took for granted

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.690 
forgotten and sort of took for granted
the<00:02:51.930> Democrats<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.769> think<00:02:53.250> that's<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.459> massive

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
the Democrats I think that's a massive

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.780 
the Democrats I think that's a massive
problem<00:02:54.329> in<00:02:55.200> 2008<00:02:55.890> that's<00:02:56.129> why<00:02:56.280> Democrats

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
problem in 2008 that's why Democrats

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.160 
problem in 2008 that's why Democrats
choose<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.150> person<00:02:57.299> they<00:02:57.480> don't<00:02:57.690> know<00:02:57.870> Barack

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
choose the person they don't know Barack

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.509 
choose the person they don't know Barack
Obama<00:02:58.470> over<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.799> person<00:02:59.099> they<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.250> know

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
Obama over the person they do know

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.030 
Obama over the person they do know
Hillary<00:02:59.970> Clinton<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:00.629> I<00:03:00.840> think<00:03:01.230> her<00:03:01.680> going

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
Hillary Clinton so I think her going

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.460 
Hillary Clinton so I think her going
into<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.519> State<00:03:02.760> Department<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:03.480> her<00:03:03.810> trying

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
into the State Department and her trying

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.380 
into the State Department and her trying
to<00:03:04.530> be<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> foil<00:03:05.069> foot<00:03:05.370> soldier<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:05.940> President

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
to be a foil foot soldier for President

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.500 
to be a foil foot soldier for President
Obama<00:03:06.629> has<00:03:06.930> really<00:03:07.530> been<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:08.090> nod<00:03:09.090> or<00:03:09.120> an

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
Obama has really been a nod or an

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.390 
Obama has really been a nod or an
acknowledgement<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.859> yes<00:03:11.069> I<00:03:11.250> have

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
acknowledgement that that yes I have

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.979 
acknowledgement that that yes I have
these<00:03:11.549> problems<00:03:11.819> with<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.299> Democratic<00:03:12.840> base

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
these problems with the Democratic base

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.110 
these problems with the Democratic base
and<00:03:13.319> trying<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.709> shore<00:03:14.010> up<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.280> support<00:03:14.940> I

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
and trying to shore up that support I

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.259 
and trying to shore up that support I
think<00:03:16.129> given<00:03:17.129> all<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.489> she<00:03:17.730> sort<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.000> moved

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
think given all that she sort of moved

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.940 
think given all that she sort of moved
away<00:03:18.480> from<00:03:18.959> some<00:03:19.139> of<00:03:19.169> these<00:03:19.290> relationships

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
away from some of these relationships

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.379 
away from some of these relationships
with<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.400> Republicans<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.090> think<00:03:21.269> they're

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
with the Republicans I think they're

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.909 
with the Republicans I think they're
still<00:03:21.569> dare<00:03:21.870> they're<00:03:22.260> they're<00:03:22.500> still<00:03:22.650> dormant

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
still dare they're they're still dormant

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.339 
still dare they're they're still dormant
but<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.760> don't<00:03:23.970> think<00:03:24.239> they're<00:03:24.450> gonna<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:25.230> know

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
but I don't think they're gonna you know

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.960 
but I don't think they're gonna you know
I<00:03:25.500> don't<00:03:25.680> think<00:03:25.859> that<00:03:26.130> many<00:03:26.280> Republicans

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
I don't think that many Republicans

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.309 
I don't think that many Republicans
ultimately<00:03:27.419> are<00:03:27.540> going<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.720> vote<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:27.900> a

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
ultimately are going to vote for a

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.250 
ultimately are going to vote for a
Hillary<00:03:28.680> Clinton<00:03:29.629> candidacy<00:03:30.629> if<00:03:30.780> Hillary

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
Hillary Clinton candidacy if Hillary

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.900 
Hillary Clinton candidacy if Hillary
does<00:03:31.500> one<00:03:31.889> what<00:03:32.220> would<00:03:32.370> be<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.669> role<00:03:32.879> of

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
does one what would be the role of

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.990 
does one what would be the role of
President<00:03:33.599> Obama<00:03:33.840> or<00:03:34.109> Team<00:03:34.440> Obama<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:35.310> mean<00:03:35.700> do

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
President Obama or Team Obama I mean do

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.520 
President Obama or Team Obama I mean do
you<00:03:36.060> think<00:03:36.120> he<00:03:36.299> would<00:03:36.690> come<00:03:36.870> out<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.169> be<00:03:37.230> and

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
you think he would come out and be and

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.500 
you think he would come out and be and
be<00:03:37.590> supportive<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.340> her<00:03:38.519> yeah<00:03:38.790> absolutely<00:03:39.060> i

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
be supportive of her yeah absolutely i

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.150 
be supportive of her yeah absolutely i
think<00:03:39.629> president<00:03:40.260> obama<00:03:40.379> has<00:03:40.620> taken<00:03:41.010> to

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
think president obama has taken to

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.189 
think president obama has taken to
governing<00:03:42.030> through<00:03:42.239> executive<00:03:42.510> order<00:03:42.870> and

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
governing through executive order and

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.930 
governing through executive order and
executive<00:03:43.650> action<00:03:43.980> i<00:03:44.069> think<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.310> Republican

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
executive action i think a Republican

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.449 
executive action i think a Republican
coming<00:03:45.299> in<00:03:45.419> next<00:03:45.629> could<00:03:46.470> just<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:47.069> know<00:03:47.099> sign

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
coming in next could just you know sign

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.039 
coming in next could just you know sign
one<00:03:47.669> long<00:03:47.910> executive<00:03:48.540> order<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:48.810> would

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
one long executive order that would

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.500 
one long executive order that would
outdo<00:03:49.379> or<00:03:50.010> undermine<00:03:50.609> everything<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.180> he's

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
outdo or undermine everything that he's

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.780 
outdo or undermine everything that he's
done<00:03:51.540> he<00:03:51.989> needs<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.530> Democrat<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.489> most

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
done he needs a Democrat the most

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.460 
done he needs a Democrat the most
plausible<00:03:54.060> Democrat<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:54.900> right<00:03:55.139> now<00:03:55.290> is

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
plausible Democrat is right now is

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.750 
plausible Democrat is right now is
obviously<00:03:55.829> he'll<00:03:56.069> already<00:03:56.160> Clinton<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:56.639> and

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
obviously he'll already Clinton it and

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.789 
obviously he'll already Clinton it and
he<00:03:56.940> meets<00:03:57.239> Hillary<00:03:57.629> Clinton<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.680> think

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
he meets Hillary Clinton and so I think

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.860 
he meets Hillary Clinton and so I think
that<00:03:59.010> means<00:03:59.819> that<00:04:00.209> he's<00:04:00.389> going<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.599> want

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
that means that he's going to want

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.509 
that means that he's going to want
Hillary<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.769> become<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.190> next<00:04:02.489> president

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
Hillary to become the next president

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.819 
Hillary to become the next president
because<00:04:03.120> his<00:04:03.359> legacy<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:03.930> at<00:04:04.109> stake<00:04:04.349> he<00:04:04.650> has

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
because his legacy is at stake he has

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.580 
because his legacy is at stake he has
personal<00:04:05.340> interest<00:04:05.699> in<00:04:05.900> all<00:04:06.900> of<00:04:07.019> this<00:04:07.199> as<00:04:07.410> well
