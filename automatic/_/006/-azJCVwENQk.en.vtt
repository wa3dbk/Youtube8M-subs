vise

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.700 

so<00:01:53.789> I'm<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.390> gonna<00:01:54.509> test<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.079> spacing<00:01:55.679> for

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
so I'm just gonna test the spacing for

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.520 
so I'm just gonna test the spacing for
the<00:01:56.149> cans<00:01:57.500> so<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.649> height<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.729> width<00:02:00.530> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the cans so the height and the width so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.819 
the cans so the height and the width so
I<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.009> height<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.960> I'll<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.229> copy<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
I like this height and I'll just copy it

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:12.640 
I like this height and I'll just copy it
I'll<00:02:05.039> use<00:02:05.189> my<00:02:05.240> double<00:02:06.240> stop<00:02:06.509> age<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.110> copy<00:02:07.859> it

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.250 

and<00:02:13.650> now<00:02:13.980> I'll<00:02:14.160> date<00:02:14.730> will<00:02:14.849> cut<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.299> next

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and now I'll date will cut this next

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:46.660 
and now I'll date will cut this next
section

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.760 

so<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.700> cut<00:02:48.000> these<00:02:48.180> small<00:02:48.540> pieces<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.290> notched

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
so I cut these small pieces and notched

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.450 
so I cut these small pieces and notched
out<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.460> part<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.570> frame<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:53.220> will

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
out the part of the frame and this will

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.200 
out the part of the frame and this will
keep<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.240> paint<00:02:54.630> cans<00:02:54.930> from<00:02:55.200> falling<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:57.000> I'm

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
keep the paint cans from falling so I'm

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.690 
keep the paint cans from falling so I'm
just<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.630> glue<00:02:57.810> them<00:02:58.080> in<00:02:58.700> they're

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
just going to glue them in they're

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.220 
just going to glue them in they're
larger<00:03:00.270> than<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:02.250> piece<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.810> that's<00:03:03.990> easy

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
larger than the piece but that's easy

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.880 
larger than the piece but that's easy
I'll<00:03:04.740> trim<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.430> down<00:03:05.460> later
