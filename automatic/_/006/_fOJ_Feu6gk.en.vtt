00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
extremely efficient or fuel so we can

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.310 
extremely efficient or fuel so we can
put<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.090> very<00:03:21.330> small<00:03:21.600> amount<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:21.900> wood<00:03:22.110> in<00:03:22.230> it

put a very small amount of wood in it

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.530 
put a very small amount of wood in it
and<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.590> will<00:03:22.650> burn<00:03:22.920> hot<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:23.970> very<00:03:24.360> long

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
and it will burn hot for a very long

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.600 
and it will burn hot for a very long
time
