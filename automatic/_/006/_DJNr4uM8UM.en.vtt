00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.299
 the market for pellet stoves is in 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.550
 full development in France since 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.380
 more than five years pellets or pellets 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.539
 of wood is one of the resources 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.260
 energy for the future 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.390
 heating in France reinforced by the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.460
 new thermal regulations 2012 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.750
 individual renovation allows 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.790
 today to install ducts 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.790
 concentric on his waterproof appliances 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.789
 dinaqua designed his dif range he likes 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:47.129
 to meet those expectations through his 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.140
 double wall air blade said flow pellet 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.149
 allows simultaneous evacuation of gases 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.469
 burned the device and recover 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.180
 their costs necessary for combustion 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.530
 thanks to its waterproof design 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.989
 terminal dif like him maybe 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.820
 integrated on the roof without any obligation 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.270
 exceed the ridge of the dwelling of 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.520
 40 cm in renovation can also 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.619
 install horizontal system 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.369
 also called sucker on one of 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.369
 facades of the house 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.450
 our system says pellet flow presents 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.799
 the advantage of having folded edges 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.840
 this innovation ensures a 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.080
 high quality finish to all our 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.080
 products 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.710
 it also offers users of our 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.880
 duct system to no longer cut itself 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.020
 by manipulating our elements 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.780
 it was enough to think about it 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.820
 pinnacle made a theme for fumes 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.100
 in the lower part with its buffer 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.299
 integrated tours allows you to connect the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.299
 smoke exit from the hair 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.750
 1 t of air intakes with are flexible 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.030
 connection that is positioned at the 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.200
 above smoke tea and that's your 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.200
 connection is ready 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.760
 our dif system pleases him and manufactured 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.080
 with the highest level of requirement 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:21.190
 qualitative our plasma welding promotes 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.959
 especially the tightness of our ducts 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.760
 Extruded summer eliminates all risks 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.799
 condensate leakage since always 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.360
 we made the choice of materials from 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.010
 quality our conduit dif pleases him 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.130
 fits into this logic with a 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:46.069
 316l stainless steel design 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.630
 great durability dinaqua makes the 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.799
 choice to establish near the center 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.310
 scientific and technical building 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.709
 cstb a technical referential for implementation 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.180
 work for dif like him in this 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.440
 application technical document 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.989
 you will find all the information 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.910
 necessary for the implementation of the 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:08.510
 system dif like it is available 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:10.730
 on our website www.nice.com beyond 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.109
 of its high quality says flow play is a 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.170
 visible smoke duct in 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.150
 the individual dwelling in this respect dinac 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.160
 also offers his dif range he likes 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.160
 according to the color chart rattle
