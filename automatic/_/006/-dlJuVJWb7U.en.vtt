 awesome holes in the ground many 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.670
 have been the huge holes dug 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.650
 by man in his search for 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.110
 exploit the rich minerals that the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.450
 earth lodges in its entrails but the 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.490
 nature also does its part creating 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.560
 huge and amazing holes 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.090
 These are ten of the holes more

 kilometers is very rich in oil and gas 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.360
 natural in the 50s when the country 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.820
 it was still part of the Soviet Union 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.520
 the government wanted to take advantage of said 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.770
 resources making a well of about 60 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.469
 meters in diameter by 20 deep 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.809
 at present the crater is fenced 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.250
 to avoid accidents since it is one 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.950

 1971 during some prospecting works 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.800
 of gas from Soviet geologists who 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.140
 they saw how their team and their stores were 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.060
 swallowed by the earth actually 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.400
 they had discovered an underground cave 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.780
 full of natural gas as they checked 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.600
 after setting it on fire 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.660

 first diamond fever in the region 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.229
 When they arrived thousands of miners 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.940
 hill disappeared and the place that 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.700
 occupied was known as the great

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.349
 they have dug in the hole 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.130

 it has 22 meters of perimeter and it was 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.030
 up with the dam between 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.980
 years 1953 and 1957 the mouth of the sink was 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.290
 rises to the height at which the level 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.000
 of the water would start to be dangerous from 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.280
 so that when the limit is exceeded 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.010
 the excess liquid falls on its own

 through the containment dam not 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.200
 I would like to imagine being absorbed by that

 minerals were discovered in bin 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.390
 grand canyon in 1850 but it was not until 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.670
 1863 that began the extraction and the 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.140
 potential of the mineral resources of 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.230
 truck began to be widely 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.480
 recognized at the beginning mining was 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.280
 difficult due to the rugged terrain of 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.819
 the area but a railroad arrived on 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.670
 cannon in 1873 driving the increase of 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.239
 the mining activity to a large extent 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.250

 miles from the city of Belize it 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.940
 find a circle almost perfect the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.090
 which is more than 305 meters in diameter 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.889
 and about 123 meters deep the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.810
 hole is the entrance of what was a 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.830
 cavern system during the era of 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.810
 ice 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.850
 the ice melted and the sea level 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.800
 it rose the caverns were flooded 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.530
 creating what is now a magnet for the

 most intrepid divers in Belize 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.880
 There are many myths about this 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.460
 geological formation which has led to 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.950
 many inexperienced people to explore it to 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.350
 In mid-2008 , the 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.870

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.850
 disappeared for a long time together 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.860
 the skeletal remains of the adventurer 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.050
 found the camera that was 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.230
 which finally allowed to identify
