up vehicles with it or it could drop

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950 
up vehicles with it or it could drop
something<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.430> electric<00:01:29.970> currents<00:01:30.780> like

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.539 
something like electric currents like
the<00:01:31.110> railgun<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:31.829> maybe<00:01:32.070> minima

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the railgun but maybe minima

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.310 
the railgun but maybe minima
minimalistic<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.600> actually<00:01:33.750> works<00:01:34.110> online

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
minimalistic so it actually works online

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.200 
minimalistic so it actually works online
who<00:01:35.159> knows<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> might<00:01:35.610> actually<00:01:35.759> come<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
who knows it might actually come to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.370 
who knows it might actually come to
online<00:01:36.540> because<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.810> don't<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> railgun
