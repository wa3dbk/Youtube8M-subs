bus bar also the neutral bus bar you can

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.550 
bus bar also the neutral bus bar you can
see<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.179> bonding<00:01:45.780> strap<00:01:46.200> right<00:01:46.500> here

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
see this is a bonding strap right here

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.550 
see this is a bonding strap right here
the<00:01:47.550> bonding<00:01:47.970> strap<00:01:48.330> should<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:48.840> connect<00:01:49.349> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the bonding strap should not connect the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.639 
the bonding strap should not connect the
neutral<00:01:50.069> bus<00:01:50.759> bar<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.479> cabinet<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.440> that's

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
neutral bus bar to the cabinet so that's

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.199 
neutral bus bar to the cabinet so that's
another<00:01:52.979> deficiency<00:01:53.789> that<00:01:53.819> we'll<00:01:54.179> be
