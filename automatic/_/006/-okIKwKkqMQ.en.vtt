00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.490
 I hope you are very well today 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.230
 let's talk about looks to wear 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.790
 during the summer we will combine 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.920
 trends that we live in spring 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.780
 summer making looks very very parents that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.340
 can use from in the city in the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.960
 beach or any place that I 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.200
 go on vacation let's see these 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.200
 books 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.220
 this first option is a very look 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.199
 summery because because I'm using 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.300
 many elements that we use in the 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.210
 summer first colors the color 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.890
 orange the color green the red up 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.750
 also dark colors we can start 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.220
 to use in summer because they already saw that 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.530
 everywhere it makes the same heat 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.350
 then we can mix it not so much 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.559
 neon is in garments but rather some 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.089
 other colors like the ones I mentioned 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.460
 I'm using the flower print that is 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.500
 a basic we saw it during the spring 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.690
 summer and we can continue to use it very 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.630
 very well this summer full of flowers 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.610
 we see pants we see blouses I wanted 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.619
 use this skirt is also in court to the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.020
 waist and has a land that goes to 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.460
 allow this to cover us completely 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.259
 we do not want to teach further 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.970
 It makes very good body this cut 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.729
 I'm sure it's going to favor 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.289
 all the blouse also has a tendency 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.270
 because it has a little bit of lace 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.009
 lace we saw everything that was 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.590
 during the day during the afternoon during 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.050
 the night can use it during the day as in 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.329
 this option in some blouse maybe not 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.620
 all lace but who likes it can 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.510
 opt for a little 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.820
 shoes shoes are also from 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.920
 great tendency because because the wicker 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.780
 This material is ideal for heat is 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.820
 very good for summer they also have 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.890
 three or four colors you have to look 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.990
 funny shoes you have to exaggerate in 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.730
 Our shoes is like an accessory 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.800
 very visible in our looks and we can 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.860
 innovate and we can opt for options 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.570
 different finally the bag me 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.820
 I've always said that lions are 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.740
 we can use them in 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.510
 spring in summer in autumn and even in 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.970
 winter right now maybe I would not use it 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.500
 both in clothes but in accessories 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.020
 Go crazy like for example this 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.520
 very cute little bag to use 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.730
 during the afternoon she is flirtatious and looks 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.730
 very well 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.390
 another very strong trend are the stripes 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.860
 and we had made a program 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.570
 specifying us on the lines the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.010
 we saw in horizontal and vertical but 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.700
 Now I want to give you looks for the 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.740
 summer 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.930
 then the sailor style will see it 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.520
 a lot of more it looks amazing we're going to 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.890
 see the colors that are used in this 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.550
 style are red blue and white 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.080
 the blue to which we speak to navy blue 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.670
 then you can experience 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.350
 can choose the skirt I wanted 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.940
 many stripes in this look but you 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.660
 they could opt for something else on say 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.950
 this smooth a navy blue and the little witch 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.050
 red or vice versa 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.510
 the red skirt the blue sachet can 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.360
 opt for a strapless sleeveless blouse 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.340
 Milestone Relax Feel cool to me 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.050
 they like T-shirts and especially 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.880
 those that are short then the only thing 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.920
 What I do is opt for a skirt that 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.650
 come more or less to the waist that 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.660
 arrive at this height so that he does not teach 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.400
 but they could use any other 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.080
 skirt they have only if they want to opt 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.150
 by this look you already saw the colors that 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.320
 they have to wear the shoes we can 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.020
 have fun with a lot of variety 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.620
 shoes we can make high shoes 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.540
 flip flops 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.280
 and we can even use these that are 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.799
 Palate style I also love 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.840
 they are comfortable they are versatile they look very 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.000
 very well I also wanted them to have another 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.780
 sailor touch have the anchor and others 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.700
 then they make this look much more ado 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.730
 as accessories I'm wearing a bracelet 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.379
 and a very basic ring is the gold me 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.530
 love the combination of gold with 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.140
 this style and finally a bag this 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.959
 bag is big this type bag type 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.879
 that kind of portfolio that we can put 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.569
 many things even the laptop to what 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.569
 You can think 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.290
 and also because not the points the 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.269
 points surely saw them very much 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.980
 They even used them because they can follow 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.530
 using them in summer they look amazing 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.909
 there are small points big points the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.200
 most of the time we're going to see it 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.829
 it is with the combination of black and white 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.840
 that's why I opted for this combination 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.639
 established is short is tied in front 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.620
 she is very flirtatious we can use it with something 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.449
 high or with something also in the hip not 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.360
 nothing happens I wanted to put on these jeans 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.710
 which are shorts, in fact, if they have 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.600
 jeans that are no longer left that no longer 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.220
 use the shorts and turn them around 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.840
 Very flirty shorts can be worn in summer 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.430
 we can combine it 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.470
 up with what they want could do 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.570
 points as I give them the option or could 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.100
 make stripes flowers what comes to mind 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.979
 that's why I recommend that if they have 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.350
 shorts are denim their Flatts 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.630
 We can use the flats, of course, 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.639
 for summer they are rich they are going to help us 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.530
 walk around to tour to do 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.260

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.300
 as accessories I have some bracelets 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.830
 with beads with spikes I'm 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.780
 combining a bit of everything 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.000
 use cute bracelets 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.950
 this summer and finally this bag 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.380
 It is also wicker what we talked about is 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.840
 an ideal material for the heat you see 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.900

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.190
 with gold we can do all the 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.139
 combinations that we want while 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.770
 see a balance and the look is followed 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.770

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.250
 this is the end a short little dress 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.630
 It's also lace that says no 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.160
 we can use the lace during the day 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.330
 during the afternoon this is a very good 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.770
 option a very simple casual way is 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.380
 a little dress as I said 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.090
 completely loose we could put 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.220
 If I want a belt all that 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.560
 I wanted is to put many accessories 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.230
 to give it more life I put this necklace 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.330
 This necklace that has more colors has 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.580
 two extra colors then it will highlight 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.320
