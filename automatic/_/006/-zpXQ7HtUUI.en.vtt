00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
through a scope you can simply run and

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.360 
through a scope you can simply run and
jump<00:03:14.800> down<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:16.350> land<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.500> right<00:03:17.530> inside<00:03:18.010> this

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
window sill and that was it saved your

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.940 
window sill and that was it saved your
life<00:03:23.160> because<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.940> person<00:03:25.180> was<00:03:25.420> chasing<00:03:25.750> you

life because the person was chasing you
they<00:03:26.950> wouldn't<00:03:27.280> know<00:03:27.400> what<00:03:27.790> would<00:03:28.120> have<00:03:28.239> known

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
they wouldn't know what would have known

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.940 
they wouldn't know what would have known
you<00:03:28.660> were<00:03:28.780> doing<00:03:29.260> so<00:03:29.440> they<00:03:29.560> would<00:03:29.709> have<00:03:29.799> jumped

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
you were doing so they would have jumped

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.280 
you were doing so they would have jumped
down<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.780> would<00:03:32.019> be<00:03:32.170> able<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.380> run<00:03:32.440> away

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.780 

and<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.549> last<00:03:36.700> glitch<00:03:38.340> I've<00:03:39.340> only<00:03:39.489> done<00:03:39.730> it

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
and the last glitch I've only done it

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.679 
and the last glitch I've only done it
once<00:03:39.879> by<00:03:40.209> myself<00:03:41.219> my<00:03:42.219> my<00:03:42.939> friend<00:03:43.269> came<00:03:43.569> over

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
once by myself my my friend came over

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:47.069 
once by myself my my friend came over
the<00:03:44.049> other<00:03:44.079> day<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.969> he<00:03:45.969> showed<00:03:46.209> me<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.659> this

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
the other day and he showed me and this

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.030 
the other day and he showed me and this
is<00:03:47.319> cool<00:03:47.560> but<00:03:47.769> it's<00:03:47.890> hard<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:50.859> like<00:03:51.010> a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
is cool but it's hard this is like a

00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:05.370 
is cool but it's hard this is like a
ladder<00:03:51.310> um<00:03:55.109> I'll<00:03:56.109> change<00:03:56.500> my<00:03:56.560> class<00:03:56.920> in<00:03:57.099> case

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.000 

Oh<00:04:05.460> tech<00:04:06.460> anyway<00:04:07.140> it's<00:04:08.140> easiest<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.770> give

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
Oh tech anyway it's easiest to give

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.560 
Oh tech anyway it's easiest to give
attack<00:04:09.340> because<00:04:09.730> you're<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.420> might<00:04:10.600> fall<00:04:12.570> we

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
attack because you're you might fall we

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.530 
attack because you're you might fall we
did<00:04:13.780> this<00:04:13.900> on<00:04:14.140> an<00:04:14.290> online<00:04:14.500> match<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.930> was<00:04:17.050> cool

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
did this on an online match it was cool

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.020 
did this on an online match it was cool
so<00:04:19.540> this<00:04:19.900> suicide<00:04:20.500> bar<00:04:20.950> thing<00:04:21.250> acts<00:04:21.550> like<00:04:22.000> a

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
so this suicide bar thing acts like a

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.030 
so this suicide bar thing acts like a
ladder<00:04:24.000> would<00:04:25.000> you<00:04:25.150> jump<00:04:25.390> on<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.830> see<00:04:27.010> oh

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
ladder would you jump on it you see oh

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.770 
ladder would you jump on it you see oh
my<00:04:27.220> gun<00:04:27.400> went<00:04:27.580> away<00:04:27.670> for<00:04:27.790> a<00:04:27.940> second<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.510> trying

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
my gun went away for a second you trying

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.560 
my gun went away for a second you trying
to<00:04:28.810> grab<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.670> but<00:04:30.670> if<00:04:30.790> you<00:04:30.850> don't<00:04:31.030> grab<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.420> in
