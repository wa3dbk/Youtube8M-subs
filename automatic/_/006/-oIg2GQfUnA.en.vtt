00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.840
 first we shell three eggs in a bowl 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.619
 then we add a Greek yogurt or 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.619
 natural sugary 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.480
 then we put the oil in the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.750
 yogurt container a little more than half 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.750
 glass 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.680
 using the yogurt container we add in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.690
 a different container three glasses of 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.730
 flour two sugar and yeast 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.390
 we walk everything to incorporate it into the 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.390
 previous mix 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.040
 he added the grated orange 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.040
 but this is optional 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.490
 we mix all the ingredients with 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.140
 help of rods or with the blender 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.140
 until a homogeneous mixture is obtained 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.810
 to make the banana puree also 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.810
 We are going to need 2 tablespoons of milk 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.820
 I do not like to beat it too much 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.860
 we add it to the mix together with the 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.860
 almonds 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.560
 then we put all the ingredients together 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.679
 We preheat the oven to 180 degrees with 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.240
 fire up and down and we leave 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.240
 Rest the mixture for 15 minutes 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.000
 we greased the container that we are going to 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.070
 use with butter and a 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.750
 napkin with your fingers pour the 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.810
 mix inside and put everything in the oven 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.340
 for 35 or 40 minutes in a pan 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.930
 with hot oil, let's do 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.530
 banana chips to decorate with the 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.530
 very thin slices 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.800
 we put some chocolate for 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.420
 melt in the microwave for about 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.280
 seconds 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.410
 when ready we bathe the banana 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.880
 fried after unmolding our 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.880
