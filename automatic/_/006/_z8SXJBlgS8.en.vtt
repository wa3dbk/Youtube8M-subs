00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.860 

what<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.650> do<00:02:47.799> is<00:02:48.069> I<00:02:48.159> cook<00:02:48.340> my<00:02:48.519> first<00:02:48.819> side<00:02:49.120> for<00:02:49.150> 55

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
what I do is I cook my first side for 55

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.600 
what I do is I cook my first side for 55
seconds<00:02:50.349> I<00:02:50.439> turn<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.769> over<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.099> cook<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.489> for

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
seconds I turn it over and cook it for

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.490 
seconds I turn it over and cook it for
about<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.819> minute<00:02:52.030> more<00:02:52.269> at<00:02:52.659> 350<00:02:53.290> degrees

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
about a minute more at 350 degrees

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.770 
about a minute more at 350 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:53.860> precisely<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.909> exactly<00:02:55.480> how

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
Fahrenheit precisely that is exactly how

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.619 
Fahrenheit precisely that is exactly how
you'll<00:02:56.170> get<00:02:56.379> a<00:02:56.409> perfect<00:02:56.739> pancake<00:02:57.430> okay<00:02:58.209> so<00:02:58.420> the

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
you'll get a perfect pancake okay so the

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.300 
you'll get a perfect pancake okay so the
batter<00:02:58.810> rested<00:02:59.260> for<00:02:59.379> about<00:02:59.560> 10<00:02:59.769> minutes<00:02:59.980> I'm

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
batter rested for about 10 minutes I'm

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.610 
batter rested for about 10 minutes I'm
about<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.819> cook<00:03:00.970> them<00:03:01.150> before<00:03:02.019> I<00:03:02.079> do<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.260> I'm

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
about to cook them before I do that I'm

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.140 
about to cook them before I do that I'm
just<00:03:02.890> going<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.040> mix<00:03:03.250> my<00:03:03.400> batter<00:03:03.609> around<00:03:03.760> just

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
just going to mix my batter around just

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.670 
just going to mix my batter around just
a<00:03:04.299> little<00:03:04.329> bit<00:03:04.569> break<00:03:05.109> up<00:03:05.290> some<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.500> those

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
a little bit break up some of those

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.979 
a little bit break up some of those
holes<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:07.239> get<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.420> little<00:03:07.659> bit<00:03:07.750> thinner

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
holes and to get a little bit thinner

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.710 
holes and to get a little bit thinner
for<00:03:08.260> when<00:03:08.409> I<00:03:08.439> drop<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:08.920> on<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.370> griddle<00:03:09.720> all

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
for when I drop it on to the griddle all

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.300 
for when I drop it on to the griddle all
right<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.079> here<00:03:11.260> we<00:03:11.319> go<00:03:11.590> I'm<00:03:11.829> gonna<00:03:12.010> put<00:03:12.280> a

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
right so here we go I'm gonna put a

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.949 
right so here we go I'm gonna put a
little<00:03:12.579> cooking<00:03:12.790> spray<00:03:12.970> on<00:03:13.299> here<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.629> don't

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
little cooking spray on here I don't

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.360 
little cooking spray on here I don't
really<00:03:14.109> have<00:03:14.290> Justin's<00:03:14.650> my<00:03:14.799> griddle<00:03:15.040> so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
really have Justin's my griddle so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.670 
really have Justin's my griddle so
perfectly<00:03:15.819> nonstick<00:03:16.359> but<00:03:16.689> this<00:03:17.409> will<00:03:17.560> last

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
perfectly nonstick but this will last

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.559 
perfectly nonstick but this will last
you<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:17.950> whole<00:03:18.069> cooking<00:03:18.519> process<00:03:21.450> now<00:03:22.450> I'm

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
you the whole cooking process now I'm

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.479 
you the whole cooking process now I'm
going<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.780> use<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.989> measuring<00:03:23.500> cup<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:24.069> make

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
going to use a measuring cup to make

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.000 
going to use a measuring cup to make
perfect<00:03:25.120> size<00:03:25.299> pancake<00:03:25.780> for<00:03:25.959> each<00:03:26.049> one<00:03:26.290> you

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
perfect size pancake for each one you

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.319 
perfect size pancake for each one you
should<00:03:27.190> probably<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:27.579> too<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.909> makes<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.299> a

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
should probably that too it makes it a

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.210 
should probably that too it makes it a
lot<00:03:28.510> easier<00:03:28.569> to<00:03:29.079> make<00:03:29.170> consistent<00:03:29.799> size

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
lot easier to make consistent size

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:44.110 
lot easier to make consistent size
pancake

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.850 

alright<00:03:45.120> I'm<00:03:45.209> approaching<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.840> 55<00:03:46.379> second

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
alright I'm approaching that 55 second

00:03:46.860 --> 00:04:01.580 
alright I'm approaching that 55 second
mark<00:03:47.040> I'm<00:03:47.550> about<00:03:47.819> to<00:03:48.060> flip<00:03:48.209> these<00:03:48.450> babies

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.960 

all<00:04:02.590> right<00:04:02.740> another<00:04:02.950> minutes<00:04:03.280> going<00:04:03.460> by<00:04:03.640> time

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
all right another minutes going by time

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.660 
all right another minutes going by time
to<00:04:04.060> take<00:04:04.180> them<00:04:04.330> off

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.040 

really<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.940> rest<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.240> your<00:04:10.330> pancakes<00:04:10.780> you

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
really the rest of your pancakes you

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.570 
really the rest of your pancakes you
just<00:04:11.230> got<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.440> find<00:04:11.620> out<00:04:11.860> exactly<00:04:12.310> how<00:04:12.520> long

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
just got to find out exactly how long

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.040 
just got to find out exactly how long
you<00:04:12.880> need<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.030> cook<00:04:13.120> them<00:04:13.390> for<00:04:13.420> so<00:04:13.750> they're

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
you need to cook them for so they're

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.870 
you need to cook them for so they're
just<00:04:14.140> barely<00:04:14.410> cooked<00:04:15.010> enough<00:04:15.250> in<00:04:15.490> the<00:04:15.670> better

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
just barely cooked enough in the better

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.479 
just barely cooked enough in the better
I<00:04:16.320> find<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.440> three<00:04:17.799> or<00:04:17.920> 50<00:04:18.130> degrees<00:04:18.310> Fahrenheit

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
I find a three or 50 degrees Fahrenheit

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.810 
I find a three or 50 degrees Fahrenheit
and<00:04:19.060> standard<00:04:19.510> batter<00:04:19.799> about<00:04:20.799> 55<00:04:21.310> seconds<00:04:21.730> on

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
and standard batter about 55 seconds on

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.090 
and standard batter about 55 seconds on
the<00:04:21.940> first<00:04:22.150> side<00:04:22.420> and<00:04:22.660> then<00:04:23.200> about<00:04:23.380> another<00:04:23.620> 55
