best of fact I papers perfect so these

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.819 
best of fact I papers perfect so these
bolts<00:00:35.250> any<00:00:36.059> face<00:00:36.390> bullets<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.870> course<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
bolts any face bullets of course it's a

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:49.000 
bolts any face bullets of course it's a
wig<00:00:41.660> let's<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:44.960> please<00:00:45.960> don't<00:00:46.170> pegasuses

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.520 

home<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.120> maybe

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
home but I just don't like that maybe

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:03.139 
home but I just don't like that maybe
maybe<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.739> off<00:00:59.090> energy<00:01:00.090> drink<00:01:01.010> spiking<00:01:02.149> most

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
maybe it off energy drink spiking most

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.289 
maybe it off energy drink spiking most
likely<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.049> merely<00:01:07.400> a<00:01:08.400> striker<00:01:09.650> something

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
likely so merely a striker something

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.590 
likely so merely a striker something
maybe<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.420> fire<00:01:12.750> blades<00:01:13.880> Brian<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.570> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
maybe a fire blades Brian if you have a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:27.800 
maybe a fire blades Brian if you have a
heart<00:01:16.020> attack<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.710> could<00:01:16.890> die

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:39.680 

something<00:01:28.810> maybe<00:01:29.140> like<00:01:30.960> galaxy<00:01:33.570> me<00:01:34.570> do<00:01:36.030> so

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.330 

what<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:40.720> would<00:01:40.840> do<00:01:41.170> is<00:01:41.290> probably<00:01:41.500> galaxy

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
what I would do is probably galaxy

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.760 
what I would do is probably galaxy
anything<00:01:43.030> right<00:01:44.070> poison<00:01:45.070> cyber<00:01:45.490> or<00:01:45.970> storm

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
anything right poison cyber or storm

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.340 
anything right poison cyber or storm
maybe<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:48.010> plane<00:01:48.369> maybe<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:49.260> ok<00:01:50.260> now<00:01:50.470> spin<00:01:50.770> tracks

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
maybe a plane maybe I ok now spin tracks

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:01.310 
maybe a plane maybe I ok now spin tracks
make<00:01:53.350> it<00:01:53.440> a<00:01:53.500> short<00:01:53.530> one<00:01:53.890> like<00:01:54.840> 1050<00:01:58.590> w<00:01:59.590> 105

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
make it a short one like 1050 w 105

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.859 
make it a short one like 1050 w 105
something<00:02:02.320> like<00:02:02.440> that<00:02:03.899> now<00:02:04.899> tips<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:06.570> good<00:02:07.570> tip

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
something like that now tips a good tip

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.479 
something like that now tips a good tip
would<00:02:08.140> probably<00:02:08.860> be<00:02:09.479> CS<00:02:10.980> but<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.160> wouldn't

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
would probably be CS but I wouldn't

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.790 
would probably be CS but I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:13.060> for<00:02:13.510> attack<00:02:14.140> types<00:02:14.440> because

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
recommend it for attack types because

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
recommend it for attack types because
like<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.760> mean<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.930> would<00:02:17.530> recommend<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.550> for

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
like I mean I would recommend this for

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.670 
like I mean I would recommend this for
if<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.660> were<00:02:19.810> trying<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.140> make<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.320> defense

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
if you were trying to make a defense

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.090 
if you were trying to make a defense
type<00:02:20.950> something<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:22.060> or<00:02:22.540> stamina

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
type something like that or stamina

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.550 
type something like that or stamina
because<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:25.239> at<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.750> same<00:02:25.900> time<00:02:26.110> it'll<00:02:26.350> just

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
because you at the same time it'll just

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.990 
because you at the same time it'll just
help<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.830> without<00:02:27.010> getting<00:02:27.459> Syria<00:02:27.790> mats

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
help you without getting Syria mats

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.070 
help you without getting Syria mats
that's<00:02:28.330> all<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.780> think<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.739> what<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.840> what<00:02:31.870> I

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
that's all I think so what so what I

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.350 
that's all I think so what so what I
would<00:02:32.230> probably<00:02:32.709> say<00:02:33.100> is<00:02:34.799> either<00:02:37.080> um<00:02:39.360> r

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
would probably say is either um r

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.860 
would probably say is either um r
squared<00:02:40.750> F<00:02:43.890> or<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.760> should<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.420> don't<00:02:46.600> know<00:02:46.690> what

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
squared F or I should I don't know what

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.130 
squared F or I should I don't know what
this<00:02:46.989> is<00:02:47.049> I<00:02:47.230> think<00:02:47.410> it's<00:02:48.480> poison<00:02:49.480> pegasuses

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
this is I think it's poison pegasuses

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.460 
this is I think it's poison pegasuses
tip<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.530> forgot<00:02:50.890> what<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.340> neighborhood<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.470> so

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
tip I forgot what the neighborhood is so

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.039 
tip I forgot what the neighborhood is so
that<00:02:53.829> here<00:02:54.400> made<00:02:54.670> all<00:02:54.880> assembled<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.750> like

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
that here made all assembled a like

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:15.860 
that here made all assembled a like
right<00:02:56.410> now

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.500 

also<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:17.140> Pegasus<00:03:17.830> done<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.730> little<00:03:19.000> bit<00:03:19.270> great<00:03:21.510> I

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
also a Pegasus done a little bit great I

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.600 
also a Pegasus done a little bit great I
wouldn't<00:03:23.500> really<00:03:23.680> go<00:03:23.950> with<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.160> galaxy

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
wouldn't really go with the galaxy

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.660 
wouldn't really go with the galaxy
Pegasus<00:03:25.120> because<00:03:25.450> galaxies<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.670> galaxy

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
Pegasus because galaxies and galaxy

00:03:27.670 --> 00:04:10.440 
Pegasus because galaxies and galaxy
Pegasus<00:03:28.330> at<00:03:28.480> his<00:04:06.300> feet<00:04:07.300> agree<00:04:08.700> with<00:04:09.700> here<00:04:10.180> we

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
Pegasus at his feet agree with here we

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.870 
Pegasus at his feet agree with here we
go<00:04:11.130> so<00:04:12.130> we're<00:04:12.340> not<00:04:12.490> the<00:04:12.670> same<00:04:14.070> direction<00:04:15.070> we

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
go so we're not the same direction we

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.260 
go so we're not the same direction we
want<00:04:16.090> champagne<00:04:16.570> wishes<00:04:17.400> caviar<00:04:18.400> dreams<00:04:18.609> on<00:04:19.209> a

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
want champagne wishes caviar dreams on a

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.350 
want champagne wishes caviar dreams on a
Budweiser<00:04:19.900> budget<00:04:20.440> so<00:04:21.120> probably<00:04:22.120> go<00:04:22.270> with

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
Budweiser budget so probably go with

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.350 
Budweiser budget so probably go with
this<00:04:22.540> I<00:04:22.919> should<00:04:23.919> be<00:04:24.070> show<00:04:24.880> up<00:04:26.520> when<00:04:27.520> this<00:04:27.760> wind

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
this I should be show up when this wind

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.870 
this I should be show up when this wind
comes<00:04:28.870> all<00:04:29.110> together<00:04:29.380> maybe<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.490> can't<00:04:30.700> say

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
comes all together maybe you can't say

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.730 
comes all together maybe you can't say
in<00:04:31.090> Korea<00:04:31.360> for<00:04:31.630> anything<00:04:31.870> all<00:04:32.169> right<00:04:32.260> almost<00:04:32.410> I

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
in Korea for anything all right almost I
