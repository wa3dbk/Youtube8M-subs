place<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.540> can<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.350> still<00:02:11.340> got<00:02:11.490> a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
place and as you can see I still got a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.140 
place and as you can see I still got a
lot<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.760> water<00:02:12.320> bubbles<00:02:13.320> at<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.370> bottom<00:02:14.730> along

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
lot of water bubbles at the bottom along

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.980 
lot of water bubbles at the bottom along
with<00:02:15.300> air<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:17.330> that's<00:02:18.330> obviously<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
with air and that's obviously the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.020 
with air and that's obviously the
hardest<00:02:19.200> form<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:20.160> get<00:02:20.310> out<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.730> that's<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
hardest form to get out and that's the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.490 
hardest form to get out and that's the
whole<00:02:21.270> reason<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.690> have<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:21.990> problem<00:02:22.260> so

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
whole reason you have this problem so

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.570 
whole reason you have this problem so
what<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.740> want<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.950> do<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.280> can<00:02:23.430> take<00:02:23.520> a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
what you want to do is you can take a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.090 
what you want to do is you can take a
black<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.970> run<00:02:24.060> white<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:25.320> go<00:02:25.560> across<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
black and run white and go across the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.660 
black and run white and go across the
whole<00:02:26.280> thing<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:28.770> you'll<00:02:28.890> push<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.400> good

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
whole thing and you'll push a good

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.350 
whole thing and you'll push a good
majority<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:31.010> pretty<00:02:32.010> easily<00:02:32.370> but

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
majority out of it pretty easily but

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.449 
majority out of it pretty easily but
also<00:02:33.630> for<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.140> third<00:02:34.350> brake<00:02:34.560> light<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:35.040> the

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
also for that third brake light it's the

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.720 
also for that third brake light it's the
black<00:02:35.670> with<00:02:36.090> white<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.510> doesn't<00:02:37.070> quite<00:02:38.070> press

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
black with white it doesn't quite press

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.160 
black with white it doesn't quite press
down<00:02:38.970> hard<00:02:39.270> enough<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.970> I'll<00:02:42.750> try<00:02:43.050> and
