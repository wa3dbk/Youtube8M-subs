00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.619 

in<00:00:01.530> question<00:00:02.129> six<00:00:02.399> see<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.820> are<00:00:03.090> working<00:00:03.449> with

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
in question six see you are working with

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.320 
in question six see you are working with
a<00:00:03.659> normal<00:00:04.410> distribution<00:00:04.500> has<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.370> mean<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.790> 700

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
a normal distribution has a mean is 700

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.440 
a normal distribution has a mean is 700
and<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:07.140> standard<00:00:07.410> deviation<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.859> 150<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:09.330> were

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
and a standard deviation of 150 you were

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.560 
and a standard deviation of 150 you were
told<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.110> probability<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.980> left<00:00:11.190> of

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
told that the probability to the left of

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.650 
told that the probability to the left of
1075<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:13.049> 0.99<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:14.160> your<00:00:15.089> asked<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> couple<00:00:15.450> of

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
1075 is 0.99 for your asked a couple of

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.349 
1075 is 0.99 for your asked a couple of
questions<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:17.580> I've<00:00:17.670> drawn<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> normal

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
questions so I've drawn the normal

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.859 
questions so I've drawn the normal
probability<00:00:18.539> curve<00:00:19.140> here<00:00:20.420> so<00:00:21.420> think<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.810> this

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
probability curve here so think of this

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.400 
probability curve here so think of this
as<00:00:22.789> 1075<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:24.330> know<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.750> probability<00:00:24.960> to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
as 1075 we know that the probability to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.730 
as 1075 we know that the probability to
the<00:00:25.500> left<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.980> 1075<00:00:26.609> 0.99<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.439> that's<00:00:28.590> this

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the left of 1075 0.99 for so that's this

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.030 
the left of 1075 0.99 for so that's this
red<00:00:29.400> region<00:00:30.199> also<00:00:31.199> note<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.619> total<00:00:31.920> area

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
red region also note that the total area

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.520 
red region also note that the total area
under<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.610> curve<00:00:32.719> for<00:00:33.719> any<00:00:34.170> normal

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
under the curve for any normal

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.000 
under the curve for any normal
probability<00:00:34.829> curve<00:00:35.370> will<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.790> 1<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.800> first

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
probability curve will be 1 so the first

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.380 
probability curve will be 1 so the first
question<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.399> course<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.820> probability<00:00:39.360> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
question of course the probability that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.950 
question of course the probability that
x<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.020> greater<00:00:40.500> than<00:00:40.739> 1075<00:00:41.600> also<00:00:42.600> one<00:00:42.750> note

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
x is greater than 1075 also one note

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.340 
x is greater than 1075 also one note
here<00:00:43.280> for<00:00:44.280> continuous<00:00:44.730> variable<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
here for continuous variable this is the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.610 
here for continuous variable this is the
same<00:00:46.559> thing<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:47.899> this<00:00:51.260> only<00:00:52.260> true<00:00:52.440> for

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
same thing as this only true for

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.889 
same thing as this only true for
continuous<00:00:53.340> variables<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> or<00:00:54.480> equal<00:00:54.780> to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
continuous variables but the or equal to

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.639 
continuous variables but the or equal to
doesn't<00:00:55.199> matter<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:56.190> means<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> same<00:00:57.090> thing

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
doesn't matter it means the same thing

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
doesn't matter it means the same thing
so<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.219> be<00:00:59.280> 1<00:00:59.489> minus<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
so this just going to be 1 minus the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.189 
so this just going to be 1 minus the
probability<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.399> x<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.910> less<00:01:02.969> than<00:01:03.239> 10<00:01:03.719> 75

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
probability that x is less than 10 75

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.980 
probability that x is less than 10 75
and<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.119> because<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> total<00:01:06.810> area

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and in this is because the total area

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.960 
and in this is because the total area
under<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> curve<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.710> 1<00:01:07.950> if<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.700> know<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
under the curve is 1 if we know that

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.200 
under the curve is 1 if we know that
this<00:01:09.090> part<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.689> point<00:01:10.350> 994<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.729> part<00:01:12.090> we're

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
this part is a point 994 and part we're

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.039 
this part is a point 994 and part we're
looking<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.530> 1<00:01:13.680> minus<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:15.049> certain

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
looking for is just 1 minus that certain

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.510 
looking for is just 1 minus that certain
question<00:01:16.380> ask<00:01:16.500> what's<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.890> probability<00:01:16.979> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
question ask what's the probability that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.630 
question ask what's the probability that
the<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:19.140> bedroom<00:01:19.290> unit<00:01:19.500> rinse<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.220> somewhere

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the one bedroom unit rinse for somewhere

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.179 
the one bedroom unit rinse for somewhere
between<00:01:21.110> seven<00:01:22.110> hundred<00:01:22.320> dollars<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:23.689> 1075

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
between seven hundred dollars and 1075

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.530 
between seven hundred dollars and 1075
so<00:01:26.189> now<00:01:26.310> we're<00:01:26.549> looking<00:01:26.700> at<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:29.090> if<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.299> want<00:01:30.479> to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
so now we're looking at a if we want to

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.190 
so now we're looking at a if we want to
cut<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.960> half<00:01:32.720> this<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> region

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
cut this in half this is the region

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.330 
cut this in half this is the region
we're<00:01:34.409> looking<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.740> now<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:36.530> couple<00:01:37.530> ways<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:38.040> do

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
we're looking at now a couple ways to do

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.940 
we're looking at now a couple ways to do
this<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.900> easiest<00:01:40.140> way<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.350> probably<00:01:40.590> uh<00:01:42.950> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
this the easiest way is probably uh the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.429 
this the easiest way is probably uh the
probability<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.520> X<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:45.000> less<00:01:45.659> than<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.229> equal

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
probability that X is less than or equal

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.130 
probability that X is less than or equal
to<00:01:46.470> send<00:01:46.710> 75<00:01:47.299> so<00:01:48.299> that's<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> entire<00:01:48.840> red

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
to send 75 so that's the entire red

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.929 
to send 75 so that's the entire red
region<00:01:50.869> minus<00:01:51.869> 0.5<00:01:52.820> that's<00:01:53.820> because<00:01:55.939> just

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
region minus 0.5 that's because just

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.130 
region minus 0.5 that's because just
this<00:01:57.119> half<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> curve<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:58.880> 0.5<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.049> you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
this half of the curve is 0.5 so if you

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.039 
this half of the curve is 0.5 so if you
do<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.530> entire<00:02:01.770> red<00:02:02.040> region<00:02:02.450> minus<00:02:03.450> 0.5

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
do the entire red region minus 0.5

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.899 
do the entire red region minus 0.5
what's<00:02:04.829> left<00:02:05.009> over<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.369> just<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.640> blue

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
what's left over is just this blue

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.320 
what's left over is just this blue
region<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.420> that's<00:02:06.810> what<00:02:06.960> we're<00:02:07.079> looking<00:02:07.290> for
