00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
allegro HD tutorial in this tutorial

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800 
allegro HD tutorial in this tutorial
we're<00:00:19.430> going<00:00:19.460> to<00:00:19.670> be<00:00:19.789> learning<00:00:19.970> about<00:00:20.240> doing

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
we're going to be learning about doing

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.600 
we're going to be learning about doing
single<00:00:21.259> mouse<00:00:21.890> presses<00:00:22.730> within<00:00:23.119> our<00:00:23.360> program

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
single mouse presses within our program

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.269 
single mouse presses within our program
so<00:00:25.610> at<00:00:25.759> the<00:00:25.880> top<00:00:26.180> here<00:00:26.539> arm<00:00:26.840> just<00:00:27.770> like<00:00:27.829> we<00:00:28.070> had

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
so at the top here arm just like we had

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.650 
so at the top here arm just like we had
the<00:00:28.520> previous<00:00:29.150> key<00:00:29.449> press<00:00:29.779> and<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:30.830> key<00:00:31.070> press

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
the previous key press and the key press

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.540 
the previous key press and the key press
we're<00:00:32.660> going<00:00:32.809> to<00:00:32.900> be<00:00:33.080> a<00:00:33.320> wee<00:00:33.860> replaces<00:00:34.370> for

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
we're going to be a wee replaces for

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.490 
we're going to be a wee replaces for
current<00:00:34.970> now<00:00:35.150> state<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:35.809> previously<00:00:36.320> on

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
current now state and previously on

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.680 
current now state and previously on
state<00:00:36.830> and<00:00:37.100> they<00:00:37.730> will<00:00:37.850> not<00:00:37.970> serve<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.269> same

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
state and they will not serve the same

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.310 
state and they will not serve the same
functionality<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:39.800> we<00:00:40.339> set<00:00:40.550> them<00:00:40.730> to<00:00:40.790> know

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
functionality and we set them to know

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.750 
functionality and we set them to know
make<00:00:42.320> sure<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:42.589> have<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.129> mouse<00:00:43.370> um

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
make sure you have the mouse um

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.969 
make sure you have the mouse um
installed<00:00:44.720> or<00:00:45.110> else<00:00:45.350> this<00:00:45.559> won't<00:00:45.739> work

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
installed or else this won't work

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.920 
installed or else this won't work
everything<00:00:48.979> here<00:00:49.369> is<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:50.390> same<00:00:50.629> from<00:00:50.839> last

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
everything here is the same from last

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.869 
everything here is the same from last
tutorial<00:00:51.409> so<00:00:52.010> you<00:00:52.100> don't<00:00:52.280> have<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.670> worry

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
tutorial so you don't have to worry

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.899 
tutorial so you don't have to worry
about<00:00:53.030> that<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:54.129> so<00:00:55.129> let's<00:00:55.339> get<00:00:55.489> into<00:00:55.670> the

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
about that and so let's get into the

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.619 
about that and so let's get into the
wild<00:00:56.600> um<00:00:56.780> down<00:00:57.530> loop<00:00:57.769> now<00:00:58.400> most<00:00:59.059> likely<00:00:59.210> you'll

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
wild um down loop now most likely you'll

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.530 
wild um down loop now most likely you'll
have<00:00:59.900> this<00:01:00.199> um<00:01:00.530> like<00:01:01.100> in<00:01:01.549> functions<00:01:02.150> like<00:01:02.299> I

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
have this um like in functions like I

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.649 
have this um like in functions like I
did<00:01:02.750> in<00:01:02.839> the<00:01:02.930> last<00:01:03.110> tutorial<00:01:03.519> but<00:01:04.519> I'm<00:01:05.330> just

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
did in the last tutorial but I'm just

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.270 
did in the last tutorial but I'm just
showing<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.140> functionality<00:01:06.380> of<00:01:06.890> how<00:01:07.130> it

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
showing you the functionality of how it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.960 
showing you the functionality of how it
works<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.540> I<00:01:08.869> said<00:01:09.320> previous<00:01:10.040> a<00:01:10.250> previous<00:01:10.280> most

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
works so I said previous a previous most

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.660 
works so I said previous a previous most
it<00:01:11.180> is<00:01:11.210> equal<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.750> current<00:01:12.080> law<00:01:12.229> state<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.340> what

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
it is equal to current law state so what

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.370 
it is equal to current law state so what
this<00:01:13.790> is<00:01:13.970> gonna<00:01:14.090> do<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.450> that<00:01:14.900> it's<00:01:15.110> going<00:01:15.259> to

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
this is gonna do is that it's going to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.580 
this is gonna do is that it's going to
set<00:01:15.530> our<00:01:15.560> previous<00:01:16.250> um<00:01:16.960> whatever<00:01:17.960> we<00:01:18.260> click

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
set our previous um whatever we click

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.550 
set our previous um whatever we click
the<00:01:18.770> last<00:01:19.040> update<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:20.270> last<00:01:20.600> update<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:21.410> it's

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
the last update the last update and it's

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.890 
the last update the last update and it's
going<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.770> store<00:01:22.040> it<00:01:22.130> in<00:01:22.220> here<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.810> then<00:01:23.810> what

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
going to store it in here and then what

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.320 
going to store it in here and then what
we<00:01:24.050> do<00:01:24.260> when<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:25.010> say<00:01:25.190> that<00:01:25.370> if<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.790> left<00:01:26.030> mouse

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
we do when I say that if the left mouse

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.540 
we do when I say that if the left mouse
button<00:01:26.750> was<00:01:26.870> pressed<00:01:27.190> then<00:01:28.190> we<00:01:28.280> set<00:01:28.430> the

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
button was pressed then we set the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.940 
button was pressed then we set the
current<00:01:28.760> state<00:01:29.180> 21<00:01:29.540> it's<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.470> right<00:01:30.710> mouse

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
current state 21 it's the right mouse

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.920 
current state 21 it's the right mouse
button<00:01:31.340> was<00:01:31.520> pressed<00:01:31.730> we<00:01:32.120> set<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.480> state<00:01:32.750> to

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
button was pressed we set the state to

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.160 
button was pressed we set the state to
two<00:01:33.170> else<00:01:34.100> if<00:01:34.550> no<00:01:35.030> button<00:01:35.420> was<00:01:35.570> pressed<00:01:35.810> then

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
two else if no button was pressed then

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.260 
two else if no button was pressed then
we<00:01:36.260> said<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.830> state<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.310> know<00:01:38.110> so<00:01:39.110> then<00:01:39.290> if<00:01:39.560> arm

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
we said the state to know so then if arm

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.969 
we said the state to know so then if arm
the<00:01:41.270> previous<00:01:41.750> data<00:01:41.960> not<00:01:42.260> equal<00:01:42.620> to<00:01:42.650> a<00:01:42.800> mouse

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
the previous data not equal to a mouse

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.480 
the previous data not equal to a mouse
date<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:43.580> if<00:01:43.640> we<00:01:43.760> clicked<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.240> different<00:01:44.780> button

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
date so if we clicked a different button

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.370 
date so if we clicked a different button
and<00:01:46.490> then<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.760> was<00:01:46.909> a<00:01:46.970> left<00:01:47.270> button<00:01:47.659> that<00:01:48.350> will

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
and then it was a left button that will

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.250 
and then it was a left button that will
increase<00:01:48.800> option<00:01:49.580> by<00:01:49.909> one<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.420> if<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:50.960> was<00:01:51.110> the

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
increase option by one and if it was the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.110 
increase option by one and if it was the
right<00:01:51.470> point<00:01:51.770> if<00:01:52.010> we<00:01:52.159> press<00:01:52.370> right<00:01:52.610> button<00:01:52.640> we

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
right point if we press right button we

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.930 
right point if we press right button we
decrease<00:01:53.540> option<00:01:54.080> by<00:01:54.290> one<00:01:54.620> and<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.549> rest<00:01:55.790> of

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
decrease option by one and the rest of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.140 
decrease option by one and the rest of
the<00:01:56.030> program<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:57.170> exact<00:01:57.770> same<00:01:58.040> except<00:01:58.940> for

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
the program is the exact same except for

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.480 
the program is the exact same except for
make<00:01:59.330> sure<00:01:59.540> you<00:01:59.630> put<00:01:59.810> show<00:02:00.080> mouse<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.740> the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
make sure you put show mouse and the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.950 
make sure you put show mouse and the
buffers<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:02.479> can<00:02:02.630> actually<00:02:02.810> see<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.670> so

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
buffers and you can actually see it so

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.770 
buffers and you can actually see it so
um<00:02:06.250> let<00:02:07.250> me<00:02:07.280> run<00:02:07.549> this<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.820> show<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.060> exactly

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
um let me run this to show you exactly

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.039 
um let me run this to show you exactly
how<00:02:08.989> it<00:02:09.170> works<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:13.640> when<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.030> click<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.480> left<00:02:14.690> oh

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
how it works so when I click the left oh

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:23.059 
how it works so when I click the left oh
sorry<00:02:15.799> I<00:02:16.159> hate<00:02:16.970> when<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.209> does<00:02:17.450> this

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.790

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
left mouse button it goes down and I

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.960 
left mouse button it goes down and I
click<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:29.890> right<00:02:30.069> mouse<00:02:30.100> button<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.819> goes

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
click the right mouse button that goes

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.660 
click the right mouse button that goes
up<00:02:31.270> right<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.700> um<00:02:34.090> just<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:35.140> quick<00:02:35.800> thing<00:02:35.830> so

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
up right so um just a quick thing so

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.840 
up right so um just a quick thing so
then<00:02:36.820> every<00:02:37.240> single<00:02:37.540> time<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:39.190> what<00:02:39.550> I'll<00:02:39.670> do

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
then every single time so what I'll do

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.750 
then every single time so what I'll do
is<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.180> okay<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:40.570> say<00:02:41.020> say<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.130> last<00:02:42.340> loop<00:02:42.640> I

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
is this okay so say say the last loop I

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.670 
is this okay so say say the last loop I
didn't<00:02:43.000> press<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.240> button<00:02:43.690> right<00:02:43.930> so

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
didn't press the button right so

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.530 
didn't press the button right so
previous<00:02:45.280> most<00:02:45.580> data<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:45.970> going<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.209> be<00:02:46.330> equal

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
previous most data is going to be equal

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.130 
previous most data is going to be equal
to<00:02:47.160> no<00:02:48.160> because<00:02:48.850> current<00:02:49.420> law<00:02:49.540> state<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:49.959> equal

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
to no because current law state is equal

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.180 
to no because current law state is equal
to<00:02:50.200> no<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:51.160> then<00:02:51.280> say<00:02:51.580> this<00:02:51.850> loop<00:02:52.270> I<00:02:53.010> press<00:02:54.010> the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
to no so then say this loop I press the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.310 
to no so then say this loop I press the
left<00:02:54.400> mouse<00:02:54.489> button<00:02:55.000> right<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:55.720> current<00:02:56.170> mouse

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
left mouse button right so current mouse

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.320 
left mouse button right so current mouse
that<00:02:56.590> will<00:02:56.709> be<00:02:56.830> equal<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.220> 1<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.700> remember

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
that will be equal to 1 I remember

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.960 
that will be equal to 1 I remember
previous<00:02:58.840> long<00:02:59.050> state<00:02:59.320> is<00:02:59.440> equal<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.920> null<00:03:00.130> so

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
previous long state is equal to null so

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.210 
previous long state is equal to null so
the<00:03:01.090> one<00:03:01.239> that<00:03:01.360> comes<00:03:01.600> here<00:03:01.989> will<00:03:02.560> be<00:03:02.800> like<00:03:03.040> if

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
the one that comes here will be like if

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.610 
the one that comes here will be like if
previous<00:03:03.850> law<00:03:04.269> state<00:03:04.660> is<00:03:04.870> not<00:03:05.110> equal<00:03:05.560> to

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
previous law state is not equal to

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.850 
previous law state is not equal to
current<00:03:06.280> state<00:03:06.550> so<00:03:07.120> this<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.570> no<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:08.739> is

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
current state so this is no and this is

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.640 
current state so this is no and this is
equal<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.190> one<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:09.430> it's<00:03:09.790> not<00:03:09.940> equal<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.690> so

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
equal to one so it's not equal to it so

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.090 
equal to one so it's not equal to it so
then<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:12.010> checks<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.820> checks<00:03:13.780> on<00:03:14.019> which<00:03:14.650> key<00:03:15.070> i

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
then it checks the checks on which key i

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.009 
then it checks the checks on which key i
press<00:03:15.430> if<00:03:15.610> i<00:03:15.730> if<00:03:16.030> i<00:03:16.239> press<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.690> left<00:03:16.930> mouse

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
press if i if i press the left mouse

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.960 
press if i if i press the left mouse
button<00:03:17.560> or<00:03:18.130> if<00:03:18.340> i<00:03:18.430> press<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.760> right<00:03:18.910> mouse

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
button or if i press the right mouse

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.870 
button or if i press the right mouse
button<00:03:19.600> if<00:03:20.320> i<00:03:20.440> press<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.769> right<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.430> left<00:03:21.459> one

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
button if i press the right the left one

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.180 
button if i press the right the left one
then<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.239> increases<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.900> option<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.800> if<00:03:24.130> i

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
then it increases the option and if i

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.860 
then it increases the option and if i
press<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.610> right<00:03:25.000> mouse<00:03:25.060> button<00:03:25.690> it

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
press the right mouse button it

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.770 
press the right mouse button it
decreases<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.590> option<00:03:26.980> now<00:03:27.640> say<00:03:28.000> i'm<00:03:28.150> holding

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
decreases the option now say i'm holding

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.440 
decreases the option now say i'm holding
down<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.380> left<00:03:29.410> mouse<00:03:29.799> button<00:03:30.400> Sam<00:03:30.790> say<00:03:31.420> push

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
down the left mouse button Sam say push

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.259 
down the left mouse button Sam say push
the<00:03:31.750> left<00:03:31.959> mouse<00:03:32.140> button<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.530> I'm<00:03:32.650> holding<00:03:32.890> it

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
the left mouse button and I'm holding it

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.509 
the left mouse button and I'm holding it
so<00:03:34.269> in<00:03:34.420> this<00:03:34.780> loop<00:03:35.079> previous<00:03:35.709> lon<00:03:35.980> state<00:03:36.310> will

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
so in this loop previous lon state will

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.100 
so in this loop previous lon state will
be<00:03:36.670> equal<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.090> current<00:03:37.420> Mountain<00:03:37.660> State<00:03:37.900> and

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
be equal to current Mountain State and

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.080 
be equal to current Mountain State and
the<00:03:38.170> current<00:03:38.920> mental<00:03:39.070> state<00:03:39.160> is<00:03:39.430> equal<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.880> one

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
the current mental state is equal to one

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.229 
the current mental state is equal to one
so<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:41.590> will<00:03:41.799> be<00:03:41.920> equal<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.280> one<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.670> since

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
so this will be equal to one and since

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.470 
so this will be equal to one and since
I'm<00:03:43.420> holding<00:03:43.959> current<00:03:44.290> now<00:03:44.470> state<00:03:44.829> um<00:03:45.700> it<00:03:46.239> will

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
I'm holding current now state um it will

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.050 
I'm holding current now state um it will
incur<00:03:47.320> loss<00:03:47.560> they<00:03:47.739> will<00:03:47.920> stay<00:03:48.340> equal<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.910> one

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
incur loss they will stay equal to one

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.690 
incur loss they will stay equal to one
so<00:03:49.299> be<00:03:49.900> like<00:03:50.049> its<00:03:50.260> previous<00:03:50.739> state<00:03:50.829> not<00:03:51.310> equal

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
so be like its previous state not equal

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.940 
so be like its previous state not equal
to<00:03:51.820> current<00:03:52.120> state<00:03:52.390> this<00:03:53.320> statement<00:03:53.650> is<00:03:53.890> false

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
to current state this statement is false

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.220 
to current state this statement is false
because<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.760> action<00:03:55.390> previous<00:03:55.870> state<00:03:56.079> is

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
because the action previous state is

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.410 
because the action previous state is
equal<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:56.980> career<00:03:57.220> in<00:03:57.250> real<00:03:57.310> estate<00:03:57.459> so

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
equal to a career in real estate so

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.479 
equal to a career in real estate so
nothing<00:03:58.810> will<00:03:58.930> happen<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.829> option<00:04:00.280> won't

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
nothing will happen and the option won't

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.210 
nothing will happen and the option won't
change<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.900> now<00:04:02.110> keep<00:04:02.410> on<00:04:02.620> going<00:04:02.890> until<00:04:02.950> you

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
change so now keep on going until you

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.650 
change so now keep on going until you
actually<00:04:03.400> release<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:04.030> key<00:04:04.239> and<00:04:04.450> then<00:04:04.600> press

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
actually release the key and then press

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.600 
actually release the key and then press
it<00:04:04.989> down<00:04:05.019> again<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.739> then<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:06.549> can<00:04:06.790> go<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:09.310> the

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
it down again and then you can go to the

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.520 
it down again and then you can go to the
rest<00:04:09.760> of<00:04:09.880> your<00:04:09.970> program<00:04:10.390> so<00:04:11.049> that's<00:04:11.320> how<00:04:11.470> you

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
rest of your program so that's how you

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.759 
rest of your program so that's how you
check<00:04:11.860> for<00:04:11.890> single<00:04:12.489> mouse<00:04:13.239> key<00:04:13.600> presses<00:04:13.900> hope

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
check for single mouse key presses hope

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.620 
check for single mouse key presses hope
