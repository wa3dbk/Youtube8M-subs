00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.500
 while we are going to start with this 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.300
 recipe 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.930
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.960

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.440

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.900

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.280
 teaspoon vanilla extract 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.250
 they can accompany it with chocolate 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.470

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.000
 not to start I'll put the flour 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.769
 in a large bowl I passed it for a 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.440
 strainer only to keep a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.840
 little bit finite this step is optional 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.270
 then I will add the 2 tablespoons 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.520
 of sugar and with the help of a whisk 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.310
 of balloon let's mix 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.560
 I'm going to add the melted butter and 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.229
 I'm going to start mixing with the beater 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.229
 of balloon and add the milk little by little 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.840
 let's add the rest of the 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.180
 ingredients we are also going to put a 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.890
 egg at a time and keep mixing not 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.290
 they forget to add the teaspoon of 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.180
 vanilla extract to mishal new the 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.940
 record video when I add it but if 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.350
 if you add it and good and we're just going to 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.500
 keep mixing until there are no more 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.500
 lumps 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.530
 once ready we will cover the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.990
 container with plastic and we're going to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.650
 book in the refrigerator for about 30 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.780
 minutes 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.210
 good since he has spent 30 minutes 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.370
 I'm going to put a pan with the flame 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.290
 medium-high and I'll grease the pan 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.150
 with a little bit of butter 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.210
 hot then let's add what 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.970
 it's the mix we're going to spread all over 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.760
 the pan and then let's leave 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.230
 cook between 30 seconds 30-60 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.569
 seconds 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.940
 when the top part looks dry or 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.370
 opaque then you can turn it with 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.280
 very careful and we will let him cook 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.400
 on the other side 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.400
 and 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.099
 well last since we have the 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.989
 cream list so now if we can 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.109
 accompany what you most want 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.450
 I use chocolate strawberries and sugar 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.430
 glas so it's very easy to do 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.170
 I hope you like the recipe there 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.969
 many ways that can do so 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.950
 I hope you like them very much 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:01.810

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.810
