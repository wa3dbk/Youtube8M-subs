00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.519
 Hi everyone 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.310
 then I'm preparing a salad of 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.840
 bring rice tomorrow we will do a 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.359
 pic nic and so I'm preparing a 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.970
 half a recipe rice salad is me 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.070
 It occurred to him that it could be one 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.670
 cute recipe to put here on the canal 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.160
 on Youtube 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.239
 so I tell you what I did then in 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.989
 this pan I did slightly 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:42.540
 let's say stew of leek and then I have 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.000
 added and asparagus and asparagus 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.010
 I simply cleaned them and I have them 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.969
 inserted into the pan like 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.010
 you can see I cut them enough 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.899
 small I left the tips apart and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.829
 enter it a little after getting 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.600
 inserted and here diced asparagus for 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.049
 who did not know how to clean a 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.610
 asparagus breaks holding the two 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.140
 end and the point where it breaks 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.020
 let's say it determines the part that goes 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.210
 used is the noblest part 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.820
 on the other hand I generally use it 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.640
 to do 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.810
 the broth then I keep it with frost 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.450
 when I make a risotto with i 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.540
 asparagus I use that part to make 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.729
 the broth that I will need for risotto and 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.659
 after that the whole length 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:36.110
 of the asparagus but to remove the tip va Ã¨ 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.380
 a little bit clean with a potato peeler e 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.869
 then I cut it like this into small pieces e 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.119
 I put it to fry in a pan between 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.130
 browning very fast because not 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.880
 i want the august shovel too 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.619
 and the asparagus in my opinion is good if it remains 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.420
 a little crunchy 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.460
 I left first with the leek because 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.600
 instead the leek must obviously be 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.780
 well cooked otherwise it is annoying 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.910
 perfect if they dry too much 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:11.620
 add a goccino of water 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:14.480
 obviously we make them become 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.050
 let them become slightly 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.050
 soft 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.520
 here's what we bring to cooking 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.220
 I try not to ruin the tips of 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.220
 asparagus not to break them 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.530
 once the spikes are by sword 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:03.530
 soft translated add a can 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:06.370
 of chickpeas and a box of oratino says kiss 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:12.670
 cat 1 and the fresh tomatoes studied 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:15.230
 in a very small way a pan-fried 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.170
 sprinter but because I don't want the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.100
 absolutely tomato and so on 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.800
 the tomato is already cooked I want it 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.530
 cool handsome remains because it is a 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.560
 spring rice salad so not 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.790
 must be i want i want a result 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.920
 fresh 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.220
 here we let go one more 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.700
 minute let the water dry in 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.400
 excess and everything is ready then and there 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.560
 peculiarity of this rice is beyond 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.680
 let's say to the vegetables I used 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.160
 which are unusual for a salad of 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.950
 rice 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.790
 the peculiarity is that I use two types 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.940
 different rice I already like summer 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.330
 boil the rice I use basmati territo 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.610
 then some white rice 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.880
 I prefer the basmati for salads 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:12.500
 of rice because I find it more fragrant than me 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:15.920
 more like rice then bearded rice 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.000
 Black Black rice is in keeping 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:24.080
 any 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:29.050
 it is super single market the two rices is made 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.560
 to reach even the vegetables here 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.560
 I mix everything well 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:44.330
 we will get a rice salad really 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.570
 very colorful and true is really good 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.570
 mostly 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.210
 I'm preparing it the day before 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:03.430
 because so from the time you laughed of 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:06.790
 can flavor this rice very well can 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.350
 being served is cold 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.170
 there is therefore room temperature 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.810
 obviously not cold of that refrigerator 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.190
 warm then slightly warmed us 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:24.280
 we will eat it at room temperature 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:27.520
 because we will be away from home I already had 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.170
 salted both the rice in cooking and 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.690
 vegetables so there is no me 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.280
 I need to add beaten salt 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:38.470
 however, add a little oil 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.810
 extra virgin olive oil here it is 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.690
 complete it all now I will rest 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.720
 this rice salad in the fridge e 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.840
 tomorrow I'll take it out of the fridge a 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.550
 little before enjoying it I know it's one 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.640
 very simple recipe but I think that 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.490
 may be perhaps a starting point for 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.990
 someone thank you so much I send you a 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.200
 kiss and see you at the next video 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.200
 Hello
