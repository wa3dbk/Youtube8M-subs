want<00:00:19.520> to<00:00:19.580> make<00:00:19.669> this<00:00:19.820> icon<00:00:20.210> green<00:00:20.599> I<00:00:20.869> have<00:00:20.930> to

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
want to make this icon green I have to

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.620 
want to make this icon green I have to
create<00:00:21.619> a<00:00:21.650> new<00:00:21.919> color<00:00:22.130> in<00:00:22.340> the<00:00:22.400> library<00:00:22.849> I<00:00:23.060> will

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
create a new color in the library I will

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.259 
create a new color in the library I will
name<00:00:23.810> it<00:00:23.840> icon<00:00:24.529> color<00:00:24.769> this<00:00:25.670> color<00:00:25.910> can<00:00:26.240> be

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
name it icon color this color can be

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.089 
name it icon color this color can be
assigned<00:00:26.599> to<00:00:26.929> any<00:00:27.050> shape<00:00:27.529> in<00:00:27.679> any<00:00:27.830> canvas

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.609 
assigned to any shape in any canvas
let's<00:00:29.000> assign<00:00:29.240> this<00:00:29.449> color<00:00:29.660> to<00:00:29.960> stroke<00:00:30.320> of<00:00:30.500> the

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
let's assign this color to stroke of the

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.220 
let's assign this color to stroke of the
bubble<00:00:30.920> in<00:00:31.099> this<00:00:31.279> icon<00:00:31.670> you<00:00:31.880> can<00:00:32.720> also<00:00:32.870> assign

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
bubble in this icon you can also assign

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.110 
bubble in this icon you can also assign
the<00:00:33.410> color<00:00:33.589> directly<00:00:34.100> from<00:00:34.400> the<00:00:34.610> inspector

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120

using<00:00:35.420> a<00:00:35.480> pop-up<00:00:35.720> menu<00:00:36.199> like<00:00:36.440> this<00:00:37.780> let's<00:00:38.780> now

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
using a pop-up menu like this let's now

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.080 
using a pop-up menu like this let's now
do<00:00:39.019> the<00:00:39.229> same<00:00:39.470> for<00:00:39.799> the<00:00:39.949> second<00:00:40.280> icon

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.130 

you

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
you

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.640 
you
that's<00:00:45.920> it<00:00:46.190> both<00:00:46.640> icons<00:00:47.090> are<00:00:47.330> now<00:00:47.450> green<00:00:47.750> now

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
that's it both icons are now green now

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.440 
that's it both icons are now green now
when<00:00:48.980> I<00:00:49.010> change<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.550> color<00:00:49.730> using<00:00:50.180> color

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
when I change the color using color

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.660 
when I change the color using color
picker<00:00:50.750> you<00:00:51.320> can<00:00:51.500> see<00:00:51.710> that<00:00:51.890> all<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.280> changes

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
picker you can see that all the changes

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.979 
picker you can see that all the changes
are<00:00:52.700> instantly<00:00:52.940> visible<00:00:53.660> on<00:00:53.810> the<00:00:53.900> canvas

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
are instantly visible on the canvas

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.720 
are instantly visible on the canvas
next<00:00:56.989> I<00:00:57.110> would<00:00:57.200> like<00:00:57.530> this<00:00:57.860> background<00:00:58.070> oval

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
next I would like this background oval

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.479 
next I would like this background oval
to<00:00:58.910> have<00:00:59.060> a<00:00:59.090> gradient<00:00:59.420> fill<00:00:59.810> to<00:01:00.590> do<00:01:00.710> this<00:01:00.890> let's

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
to have a gradient fill to do this let's

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.100 
to have a gradient fill to do this let's
create<00:01:01.640> two<00:01:02.000> colors<00:01:02.390> that<00:01:02.420> will<00:01:02.750> define<00:01:03.050> my

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
create two colors that will define my

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.560 
create two colors that will define my
background<00:01:03.739> gradient<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.820> first<00:01:05.059> color<00:01:05.330> will

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
background gradient the first color will

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.760 
background gradient the first color will
be<00:01:05.690> named<00:01:05.930> top<00:01:06.380> color

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.249 

it<00:01:09.579> will<00:01:09.700> be<00:01:09.820> used<00:01:10.060> as<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.299> gradients<00:01:10.960> first

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
it will be used as the gradients first

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.560 
it will be used as the gradients first
stop<00:01:11.530> color<00:01:11.829> now<00:01:12.759> let<00:01:13.000> me<00:01:13.090> show<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.299> one<00:01:13.539> of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
stop color now let me show you one of

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.480 
stop color now let me show you one of
paint<00:01:13.899> codes<00:01:14.140> most<00:01:14.380> interesting<00:01:15.100> features

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
paint codes most interesting features

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.779 
paint codes most interesting features
derived<00:01:16.329> colors<00:01:16.840> this<00:01:17.590> top<00:01:17.890> color<00:01:18.219> will<00:01:18.670> be

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
derived colors this top color will be

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.850 
derived colors this top color will be
based<00:01:19.030> on<00:01:19.240> my<00:01:19.390> icon<00:01:19.869> color<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.619> will<00:01:20.770> be

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
based on my icon color it will be

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.399 
based on my icon color it will be
derived<00:01:21.219> using<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.880> shadow<00:01:22.210> operation<00:01:23.020> which

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
derived using the shadow operation which

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.859 
derived using the shadow operation which
makes<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.799> base<00:01:23.950> color<00:01:24.219> darker<00:01:24.759> let's<00:01:25.689> set

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
makes the base color darker let's set

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.359 
makes the base color darker let's set
the<00:01:25.960> shadow<00:01:26.140> operation<00:01:26.799> value<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.490> 40%<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
the shadow operation value to 40% the

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.859 
the shadow operation value to 40% the
second<00:01:30.729> gradient<00:01:30.969> color<00:01:31.360> will<00:01:31.539> be<00:01:31.659> called

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
second gradient color will be called

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.210 
second gradient color will be called
bottom<00:01:32.439> color

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
bottom color

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.800 
bottom color
again<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.340> will<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.520> based<00:01:35.760> on<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.120> icon<00:01:36.510> color

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
again it will be based on the icon color

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.140 
again it will be based on the icon color
but<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.530> time<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.950> will<00:01:38.250> use<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.730> highlight

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
but this time I will use the highlight

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.320 
but this time I will use the highlight
operation<00:01:39.810> instead<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> value<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.460> 60%

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
operation instead with a value of 60%

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.720 
operation instead with a value of 60%
when<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> create<00:01:43.620> gradient<00:01:44.160> and<00:01:44.250> open<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
when I create gradient and open the

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.850 
when I create gradient and open the
gradient<00:01:44.940> control<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:46.020> assign<00:01:46.290> any<00:01:46.590> color

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
gradient control I can assign any color

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.800 
gradient control I can assign any color
from<00:01:47.130> my<00:01:47.310> library<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:48.030> color<00:01:48.210> steps<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
from my library to color steps in the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.960 
from my library to color steps in the
gradient<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.920> first<00:01:50.130> step<00:01:50.370> will<00:01:50.550> be<00:01:50.580> top

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
gradient the first step will be top

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.030 
gradient the first step will be top
color<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.990> second<00:01:52.410> will<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.590> bottom

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
color and the second will be bottom

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.780 
color and the second will be bottom
color

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.760 

once<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.330> have<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> gradient<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.500> assign

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
once we have the gradient we can assign

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.530 
once we have the gradient we can assign
it<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:58.980> the<00:01:59.160> fill<00:01:59.400> of<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.670> oval<00:01:59.940> shape<00:02:00.180> behind

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
it to the fill of the oval shape behind

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.300 
it to the fill of the oval shape behind
my<00:02:00.750> icon<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.990> see<00:02:04.230> the<00:02:04.560> gradient<00:02:04.890> has

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
my icon as you can see the gradient has

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.880 
my icon as you can see the gradient has
darker<00:02:05.760> top<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.300> brighter<00:02:06.720> bottom<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.320> need<00:02:07.800> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
darker top and brighter bottom I need to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.500 
darker top and brighter bottom I need to
swap<00:02:08.130> these<00:02:08.340> colors<00:02:08.760> to<00:02:09.030> reverse<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.479> order

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
swap these colors to reverse the order

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.630 
swap these colors to reverse the order
of<00:02:09.899> colors<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.440> gradient<00:02:10.710> just<00:02:11.250> use<00:02:11.460> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
of colors and a gradient just use the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.900 
of colors and a gradient just use the
swap<00:02:11.850> tool<00:02:12.120> in<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> gradient<00:02:12.780> control<00:02:13.910> let's

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
swap tool in the gradient control let's

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.460 
swap tool in the gradient control let's
assign<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.450> same<00:02:15.690> gradient<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.380> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
assign the same gradient to the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.300 
assign the same gradient to the
background<00:02:16.950> oval<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.520> my<00:02:17.700> second<00:02:18.090> icon<00:02:18.210> as<00:02:19.310> you

background oval of my second icon as you

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.730 
background oval of my second icon as you
can<00:02:20.460> see<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.120> stroke<00:02:21.420> color<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:21.900> my<00:02:22.050> icon<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.710> a

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
can see the stroke color of my icon is a

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.140 
can see the stroke color of my icon is a
little<00:02:23.070> bit<00:02:23.220> lost<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.730> front<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
little bit lost in front of the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.720 
little bit lost in front of the
background<00:02:24.330> gradient<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.650> fix<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.280> will

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
background gradient to fix this I will

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.270 
background gradient to fix this I will
create<00:02:27.030> another<00:02:27.390> color<00:02:27.720> let's<00:02:28.320> name<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.620> icon

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
create another color let's name it icon

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.420 
create another color let's name it icon
stroke<00:02:29.640> color<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.630> will<00:02:31.590> also<00:02:31.890> be<00:02:32.010> based<00:02:32.220> on

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
stroke color it will also be based on

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.340 
stroke color it will also be based on
the<00:02:32.550> icon<00:02:32.910> color<00:02:33.150> derived<00:02:33.780> using<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
the icon color derived using the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
the icon color derived using the
highlight<00:02:34.890> operation<00:02:35.490> set<00:02:35.790> at<00:02:35.910> 80%<00:02:36.240> value<00:02:37.370> now

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
highlight operation set at 80% value now

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.430 
highlight operation set at 80% value now
I<00:02:38.400> can<00:02:38.820> assign<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.330> color<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.840> stroke<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.320> my

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
I can assign this color to stroke of my

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.590 
I can assign this color to stroke of my
icon<00:02:40.830> by<00:02:41.190> dragging<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.820> connection<00:02:42.240> dot<00:02:42.420> as

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
icon by dragging the connection dot as

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:52.210 
icon by dragging the connection dot as
we<00:02:43.020> did<00:02:43.170> before

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.440 

well<00:02:53.220> everything<00:02:53.790> seems<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:54.090> be<00:02:54.180> all<00:02:54.330> right

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
well everything seems to be all right

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.449 
well everything seems to be all right
now<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:55.590> last<00:02:55.830> thing<00:02:56.069> I<00:02:56.130> would<00:02:56.250> like<00:02:56.280> to

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
now the last thing I would like to

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.220 
now the last thing I would like to
change<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.300> stroke<00:02:57.599> color<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:58.080> this

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
change is the stroke color of this

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.680 
change is the stroke color of this
background<00:02:58.440> oval<00:02:59.069> for<00:02:59.700> this<00:02:59.819> I<00:03:00.030> will<00:03:00.390> create

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
background oval for this I will create

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.110 
background oval for this I will create
another<00:03:01.020> color<00:03:01.319> name<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.099> background<00:03:02.459> stroke

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
another color name it background stroke

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.170 
another color name it background stroke
color<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.599> set<00:03:04.050> its<00:03:04.200> base<00:03:04.440> color<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.890> my<00:03:05.670> icon

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
color and set its base color to my icon

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
color and set its base color to my icon
color

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
color

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.670 
color
we<00:03:08.920> will<00:03:09.040> now<00:03:09.190> use<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.640> shadow<00:03:09.880> operation

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.500 

let's<00:03:13.680> assign<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.130> color<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.670> stroke<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.330> both

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
let's assign the color to stroke of both

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.660 
let's assign the color to stroke of both
ovals

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.120 

it<00:03:19.599> seems<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.930> little<00:03:20.020> bit<00:03:20.260> darker<00:03:20.650> than<00:03:20.800> I<00:03:20.860> want

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
it seems a little bit darker than I want

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.010 
it seems a little bit darker than I want
so<00:03:21.459> let's<00:03:21.670> fix<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.180> in<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.390> color<00:03:22.599> picker

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
so let's fix this in the color picker

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.510 
so let's fix this in the color picker
by<00:03:23.440> changing<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.010> amount<00:03:24.099> of<00:03:24.310> shadow

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
by changing the amount of shadow

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.960 
by changing the amount of shadow
operation

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
operation

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.870 
operation
all<00:03:27.500> parts<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.650> icons<00:03:29.070> are<00:03:29.280> now<00:03:29.430> using<00:03:29.790> our

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
all parts of the icons are now using our

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.550 
all parts of the icons are now using our
newly<00:03:30.330> defined<00:03:30.480> colors

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
newly defined colors

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.010 
newly defined colors
so<00:03:33.190> now<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.459> can<00:03:33.760> show<00:03:33.970> you<00:03:34.030> how<00:03:34.270> changes<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.930> the

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
so now I can show you how changes of the

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.020 
so now I can show you how changes of the
base<00:03:35.200> icon<00:03:35.680> color<00:03:35.950> are<00:03:36.190> propagated<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:36.940> all

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
base icon color are propagated to all

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.540 
base icon color are propagated to all
it's<00:03:37.390> derived<00:03:37.720> colors<00:03:38.140> when<00:03:38.860> I<00:03:38.890> move<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.280> hue

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
it's derived colors when I move the hue

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.460 
it's derived colors when I move the hue
slider<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:40.390> can<00:03:40.420> see<00:03:40.780> that<00:03:40.930> all<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.290> colors

slider you can see that all the colors

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.930 
slider you can see that all the colors
derived<00:03:42.010> from<00:03:42.100> my<00:03:42.280> base<00:03:42.459> color<00:03:42.700> are

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
derived from my base color are

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.240 
derived from my base color are
automatically<00:03:43.870> updated<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.830> icons
