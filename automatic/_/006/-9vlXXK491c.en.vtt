00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.030
 i 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.299
 game theory studies the 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.889
 situations in which both 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.750
 actions performed by individuals 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.270
 as the results that to expect from 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.730
 they depend on the actions that others 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.800
 can carry out 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.449
 given that those situations of 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.390
 interdependence are so related 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.070
 with what others can do they will give 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.140
 place to be adopted different 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.170
 strategies and that you can try 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.030
 determine what are the actions that 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.220
 the different individuals will carry out 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.160
 in the search for the best results 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.550
 possible is to say that the theory of 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.100
 games study the situations of 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.500
 strategic interdependence 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.329
 the elements that are necessarily 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.460
 present in each approach in the 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.760
 scope of game theory are several 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.739
 first of all the players also 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:07.729
 the strategies and information actions 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.470
 payments and balances the players are 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.700
 the individuals who have to take the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.560
 decisions 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.810
 assuming always that they seek to obtain 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.260
 the best possible payments is to say 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.930
 looking to maximize your utility 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.700
 the actions are each one of the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.250
 possible alternatives that a player 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.040
 can adopt at any time in which 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.660
 he has to decide 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.060
 logically opt for one or the other 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.490
 looking to maximize your utility and 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.530
 taking into account both the possible 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.350
 states of nature that can 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.630
 occur as the possible actions that 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.350
 the rest of the players can carry 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.290
 cape 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.390
 the information is nothing but the degree of 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.420
 knowledge that is available in each 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.190
 moment about the values of the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.960
 Knowledge is different 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.899
 how the game has developed 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.600
 until then and the actions that 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.320
 everyone has taken 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.299
 the payments or rewards represent the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.239
 utility that players receive when 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.459
 end the game whose assessment has not 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.100
 of necessarily being carried out in 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.640
 monetary terms 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.530
 finally the balance is the whole 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.550
 of strategies that players carry 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.800
 out when participating in the game 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.170
 to facilitate its understanding and 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.180
 interpretation there are two possible 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.460
 representations of the games the 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.770
 matrix also known as 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.020
 normal representation and the way 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.440
 extensive or representation in the form of 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.360
 tree the normal or matrix form will 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.640
 usually use but not in a way 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.770
 exclusive when there are only two 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.380
 players in such a way that they can 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.470
 put your possible strategies in rows 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.260
 those of player number one and in columns 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.320
 those of player number two as you can 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.710
 appreciate in the example the payments are 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.430
 show inside the cells 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.550
 corresponding being the payment of 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.130
 player number one which is represented 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.250
 closer to him is to say before the 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.880
 comma and that of player number two that 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.470
 is placed after the coma so the possible 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.580
 strategies among which you can choose 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.820
 the number one player in this figure are 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.080
 and b while the player number 2 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.690
 you can choose between xe iu 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.820
 if the number one player chooses to and the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.190
 player number two opts for the 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.540
 strategy x the payments that one and others 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.460
 receive are 8 and 7 respectively the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.890
 reading of the payments included in each 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.100
 one of the other three boxes is 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.710
 analogous to the exposed 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.200
 the extensive or shaped representation 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.480
 tree showing exactly the same 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.730
 information that the matrix form but 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.520
 ordered in a more graphic way 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.100
 as we see below in this figure 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.530
 as you can see if the player 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.720
 number one employs the strategy 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.850
 and player number two uses the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.250
 strategy x the payments that both 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.010
 players get are 8 and 7 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.680
 respectively and so on to 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.780
 the 4 existing possibilities that 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.200
 they are obviously the same as this one 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.570
 same game when we have represented 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.460
 previously in a matrix form for 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.200
 prevent it from being interpreted that first 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.150
 choose player number one and then what 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.560
 makes player number 2 since 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.440
 reading the graph from left to 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.830
 right it might seem that 's the way we have 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.740
 represented that ellipse that receives the 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.660
 name of information set that 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.850
 joining the two points where the 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.210
 player number 2 could have to 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.100
 choose in this way we want to indicate 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.910
 that player number 2 performs his 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.790
 single election ignoring the one of 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.010
 player number 1 what could happen 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.440
 If the choice is simultaneous or if the 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.840
 player number 2 makes his decision with 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:08.389
 after the player number 1 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.389
 without having information about it
