Hi and welcome to a new video of the maemo Games: series!

00:00:06.647 --> 00:00:14.414
I am zehjotkah from meetmeego.org and in this video I'll show you a preview of a yet unreleased game.

00:00:26.096 --> 00:00:29.716
It's about Rollercoaster Rush Jurassic

00:00:32.224 --> 00:00:36.927
It will be available at the Ovi Store, soon.

00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:50.447
Starting the game will show you an intro video after the loading process.

00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:07.038
The aim of the game is to bring the train of a Rollercoaster to the finish safe.

00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:14.724
Please keep in mind: this is an unreleased test-version, so there could be changes regarding perfomance in the final version.

00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:46.513
You can control the game either via touchscreen on the left bottom side.

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:56.497
Or simply use the accelerometer, which for me is the option of choice.

00:02:03.447 --> 00:02:13.601
The graphics are nice, a little bit comic-ish, so there is no problem with cube-like trees.

00:02:16.364 --> 00:02:25.865
This was a little bit boring... It was the first level! Check out the next one!

00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:38.732
This track is a little bit more difficult, because you can't simply accelerate all the time...

00:02:50.515 --> 00:02:55.618
Doing this, you will lose the game very fast.

00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:16.972
