00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
start increasing your vertical in the

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.950 
start increasing your vertical in the
next<00:00:10.380> two<00:00:10.620> weeks<00:00:10.889> or<00:00:11.130> quicker<00:00:11.719> the<00:00:12.719> first

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
next two weeks or quicker the first

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.350 
next two weeks or quicker the first
thing<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.410> what<00:00:14.040> why<00:00:14.309> do<00:00:14.370> people<00:00:14.730> not<00:00:14.880> succeed

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
thing is what why do people not succeed

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.420 
thing is what why do people not succeed
first<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> lack<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.170> knowledge<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:17.010> correct

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
first is a lack of knowledge of correct

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.120 
first is a lack of knowledge of correct
principles<00:00:18.180> second<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> lack<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.680> knowledge

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
principles second is a lack of knowledge

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.960 
principles second is a lack of knowledge
of<00:00:20.550> correct<00:00:21.300> practices<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.560> techniques<00:00:23.189> so

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
of correct practices and techniques so

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.130 
of correct practices and techniques so
basically<00:00:24.449> that's<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.750> difference<00:00:24.930> between

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
basically that's the difference between

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.700 
basically that's the difference between
what<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.340> do<00:00:26.640> versus<00:00:27.570> how<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.930> do<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.529> and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
what you do versus how you do it and

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.169 
what you do versus how you do it and
there's<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.250> big<00:00:29.429> difference<00:00:29.640> i'm<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> go

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
there's a big difference i'm going to go

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.089 
there's a big difference i'm going to go
into<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.570> little<00:00:30.689> bit<00:00:30.869> later<00:00:31.109> third<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
into that a little bit later third of

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.430 
into that a little bit later third of
all<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.369> lack<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.579> discipline<00:00:33.270> or<00:00:33.510> ability

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
all is a lack of discipline or ability

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.500 
all is a lack of discipline or ability
to<00:00:34.620> apply<00:00:34.920> proper<00:00:35.670> principles<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
to apply proper principles and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.560 
to apply proper principles and
techniques<00:00:37.309> consistently<00:00:38.309> over<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:39.059> period<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
techniques consistently over a period of

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.049 
techniques consistently over a period of
time<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.620> last<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.160> simply<00:00:41.640> lack<00:00:41.850> of

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
time and the last one is simply lack of

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.490 
time and the last one is simply lack of
proper<00:00:42.390> nutrition<00:00:42.870> i'm<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> go<00:00:43.350> into

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
proper nutrition i'm going to go into

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.040 
proper nutrition i'm going to go into

just go out there and have some ghost

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.280

rider<00:01:24.150> who<00:01:24.330> knows<00:01:24.479> very<00:01:24.840> little<00:01:24.930> about

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
rider who knows very little about

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.679 
rider who knows very little about
jumping<00:01:25.950> right<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> training<00:01:27.060> manual<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.600> it's

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
jumping right a training manual and it's

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.270 
jumping right a training manual and it's
a<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.140> huge<00:01:28.380> disservice<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
a it's a huge disservice to the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.700 
a it's a huge disservice to the
community<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.270> another<00:01:31.229> reason<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
community so another reason is that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.969 
community so another reason is that
correct<00:01:32.570> explosion<00:01:33.570> training<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
correct explosion training really is

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.069 
correct explosion training really is
counterintuitive<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:36.210> mean<00:01:36.720> you're<00:01:36.930> going<00:01:37.020> to

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
counterintuitive I mean you're going to

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.870 
counterintuitive I mean you're going to
train<00:01:37.409> wrong<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.369> feel<00:01:38.700> like

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
train wrong and it's going to feel like

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.539 
train wrong and it's going to feel like
you're<00:01:39.060> training<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:39.860> most<00:01:40.860> coaches<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
you're training right most coaches and

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.100 
you're training right most coaches and
trainers<00:01:41.670> simply<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.360> experts<00:01:42.869> out

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
trainers simply are not experts out

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.740 
trainers simply are not experts out
there<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.500> know<00:01:43.590> I've<00:01:43.680> listened<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.159> coaches

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
there you know I've listened to coaches

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
there you know I've listened to coaches
trained<00:01:45.750> me<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> wrong<00:01:46.229> way<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.710> many<00:01:46.890> years

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
trained me the wrong way for many years

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.530 
trained me the wrong way for many years
and<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.490> wasn't<00:01:47.729> until<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.939> ran<00:01:48.240> into<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and it wasn't until I ran into the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.510 
and it wasn't until I ran into the
correct<00:01:48.840> principles<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.009> knew<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.250> they

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
correct principles that I knew that they

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.920 
correct principles that I knew that they
just<00:01:50.670> weren't<00:01:50.880> properly<00:01:51.240> trained<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:51.899> that

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
just weren't properly trained for that

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.569 
just weren't properly trained for that
now<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> other<00:01:53.070> things<00:01:53.220> is

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
now one of the other things is

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.179 
now one of the other things is
discipline<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.329> not<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.290> never<00:01:55.530> was<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
discipline is not and it never was and

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.240 
discipline is not and it never was and
it<00:01:56.280> never<00:01:56.549> will<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:57.240> easy<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.990> come<00:01:58.259> by<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.950> even

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it never will be easy to come by so even

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.280 
it never will be easy to come by so even
if<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.820> right<00:01:59.969> information<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.780> lot
