00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.440
 if the fiat will then have bmw mini and six hundred suddenly 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.330
 purity 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.569
 in 1906 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:11.419
 what is being done 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.679
 in the garage already the pohang 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.589
 and the marcelo will also explain 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.230
 How is this car being made? 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.340
 What I saw was a very interesting detail. 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.739
 not to stir 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.149
 the wheels origin 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.150
 the rays of wood 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.300
 A work was done 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.740
 one of the wheels 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.010
 victor followed the move 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.800
 of the car that is not taught 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
 and preserved these wheels 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.050
 the original sites and woods 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.160
 were made 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.470
 16 and is more than 100 years old 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.840
 and now marcelo cassaro and will stay 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.740
 what is being done in this reform durban 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.010
 1906 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.500
 they were crowded 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.180
 a lot of heart responsibility 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.430
 my assertion 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.700
 France had referred 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.950
 interesting insight that the people with eight months fighting car 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.079
 referring to five days of meeting 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:18.930
 the hotsite 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.820
 flows from hot to flat 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.540
 and I know it 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.840
 they intend to go to war 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.490
 at each event these agents 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.640
 with a bit of staying a few more and was different 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.320
 this is the third place 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.060
 in a straight line 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.260
 manufactured by renamo and Germans to register 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.720
 and the owners asked to make the bodies 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.180
 according to the personal characteristics 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
 I preferred to stay in the super aurora car they do 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.670
 and a trunk in the back 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.370
 so your car 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.670
 what we all say so the two or three touches 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.720
 I like what I do a bodywork 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.060
 one of the other I said that I had stated that I knew several 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.250
 the promoters of the test 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.559
 and was the only one for all positions in the body that was different 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:15.619
 and in the bodywork also the lockers carpenter so much is that part of the 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.619
 the woodworking of that car or the regional 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.629
 the timber 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.859
 when you have too short 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.939
 because the problem here is not the rust is the termite 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.499
 things do not have much with the dry and hot weather 10 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.569
 each piece so that it was not so does not give 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.399
 the structure of places 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:37.009
 then this part 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.009
 car scratched very well maintained 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:44.049
 in more than 100 thousand euros is impressive the car has to be 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.629
 dilma remained right and precaver 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.390
 the coolest thing is that after the woodwork was placed there is to be done 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.319
 real arthur 18 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.279
 molded sheet 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.180
 farm 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.359
 his car's body looks more like a wagon than a cargo 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:07.759
 It's the beginning of the current 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.089
 the actors and others 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.499
 they were you have to get him 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:12.599
 yea 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.599
 I want a motorized cart because the longer one 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.839
 is the former chairman of the body 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:20.829
 and apart 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.729
 structural of the wood 'was it was as if it were of the capital capixaba pablo armourer 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.289
 my car is a carriage engines 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:31.739
 marcelo 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.079
 and this wound from the net 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.249
 and know that it is a characteristic front of all cases 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.529
 independent of the body type 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:41.319
 the mother's body leaves 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.689
 I learned the region's characteristic and it is amazing that until Friday 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.269
 sheet metal and discovered 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.169
 because when setting 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.719
 the general welfare design only without the result evaluated 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:58.029
 usually the record in the middle of the table are so the responsibility 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:04.659
 and thus restore earth's crust is a common feature agreement 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.330
 the alpha I ran 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.940
 another alert is to characterize it as the characteristic of it 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.949
 every time later this Thursday 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.809
 then it spread 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:19.039
 has entered 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.959
 almost all 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.079
 to taste 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.079
 consider yourself december 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:36.860
 if it is written revealed beasts 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.860
 at the 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.199
 retirement of old cars is like this. 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.330
 I found a6 bmw mini retro effects to stop because I 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.080
 I found an attitude 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.820
 another under the stairs 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.940
 other study arrays by friend nominations 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.449
 with other collectors is restoring think not on top of the 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:06.719
 tree 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:07.800
 and renews itself 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.850
 in 1906 and we will accompany 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.219
 this reform 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:15.099
 and in the next program 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.349
 Let's show the car ready. 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.509
 same period 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:20.469
 passion 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:21.789
 and so 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.669
 delay but happens 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.289
 the world without fear a dream 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.710
 I've always dreamed 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.110
 I have a goal 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.889
 strong all you want 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.779
 I just know it's a European sports car 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.779
 the cable before the decade 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.729
 fourth fred your dream 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.680
 what you just born 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.120
 his bike because he had 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.449
 until the next program
