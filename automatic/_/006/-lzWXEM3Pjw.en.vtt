00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.240
 hello everyone I'm the fire wolf 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.120
 As I promised you here I bring you the second part of the video this time 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.969
 I'll talk about the black hole of majora's mask 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.969
 well let's go to it 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.630
 as you could notice the back of the hero of time is a big black hole 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.899
 but in the majora's mask it becomes much deeper 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.309
 analyze each of the items that keep the limit is another saga 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.239
 the items that this legendary little boy carries are 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.679
 ocarina 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.260
 the arrows again are four 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.800
 bombs 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.450
 busch ous 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.150
 from qwest 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.660
 from q lux 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.230
 iss before 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.820
 barrel pump can only be used if it is the ing gordon 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.530
 photographic camera 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.270
 the eye of truth 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.020
 the jobs out 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.800
 the sword of ada 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.130
 six empty jars 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.840
 up to here the only thing that does not fit me so that it enters a back is the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.350
 barrel 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.199
 but well we already showed that this is not a limitation for black holes 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.160
 from the backs of these characters 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.110
 What I wonder is how you can wear 24 masks with you 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.180
 it's not logical and the most shocking thing is that he takes them out by putting his hand and 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.110
 they do not look for it and nothing is as if the mask were placed on his hand and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.440
 ready more expensive in a second 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.560
 because there are many masks I will only mention them, I will not 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.310
 describe what each of them does because otherwise the video would be quite long 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.850
 postman's cap 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.040
 mask for transnochado 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.970
 explosive mask 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.830
 stone mask 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.580
 the mask of the cta 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.240
 mascaraque with 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.950
 bermen mask 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.890
 the rabbit visor 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.960
 the mask where 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.930
 the mask of aromas 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.820
 the roman mask 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.080
 mask of the circus boss 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.880
 casey mask 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.990
 Grooms mask 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.880
 the most expensive of the truth 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.720
 camaro mask 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.520
 spinning mask 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.220
 garro mask 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.270
 Captain's mask 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.219
 and the giant mask 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:12.529
 these are the most expensive that do not contribute anything to history the only thing of these 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.790
 masks is that they are alternate stories 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.739
 due to the game mode 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.739
 the masks that are part of the story are 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.029
 and the area 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:27.379
 within the equipment carries four more masks 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.290
 loquacious and would add 28 masks to the account 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.459
 which means that that black hole is very deep 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.280
 but hey who said that the black holes of these characters have a background 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.649
 these masks he gets when he releases each of the four giants 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.590
 of the curse of the mask the first one is the hollow mask the 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.349
 masked warrior of the jungle the second is the most expensive got the 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.239
 masked mechanical monster 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.120
 another of the masks and the third in the account is the region the guardian fish 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.069
 masked and lastly the last mask is the insect tourism 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.009
 masked giant 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.069
 carries with it as is constumbre the sword as the main weapon 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.269
 as well as the shield 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.849
 he also carries with him a yellow notebook in which he writes down what 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.379
 Characters was talking throughout the game 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.559
 yes but how can we forget about the rupee bag and the thing that serves so that 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:20.489
 keep your arrows thing just as rare that you can save just a bunch of 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.529
 arrows there 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:25.039
 maybe I also used a two-dimensional vortex like the 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:27.829
 back but we who know 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:28.620
 wait 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.040
 I almost forgot to tell you about the ocarina 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.970
 since as you know, this changes every link that changes into a gordon 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.769
 dark respectively let's see 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.879
 when it is limit that trumpet species come out of the back 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.730
 and look closely at the size they are larger than the little basin child is 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.979
 convert the inc 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:50.779
 I still name the instruments but I will do it in order of sizes 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:54.939
 the one that follows according to its size is the guitar when it becomes an area 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.010
 see nothing else that size if we stop that guitar guitar between 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.919
 quotation marks 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.719
 because it is the skeleton of a fish 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.869
 it's the size of the young area, it may even be bigger 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:09.049
 and I wanted to leave for the last the instrument of the gordon since this is 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.289
 the one that does not let me sleep at night because I'm thinking about the size and how 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:17.400
 can enter a back look at those drums several of them surpass 

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.489
 easily the size of the child inc 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.180
 How can that be possible 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.240
 not until here left once again the issue of black holes 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.030
 soon more black holes but for now I say goodbye
