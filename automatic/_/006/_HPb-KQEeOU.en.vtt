00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
of the actual where the wallpaper here

of the actual where the wallpaper here
so<00:01:20.110> you<00:01:20.200> can<00:01:20.320> see<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:20.649> slightly<00:01:21.039> moving<00:01:21.490> and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
so you can see this slightly moving and

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.670 
so you can see this slightly moving and
this<00:01:22.299> is<00:01:22.420> actually<00:01:22.720> dependent<00:01:22.840> on<00:01:23.350> the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
this is actually dependent on the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.160 
this is actually dependent on the
orientation<00:01:24.369> of<00:01:24.430> your<00:01:24.579> phone<00:01:24.790> as<00:01:25.000> well<00:01:25.150> so<00:01:25.780> as

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
orientation of your phone as well so as

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.450 
orientation of your phone as well so as
you<00:01:26.350> sort<00:01:26.500> of<00:01:26.590> move<00:01:26.829> it<00:01:26.950> around<00:01:26.979> you'll<00:01:27.369> be

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
you sort of move it around you'll be

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.800 
you sort of move it around you'll be
able<00:01:27.549> to<00:01:27.670> see<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:27.909> little<00:01:28.150> stars<00:01:28.479> climbing

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
able to see the little stars climbing

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.990 
able to see the little stars climbing
move<00:01:28.960> from<00:01:29.110> side<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.380> side<00:01:29.640> which<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.790> pretty

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
move from side to side which is pretty

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.120 
move from side to side which is pretty
cool<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.170> what<00:01:32.320> this<00:01:32.439> actually<00:01:32.590> does<00:01:32.770> is

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
cool so and what this actually does is

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.920 
cool so and what this actually does is
when<00:01:33.250> you<00:01:33.280> go<00:01:33.460> into<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.790> app<00:01:33.909> itself<00:01:34.299> it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
when you go into the app itself it

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
just go and I'm not quite advice here so

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.910 
just go and I'm not quite advice here so
as<00:02:10.600> you<00:02:10.690> can<00:02:10.810> see<00:02:10.989> this<00:02:11.140> one's<00:02:11.410> being<00:02:11.650> applied

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
as you can see this one's being applied

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.220 
as you can see this one's being applied
now<00:02:12.250> if<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:12.940> go<00:02:13.060> into<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.359> settings<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.930> be<00:02:14.109> able

now if I go into the settings to be able

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.740 
now if I go into the settings to be able
to<00:02:14.320> see<00:02:14.620> how<00:02:15.459> this<00:02:15.609> will<00:02:15.790> work<00:02:15.820> so<00:02:16.359> when<00:02:16.570> we<00:02:16.630> go

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
to see how this will work so when we go

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.720 
to see how this will work so when we go
into<00:02:16.870> wallpapers<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.160> we<00:02:18.280> can't<00:02:18.519> choose

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
into wallpapers and we can't choose

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.110 
into wallpapers and we can't choose
wallpaper<00:02:18.970> go<00:02:19.540> into<00:02:19.930> dynamic<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.760> we<00:02:21.940> have

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
wallpaper go into dynamic and we have

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.699 
wallpaper go into dynamic and we have
kind<00:02:22.390> of<00:02:22.450> extra<00:02:22.870> ones<00:02:23.049> unfortunately<00:02:23.620> can

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
kind of extra ones unfortunately can

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.650 
kind of extra ones unfortunately can
only<00:02:23.799> have<00:02:23.950> one<00:02:24.160> at<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.310> time<00:02:24.519> so<00:02:24.850> each<00:02:25.330> time<00:02:25.599> you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
only have one at a time so each time you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.930 
only have one at a time so each time you
have<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.959> go<00:02:26.080> back<00:02:26.290> into<00:02:26.530> our<00:02:27.220> dynamic<00:02:27.790> and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
have to go back into our dynamic and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.940 
have to go back into our dynamic and
change<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.390> but<00:02:29.110> what<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.319> can<00:02:29.440> do<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.739> have

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
change it but what we can do is have

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.370 
change it but what we can do is have
this<00:02:30.099> one

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
this one

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.470 
this one
which<00:02:30.500> is<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> let's<00:02:31.520> say<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:32.210> new<00:02:32.330> one

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
which is a let's say the the new one

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.210 
which is a let's say the the new one
we've<00:02:32.600> just<00:02:32.780> added<00:02:32.960> here<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.290> if<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.010> come<00:02:34.190> out

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
we've just added here so if I come out

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.100 
we've just added here so if I come out
of<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.550> you'd<00:02:34.760> be<00:02:34.790> able<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.930> little

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
of this you'd be able to have a little

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.690 
of this you'd be able to have a little
bit<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.380> demonstration<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:37.100> how<00:02:37.250> these<00:02:37.430> work

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
bit of a demonstration of how these work

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.250 
bit of a demonstration of how these work
so<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:37.970> is<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.150> little<00:02:38.630> bit<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.840> one<00:02:39.050> for<00:02:39.200> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
so this is a little bit of one for the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.460 
so this is a little bit of one for the
ladies<00:02:39.650> which<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.870> little<00:02:42.050> sort<00:02:42.440> of

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
ladies which is the little sort of

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.650 
ladies which is the little sort of
flowers<00:02:42.710> and<00:02:42.890> stuff<00:02:43.100> there<00:02:43.340> if<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.300> just<00:02:44.450> go

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
flowers and stuff there if I just go

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.240 
flowers and stuff there if I just go
ahead<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.020> do<00:02:45.140> one<00:02:45.410> more<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:45.830> I'll<00:02:45.890> just<00:02:46.040> go

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
ahead and do one more so I'll just go

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.160 
ahead and do one more so I'll just go
and<00:02:46.430> do<00:02:46.550> this<00:02:46.730> one<00:02:46.940> here<00:02:47.240> so<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.690> can<00:02:47.870> see<00:02:48.020> this

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
and do this one here so you can see this

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.440 
and do this one here so you can see this
is<00:02:48.290> pretty<00:02:48.500> much<00:02:48.590> quite<00:02:49.340> similar<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.300> ones

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
is pretty much quite similar to the ones

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.270 
is pretty much quite similar to the ones
that<00:02:50.540> actually<00:02:50.690> come<00:02:51.020> with<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.380> phone<00:02:51.920> itself

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
that actually come with the phone itself

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.130 
that actually come with the phone itself
just<00:02:52.880> press<00:02:53.090> install<00:02:53.450> do<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.750> quick<00:02:54.020> little

respring<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.920> then<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.130> should<00:02:55.310> sort<00:02:55.850> of

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
respring and then it should sort of

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.270 
respring and then it should sort of
install<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:57.170> apply<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.530> straightaway<00:02:58.070> so

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
install it and apply it straightaway so

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
my device just yet but I would really

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.550
