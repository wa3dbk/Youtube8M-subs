 of our Italy and still today there 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.269
 I will show a batch of games really 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:15.509
 interesting with a part of f.cap 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.170
 wonderful however precise I have 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.130
 discovered that the championship of the second 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.250
 English division 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.769
 len power championship ends in March 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.660
 so the two episodes are at maximum high e 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.000
 in our video camera constant 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.300
 will end anyway we leave immediately at home 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.370
 against lips town this in the sixth minute 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.809
 immediately tommy vee ilenia on deviation 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.950
 marks this fine goal then all 88th 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.710
 enne is output this stops this 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.170
 goal grinded apparently debut with 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.989
 this great ass for jerry mbakogu 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.030
 that in the end always marks him if there 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.460
 notice mbakogu's goals come 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.340
 seems end of the game also ends 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.940
 the match 2 to 0 for other wolverhamton 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.940
 three fundamental points 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.689
 now let's go play rome at home 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.580
 in our moulinex tedium look at the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.650
 training because the menin passenger 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.650
 f.cap are all reservations 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.920
 we play against the d'erce field at 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.350
 seventh minute morata lanza well known 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.119
 that physically throws opponents and then of 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.090
 left crosses where the goalkeeper a little 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.540
 get to the ninth minute 10 aces 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.520
 imbesi has our second bomber of the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.600
 team as a muse today will not score 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.549
 if I 'm not mistaken or at least dry for now 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.340
 who returns from the injury per word puts 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:49.290
 in the midst of death this caravan 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:51.630
 phenomenal phenomenal really great goal e 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.850
 security goal 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.500
 however at the 42nd on a hole in the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:02.130
 defense scanner marks for the dance field 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.259
 at the forty-fourth and in my opinion who 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.450
 will end at the ninetieth this 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.009
 awesome of mbakogu premium 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.229
 wrong then remedy immediately 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.550
 ninetieth then between one and ends the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.880
 game 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.350
 now real bad boys comfortable there 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.800
 please do not change channels 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.960
 there is a big como in f cup party 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:27.830

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:30.930
 villa libri lane will be a match 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.640
 phenomenal our kids dream of a 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.800
 such moment we arrive at the eighths 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.360
 of final 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.900
 we are the sixteenth if we pass we go 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.900
 in the second round 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.430
 I hope you enjoy this part 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.520
 here is the entry into the field of ours 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.520
 boys 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.310
 however, he immediately puts himself on the second 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.500
 minute we try muse immediately but the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.960
 goalkeeper now rejects muse enters e 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.510
 new enlarges for villas and cottages arrives 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.670
 vineyard displaces tommy vee goalkeeper 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.170
 slight second consecutive goal for the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.450
 midfielder great goal at the twentieth 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.600
 but 48 is about to finish the first time 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.400
 look up here but what does a combine? 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.780
 intervention is wonderful 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.240
 the first half ends on the advance 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.360
 anthony will evolve in excellent travel 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:28.170
 try the boys we go to the second 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.840
 time to the seventieth if that that 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.130
 slips to Ireland in front of the door 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.080
 displaces together a 78th anyway 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.080
 but cogo launches sigthÃ³rsson 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.050
 at the eighty-eighth stop on the chest and at 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.470
 area limit starts a right 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.600
 impressive 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.910
 sixth goal of the season is a great goal and goal 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.030
 of the passage of the shift because the 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.430
 game will end which will end 2 1 for the 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.820
 wolverhampton and wolves by roberto baggio 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.709
 continue to fly and dream at the last 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.810
 minute there is this action blocked by 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.310
 put in this ugly cross 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.690
 the game ends here as you can see it has 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.690
 one we pass the turn 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.290
 I had a problem but I am not sorry 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.070
 left the first goal of 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.590
 villas enya however you will see that the 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.910
 game will go bad anyway it's okay if 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.010
 anyway, September does not apply to me 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.540
 like in the meantime that you read anyway 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:27.410
 on the 33rd goal of the opponents with kraft 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.410
 croft 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.220
 then we relive the goal because I have 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.699
 done the first so I do say for 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.110
 this to entertain you a little 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.819
 see the first 3 fiction 1 with goals from 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.889
 then villas and in the computation register in 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:44.819
 final like the internet and the problem ad 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:49.060
 please stick to the balanced advantage 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:51.060
 opponents shoot from within the area and 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.300
 another duck is made as usual 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.430
 however 2 1 ends for them so yes 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.979
 stop the positive strip and if you give it to him 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.400
 play against the cardiff 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:05.620
 at the eighteenth bellamy puts in the middle 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.870
 meeting and then this is a big one 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.870
 team maynard marks during the wind 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.190
 and musa lanza lucas piazon that if in his 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.870
 first as they mature a strange goal pulls 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.080
 on the first post the goalkeeper's duck 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.699
 marshall and at the 28th marks his 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.159
 first flight in the league with this bel 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:31.349
 left even if the goalkeeper could 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:33.849
 do much more at the 38th nyt ingham 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:36.400
 sorry whittingham marks the advantage 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.289
 of the landlords the cardiff anyway 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.320
 if you remember a square team 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:44.889
 always given a lot of hard work to 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:49.449
 a fast and powerful attack however at 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:52.710
 thirty-ninth but misses again 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.520
 in short monumental adversaries 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.580
 conquer the attention of the launch 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.800
 from outside to musa kusa entering it stands 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.240
 displaces the goalkeeper on his return again on 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.580
 our captain at the sixtieth now 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.409
 immediately sixty-eight both cogo 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.460
 sign another decisive goal I would make one 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.500
 statue 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.599
 if I were him I would make a coco bar 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.599
 because every time he comes in he always does 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.039
 goal so I don't know what to do with it anyway 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.139
 ninetieth the dreams of are extinguished 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:24.820
 cardiff draw with this parade 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:26.440
 venezie the game ends 3 to 2 e 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.610
 continues to fly in the charts there 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.680
 we resume immediately after the beating 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.889
 previous however a proposal arrives 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.900
 to the many a part of the del 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.800
 tottenham that offers us 35 thousand euros a 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.470
 week 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.180
 I was going to accept a poletto 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.789
 I can't leave guys in this 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.669
 moment in this decisive moment le 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.780
 change then decided to act 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:50.180
 however now I leave you leave with 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:54.500
 the championship standings are us 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:57.319
 seconds at 4 points from birmingham is at most 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.750
 6 from blackburn rovers then a good one 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:02.270
 moment for us we hope not to 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:08.169
 go playout player and playoff 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:13.719
 sorry now I'll show you 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:17.340
 the scoreboard f.cap board that from 

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:20.590
 see each other if we kids dream of it 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:23.710
 now look we are going to play 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.449
 against the new castle and if we were to 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.969
 win what's very unlikely anyway 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:33.550
 we will face one of the highest rating 

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:35.469
 to go to the semi-finals on the other 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.449
 instead part if dote to menswear 

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:39.120
 however, quite noble teams 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:40.960
 compared to us 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.699
 however now I leave you with 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.439
