reckon it will ok we're going to try a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.660 
reckon it will ok we're going to try a
lap<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.990> portion<00:02:27.440> out<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.830> don't<00:02:28.550> think

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
lap in the portion out I don't think

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.860 
lap in the portion out I don't think
it's<00:02:28.760> going<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:28.910> go<00:02:29.000> as<00:02:29.120> quick<00:02:29.330> spin<00:02:29.540> this<00:02:29.630> am

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
it's going to go as quick spin this am

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.220 
it's going to go as quick spin this am
let's<00:02:30.590> see<00:02:30.830> stopwatch<00:02:31.610> will<00:02:31.910> not<00:02:32.060> lie<00:02:32.270> here<00:02:33.110> we

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
let's see stopwatch will not lie here we

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.250 
let's see stopwatch will not lie here we
go

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
go

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.470 
go
straight<00:02:36.129> away<00:02:36.250> there's<00:02:36.610> more<00:02:36.760> movement<00:02:37.330> they

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
straight away there's more movement they

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.940 
straight away there's more movement they
want<00:02:37.900> goodness<00:02:38.260> me<00:02:38.489> over<00:02:39.489> these<00:02:39.610> bumps

goodness<00:03:26.880> me<00:03:26.910> that's<00:03:27.390> awful<00:03:27.840> lot<00:03:27.959> closer<00:03:28.200> than

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
goodness me that's awful lot closer than

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
goodness me that's awful lot closer than
I<00:03:28.470> thought<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.709> was<00:03:28.830> going<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.130> be

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
I thought it was going to be

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.259 
I thought it was going to be
well<00:03:31.239> that<00:03:31.480> enforce<00:03:32.519> all<00:03:33.519> right<00:03:33.610> then<00:03:33.790> last<00:03:34.000> up

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
well that enforce all right then last up

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.539 
well that enforce all right then last up
is<00:03:34.480> what<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:35.260> would<00:03:35.860> refer<00:03:36.129> to<00:03:36.159> as<00:03:36.310> the

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
is what I would refer to as the

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.020 
is what I would refer to as the
wild-card<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.750> audi<00:03:38.019> r8<00:03:38.319> v10<00:03:38.830> all<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.610> do<00:03:39.790> is

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
wild-card the audi r8 v10 all you do is

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:50.869 
wild-card the audi r8 v10 all you do is
have<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.959> go<00:03:41.140> so<00:03:46.829> unfortunately<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:49.690> brakes

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
have a go so unfortunately the brakes

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.080 
have a go so unfortunately the brakes
just<00:03:51.879> about<00:03:52.239> disappeared<00:03:52.870> on<00:03:53.049> audi<00:03:53.909> which<00:03:54.909> is

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
just about disappeared on audi which is

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.539 
just about disappeared on audi which is
a<00:03:55.120> shame<00:03:55.239> because<00:03:55.450> I<00:03:55.959> reckon<00:03:56.290> except<00:03:57.040> this

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
a shame because I reckon except this

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:06.110 
a shame because I reckon except this
time<00:03:58.709> done<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.739> couple<00:03:59.950> laps<00:04:00.340> in<00:04:00.489> it<00:04:01.650> but<00:04:02.650> the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.240 

acceleration<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.840> gearing<00:04:08.170> itself<00:04:08.859> not<00:04:09.190> the

circuit<00:04:12.970> just<00:04:13.299> right<00:04:14.640> if<00:04:15.640> you<00:04:15.849> can<00:04:16.060> commit

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389

under<00:04:16.690> in<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:16.959> braking<00:04:17.350> zones<00:04:17.560> running<00:04:17.949> out

under in the braking zones running out
in<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.280> course<00:04:18.579> and<00:04:18.820> then<00:04:19.389> this<00:04:19.539> am<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:20.310> think

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
in the course and then this am I think

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.860 
in the course and then this am I think
this<00:04:21.400> car<00:04:21.609> would<00:04:21.699> go<00:04:21.760> fast<00:04:22.150> neither<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.750> let's

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
this car would go fast neither and let's

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.180 
this car would go fast neither and let's
have<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:22.990> look<00:04:23.139> at<00:04:23.199> what<00:04:23.350> Tom's<00:04:23.650> done<00:04:23.889> anyway

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
have a look at what Tom's done anyway

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.159 
have a look at what Tom's done anyway
115<00:04:27.190> 5<00:04:28.139> yeah<00:04:30.570> what's<00:04:31.570> that<00:04:31.630> just<00:04:31.930> under<00:04:32.139> a

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
115 5 yeah what's that just under a

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.600 
115 5 yeah what's that just under a
second<00:04:32.620> third<00:04:32.830> on<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.100> GTR<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:35.340> just<00:04:36.340> over

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
second third on the GTR and just over

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.360 
second third on the GTR and just over
half<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:36.940> second<00:04:37.300> slower<00:04:37.330> than<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.720> Porsche

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
half a second slower than the Porsche

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.029 
half a second slower than the Porsche
it's<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.520> macro<00:04:40.030> example<00:04:40.599> of<00:04:40.750> why<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.229> GTR<00:04:41.919> is

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
it's a macro example of why the GTR is

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.850 
it's a macro example of why the GTR is
fastest<00:04:42.610> it<00:04:43.330> simply<00:04:43.840> carries<00:04:44.200> more<00:04:44.440> speed

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
fastest it simply carries more speed

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.730 
fastest it simply carries more speed
into<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.639> out<00:04:45.970> of<00:04:46.030> each<00:04:46.450> corner<00:04:46.990> so<00:04:47.590> though

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
into and out of each corner so though

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.650 
into and out of each corner so though
it's<00:04:47.889> not<00:04:47.950> quickest<00:04:48.310> down<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.520> straight<00:04:48.970> it's

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
it's not quickest down a straight it's

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.890 
it's not quickest down a straight it's
still<00:04:49.990> sets<00:04:50.349> the<00:04:50.470> best<00:04:50.680> lap<00:04:50.860> time<00:04:51.750> so<00:04:52.750> we've

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
still sets the best lap time so we've

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.510 
still sets the best lap time so we've
looked<00:04:53.020> at<00:04:53.169> a<00:04:53.260> lot<00:04:53.380> of<00:04:53.440> data<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:54.010> we've<00:04:54.160> had<00:04:54.280> an

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
looked at a lot of data and we've had an

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.070 
looked at a lot of data and we've had an
awful<00:04:54.820> lot<00:04:54.910> of<00:04:54.970> fun<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.450> what<00:04:55.599> have<00:04:55.720> we<00:04:55.840> learnt

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
awful lot of fun and what have we learnt

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.279 
awful lot of fun and what have we learnt
the<00:04:56.620> GTR<00:04:57.099> is<00:04:57.340> still<00:04:57.729> king<00:04:58.030> in<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.450> dry<00:04:58.660> it<00:04:58.960> set

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
the GTR is still king in the dry it set

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.100 
the GTR is still king in the dry it set
the<00:04:59.380> fastest<00:04:59.770> time<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.729> 911<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.570> much

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
the fastest time the 911 is much

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.589 
the fastest time the 911 is much
improved<00:05:02.320> it<00:05:02.919> is<00:05:03.130> almost<00:05:03.460> as<00:05:04.120> quick<00:05:04.360> as<00:05:04.479> than

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
improved it is almost as quick as than

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.089 
improved it is almost as quick as than
this<00:05:04.690> out<00:05:04.900> but<00:05:05.440> probably<00:05:05.919> the<00:05:06.010> most

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
this out but probably the most

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.920 
this out but probably the most
interesting<00:05:06.580> thing<00:05:06.729> of<00:05:06.820> all<00:05:06.970> is<00:05:07.180> this<00:05:07.690> thing

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
interesting thing of all is this thing

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.500 
interesting thing of all is this thing
because<00:05:08.680> it<00:05:09.580> wasn't<00:05:09.880> as<00:05:09.940> quick<00:05:10.120> as<00:05:10.240> easy<00:05:10.419> to

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
because it wasn't as quick as easy to

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.960 
because it wasn't as quick as easy to
but<00:05:10.960> with<00:05:11.590> better<00:05:11.800> brakes<00:05:12.190> and<00:05:12.490> a<00:05:12.699> proper

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
but with better brakes and a proper

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.089 
but with better brakes and a proper
flappy<00:05:13.210> paddle<00:05:13.570> gearbox<00:05:13.710> might<00:05:14.710> just<00:05:14.949> be<00:05:15.070> the

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
flappy paddle gearbox might just be the

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.460 
flappy paddle gearbox might just be the
best<00:05:15.430> road<00:05:15.639> car<00:05:15.880> here<00:05:16.349> unfortunately<00:05:17.349> though

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
best road car here unfortunately though

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.439 
best road car here unfortunately though
it<00:05:17.740> doesn't<00:05:18.010> have<00:05:18.250> them<00:05:18.430> which<00:05:18.669> means<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:19.000> GTR

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
it doesn't have them which means the GTR

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.710 
it doesn't have them which means the GTR
is<00:05:19.690> still<00:05:20.139> king
