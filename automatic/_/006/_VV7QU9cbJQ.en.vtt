 good to everyone here cg and today I'm going to 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.770
 teach how to change the appearance of 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.900
 your of your character in 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.929
 Minecraft 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.000
 and good is very simple you have to come 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.770
 I will leave this website in the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.160
 description of the video 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.650
 and good as you will see here there are many 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.380
 interfaces is worth or not suits or as 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.690
 you want to call it vale we are going to choose 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.370
 for example this one of schlinder more or 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.090
 less 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.010
 you can take the one you like the most 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.870
 well this is not bad at all the truth and 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.030
 good 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.610
 when sending to this web page and what 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.390
 you have to do is give it to download to 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.950
 computer vale 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.560
 we give him 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.440
 here it will be downloaded we give right click 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:56.150
 show in folder we can minimize 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.940
 this page is worth I will leave here 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.210
 I recommend you first put it in 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.770
 the desktop and then once you have 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.570
 installed you can put it in some 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.300
 minecraft folder or just 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.620
 delete it as you want in accordance we leave 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.830
 right here 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.160
 now let's start we give you to run 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.270
 and you have to write percent app 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.860
 data percent you give accept 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.960
 ok and you have to open the folder this 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.930
 that puts minecraft point 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.930
 once here you have to give pin 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.140
 and here you will find several folders without 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.350
 this one that puts in minecraft right click 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.850
 and open with winrar archi see if not 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.740
 you have this program is necessary 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.570
 download it 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.040
 so 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.360
 I will leave you also the description of 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.680
 video so you download it if you do not 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.480
 you have 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.570
 this nothing and good once here 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.530
 this will come out and you go to the folder that 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 put mod 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.630
 mv two clicks 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.830
 and notice here that puts char is worth this 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.810
 is your suit the default suit 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.209
 so what you have to do is let 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.980
 minimize this here where you have the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.520
 costume that you have previously 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.630
 downloaded right click and change 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.960
 name and we have to put char 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.240
 as is without a capital letter or anything in 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.470
 lowercase without point or anything 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.570
 because this is the same as casting this char 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.050
 It has to be the same as here without a point 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.870
 or anything like that should the stick 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.790
 and now you get 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.840
 you give to copy 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.340
 and here you give to paste this will come out 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.750
 you have to see what to add and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.349
 replace you accept and you will have 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.030
 your suit installed now good this 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.810
 would let you see around here you can 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.810
 leave the folders 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.380
 and I'm going to start minecraft so you can see 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.380
 what has changed 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.690
 It's pretty simple to do 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.650
 a player 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.560
 and as you can see 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.390
 I've already changed my appearance 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.470
 Well, it's not that she's very pretty because 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.720
 well it seems that it goes for the sides 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.920
 but hey this is the appearance of 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.620
 slender 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.800
 it's not bad at all either, by the way and 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.300
 Well, this has been like installing 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.849
 your our costume in minecraft 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:51.470
 I'm going to leave the game and now if you want 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.680
 customize it because you only have to 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.989
 give it here where the page 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.560
 download it instead of downloading 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.430
 to computer you give edit skin 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.430
 and will send you a 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.629
 to a good page the same page but 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.430
 to edit it remember you have to be 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.980
 registered on this website for 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.850
 then upload it 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.950
 and well you download and here you can edit it to 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.000
 your taste is worth 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:26.960
 four nonsense and if you're wrong this 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.470
 arrow is to undo and this for 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.810
 do again 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.260
 so well this would basically be 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.790
 for if you want to edit it and then a 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.900
 once I edit it jce for example I'm going to do 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.419
 a bullshit around here 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.960
 once you have it done you give it to a 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.650
