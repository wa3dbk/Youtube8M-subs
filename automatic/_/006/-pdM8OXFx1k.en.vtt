the<00:00:32.790> hell<00:00:32.969> may<00:00:33.300> as<00:00:33.360> well<00:00:33.600> play<00:00:34.320> some<00:00:34.620> quality

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the hell may as well play some quality

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.299 
the hell may as well play some quality
for<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:36.149> find<00:00:36.510> sniping<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.350> lot<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.100> fun

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.889 
especially if you use a cock because
it's<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.610> one<00:00:41.790> shot<00:00:41.969> kill<00:00:42.030> anywhere<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it's a one shot kill anywhere on the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.529 
it's a one shot kill anywhere on the
body<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.489> quite<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> lot<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.700> people<00:00:44.910> say<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
body as quite a lot of people say and I

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.209 
body as quite a lot of people say and I
agree<00:00:45.960> should<00:00:46.230> happen<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.559> one<00:00:46.649> or<00:00:46.770> two<00:00:46.950> but

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
agree should happen in one or two but

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.610 
agree should happen in one or two but
then<00:00:47.399> again<00:00:47.489> people<00:00:48.239> who<00:00:48.600> hate<00:00:49.289> people<00:00:49.559> who

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
then again people who hate people who

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
then again people who hate people who
run<00:00:49.860> around<00:00:50.100> quickscoping<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.539> it's

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
run around quickscoping think that it's

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.549 
run around quickscoping think that it's
good<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.949> always<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.430> shotting<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.079> think

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
good not always one shotting but I think

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.910 
good not always one shotting but I think
more<00:00:56.160> people<00:00:56.399> would<00:00:56.760> prefer<00:00:57.649> snipers<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
more people would prefer snipers to be a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.500 
more people would prefer snipers to be a
one<00:00:59.160> shot<00:00:59.340> kill<00:00:59.399> any<00:00:59.730> way<00:00:59.879> or<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
one shot kill any way or it's just the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330 
one shot kill any way or it's just the
intervention<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.989> bar<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.829> something<00:01:02.129> power

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
intervention of bar with something power

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.329 
intervention of bar with something power
and<00:01:03.180> differently<00:01:03.600> than<00:01:03.899> people<00:01:04.290> who<00:01:05.040> wouldn't

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and differently than people who wouldn't

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.810 
and differently than people who wouldn't
like<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.110> but<00:01:07.110> yeah<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.040> Simon

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
like it like that but yeah so Simon

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.310 
like it like that but yeah so Simon
ecology<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> lot<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.600> fun<00:01:09.810> even<00:01:10.110> without

for SMGs and assault rifles one is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730 
for SMGs and assault rifles one is
nearly<00:01:18.450> as<00:01:18.659> powerful<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.320> were<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.590> one

the<00:04:50.980> game<00:04:51.160> time<00:04:51.430> then<00:04:52.330> we'll<00:04:52.480> win<00:04:52.660> or<00:04:52.900> if<00:04:52.990> we

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
the game time then we'll win or if we

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.120 
the game time then we'll win or if we
want<00:04:53.260> to<00:04:53.290> tank<00:04:53.470> which<00:04:53.620> is<00:04:53.710> armed<00:04:53.890> the<00:04:54.010> two

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
want to tank which is armed the two

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.040 
want to tank which is armed the two
bombs<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:55.150> way<00:04:55.270> you<00:04:55.330> end<00:04:55.600> up<00:04:55.690> with<00:04:55.810> a

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
bombs and that way you end up with a

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.430 
bombs and that way you end up with a
nice<00:04:56.200> long<00:04:56.410> game<00:04:56.620> you<00:04:57.190> still<00:04:57.640> win<00:04:58.440> assuming

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
nice long game you still win assuming

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.980 
nice long game you still win assuming
you<00:05:00.120> don't<00:05:01.530> just<00:05:02.530> be<00:05:03.100> idiots<00:05:03.490> and<00:05:03.990> forget

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
you don't just be idiots and forget

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.170 
you don't just be idiots and forget
about<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.229> objective<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:05.890> you<00:05:06.850> can<00:05:07.000> get<00:05:07.150> a

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
about the objective and you can get a

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.760 
about the objective and you can get a
nice<00:05:07.450> high<00:05:07.690> amount<00:05:07.900> of<00:05:07.990> kills<00:05:08.169> and<00:05:08.440> I<00:05:08.530> think

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
nice high amount of kills and I think

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.200 
nice high amount of kills and I think
demolition<00:05:09.250> is<00:05:09.370> easy<00:05:09.550> one<00:05:09.820> of<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.000> games

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
demolition is easy one of the games

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.690 
demolition is easy one of the games
which<00:05:10.450> you<00:05:10.630> can<00:05:10.720> get<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.919> highest<00:05:12.100> kill<00:05:12.520> count

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
which you can get the highest kill count

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.120 
which you can get the highest kill count
in<00:05:12.880> maybe<00:05:13.479> sabotage<00:05:14.050> if<00:05:14.260> you<00:05:14.440> let<00:05:14.560> it<00:05:14.590> last<00:05:14.919> a

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
in maybe sabotage if you let it last a

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.770 
in maybe sabotage if you let it last a
while<00:05:15.280> but<00:05:15.610> then<00:05:15.820> again<00:05:15.940> you<00:05:16.270> have<00:05:16.390> respawned

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
while but then again you have respawned

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.070 
while but then again you have respawned
times<00:05:17.200> than<00:05:17.380> that<00:05:17.530> which<00:05:17.680> would<00:05:18.840> not<00:05:19.840> allow

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
times than that which would not allow

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.680 
times than that which would not allow
you<00:05:20.140> to<00:05:20.800> get<00:05:21.010> that<00:05:21.610> many<00:05:21.700> kills<00:05:21.970> yeah<00:05:22.419> you<00:05:22.479> can

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
you to get that many kills yeah you can
