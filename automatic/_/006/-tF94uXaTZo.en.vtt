hey<00:00:07.470> guys<00:00:07.680> mop<00:00:07.950> up<00:00:08.099> here<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:09.240> wanted<00:00:09.570> to

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
hey guys mop up here and I wanted to

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.900 
hey guys mop up here and I wanted to
make<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:10.019> video<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.410> share<00:00:11.099> my<00:00:11.309> opinion<00:00:11.730> on

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
make this video to share my opinion on

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.369 
make this video to share my opinion on
some<00:00:12.179> stuff<00:00:12.480> but<00:00:12.900> i<00:00:13.500> think<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:15.080> more<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
some stuff but i think is more of the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.370 
some stuff but i think is more of the
right<00:00:16.529> way<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> go<00:00:17.070> after<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:18.119> pvp<00:00:18.869> power<00:00:18.900> bar

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
right way to go after the pvp power bar

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.560 
right way to go after the pvp power bar
from<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.619> weapons<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.760> if<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.180> don't<00:00:21.390> know

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
from the weapons so if you don't know

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.830 
from the weapons so if you don't know
there<00:00:21.930> has<00:00:22.199> been<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.980> doubling<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.269> pv

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
there has been a doubling on the pv

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.130 
there has been a doubling on the pv
power<00:00:25.279> that<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.939> weapons<00:00:27.300> give<00:00:27.800> so<00:00:30.140> basically

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
power that the weapons give so basically

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.770 
power that the weapons give so basically
every<00:00:31.500> pvp<00:00:31.980> r<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> full<00:00:33.360> pv

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
every pvp r was going for a full pv

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.660 
every pvp r was going for a full pv
power<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.230> their<00:00:34.410> gear<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.980> gems<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.489> stuff

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
power on their gear and gems and stuff

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.250 
power on their gear and gems and stuff
like<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:37.399> everyone<00:00:38.399> was<00:00:38.670> at<00:00:38.879> around<00:00:39.260> 55

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
like that and everyone was at around 55

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.430 
like that and everyone was at around 55
+<00:00:40.829> %<00:00:41.460> pv<00:00:42.420> power<00:00:42.739> which<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:44.809> if<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.079> think<00:00:46.350> about

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
+ % pv power which is if you think about

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.160 
+ % pv power which is if you think about
it<00:00:47.300> if<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.450> go<00:00:48.629> full<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.280> brazilians<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.960> go

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it if you go full of brazilians you go

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.560 
it if you go full of brazilians you go
at<00:00:53.010> about<00:00:53.190> seventy<00:00:53.969> percent<00:00:54.149> I'm<00:00:55.250> a<00:00:56.300> bit<00:00:57.300> lower

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
at about seventy percent I'm a bit lower

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.420 
at about seventy percent I'm a bit lower
because<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.140> don't<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> gear<00:00:59.190> I

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
because I don't have all the gear I

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.650 
because I don't have all the gear I
don't<00:00:59.670> have<00:01:01.219> upgraded<00:01:02.219> honor<00:01:03.000> pieces<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
don't have upgraded honor pieces and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.940 
don't have upgraded honor pieces and
stuff<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:06.229> someone<00:01:07.229> has<00:01:07.380> fifty

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
stuff like that so if someone has fifty

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.789 
stuff like that so if someone has fifty
five<00:01:08.159> percent<00:01:08.189> PV<00:01:09.119> power<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.770> like

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
five percent PV power and you have like

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.609 
five percent PV power and you have like
seventy<00:01:11.580> percent<00:01:11.729> beauty<00:01:12.570> zillions<00:01:12.960> you

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
seventy percent beauty zillions you

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.070 
seventy percent beauty zillions you
actually<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.479> fifteen<00:01:15.479> percent<00:01:15.840> damage

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
actually have fifteen percent damage

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.620 
actually have fifteen percent damage
reduction<00:01:16.530> because<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.549> gets<00:01:17.790> negated<00:01:18.360> blah

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
reduction because it gets negated blah

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.350 
reduction because it gets negated blah
blah<00:01:18.780> blah<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.200> know<00:01:19.229> how<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.560> goes<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.549> PP

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
blah blah you know how it goes it's PP

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.840 
blah blah you know how it goes it's PP
resilience<00:01:21.869> minus<00:01:22.350> PP<00:01:22.740> power<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.280> what<00:01:23.640> is

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
resilience minus PP power and what is

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.140 
resilience minus PP power and what is
left<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:25.080> action<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.500> resilience<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.880> if

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
left is your action on resilience but if

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
left is your action on resilience but if
you<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.750> about<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.049> other<00:01:28.350> way<00:01:28.650> what<00:01:28.950> most

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
you think about the other way what most

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.960 
you think about the other way what most
people<00:01:29.759> are<00:01:29.880> doing<00:01:30.180> they<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:31.310> 57<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:32.490> sixty

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
people are doing they have 57 or sixty

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.179 
people are doing they have 57 or sixty
percent<00:01:33.150> resilience<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.140> most<00:01:34.619> people<00:01:35.009> have

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
percent resilience and most people have

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.190 
percent resilience and most people have
more<00:01:35.520> than<00:01:35.759> fifty<00:01:36.090> five<00:01:36.299> percent<00:01:36.329> pvp<00:01:37.170> power

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
more than fifty five percent pvp power

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.569 
more than fifty five percent pvp power
which<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:39.390> or<00:01:39.570> less<00:01:40.130> they<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.310> no

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
which is like more or less they have no

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.880 
which is like more or less they have no
pvp<00:01:42.060> gear<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.540> them<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.869> someone<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.710> hitting

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
pvp gear on them and someone is hitting

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.080 
pvp gear on them and someone is hitting
on<00:01:44.159> them<00:01:44.280> without<00:01:44.549> pvp<00:01:45.180> gear<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:47.090> being

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
on them without pvp gear at all so being

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.240 
on them without pvp gear at all so being
a<00:01:48.210> tetra<00:01:48.479> paladin<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.049> being<00:01:49.320> more<00:01:49.920> or<00:01:50.070> less<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
a tetra paladin and being more or less a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.569 
a tetra paladin and being more or less a
punch<00:01:50.610> bug<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.030> played<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:52.100> 200<00:01:53.100> games<00:01:53.340> of

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
punch bug I played like 200 games of

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.389 
punch bug I played like 200 games of
past<00:01:53.790> 2-3<00:01:54.570> days<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.530> realized<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.100> I'm

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
past 2-3 days and I realized that I'm

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.709 
past 2-3 days and I realized that I'm
the<00:01:56.549> main<00:01:56.729> target<00:01:57.149> all<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> time<00:01:58.549> so<00:01:59.719> I

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the main target all the time so I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.870 
the main target all the time so I
thought<00:02:01.469> like<00:02:01.649> yeah<00:02:02.280> why<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.610> go<00:02:02.850> for

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
thought like yeah why not go for

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.149 
thought like yeah why not go for
resilience<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.750> mean<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.350> do<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.710> math<00:02:04.740> is

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
resilience I mean if you do the math is

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.880 
resilience I mean if you do the math is
actually<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.610> ten<00:02:06.090> fifteen<00:02:06.810> percent<00:02:07.170> dollar

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
actually a ten fifteen percent dollar

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.360 
actually a ten fifteen percent dollar
reduction<00:02:08.270> from<00:02:09.649> zero<00:02:10.649> damage<00:02:10.920> reduction

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
reduction from zero damage reduction

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.160 
reduction from zero damage reduction
that<00:02:11.730> that's<00:02:12.060> something

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
that that's something

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.500 
that that's something
and<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.770> actually<00:02:13.950> worked<00:02:14.430> for<00:02:14.670> me<00:02:14.819> as<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:17.510> got

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
and it actually worked for me as I I got

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.979 
and it actually worked for me as I I got
some<00:02:18.720> clips<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.319> got<00:02:19.530> some<00:02:19.770> situations<00:02:20.760> that

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
some clips I got some situations that

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.320 
some clips I got some situations that
actually<00:02:21.989> survived<00:02:22.580> with<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> very<00:02:24.000> very<00:02:24.209> very

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
actually survived with a very very very

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.190 
actually survived with a very very very
low<00:02:24.750> HP<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:26.610> i<00:02:27.000> I'd<00:02:27.569> give<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.020> to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
low HP and I i I'd give that to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.400 
low HP and I i I'd give that to
resilience<00:02:28.550> like<00:02:29.550> ten<00:02:30.480> percent<00:02:30.959> fifteen

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
resilience like ten percent fifteen

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.040 
resilience like ten percent fifteen
percent<00:02:31.709> is<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.100> lot<00:02:32.400> if<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.510> think<00:02:33.690> about<00:02:33.840> it

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
percent is a lot if you think about it

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.699 
percent is a lot if you think about it
up<00:02:34.739> from<00:02:35.130> zero<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.660> yeah<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.140> wanted<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.470> give

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
up from zero so yeah I wanted to give

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.120 
up from zero so yeah I wanted to give
you<00:02:37.830> guys<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.069> heads<00:02:38.400> up<00:02:38.670> if<00:02:39.440> you<00:02:40.440> want<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.860> check

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
you guys a heads up if you want to check

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.670 
you guys a heads up if you want to check
out<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.610> best<00:02:42.030> jamming<00:02:42.599> for<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.050> data<00:02:43.230> pardon

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
out the best jamming for the data pardon

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.490 
out the best jamming for the data pardon
you<00:02:43.769> should<00:02:43.950> check<00:02:44.160> fungoides<00:02:44.610> because<00:02:45.500> I'm

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
you should check fungoides because I'm

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.979 
you should check fungoides because I'm
not<00:02:46.709> really<00:02:47.040> jamming<00:02:47.489> optimally<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.690> get<00:02:48.870> the

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
not really jamming optimally to get the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.960 
not really jamming optimally to get the
circuit<00:02:49.319> bonuses<00:02:49.769> at<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.100> moment<00:02:50.430> because<00:02:50.760> I

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
circuit bonuses at the moment because I

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.970 
circuit bonuses at the moment because I
want<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.360> have<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.810> most<00:02:52.290> resilience

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
want to have the most resilience

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.360 
want to have the most resilience
possible<00:02:53.519> it's<00:02:54.420> really<00:02:55.319> important<00:02:55.799> for<00:02:55.860> me<00:02:56.040> I

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
possible it's really important for me I

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.280 
possible it's really important for me I
don't<00:02:56.610> care<00:02:56.790> if<00:02:56.850> i<00:02:57.090> lose<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.569> two<00:02:57.900> percent

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
don't care if i lose like two percent

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.920 
don't care if i lose like two percent
damage<00:02:58.470> or<00:02:58.830> three<00:02:59.010> percent<00:02:59.400> damage<00:02:59.549> I<00:03:00.030> can<00:03:00.810> do

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
damage or three percent damage I can do

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.949 
damage or three percent damage I can do
damaging<00:03:01.410> cooldowns<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:03.569> don't<00:03:03.780> really

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
damaging cooldowns and you don't really

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.550 
damaging cooldowns and you don't really
do<00:03:04.200> any<00:03:04.380> damage<00:03:04.620> out<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.100> them<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:06.440> yeah<00:03:08.209> but

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
do any damage out of them so yeah but

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.430 
do any damage out of them so yeah but
make<00:03:10.560> sure<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.980> have<00:03:11.360> 200<00:03:12.360> PP<00:03:12.750> resilience<00:03:13.230> on

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
able to find it easily so yeah that was

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.390 
able to find it easily so yeah that was
about<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.329> for<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:45.870> video<00:03:46.079> I<00:03:46.410> think<00:03:46.980> this

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
about it for this video I think this

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.880 
about it for this video I think this
applies<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:48.090> most<00:03:48.359> classes<00:03:49.079> nowadays<00:03:49.590> because

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
applies to most classes nowadays because

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.190 
applies to most classes nowadays because
let's<00:03:50.340> say<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.730> husband<00:03:51.209> Sean<00:03:51.450> wants<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.720> do<00:03:51.959> it

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
let's say a husband Sean wants to do it

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.340 
let's say a husband Sean wants to do it
because<00:03:53.190> they<00:03:53.640> are<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:54.540> know<00:03:54.660> they<00:03:54.989> flop

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
because they are you know they flop

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.490 
because they are you know they flop
pretty<00:03:55.769> easy<00:03:56.390> kind<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.510> like<00:03:57.690> rats<00:03:58.019> ok<00:03:58.260> we'll

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
pretty easy kind of like rats ok we'll

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.039 
pretty easy kind of like rats ok we'll
have<00:03:58.590> bubble<00:03:59.160> but<00:03:59.459> most<00:04:00.269> people<00:04:00.600> around<00:04:00.780> with

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
have bubble but most people around with

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.819 
have bubble but most people around with
either<00:04:01.200> peace<00:04:01.650> or<00:04:01.799> war<00:04:01.920> nowadays<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:03.380> yeah<00:04:04.380> you

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
either peace or war nowadays so yeah you

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.490 
either peace or war nowadays so yeah you
more<00:04:05.340> or<00:04:05.459> less<00:04:05.609> get<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.209> idea<00:04:06.600> I<00:04:06.870> mean<00:04:06.989> fifteen

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
more or less get the idea I mean fifteen

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.870 
more or less get the idea I mean fifteen
percent<00:04:08.209> reduction<00:04:09.209> is<00:04:09.840> kind<00:04:10.380> of<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.590> thing<00:04:10.880> up

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
percent reduction is kind of a thing up

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.860 
percent reduction is kind of a thing up
from<00:04:12.239> zero<00:04:12.660> or<00:04:12.900> five<00:04:13.560> or<00:04:13.980> whatever<00:04:14.569> so<00:04:15.569> yeah<00:04:15.840> I

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
from zero or five or whatever so yeah I

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.379 
from zero or five or whatever so yeah I
hope<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.169> liked<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.470> video<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:17.329> I'll<00:04:18.329> see
