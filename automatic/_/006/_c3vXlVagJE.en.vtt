00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.200
 hello everyone knows specops how 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.300
 go dear you subject code subscribers 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.889
 I'm fine I'm happy 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.630
 to take care of the clip of the day of October 3rd 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.180
 2012 and I can assure you that 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.340
 today the clips that have been received 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.810
 are really very different and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.240
 stands out from what we usually see 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.220
 and I can tell you that it feels good 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.449
 and it sends fresh air and I can 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.250
 already tell you that we are 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.869
 in serial access clips since with 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.130
 the first with carbon swift which is in 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.989
 infect who is the last survivor 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.360
 who are trying somehow 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.450
 survive with his akimbo gun will do 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.110
 a little watts thanks to his 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.180
 reloading 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.890
 he's going to redo a last one that he has with 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.010
 his gun and then it will come out the sound 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.350
 and make a fuss of the fire of god 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.079
 with says that thanks to the bar is so 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 in a row until they are listed and 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.010
 turn into a zombie a big geek 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.570
 since there he has finally held two 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.719
 finally to really infect a little bit 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.820
 with difficulty 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.979
 it is still to see but has 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.490
 managed to push back the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.080
 enemies in a pretty strong way for 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.549
 a second clip in the theme of the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.010
 series to end up with stocks 10 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.840
 who shows us his responsiveness on arcade 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.850
 m hongun games that will make us a 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.950
 pretty good series 2-1 first kills 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.860
 simply a second one that a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.799
 third he'll try to have to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.330
 activate fourth that he to show 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.340
 who is the strongest a fifth he 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.259
 1/6 that he fast enough 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.030
 a seventh that he for a person who 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.700
 to walk quietly an eighth 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.740
 that he's a ninth he's facing 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.200
 really allows him to ride very 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.509
 quickly in the ranking 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.860
 do not be surprised if it changes maps 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.899
 we are still with death note 10 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.369
 dry two clips are always linked a 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.079
 series but why do less good 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.570
 when we can do better this time 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.759
 a series of eleven they with a quad 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.380
 fidh right now it's time 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.430
 leave or double on men so here 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.200
 why they really use a lot 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.210
 the gun as well as his friend but 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.630
 really especially the knife since that 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.820
 knock down the imitate 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.280
 quickly that the gun is the eleventh 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.259
 that he just now it was really 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.420
 not bad these two series show us 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.700
 really that we can really dig 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.560
 the gap very quickly again from a big 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.150
 gg to you here it is here I hope it 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.040
 you will have liked to change my point of 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.660
 view it was very good clip 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.950
 it was really nice of them 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.730
 comment and then why stop 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.069
 When we love 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.510
 here is a clip of the bonus game always 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.430
 death note 10 and for once he did 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.230
 loud and really impressed me a 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.300
 person in phase with the 130 c all the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.400
 world this is to cover below the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.959
 buildings at the season ensures killed by 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.390
 weary feeling of struggle us who was not 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.310
 a frank evening pg and then shot online 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.370
 right and makes us a more powerful 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.200
 points in abridging the suffering of the 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.030
 driver of the 130 this is it 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.260
 do we move on to something else 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.730
 this time it's over for 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
 today if you too have a 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.790
