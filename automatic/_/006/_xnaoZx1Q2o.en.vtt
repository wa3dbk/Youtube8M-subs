00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.050 

I<00:00:27.080> guess<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.260> best<00:00:28.560> he<00:00:28.830> could<00:00:28.950> do<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.280> some

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
I guess the best he could do is some

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.630 
I guess the best he could do is some
massive<00:00:30.630> anger<00:00:30.990> management<00:00:31.590> program<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.279> would

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
massive anger management program I would

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.990 
massive anger management program I would
think<00:00:32.850> anger<00:00:33.420> management<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.930> not<00:00:34.110> about

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
think anger management is not about

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.820 
think anger management is not about
managing<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> anger<00:00:36.480> once<00:00:36.720> it<00:00:36.870> comes<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.260> it's

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
managing the anger once it comes on it's

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.890 
managing the anger once it comes on it's
about<00:00:38.010> managing<00:00:38.460> your<00:00:38.760> physiological<00:00:39.210> state

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
about managing your physiological state

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.120 
about managing your physiological state
so<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.230> doesn't<00:00:40.560> come<00:00:40.680> on

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
so it doesn't come on

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.340 
so it doesn't come on
so<00:00:41.550> he<00:00:41.970> was<00:00:42.060> a<00:00:42.090> perfect<00:00:42.540> candidate<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:42.989> anger

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
so he was a perfect candidate for anger

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.040 
so he was a perfect candidate for anger
management<00:00:43.380> he<00:00:44.250> needs<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.760> know<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.050> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
management he needs to know that the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.320 
management he needs to know that the
adrenaline<00:00:46.830> dump<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.340> most<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.880> us<00:00:48.000> have
