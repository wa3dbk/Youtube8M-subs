variation<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.559> aircraft<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.219> won't<00:00:47.370> really<00:00:47.640> get

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

into<00:00:48.059> too<00:00:48.660> much<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.590> will<00:00:49.680> include

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
into too much of what it will include

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.260 
into too much of what it will include
because<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.489> will<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.700> more<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.030> surprise

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
