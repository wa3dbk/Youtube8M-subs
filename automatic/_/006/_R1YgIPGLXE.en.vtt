00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.020

 better sounds good has been a show 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.470

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.919
 we have already seen, it is pop 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.770
 Spanish from the 80s and a little bit from the 90s 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:59.720
 so that people dance medical process 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.759
 when I'm not making videos 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.560
 weekends the truth is that I have 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.380
 say that good is a fun job 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.419
 because I have a good time playing the 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.710
 guitar the truth and especially when 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.110
 you are playing and you see that people are 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.680
 having fun so much better 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.440
 and see you next Wednesday how 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.180
 As I said before, well, today is 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.250
 Saturday but for you when you see 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.010
