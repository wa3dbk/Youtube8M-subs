 regarding the settings 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.820
 in addition to the classic ones we find the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.460
 voodoo section that groups four 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.870
 voices or hardware interface themes e 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.910
 super user 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.290
 let's start from the first one here we can 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.150
 customize the button menu 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.770
 power supply or that menu that is 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.930

 power and activate the navigation bar e 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.740

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.780
 unlock allows you to set the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.790
 lockscreen entering for example some 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.530
 shortcuts or associating actions 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.930
 at the normal or prolonged pressure of the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.420
 buttons enabling the widget la 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.580
 transparency and blur effect and more 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.829
 provides some settings like it 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.530
 state of the battery on rotation and the 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.299
 power menu status bar allows you to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.670
 set the status bar elements 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.500
 which watch battery indicator 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.659
 and signal panel settings 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.369
 rapids makes available to the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.799
 options for customizing the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.200
 secondary drop-down menu or the one 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.090
 with tools while notification menus 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.189
 allows you to do the same thing but with 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.479
 the main drop-down menu 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.610
 also here we can activate the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.250
 notification tools we prefer between 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.320
 over and zap for notifications pop up in 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.479
 android lollipop active style 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.030
 notifications to enable the screen 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.469
 of blocking the motorola motorcycle hicks and halo 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.150
 which together with over is a tool 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.190
 created by the paranoid team 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.350
 android for fluctuating notifications e 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.720
 opening them in the window 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.670
 recent spa in provides three 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.790
 several test managers the classic one 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.200
 of the pure Android the slim sidebar 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.350
 rom and the omni switch of the omni each 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.030
 obviously with the relative settings 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.340
 on mor we can insert an operator 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.050
 custom enable mode with 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.170
 two panels in the settings and 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.060
 change the density of the cd choose 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.200
 display shutdown animation 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.180
 and more 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.709
 finally the immersive mode section puts a 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.810
 available screen mode 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.580
 whole that we can set by choosing 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.470
 for example if you only involve the 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.160
 navebus are the status bar or 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.050
 both returning to the main menu 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.090
 second item or hardware puts a 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.680
 arrangement of options to associate 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.720
 actions at normal pressure or 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.700
 prolonged of the navbar keys e 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.800
 shortcuts to elements such as 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.660
 the clock in the drop-down menu on 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.670
 buttons allows you to do the same thing 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.310
 but with the soft touch keys the home button 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.010
 and the power button on performance we can 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.900
 manage processor and governor scheduler 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.550
 and memory and finally we can 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.790
 customize the intensity of 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.040
 vibration and backlight themes 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.540
 and the cyanogenmod team chooser 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.590
 through which we can 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.900
 customize the individual parts of the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.640
 our rom as icons style characters 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.860
 startup animations and so on 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.840
 and on styles in addition to the classic o 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.090
 it is to any other themes downloaded to 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.370
 part the team provides us with vanir 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.120
 inverted which causes the menus 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.890
 finally t black td superuser 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.510
 it simply refers to the ap 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.450
 allows to manage root permissions 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.550
 to be granted or not to deny others 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.260
 applications regarding the 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.750
 launcher in the home page section 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.330
 we find launcher 3 and the gel by default 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.310
 or the google experience launcher il 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.200
 first slightly more customizable 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.940
 in terms of settings but without the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.269
 possibility of quick access to google 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.799
 now 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.530
 which happens instead in the second 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.060
 via a swipe to the right for 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.070
 regarding the applications of 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.690
 system we find the contrary of 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.330
 settings that are many 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.220
 only the essential ones or dsp 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.680
 sound control manager either 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.049
 in loudspeaker that in headphone the messages 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.449
 is 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.949
 google omniswitch weather news ie 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.479
 settings for the task manager 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.340
 of the omni rom I showed you 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.099
 briefly before and we can 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.080
 truly complete personalization 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.900
 a voice recorder is a torch 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.120
 let's see the camera camera that is 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.889
 the classic one of the pure Android with in 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.289
 plus the ability to save photos 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.180
 in the external sd also here the 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.889
 there are not many additional settings 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.889
 but let's try to take some shots 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:53.139
 we do not even one with the flash and how 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.870
 you see the speed of focusing and 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.250
 shooting is definitely good 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.229
 let's look at the results 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.740
 obtained and are all sharp and well 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.659
 therefore defined excellent camera for 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.580
 As for the video part I noticed 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:08.710
 instead a problem at the end of 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.349
 registration when we stop 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.419
 the app crasha I did several tests and me 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.340
 however, the videos have not always happened 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.129
 they have never been lost and always has them 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.319
 saved correctly therefore video camera 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.330
 imprecise because it gets stuck in 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.069
 anomalous way but that does not give problems since 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.029
 practical point of view if we can 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.210
 say as it saves what we record 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.009
 ok 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.870
 no bugs to report for that we pass 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.860
 to the final considerations 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.719
 regarding management 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.279
 I always found myself energetic 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:38.830
 quite well coming to an end 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:41.380
 day with about 14 15 hours of use 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.659
 medium intense and 3d screen are not 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.669
 exciting results but counting that 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.919
 the battery is that stop then not 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.330
 however they are better than 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.729
 those obtained with the firmware 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.800
 official samsung the fluidity and the 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.719
 stability are perfect and I never have 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.460
 I've noticed spontaneous restarts 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:59.830
 was forced to restart 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.750
 and don't pay attention to the jerkiness that 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.580
 see on the screen how to cause it e 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.680
 skin recording application 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.509
 so I think I was lucky 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.520
 because not knowing yet in the 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.889
 particularly the best firmware for s3 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.300
 I found a very valid ROM I have 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.400
 held the venier for more than two 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.370
 weeks and if I could I would still hold her 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.960
 I recommend it absolutely perfect 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.940
 nothing more to add except that the 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.529
 list of compatible devices 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.539
 found in the description together with 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.840
 rom and google app downloads if 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.639
 so this for today 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.070
 and all if you liked the video 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.910
 I recommend you put a nice like 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.710
 share it and remember to 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.630

 Hi everyone
