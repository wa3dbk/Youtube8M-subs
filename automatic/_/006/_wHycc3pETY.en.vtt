00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello everyone ive gaming industry 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.450
 gave us a lot of great games 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.429
 I think each of you can immediately call 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.349
 a couple of these but often 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.780
 happens such a thing to do pull 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.820
 their zagrebuschie little hands hit games 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.460
 in order to film them and cash in on their 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.590
 popularity and unfortunately film adaptation 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.529
 games are not always what they are 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.230
 gamers are waiting for them today i will show you the top 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.390
 5 of the best screen games top 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.189
 compiled personally in my opinion and rather 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.720
 total does not coincide with your opinion not 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.340
 let's take more time let's 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.890
 plunge into this abyss mediocre 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.670
 bad taste drove fifth 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.800
 silent hill 2 is not that I think 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.820
 the first part of the film is very successful 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.680
 screen versions 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.780
 but unlike the second part, it is at least 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.149
 something like the first source in 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.309
 difference from 2 as I once said in 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.680
 one of its video would be better this movie 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.480
 did not take off at all so tell me how 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.399
 could be made from a beautiful game with 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.670
 phenomenal atmosphere deep plot 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.469
 here this work on the case just took 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.390
 ripped from each game piece by piece 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.309
 mixed it in some kind of crazy write down 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.470
 you hodgepodge and released it on a big 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.900
 screen so suckin picturing great 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.060
 a series of games I consider it a crime 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.979
 that's why silent hill 2 takes 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.369
 well-deserved fifth place to my top 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.500
 fourth street fighter despite 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.909
 the fact that this is a film of my childhood and 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.220
 despite the fact that in this film 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.060
 invited van damma and I love him very much 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.920
 as an actor 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.110
 even he could not save this worthless 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.180
 the film is the first thing that catches your eye 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.759
 disgusting game absolutely everyone 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.950
 actors in this movie but of course flat 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.049
 stupid script and even van dam almost in 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.180
 each scene replays staging 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.070
 battles of course also lame on both legs 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.229
 in general, in one word, not a movie 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.430
 disappointments for street fighter fans 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.930
 and third place max payne max payne to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.890
 still remains one of my favorites 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.810
 of games 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.759
 noir fighter with a good plot and 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.189
 memorable main character 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.540
 but was it really so hard to move everything 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.280
 it's on the big screen 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.500
 because if you just take and collect all 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.250
 screensavers in the game max payne it will already be 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.040
 whole movie 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.960
 apparently difficult for the movie max payne you don't 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.599
 find nothing to remind you 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.230
 your favorite game except city views 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.230
 shot well and a bit on 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.750
 remember the game and the rest is not noir not 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.640
 The plot will not find anything in this movie 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.650
 if we look at the movie in terms of 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.090
 a man who has not played in the game 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.760
 You can say that the film is very even 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.250
 not bad but if you are an avid game fan 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.349
 max payne how I will show you the movie 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.049
 sheer failure and bring you only 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.250
 pain and disappointment move on 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.190
 second place 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.879
 mortal kombat 2 extermination is a creation 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.250
 came out in 1997 I don’t even know why 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.129
 After all, this film is bad at all 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.680
 never mind the costume and makeup 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.720
 fighting acting game and it is not at all 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.879
 the actors just don't even try to play 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.440
 computer graphics film done 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.930
 as if Krivorukov schoolchildren with 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.640
 progressive down syndrome that 's what 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.709
 you wait from the movie on the mortal universe 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.840
 kombat I think you are waiting for high quality 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.209
 set fighting scenes good 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.799
 special effects sea of ​​blood and violence and you 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.379
 do you think the film has any of that 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.750
 what i have listed roll up my lip this 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.549
 worst adaptation mortal kombat blood 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.680
 the film is completely absent 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.480
 the choreography of the battle scenes is so terrible 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.630
 it seems that the actor is doing ballet 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.700
 they fight acting and I said 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.099
 about acting roaring this is the worst 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.200
 the film goes on and finally we 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.450
 got to the first place what 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.250
 the film was able to get around everyone on what head 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.109
 same film so pav that you will not become 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.359
 watch it even on pain of death 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.609
 Perhaps I'll start from afar that is to say with 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.459
 movie director movie director 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.829
 landmark i'm talking about the great and terrible 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.200
 movie more if anyone else does not know 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.329
 uve ball are considered the worst director and i 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.519
 I can tell you that he deservedly so 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.709
 that is not a fink wild thrash and failure to 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.480
 My regret is the talentless hands of Ebola 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.230
 got to such a great game like 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.060
 blood rayne 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.220
 I personally like the game blood 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.840
 rayne but rather a whole series of games 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.299
 before that in this game may not like 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.849
 generally sexy main character on the street 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.040
 empire dynamic fighting sea of ​​blood yes and 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.079
 In general, the vampire theme of which I am 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.449
 love since childhood but it seems Louis was not 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.069
 I loved this game very much and I didn’t play 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:15.010
 she even managed to screw up 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.510
 Perhaps we’ll all begin with the actors. 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.400
 the film plays quite famous 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.979
 cast but you just look 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.080
 how do they play they play as if 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.350
 uve ball would force to withdraw in 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.450
 this nightmare 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.100
 yes figs with her with this acting game I 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.710
 I can even close my eyes to the fact that everything 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.690
 shot steep incomprehensible well that's what 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.640
 i can't close my eyes so it is on 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.230
 fights though no close your eyes after all 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.060
 can your palm 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.530
 if you ever played a game it was 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.360
 the rain you know that rain 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:47.330
 fast as lightning and now 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.700
 look what she is in the movie without 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.890
 comments in general uve again 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.620
 He proved that he was the king of the worst films in 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.720
 visa you so snow rain rain rayne 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.180

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.400
