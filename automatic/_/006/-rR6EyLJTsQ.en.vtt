00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.439
 and good is to everyone here tells them 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.479
 disaster with white gameplay 2 like 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:08.849
 is fine is a gameplay with the suite 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.469
 fire builder and you see that I wear it 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.450
 with the camouflage cost that good 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.370
 montonazo and good minus those on this 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.619
 Of course bring video playback release 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.119
 that has gone up practically 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.920
 well in fact it has already gone up one day 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.609
 the only thing that nobody had given 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.590
 account and take as practically the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.750
 I hang up has been given to light and others has 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.369
 the light came out but nevertheless with it 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.800
 it has been confirmed that it is false is to say 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.210
 which is fake that is not real but is 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.670
 someone who was bored very much and has 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.280
 done though you have to say 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.650
 that is super currado or I do not know if 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.570
 it was better this is from a previous trailer 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.890
 which is harassment or of any previous thing 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.120
 as I say you had used those 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.080
 images but what are the actors 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.120
 etc 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.410
 that is to say that you trasnos that idea is 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.240
 quite original so it's doing something 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.330
 fake then in another way but good 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.070
 I do not know for what purpose they have done this 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.600
 because reality only benefits the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.090
 own company is to say if you generate 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.440
 something about removing who was 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.870
 pending the new of the new 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.100
 playstation no one is saying everything 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.780
 one is waiting for inside 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.900
 just a week 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.299
 xbox but if you are you start suddenly to 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.820
 talk about the new playstation 4 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.110
 oysters then grow to the xbox not of 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.759
 suddenly it takes away all the protagonism and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.009
 everything that was generating the new 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.450
 xbox and suddenly they get this out 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.670
 that very good because you can really 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.979
 be false I do not doubt the truth but without 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.680
 But it seems very strange that no one 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.470
 has currado this to be false is 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.940
 say I think someone or the same 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.310
 own was done this because it has 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.740
 uploaded to a super channel let's say that 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.509
 anonymous ie I had a video uploaded 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.649
 to acquire are the Japanese title 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.240
 etc 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.119
 they themselves believe that they have been the ones 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.649
 they have caught and have done this simply 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.570
 as advertising campaign even 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.729
 many times they make their own 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.369
 own campaigns from this style do not 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.050
 I would discard truth truthfully 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.310
 being false, it gives me quite the same if 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.050
 they have done or have stopped doing it 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.520
 some I think it could just be 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.990
 a possibility but I'm going to 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.909
 take advantage of this because it does let's say that 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.170
 a week that already preparing almost saying 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.590
 a video gathering information about 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.119
 news of the new playstation but 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.400
 well I did not have enough things that 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.989
 talk like to make a whole video and 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.800
 The first thing is that someone then 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.360
 realized 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.420
 they said the sony people themselves that very 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.400
 few people realized that in the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.930
 official launch of the playstation 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.910
 you only saw the command evidently 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.410
 not serve the entire console but all 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.750
 the fifteen of the invisible console 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.840
 etcetera etcetera but good it turns out that 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.250
 nobody realized that he was not 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.590
 looking at the screen and no one gave 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.780
 mind that in your hands but when 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.420
 I was playing the kill zone and so on 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.360
 the command you know that it has a screen 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.100
 leds if I'm not wrong 3 inches 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.130
 but it's those dimensions but good 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.420
 case is that nobody realized that 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.580
 that screen was changing color in 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.860
 function of let's say they had several 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.720
 functions in the use in the game is 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.790
 say in the cri liza a 4 how they were 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.860
 playing if your character was hurt 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.300
 because the LED screen went from being 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.890
 green color for the reds is something 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.650
 super absurd the truth or I think that 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.200
 A thousand things have already been done, let's say that 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.210
 century that however perhaps the 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.770
 alauÃ­ or install 3 you have a 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.730
 little screen that marks you let's say 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.180
 other data 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.710
 but let's say that in this case it is 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.760
 something that I think is quite absurd 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.670
 society the authority so 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.019
 writing right handed mesh let's say that 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.040
 you say no of the things the second thing is 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.659
 how good you know that the command is going to 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.180
 to be practically the same in fact was what 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.590
 only that we saw from the console the command and 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.819
 you already know that I would have the same is what 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.909
 that was going to have a share button 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.650
 although nevertheless the people of sony are 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.680
 reserved 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.780
 let's say that the privilege or is the 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.870
 assess let's say that the option to be able 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.159
 cut what has been the option of 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.200
 to share is to ask for a button 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.340
 share in which you give it is recorded 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.250
 a video you can share with your 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.739
 contacts as this had taken away what 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.629
 which means that this choice of 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.609
 own our own game decides 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.079
 imagine that you are playing your set to 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.609
 any game is just in the 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.709
 end then I use anything on 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.510
 the most advanced game and you give it a 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.939
 Share button and all contacts 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.709
 the skills at the end is not to say no 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.690
 I think it's allowed because it would be 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.250
 quite absurd and like a lot 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.569
 people say that oysters that well be able 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.310
 Stream directly from the 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.139
 new console and so on I think it's going to 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.729
 end up happening just like me 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.380
 example has happened with the call of duty 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.669
 that is to say the whole world was saying 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.990
 you are coming the new call of duty 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.060
 will you have the possibility 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.510
 to do streaming sincerely I have not seen 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.039
 to nobody do streaming from their own 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.270
 the console itself is saying something that is not 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.250
 he knows it can be done 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.930
 streaming from the call of duty itself 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.910
 with people of action who do them 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.470
 ends tweets or youtube and I have not seen 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.940
 to nobody do those terms is that by 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.780
 much that people say oysters what good 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.860
 what good what good you will not need 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.229
 capturing 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.849
 that's really going to be just as worthless or 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.229
 At least that's what I think so good 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.520
 that has been practically everything then 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.039
 some images I imagine that during 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.680
 all the video showing the thing that 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.810
 had supposedly revealed that 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.830
 we know it was proven to be false but not 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.020
 a little information has been completed 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.030
 about the new console so it's our turn 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.860
 wait just a week to know 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.270
 what will happen to the new xbox so 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.919
 what I said and use video vote it and we 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.919
 we see the next one over all and goodbye
