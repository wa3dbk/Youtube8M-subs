when<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.690> first<00:00:15.990> started<00:00:16.379> participating<00:00:17.060> in

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
when I first started participating in

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.330 
when I first started participating in
debate<00:00:18.480> with<00:00:18.840> shooting<00:00:19.260> coaches<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.250> is

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
debate with shooting coaches and what is

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.210 
debate with shooting coaches and what is
the<00:00:20.460> most<00:00:20.640> important<00:00:21.150> factor<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.510> shooting<00:00:21.930> I

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
the most important factor in shooting I

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.339 
the most important factor in shooting I
mentioned<00:00:25.279> tolls<00:00:26.390> feet<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.660> glutes

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
mentioned tolls feet and glutes

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.640 
mentioned tolls feet and glutes
rather<00:00:29.310> than<00:00:29.519> shooting<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:30.000> my<00:00:30.150> fingers<00:00:30.650> my

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
rather than shooting for my fingers my

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.430 
rather than shooting for my fingers my
explanation<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.219> simple<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:33.570> toes<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.170> feet

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
explanation is simple the toes and feet

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.010 
explanation is simple the toes and feet
are<00:00:34.980> an<00:00:35.340> integral<00:00:35.790> part<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.300> whole

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
are an integral part of whole

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.900 
are an integral part of whole
biomechanics<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.100> now<00:00:38.219> see<00:00:38.460> inside<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
biomechanics we can now see inside the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.110 
biomechanics we can now see inside the
shoe<00:00:39.800> everybody<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:40.980> copy<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.760> shooting

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
shoe everybody can copy the shooting

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.700 
shoe everybody can copy the shooting
form<00:00:42.390> correctly<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> certain<00:00:43.379> degree

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
form correctly to a certain degree

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.639 
form correctly to a certain degree
however<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.539> neurological<00:00:46.200> connection

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
however the neurological connection

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.290 
however the neurological connection
between<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.160> feet<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.579> glutes<00:00:47.789> are<00:00:48.000> not

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
between the feet and glutes are not

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.209 
between the feet and glutes are not
there<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:48.899> majority<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> people<00:00:49.590> due<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
there for majority of the people due to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.240 
there for majority of the people due to
the<00:00:50.460> shoe<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.870> hyper<00:00:52.079> art<00:00:52.320> magazine<00:00:52.739> utilizes

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the shoe the hyper art magazine utilizes

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.459 
the shoe the hyper art magazine utilizes
intrinsic<00:00:53.730> muscles<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.300> tendons<00:00:54.629> inside<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
intrinsic muscles and tendons inside the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.060 
intrinsic muscles and tendons inside the
feet<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.940> stimulates<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.770> sciatic<00:00:58.770> nerves

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
feet and stimulates this sciatic nerves

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.650 
feet and stimulates this sciatic nerves
to<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.399> glutes<00:00:59.719> in<00:01:00.719> common<00:01:01.649> people<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
to the glutes in common people the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.410 
to the glutes in common people the
glutes<00:01:03.660> are<00:01:03.930> soft<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.040> cannot<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:06.030> leveraged

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
glutes are soft and cannot be leveraged

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.320 
glutes are soft and cannot be leveraged
due<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.290> generation<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.610> healthy<00:01:09.090> nerves

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
due to the generation of healthy nerves

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.920 
due to the generation of healthy nerves
from<00:01:09.750> feet<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.500> glutes<00:01:11.450> in<00:01:12.450> superior

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
from feet to the glutes in superior

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.080 
from feet to the glutes in superior
athletes<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.710> glutes<00:01:13.950> are<00:01:14.130> hard<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.430> rock<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
athletes the glutes are hard as rock and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.910 
athletes the glutes are hard as rock and
can<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.360> easily<00:01:15.479> leveraged<00:01:16.049> when<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> feet

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
can be easily leveraged when the feet

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.690 
can be easily leveraged when the feet
get<00:01:17.220> into<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.360> hybrid<00:01:18.720> mode<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.340> tendon
