only thing is you might want to replace
those<00:02:32.840> screens<00:02:33.260> because<00:02:34.100> they're<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:35.260> little

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
those screens because they're a little

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.860 
those screens because they're a little
bit<00:02:36.500> broken<00:02:38.590> here's<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.709> other<00:02:39.830> rear<00:02:40.370> fender

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
bit broken here's the other rear fender

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.030 
bit broken here's the other rear fender
as<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.990> can<00:02:42.140> see<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.440> is<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.680> previous

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
as you can see this is the previous

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.720 
as you can see this is the previous
guy's<00:02:43.280> car<00:02:44.470> there's<00:02:45.470> metal<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.490> just<00:02:46.640> a

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
guy's car there's metal it's just a

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.060 
guy's car there's metal it's just a
fiberglass<00:02:47.150> part<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.600> want<00:02:49.240> as<00:02:50.240> you<00:02:50.360> can<00:02:50.540> see

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
fiberglass part you want as you can see

00:02:51.070 --> 00:03:01.619 
fiberglass part you want as you can see
just<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.190> separate<00:02:52.820> it

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.250 

so<00:03:02.629> the<00:03:02.720> rear<00:03:02.870> right<00:03:03.080> side<00:03:03.790> comes<00:03:04.790> with<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.300> gas

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
so the rear right side comes with a gas

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.580 
so the rear right side comes with a gas
cap<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:09.290> has<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.769> extension<00:03:10.040> on<00:03:10.550> it

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
cap it has the extension on it

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.339 
cap it has the extension on it
so<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:12.890> can<00:03:13.040> still<00:03:13.310> use<00:03:13.519> your<00:03:13.730> stock<00:03:14.349> gas

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
so that you can still use your stock gas

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.920 
so that you can still use your stock gas
cap<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.739> everything<00:03:19.360> so<00:03:20.360> once<00:03:20.510> again<00:03:20.660> this<00:03:20.870> is

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930
