back the trailer underneath it and just

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.250 
back the trailer underneath it and just
to<00:00:31.949> let<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.250> know<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.730> think<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> original

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.920 

watercraft<00:00:37.260> weight<00:00:37.590> about<00:00:38.149> 525<00:00:39.149> pounds

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
watercraft weight about 525 pounds

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.319 
watercraft weight about 525 pounds
something<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:41.460> estimating<00:00:41.940> my

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
something like that I'm estimating my

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.299 
something like that I'm estimating my
boat<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:43.140> everything<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.890> it

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
boat with everything in it

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.229 
boat with everything in it
without<00:00:44.730> anybody<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.660> about<00:00:46.559> 600<00:00:47.160> pounds<00:00:47.610> but

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
without anybody is about 600 pounds but

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.470 
without anybody is about 600 pounds but
the<00:00:48.450> square<00:00:48.840> footage<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:50.149> touching<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> water

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the square footage of touching the water

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.560 
the square footage of touching the water
is<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.340> lot<00:00:53.340> larger<00:00:53.610> than<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.420> original

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
is a lot larger than the original

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.080 
is a lot larger than the original
sea-doo<00:00:55.199> plus<00:00:56.039> being<00:00:56.280> flat<00:00:56.579> bottom<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.510> I'm<00:00:58.079> I

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
sea-doo plus being flat bottom so I'm I

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
sea-doo plus being flat bottom so I'm I
don't<00:01:00.090> think<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.629> overweight<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.710> it's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
don't think it's overweight but it's

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.260 
don't think it's overweight but it's
certainly<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.250> something<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.940> two<00:01:03.120> or

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
certainly not something that two or

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.840 
certainly not something that two or
three<00:01:03.449> people<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.960> lift<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> trailer<00:01:05.610> or

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
three people can lift on to a trailer or

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.730 
three people can lift on to a trailer or
anything<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.930> tough<00:01:07.170> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
anything like that it's it's tough so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.200 
anything like that it's it's tough so
it's<00:01:07.770> gonna<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.460> its<00:01:08.640> own<00:01:08.760> flat

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it's gonna have to have its own flat

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.620 
it's gonna have to have its own flat
bottom<00:01:09.540> type<00:01:09.750> trailer<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:11.299> just<00:01:12.299> thought<00:01:12.450> I'd

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
bottom type trailer I just thought I'd

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.270 
bottom type trailer I just thought I'd
show<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.229> little<00:01:13.470> picture<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:13.830> before<00:01:14.250> I

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
show a little picture here before I

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.490 
show a little picture here before I
launch<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.850> then<00:01:14.970> I'm<00:01:15.119> gonna<00:01:15.330> hopefully<00:01:16.140> get

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
launch and then I'm gonna hopefully get

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.170 
launch and then I'm gonna hopefully get
somebody<00:01:16.830> take<00:01:17.130> some<00:01:17.280> pictures<00:01:17.580> well<00:01:17.880> it's

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
somebody take some pictures well it's

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.930 
somebody take some pictures well it's
being<00:01:18.450> launched<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.330 

see<00:01:22.940> little<00:01:23.210> air
