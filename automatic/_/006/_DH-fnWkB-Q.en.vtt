00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
start off with the obvious which would

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.080 
start off with the obvious which would
be<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> throne<00:00:34.800> chair<00:00:35.130> we're<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.910> do

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090

front<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.190> along<00:00:45.000> these<00:00:45.180> sides<00:00:45.920> I'm<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
front and along these sides I'm going to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.340 
front and along these sides I'm going to
create<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.820> corner<00:00:48.750> piece<00:00:50.149> then<00:00:51.149> whoops<00:00:51.660> then

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
create a corner piece then whoops then

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.650 
create a corner piece then whoops then
bring<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:53.100> upside<00:00:53.789> down<00:00:53.969> stairs<00:00:56.660> full

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
bring it up with upside down stairs full

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.349 
bring it up with upside down stairs full
block<00:00:58.280> upside<00:00:59.280> down<00:00:59.489> stairs<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:02.359> then

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
block upside down stairs I can then

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.140 
block upside down stairs I can then
stairs<00:01:03.719> facing<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.710> way<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.250> finally<00:01:05.790> one

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
stairs facing this way and finally one

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.630 
stairs facing this way and finally one
upside<00:01:06.630> down<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.860> will<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> basics

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
upside down and that will be the basics

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640 
upside down and that will be the basics
for<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.000> throne<00:01:09.479> chair<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.260> hopefully<00:01:10.560> you

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
for the throne chair so hopefully you

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
for the throne chair so hopefully you
can<00:01:10.680> follow<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.450> once<00:01:12.450> you've<00:01:12.630> done

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
can follow that and once you've done

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.350 
can follow that and once you've done
that<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:13.229> also<00:01:13.380> want<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.710> grab<00:01:14.010> some<00:01:14.369> full

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
that we also want to grab some full

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.679 
that we also want to grab some full
blocks<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.869> stone<00:01:16.650> bricks<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:18.119> bring<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
blocks of stone bricks and bring up a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.359 
blocks of stone bricks and bring up a
wall<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.590> along<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.970> backside<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.960> so

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
wall just along the backside like so

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.620 
wall just along the backside like so
we're<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> continue<00:01:23.909> doing<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.450> until

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
we're going to continue doing this until

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.710 
we're going to continue doing this until
we<00:01:25.170> reach<00:01:25.939> basically<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.570> top<00:01:29.630> we're<00:01:30.630> going

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
we reach basically the top we're going

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.480 
we reach basically the top we're going
to<00:01:30.780> grab<00:01:30.990> our<00:01:31.170> buttons<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.979> put<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.369> on

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
to grab our buttons and put one on

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.240 
to grab our buttons and put one on
either<00:01:32.729> side<00:01:35.960> this<00:01:36.960> button<00:01:37.409> will<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.710> pretty

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
either side this button will be pretty

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.880 
either side this button will be pretty
much<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.670> decoration<00:01:39.180> purpose<00:01:39.600> only<00:01:40.259> just

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
much for decoration purpose only just

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.050 
much for decoration purpose only just
make<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.189> look<00:01:41.250> symmetrical<00:01:43.729> so<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.820> need<00:01:44.970> to

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
make it look symmetrical so we need to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.609 
make it look symmetrical so we need to
leave<00:01:45.180> space<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> redstone

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
leave space for all the redstone

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.679 
leave space for all the redstone
mechanics<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.460> I've<00:01:47.579> cut<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.119> hole<00:01:48.479> which

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
mechanics so I've cut out a hole which

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.319 
mechanics so I've cut out a hole which
is<00:01:48.840> two<00:01:49.049> blocks<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.530> depth<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.100> also<00:01:50.790> removed

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
is two blocks in depth and also removed

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.510 
is two blocks in depth and also removed
all<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> unnecessary<00:01:52.020> blocks<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.310> for

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
all the unnecessary blocks so for

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.679 
all the unnecessary blocks so for
example<00:01:53.909> I'm<00:01:54.000> not<00:01:54.119> going<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> remove<00:01:54.479> this

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
example I'm not going to remove this

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.499 
example I'm not going to remove this
block<00:01:54.960> because<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> reveal<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.159> cap

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
block because it's going to reveal a cap

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.609 
block because it's going to reveal a cap
which<00:01:57.509> reminds<00:01:57.869> me<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.200> need<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.439> grab

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
which reminds me that we need to grab

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.980 
which reminds me that we need to grab
some<00:01:58.860> cobblestone<00:01:59.430> blocks<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.060> place<00:02:00.689> them

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
some cobblestone blocks and place them

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.690 
some cobblestone blocks and place them
right<00:02:01.170> underneath<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.860> buttons

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.950 

and<00:02:05.700> then<00:02:05.970> we<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.150> remove<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.600> blocks<00:02:06.870> from

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
and then we can remove the blocks from

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.480 
and then we can remove the blocks from
underneath<00:02:09.770> right<00:02:10.770> guys<00:02:11.010> so<00:02:11.190> I'm<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.430> to

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
underneath right guys so I'm going to

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.430 
underneath right guys so I'm going to
try<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.760> explain<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.540> best<00:02:12.810> as<00:02:12.960> I<00:02:13.080> can

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
try to explain this as best as I can

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.080 
try to explain this as best as I can
I<00:02:13.470> haven't<00:02:13.800> really<00:02:13.920> done<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.310> tutorial<00:02:14.520> video

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
I haven't really done a tutorial video

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.270 
I haven't really done a tutorial video
on<00:02:15.210> redstone<00:02:15.720> before<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.620> hopefully<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.100> can

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
on redstone before so hopefully you can

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.400 
on redstone before so hopefully you can
follow<00:02:17.460> this<00:02:17.640> easily<00:02:18.210> we're<00:02:18.900> gonna<00:02:18.990> start<00:02:19.290> by

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
follow this easily we're gonna start by

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.830 
follow this easily we're gonna start by
adding<00:02:19.560> these<00:02:19.830> sticky<00:02:20.250> pistons<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.420> are

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
adding these sticky pistons and to are

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.650 
adding these sticky pistons and to are
gonna<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.380> facing<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.310> world<00:02:23.670> blocks<00:02:24.000> leaving

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
gonna be facing the world blocks leaving

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.390 
gonna be facing the world blocks leaving
one<00:02:25.110> gap<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.770> just<00:02:26.220> like<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:29.250> other

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
one gap so just like that and the other

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.640 
one gap so just like that and the other
sticky<00:02:29.820> piston<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.300> going<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.600> go<00:02:30.720> facing

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
sticky piston is going to go facing

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.670 
sticky piston is going to go facing
upwards<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.810> underneath<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.110> cobblestone

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
upwards just underneath the cobblestone

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.140 
upwards just underneath the cobblestone
block<00:02:34.890> which<00:02:35.130> we<00:02:35.280> placed<00:02:35.520> underneath<00:02:35.880> the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
block which we placed underneath the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.050 
block which we placed underneath the
button<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:37.800> we<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.190> actually<00:02:38.490> go<00:02:38.790> ahead<00:02:38.820> and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
button and we can actually go ahead and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.730 
button and we can actually go ahead and
remove<00:02:39.540> these<00:02:39.750> blocks<00:02:40.110> because<00:02:40.470> we<00:02:40.560> don't

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
remove these blocks because we don't

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.620 
remove these blocks because we don't
need<00:02:40.920> them<00:02:41.190> we're<00:02:41.820> going<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.030> add<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.330> full

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
need them we're going to add a full

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.280 
need them we're going to add a full
block<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.080> place<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:44.070> lever<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:45.300> what

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
block and place the lever and what

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.140 
block and place the lever and what
basically<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.980> does<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:47.550> once<00:02:47.970> we

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
basically this does is that once we

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.960 
basically this does is that once we
press<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.870> button<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:50.100> piston<00:02:50.580> will<00:02:50.760> bring

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
press this button the piston will bring

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.720 
press this button the piston will bring
down<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.510> cobblestone<00:02:52.020> block<00:02:52.460> revealing<00:02:53.460> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
down the cobblestone block revealing the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.540 
down the cobblestone block revealing the
lever<00:02:54.120> which<00:02:54.660> once<00:02:55.020> pulled<00:02:55.380> will<00:02:56.250> trigger

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
lever which once pulled will trigger

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.180 
lever which once pulled will trigger
these<00:02:56.850> two<00:02:57.120> sticky<00:02:57.480> pistons<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.170> open<00:02:58.950> up<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
these two sticky pistons and open up the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.420 
these two sticky pistons and open up the
secret<00:02:59.430> passageway<00:03:04.070> so<00:03:05.070> now<00:03:05.190> we're<00:03:05.280> going<00:03:05.370> to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
secret passageway so now we're going to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.220 
secret passageway so now we're going to
add<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.790> redstone<00:03:06.270> torches<00:03:06.660> there's<00:03:07.080> only

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
add the redstone torches there's only

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.410 
add the redstone torches there's only
two<00:03:07.560> involved<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> circuit<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.300> we're

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
two involved in the circuit so we're

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.570 
two involved in the circuit so we're
gonna<00:03:09.540> add<00:03:09.750> one<00:03:10.020> where<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.680> block<00:03:11.280> where<00:03:11.489> the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
gonna add one where the block where the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.060 
gonna add one where the block where the
button<00:03:11.940> goes<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:13.260> other<00:03:13.470> one<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.860> going

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
button goes and the other one is going

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.650 
button goes and the other one is going
to<00:03:14.130> be<00:03:14.310> placed<00:03:14.580> four<00:03:14.910> blocks<00:03:15.150> further<00:03:15.420> away

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
to be placed four blocks further away

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.620 
to be placed four blocks further away
from<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:15.959> piston<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.680> one<00:03:16.890> two<00:03:17.100> three<00:03:17.130> four

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
from this piston so one two three four

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.180 
from this piston so one two three four
remove<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.870> three<00:03:19.140> blocks<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.950> middle

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
remove the three blocks in the middle

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.400 
remove the three blocks in the middle
and<00:03:20.370> then<00:03:20.880> add<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.239> redstone<00:03:21.690> torch<00:03:21.720> right

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
and then add the redstone torch right

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.979 
and then add the redstone torch right
there<00:03:22.769> just<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.269> then<00:03:24.900> we're

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
there just like that and then we're

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.630 
there just like that and then we're
going<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.140> connect<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.650> redstone<00:03:26.220> torch

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
going to connect this redstone torch

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.910 
going to connect this redstone torch
with<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.269> redstone<00:03:27.780> all<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.260> way<00:03:28.350> down<00:03:28.590> to

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
with the redstone all the way down to

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.130 
with the redstone all the way down to
the<00:03:29.250> sticky<00:03:29.700> piston<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.930> we're<00:03:31.050> gonna

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
the sticky piston so that we're gonna

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.640 
the sticky piston so that we're gonna
add<00:03:31.350> two<00:03:31.650> blocks<00:03:31.950> here<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.200> we're<00:03:34.200> gonna<00:03:34.320> cut

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
add two blocks here and we're gonna cut

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.090 
add two blocks here and we're gonna cut
a<00:03:34.860> path<00:03:35.280> all<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.239> way<00:03:36.540> down<00:03:36.870> till<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.890> meets

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
a path all the way down till it meets

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.050 
a path all the way down till it meets
the<00:03:38.310> piston<00:03:38.840> then<00:03:39.840> connect<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.410> like<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.610> and

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
the piston then connect it like so and

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.600 
the piston then connect it like so and
it<00:03:42.600> should<00:03:42.810> turn<00:03:43.050> on<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.290> piston<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.400> once

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
it should turn on the piston and once

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.220 
it should turn on the piston and once
you<00:03:44.760> press<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.180> button<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.750> should<00:03:46.050> now

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
you press this button it should now

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.430 
you press this button it should now
bring<00:03:46.650> down<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:47.010> cobblestone

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.590 

now<00:03:52.310> we're<00:03:52.430> going<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.610> go<00:03:52.730> ahead<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.210> connect

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
now we're going to go ahead and connect

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.810 
now we're going to go ahead and connect
the<00:03:53.900> lever<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.740> the<00:03:54.770> back<00:03:55.070> of<00:03:55.310> this<00:03:55.490> floating

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.240 
the lever to the back of this floating
block<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:57.230> do<00:03:57.350> that<00:03:57.530> we<00:03:57.650> want<00:03:57.740> to<00:03:57.860> start<00:03:58.100> by

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
block and to do that we want to start by

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.640 
block and to do that we want to start by
creating<00:03:58.580> a<00:03:58.940> path<00:03:59.240> choose<00:04:00.140> any<00:04:00.380> block<00:04:00.530> you

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
creating a path choose any block you

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.720 
creating a path choose any block you
want<00:04:00.830> you<00:04:00.980> just<00:04:01.100> go<00:04:01.250> one<00:04:01.460> two<00:04:01.640> three<00:04:02.150> up<00:04:02.930> one<00:04:03.730> up

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
want you just go one two three up one up

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.860 
want you just go one two three up one up
again<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.980> then<00:04:06.980> join<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.340> up<00:04:10.570> then<00:04:11.570> finish

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
again and then join it up then finish

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.400 
again and then join it up then finish
off<00:04:12.020> the<00:04:12.140> circuit<00:04:12.590> with<00:04:13.010> redstone<00:04:13.520> and<00:04:17.410> now

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
off the circuit with redstone and now

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.740 
off the circuit with redstone and now
this<00:04:18.620> redstone<00:04:18.980> torch<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:20.120> going<00:04:20.360> to<00:04:20.420> join<00:04:20.570> up

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
this redstone torch is going to join up

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.590 
this redstone torch is going to join up
with<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:21.200> piston<00:04:21.739> so<00:04:22.490> again<00:04:22.760> another<00:04:23.180> basic

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
with the piston so again another basic

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.680 
with the piston so again another basic
path<00:04:24.370> leaving<00:04:25.370> space<00:04:25.730> for<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.090> redstone<00:04:26.510> to

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
path leaving space for the redstone to

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.500 
path leaving space for the redstone to
go<00:04:26.810> on<00:04:26.930> top<00:04:27.140> that's<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.280> trigger<00:04:28.520> switch<00:04:29.150> on<00:04:29.330> the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
go on top that's a trigger switch on the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.550 
go on top that's a trigger switch on the
piston<00:04:29.960> for<00:04:30.800> pushing<00:04:31.340> out<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.490> wall<00:04:32.270> block

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.530 

right<00:04:36.560> then<00:04:36.800> two<00:04:37.130> final<00:04:37.490> steps<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:38.000> finish<00:04:38.240> the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
right then two final steps to finish the

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.600 
right then two final steps to finish the
connection<00:04:39.170> we're<00:04:39.920> going<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.130> join<00:04:40.310> up<00:04:40.490> the

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
connection we're going to join up the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.150 
connection we're going to join up the
circuit<00:04:41.030> with<00:04:41.210> redstone<00:04:41.600> to<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.560> final

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
circuit with redstone to the final

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.550 
circuit with redstone to the final
piston<00:04:43.580> at<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:43.790> bottom<00:04:44.120> over<00:04:44.300> here<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:45.530> just

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
piston at the bottom over here so just

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.110 
piston at the bottom over here so just
make<00:04:46.010> sure<00:04:46.040> that<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.610> switches<00:04:46.940> on<00:04:48.820> as<00:04:49.820> you<00:04:50.000> can

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
make sure that it switches on as you can

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.640 
make sure that it switches on as you can
see<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.600> then<00:04:50.960> we're<00:04:51.050> going<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.200> place<00:04:51.410> a

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
see and then we're going to place a

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.770 
see and then we're going to place a
lever<00:04:52.040> that's<00:04:52.430> going<00:04:52.730> to<00:04:52.790> go<00:04:52.910> on<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.270> inside

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
lever that's going to go on the inside

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.510 
lever that's going to go on the inside
and<00:04:54.020> that's<00:04:54.200> going<00:04:54.350> to<00:04:54.410> stop<00:04:54.680> intruders<00:04:55.370> from

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
and that's going to stop intruders from

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.540 
and that's going to stop intruders from
following<00:04:56.120> you<00:04:56.210> in<00:04:56.420> once<00:04:56.690> it's<00:04:56.930> triggers<00:04:57.550> so

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
following you in once it's triggers so

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.650 
following you in once it's triggers so
again<00:04:58.850> connect<00:04:59.330> it<00:04:59.510> with<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.720> redstone<00:05:00.170> and

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.730 

that's<00:05:05.660> pretty<00:05:05.810> much<00:05:05.930> all<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.380> circuit

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
that's pretty much all the circuit

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.950 
that's pretty much all the circuit
complete<00:05:07.160> so<00:05:07.880> let's<00:05:08.060> go<00:05:08.180> ahead<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:08.419> see<00:05:08.810> if<00:05:08.840> it

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
complete so let's go ahead and see if it

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.909 
complete so let's go ahead and see if it
works<00:05:09.140> so<00:05:10.480> as<00:05:11.480> you<00:05:11.660> can<00:05:11.750> see<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.290> throne<00:05:12.650> chair

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
works so as you can see the throne chair

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.970 
works so as you can see the throne chair
is<00:05:13.100> closed<00:05:13.610> up<00:05:13.910> if<00:05:14.690> we<00:05:14.900> press<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.350> button<00:05:15.380> it's

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
is closed up if we press the button it's

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.100 
is closed up if we press the button it's
going<00:05:16.130> to<00:05:16.220> reveal<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.640> lever<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.210> if<00:05:17.690> we<00:05:17.810> pull

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
going to reveal the lever and if we pull

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.460 
going to reveal the lever and if we pull
that<00:05:18.230> lever<00:05:18.440> it<00:05:18.770> should<00:05:19.130> open<00:05:19.430> up<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.760> gap

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
that lever it should open up the gap

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.810 
that lever it should open up the gap
leaving<00:05:21.470> an<00:05:21.650> entrance<00:05:22.130> for<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.460> secret

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
leaving an entrance for the secret

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.180 
leaving an entrance for the secret
passageway<00:05:23.150> and<00:05:23.510> if<00:05:24.200> we<00:05:24.320> go<00:05:24.440> back<00:05:24.470> and<00:05:24.919> press

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
passageway and if we go back and press

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.370 
passageway and if we go back and press
the<00:05:25.400> button<00:05:25.610> again<00:05:25.970> it's<00:05:26.480> not<00:05:26.720> going<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:26.930> work

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
the button again it's not going to work

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.960 
the button again it's not going to work
that's<00:05:27.830> because<00:05:28.100> since<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.520> lever<00:05:28.700> is

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
that's because since the lever is

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.060 
that's because since the lever is
already<00:05:29.390> pulled<00:05:29.720> it's<00:05:30.320> already<00:05:30.650> giving<00:05:30.890> power

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
already pulled it's already giving power

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.920 
already pulled it's already giving power
to<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:31.280> piston<00:05:31.790> so<00:05:32.360> it's<00:05:32.510> not<00:05:32.690> going<00:05:32.870> to

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
to the piston so it's not going to

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.270 
to the piston so it's not going to
reopen<00:05:33.610> then<00:05:34.610> if<00:05:34.730> we<00:05:34.850> pass<00:05:35.090> through<00:05:35.510> and<00:05:36.280> pull

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
reopen then if we pass through and pull

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.110 
reopen then if we pass through and pull
this<00:05:37.460> lever<00:05:37.730> it<00:05:38.570> should<00:05:38.840> close<00:05:39.080> up<00:05:39.140> the<00:05:39.860> gap

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
this lever it should close up the gap

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.170 
this lever it should close up the gap
stopping<00:05:41.120> intruders<00:05:41.510> from<00:05:41.600> following<00:05:42.020> you<00:05:42.110> in

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.490 

so<00:05:47.180> that<00:05:47.330> would<00:05:47.419> be<00:05:47.510> the<00:05:47.630> end<00:05:47.780> of<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.080> tutorial

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
so that would be the end of the tutorial

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.909 
so that would be the end of the tutorial

redstone connections if we actually go
behind<00:05:53.120> the<00:05:53.210> scenes<00:05:53.419> you<00:05:53.780> can<00:05:54.320> see<00:05:54.620> that<00:05:54.770> all

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
behind the scenes you can see that all

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.040 
behind the scenes you can see that all
my<00:05:55.010> redstone<00:05:55.610> is<00:05:55.850> covered<00:05:56.390> up<00:05:56.540> within<00:05:56.840> the
