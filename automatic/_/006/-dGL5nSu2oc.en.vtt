 was measured with a ruler that was two 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.160
 inches less than the true meter 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:14.250
 then you have suffered a loss in the 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:16.770
 value of 'let's solution solution 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.100
 I want to know how it was the loss that she 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.810
 had well 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.229
 the first thing she bought 20 meters 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:32.460
 20 meters of fabric paying real and 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.540
 50 cents or meter 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.560
 then she paid how much in total the total 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.600
 paid out 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:50.570
 the total paid and then will be 20 meters 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:59.159
 times ten reais and 50 cents 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:03.659
 soon she paid a total of 210 reais 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.930
 this is the amount she paid plus one 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.649
 meter that was used and 62 centimeters 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.320
 smaller than the true method you know 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.829
 that the meter is six centimeters 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:21.180
 Early in the morning I was measuring 2 centimeters 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:25.160
 less was so good the damage in each 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.160
 meter in every inch 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.920
 she took a loss of 2 centimeters 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.239
 then in marriage her injury was 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.269
 from the center chuchu 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.730
 she had a 2 percent loss in 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.070
 every meter 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.910
 Now I know what her injury was. 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:49.300
 now it was 2% of the total 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:55.570
 therefore the loss of the loss 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:03:00.200
 the loss of it was a loss that 2% 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:07.930
