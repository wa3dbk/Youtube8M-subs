00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello girls good today I came to make one 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.569
 video much requested by you 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.670
 mainly I did not notice in the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.450
 video app comments to the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.620
 iphone 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.420
 I realized that a lot of girls 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.280
 They asked me what I 'm doing. 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.869
 hair, how could I do it? 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.359
 it reaches that size here is how it is 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.720
 that hydrate it that I 'm making of it 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.460
 It's so beautiful not to be that and such 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.050
 I've heard that for you all that you 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.369
 They want to know about you for everything I do. 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.560
 my hair 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.000
 First and foremost, I'll talk to my 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.710
 Hair does not have any chemical my 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.710
 hair was always a lookout is something that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.399
 I did in it was cut since when it was 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.760
 little I never painted the coffee 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.890
 sanitation 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.120
 nothing, nothing, nothing on the table, totally 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.160
 virgin and next go have a hair 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.520
 healthy first you have to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.710
 cut what I do my hair in 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.320
 True, he had his hair always. 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.570
 so we always cut 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.670
 here because it does not lead me to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.400
 hairdresser never overdose 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.890
 cut hair tone and then I would take 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.060
 so will not I never said behave 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.659
 No, I do not know. 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.759
 I left like so my mother told the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.670
 I also did not talk about hacking and then 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.189
 it was growing growing and I ended up in color 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.310
 hair we'll just get no 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.650
 I have since and since that year I started 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.840
 to let the hair grow and then 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.939
 I'm just going to take photos, including 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.090
 my mother to my court and I'm with 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.799
 O little heart so much good of people 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.270
 I'm scared of my hairdresser. 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.759
 I kind of have it, so it's me too. 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.930
 so little heart but it will work 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.850
 says my castle to anyone who asks 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.149
 is the room he usually once per 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.909
 year and does not cut the type of cut even 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.230
 I'm only on the tips when I see 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.720
 that the tips are very well fragile zinho 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.600
 so I catch talk about creating shame 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.960
 on the face and do not cut the hair so it is 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.450
 once a year and that only only has 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.700
 very lucky to know about the new 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.120
 take your time and against my 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.370
 since before and it's when I had hair 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.710
 here I always cut once in the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.600
 I do not do that rule of the three 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.410
 months yesterday's score cut three 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.020
 months 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.770
 I do not see it that way because if you cut 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.210
 every three months 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.620
 I think you do not see your hair growing 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.180
 good my opinion the inversion day wash the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.510
 hair I've always used mine 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.810
 transfer is the smallest and has already used 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.750
 several lines of silk HIV Pantene 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.180
 but now at a time using another semi 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.430
 including the one here with my finishing and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.550
 a 3m shampoo conditioner medal 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.130
 months and twelve that line lines here 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.920
 the shampoo here because it's over and I 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.750
 I bought more but the owner this line that 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.840
 encompasses hair and a very 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.370
 Also important that I use every week 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.040
 I get into my hair be a 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.020
 hydration or a heavy 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.300
 every week I moisturize my hair almost 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.300
 every time you put your hair on 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.550
 to hydrate so much and so deep 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.130
 as for the light heritage of mine I used here 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.150
 of natixis it's expensive it's of the line 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.760
 from aga khan 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.580
 This one and sicme is super delicious he is 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.620
 super crying and smelling it is full 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.950
 Because I already have a jar, I think the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.290
 third pot a more expensive mask if 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.380
 I can not go wrong with her last belt 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.030
 forty reais but I paulo because I 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.620
 really feel difference in hair one 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.200
 shine everything else 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.790
 I'm always dealing she'll say 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.680
 who was the one who helped hair grow 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.270
 because you do not know he always grew up 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.370
 so usually I've never used anything 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.680
 type has a produtinho using a 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.690
 machine in life is not 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.770
 I think in the fall of the horse that to 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.290
 grow that has mines puts a shampoo 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.360
 have shampoos that are also specific for 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.100
 help your hair grow and everything else 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.370
 that my hair has always been 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.050
 none of this type c biguÃ¡ veiga maltez only 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.120
 This is just that I think it's important for you. 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.280
 cut your hair every week you want 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.570
 he jumped because they so healthy 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.550
 The consequence, but I know he will. 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.790
 want to bookmark when I'm going to do these 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.000
 That's what these little things bagatin 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.700
 so I always try to protect my 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.280
 hair in every possible way 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.440
 so today I 'm also using 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.480
 the apothecary this is the line 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.880
 Take care of yourself, this is a thermal protector. 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.070
 spray that you just apply to the hair 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.700
 and still use it only to protect the 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.860
 hair I also this natixis oil paddle 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.080
 I'm from o boticario too I like 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.120
 quite and I found him well 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.100
 at least he even the protector 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.840
 so if you do not have a protector you do not have 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.300
 problem passing anything by chapinha 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.800
 dryer everything else so I do not use 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.320
 only times but of course you do not 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.460
 you can spray your hair and 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.020
 touch of oil 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.700
 do you pass a little spray and a 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.200
 little oil look you do not need 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.000
 generate that usually looks at the realm 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.860
 enough and this one is not knowing 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.140
 protect against heat 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.230
 Me too, to finish this hair 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.300
 Very cool, me too, and he helps 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.520
 keep your hair always treated with more 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.680
 and it's not that people my hair it does not me 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.660
 It's too much work because like I said 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.610
 at the beginning of the video he has no chemistry 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.620
 No, then I do not need to stay. 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.540
 retouching crazy fell in a hall 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.430
 always when I said 'I always cut 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.980
 the same year then sometime in the year 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.600
 that the tied the hall I do not do anything 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.030
 there is a lot that sometimes we do not go to 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.490
 even make hydration and everything else alone 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:41.710
 That's why I always took care of that. 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:44.350
 so I always tried to avoid chemistry 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.380
 tincture everything lighter I'm here until 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.780
 Today the hair 21 caught it comes nothing is 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.670
 I always try to leave a lot of 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.070
 It will be okay to miss since I do not 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.840
 I agree so often and this 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.450
 people do not have much to say in this 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.740
 video I hope you have enjoyed 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.449
 I hope I have 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.849
 This is it for those who want to leave their hair 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.979
 Grow the tip is you always leave 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:08.080
 very well treated and is not and I hope 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.460
