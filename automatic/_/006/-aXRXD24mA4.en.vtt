00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.849 

the<00:00:29.880> purpose<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> snatch<00:00:30.960> grip<00:00:31.260> deadlift

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the purpose of the snatch grip deadlift

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.340 
the purpose of the snatch grip deadlift
is<00:00:32.009> really<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.579> simulate<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.510> pulling<00:00:34.020> part

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
is really to simulate the pulling part

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.639 
is really to simulate the pulling part
of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.770> snatch<00:00:35.100> movement<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.320> setup

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
of the snatch movement so the setup

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.500 
of the snatch movement so the setup
should<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.399> same<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.180> were<00:00:39.329> going

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
should be the same as if you were going

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.200 
should be the same as if you were going
to<00:00:39.690> snatch<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.920> hand<00:00:41.190> position<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.969> bar

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
to snatch your hand position on the bar

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.900 
to snatch your hand position on the bar
as<00:00:42.390> wide<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.530> weight<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.160> your<00:00:44.190> heels<00:00:44.340> your

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
as wide the weight is in your heels your

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.119 
as wide the weight is in your heels your
toes<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.539> knees<00:00:45.840> are<00:00:46.140> turned<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:46.829> slightly

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
toes and knees are turned out slightly

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.119 
toes and knees are turned out slightly
and<00:00:47.730> your<00:00:48.270> shoulders<00:00:48.809> should<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.500> line<00:00:49.890> or

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
and your shoulders should be in line or

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.340 
and your shoulders should be in line or
slightly<00:00:50.460> over<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.300> bar<00:00:51.510> depending<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:52.140> how

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
slightly over the bar depending on how

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.700 
slightly over the bar depending on how
you<00:00:52.410> prefer<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.070> snatch<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.379> think

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
you prefer to snatch so I like to think

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.799 
you prefer to snatch so I like to think
of<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.219> if<00:00:56.579> I'm<00:00:56.789> actually<00:00:57.059> getting<00:00:57.449> ready

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
of it as if I'm actually getting ready

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.930 
of it as if I'm actually getting ready
to<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> snatch<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.859> I'm<00:00:59.010> simulating<00:00:59.910> that

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
to do a snatch and I'm simulating that

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.389 
to do a snatch and I'm simulating that
same<00:01:00.539> movement<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.440> you're<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> be

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
same movement but you're going to be

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.340 
same movement but you're going to be
doing<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:02.910> much<00:01:03.300> heavier<00:01:03.989> weight

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
doing it with much heavier weight

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.469 
doing it with much heavier weight
typically<00:01:05.010> you're<00:01:05.159> really<00:01:05.519> strengthening

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
typically you're really strengthening

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.420 
typically you're really strengthening
through<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> pulling<00:01:07.409> part<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> movement

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
through the pulling part of the movement

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.020 
through the pulling part of the movement
for<00:01:09.030> those<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.439> who<00:01:10.799> don't<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.400> snatch<00:01:11.729> it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
for those of you who don't do snatch it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.120 
for those of you who don't do snatch it
doesn't<00:01:12.450> mean<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.990> can't<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> snatch

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
doesn't mean that you can't do a snatch

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.280 
doesn't mean that you can't do a snatch
grab<00:01:14.520> deadlift<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.360> still<00:01:15.659> another<00:01:15.990> way<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
grab deadlift it's still another way to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.499 
grab deadlift it's still another way to
challenge<00:01:16.680> yourself<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.729> you're<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
challenge yourself and you're going to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.370 
challenge yourself and you're going to
work<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.080> your<00:01:19.200> back<00:01:19.549> strains<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.820> glutes

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
work on your back strains your glutes

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.590 
work on your back strains your glutes
as<00:01:22.680> well<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.399> it<00:01:23.640> doesn't<00:01:24.060> really<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.450> you

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
as well so it doesn't really that you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.069 
as well so it doesn't really that you
can't<00:01:24.930> do<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.610> for<00:01:26.610> those<00:01:26.789> of<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.509> use<00:01:27.570> it

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
can't do it for those of you that use it

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.590 
can't do it for those of you that use it
as<00:01:28.229> an<00:01:28.409> aid<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.009> go<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.759> snatch<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
as an aid to go on with your snatch it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.529 
as an aid to go on with your snatch it
is<00:01:30.780> such<00:01:31.320> an<00:01:31.500> important<00:01:32.130> movement<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.970> again

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
is such an important movement and again

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.080 
is such an important movement and again
you<00:01:33.750> really<00:01:33.960> want<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.439> try<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.649> simulate<00:01:35.090> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
you really want to try to simulate the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.929 
you really want to try to simulate the
same<00:01:36.560> movement<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.679> if<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.039> were<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.789> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
same movement as if you were going to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.149 
same movement as if you were going to
actually<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> snatch<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.909> here

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
actually do a snatch you can see it here

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.609 
actually do a snatch you can see it here
from<00:01:44.159> another<00:01:44.759> angle<00:01:45.179> and<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.049> idea<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.470> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
from another angle and the idea is you

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.620 
from another angle and the idea is you
kind<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.979> want<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> try<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> bring<00:01:47.970> your<00:01:48.179> glutes

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
kind of want to try to bring your glutes

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.289 
kind of want to try to bring your glutes
and<00:01:48.899> your<00:01:48.960> your<00:01:49.950> shoulders<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> same

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
and your your shoulders up at the same

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.450 
and your your shoulders up at the same
time<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.079> tendency<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.710> shooting<00:01:53.429> my

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
time I have a tendency of shooting my

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.219 
time I have a tendency of shooting my
butt<00:01:53.880> up<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.240> that's<00:01:54.390> something<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.049> need

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229

butt up and that's something that I need
to<00:01:55.409> work<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.970> want<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.390> arms<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.899> be

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
to work on but you want the arms to be

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.429 
to work on but you want the arms to be
