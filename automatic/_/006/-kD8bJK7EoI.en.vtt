one<00:00:00.450> of<00:00:00.539> the<00:00:00.630> questions<00:00:00.989> I<00:00:01.170> most<00:00:01.350> often

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
one of the questions I most often

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.460 
one of the questions I most often
receive<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.429> how<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.639> calculate<00:00:02.909> volume<00:00:03.540> no

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
receive is how to calculate volume no

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.010 
receive is how to calculate volume no
not<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.220> type<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:05.490> volume<00:00:05.940> but<00:00:06.390> rather<00:00:06.569> the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
not that type of volume but rather the

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.200 
not that type of volume but rather the
volume<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.950> subwoofer<00:00:08.309> enclosure<00:00:08.490> a

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
volume of a subwoofer enclosure a

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.270 
volume of a subwoofer enclosure a
function<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.380> based<00:00:10.620> on<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.010> width

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
function that is based on the width

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.240 
function that is based on the width
depth<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.300> height<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.200> box<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.710> what<00:00:14.160> do

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
depth and height of the box and what do

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.010 
depth and height of the box and what do
you<00:00:14.340> do<00:00:14.490> if<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.880> box<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> strange<00:00:15.750> shape

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
you do if the box is a strange shape

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.120 
you do if the box is a strange shape
like<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> wedge<00:00:16.859> or<00:00:17.480> not<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> shape<00:00:18.810> at<00:00:18.960> all<00:00:19.130> let's

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
like a wedge or not a shape at all let's

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.900 
like a wedge or not a shape at all let's
take<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> look

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
take a look

volume<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.170> quantity<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.650> space<00:00:23.039> enclosed

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
volume is the quantity of space enclosed

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.880 
volume is the quantity of space enclosed
by<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> three<00:00:24.269> dimensional<00:00:24.779> boundary<00:00:25.199> for

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
by a three dimensional boundary for

by a three dimensional boundary for
example<00:00:26.340> if<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.760> had<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.180> inch<00:00:27.390> by<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:28.050> inch

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
example if we had a one inch by one inch

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.070 
example if we had a one inch by one inch
by<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.590> inch<00:00:28.949> cube<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.029> total<00:00:30.359> volume<00:00:30.689> would

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
by one inch cube the total volume would

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.920 
by one inch cube the total volume would
be<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.800> inch<00:00:32.120> now<00:00:33.120> let's<00:00:33.360> say<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:33.690> took<00:00:33.809> a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
be one inch now let's say we took a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.900 
be one inch now let's say we took a
bunch<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.260> these<00:00:34.440> cubes<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.130> made<00:00:35.640> them<00:00:35.880> into

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
bunch of these cubes and made them into

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.450 
bunch of these cubes and made them into
a<00:00:36.300> much<00:00:36.570> larger<00:00:36.600> cube<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.739> was<00:00:37.920> three<00:00:38.280> inch

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
a much larger cube that was three inch

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.360 
a much larger cube that was three inch
by<00:00:38.879> three<00:00:39.180> inch<00:00:39.210> by<00:00:39.690> three<00:00:40.020> inch<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.100> case

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
by three inch by three inch in this case

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.459 
by three inch by three inch in this case
we<00:00:41.730> would<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.030> three<00:00:42.450> times<00:00:42.870> three<00:00:43.290> times

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
we would have three times three times

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.940 
we would have three times three times
three<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.789> equals<00:00:45.079> twenty-seven<00:00:46.079> cubes<00:00:46.440> if

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
three which equals twenty-seven cubes if

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.830 
three which equals twenty-seven cubes if
we<00:00:47.160> break<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.579> out<00:00:47.820> we<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.239> see<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.750> we

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
we break this out we can see that we

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.970 
we break this out we can see that we
have<00:00:49.020> three<00:00:49.530> rows<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.460> nine<00:00:51.059> cubes<00:00:51.539> each<00:00:51.980> nine

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
have three rows of nine cubes each nine

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.340 
have three rows of nine cubes each nine
plus<00:00:53.250> nine<00:00:53.309> plus<00:00:53.730> nine<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.600> also<00:00:54.840> equal<00:00:55.320> to

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
plus nine plus nine is also equal to

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.950 
plus nine plus nine is also equal to
twenty-seven<00:00:56.219> cubic<00:00:56.370> inches<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.809> this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
twenty-seven cubic inches with this

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.990 
twenty-seven cubic inches with this
understanding<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.829> volume<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.670> see<00:00:59.850> how

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
understanding of volume we can see how

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.180 
understanding of volume we can see how
it<00:01:00.120> applies<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.480> car<00:01:01.020> audio<00:01:01.350> when<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.039> are

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it applies to car audio when we are

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.250 
it applies to car audio when we are
measuring<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> car<00:01:03.059> audio<00:01:03.390> enclosure<00:01:03.809> we

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
measuring for a car audio enclosure we

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.410 
measuring for a car audio enclosure we
want<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> measure<00:01:04.739> our<00:01:05.010> width<00:01:05.400> our<00:01:05.610> depth<00:01:06.119> and

want to measure our width our depth and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.690 
want to measure our width our depth and
our<00:01:06.750> height<00:01:07.020> within<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.799> vehicle<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.520> our

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
our height within the vehicle for our

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.609 
our height within the vehicle for our
first<00:01:09.000> example<00:01:09.600> let's<00:01:09.869> say<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.200> measured

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
first example let's say that we measured

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.219 
first example let's say that we measured
a<00:01:10.710> width<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.100> 36<00:01:11.700> inches<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.330> depth<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.840> 18

inches and a height of 15 inches now

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.560 
inches and a height of 15 inches now
let's<00:01:16.140> say<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.830> our<00:01:17.040> box<00:01:17.310> design<00:01:17.790> has<00:01:18.509> a

requirement of being two cubic feet of
air<00:01:21.659> volume<00:01:22.080> well<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.890> means<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.220> we'll

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
air volume well that means that we'll

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.460 
air volume well that means that we'll
need<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> pick<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> variable<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.290> can

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
need to pick a variable so that we can

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.950 
need to pick a variable so that we can
control<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.009> actual<00:01:26.549> volume<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> box<00:01:27.270> so

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
control the actual volume of the box so

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.050 
control the actual volume of the box so
let's<00:01:27.990> say<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.710> our<00:01:28.770> height<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.340> 15<00:01:29.759> inches

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
let's say that our height of 15 inches

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.480 
let's say that our height of 15 inches
is<00:01:30.360> unknown<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:31.290> begin<00:01:31.619> sketching<00:01:31.920> out<00:01:32.250> our

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490

is unknown we begin sketching out our
available<00:01:32.909> rooms<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.689> can<00:01:33.840> determine

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
available rooms that we can determine

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.620 
available rooms that we can determine
the<00:01:34.650> variable<00:01:35.250> height<00:01:35.460> an<00:01:35.670> important<00:01:36.329> number

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the variable height an important number

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.390 
the variable height an important number
for<00:01:36.659> us<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.140> remember<00:01:37.439> here<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> United

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
for us to remember here in the United

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.819 
for us to remember here in the United
States<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:40.220> 1728<00:01:41.220> that's<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.970> magic<00:01:42.509> number

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
States is 1728 that's the magic number

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.410 
States is 1728 that's the magic number
actually<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.130> how<00:01:44.280> many<00:01:44.340> cubic<00:01:44.790> inches<00:01:45.119> are

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
actually it's how many cubic inches are

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.069 
actually it's how many cubic inches are
in<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.689> cubic<00:01:46.020> foot<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.829> 12<00:01:47.189> by<00:01:47.340> 12<00:01:47.610> by<00:01:47.850> 12<00:01:48.180> so

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
in a cubic foot it's 12 by 12 by 12 so

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.899 
in a cubic foot it's 12 by 12 by 12 so
we're<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.380> use<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.040> determine<00:01:50.369> how

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
we're going to use this to determine how

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.450 
we're going to use this to determine how
many<00:01:51.149> cubic<00:01:51.509> inches<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.320> need<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.280> our

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
many cubic inches we need to have our

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.999 
many cubic inches we need to have our
goal<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.970> two<00:01:54.299> cubic<00:01:54.720> feet<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.619> simply

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
goal of two cubic feet so we simply

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.139 
goal of two cubic feet so we simply
multiply<00:01:56.280> two<00:01:57.270> times<00:01:58.340> 1728<00:01:59.340> which<00:01:59.759> gives<00:02:00.000> us

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
multiply two times 1728 which gives us

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.429 
multiply two times 1728 which gives us
three<00:02:00.479> thousand<00:02:00.899> four<00:02:01.079> hundred<00:02:01.200> and

for<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.869> enclosure<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.070> now<00:02:05.189> use<00:02:05.219> simple

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
for this enclosure we can now use simple

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.160 
for this enclosure we can now use simple
algebra<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.540> divide<00:02:07.670> 3456<00:02:08.670> by<00:02:09.060> 18<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.840> then

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
algebra and divide 3456 by 18 and then

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.070 
algebra and divide 3456 by 18 and then
divide<00:02:10.470> by<00:02:10.500> 36<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.940> find<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.540> variable

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
divide by 36 to find that variable

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.370 
divide by 36 to find that variable

now<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.400> obvious<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:17.850> 5.3<00:02:18.780> inches<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.380> not

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
now it's obvious that 5.3 inches is not

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.070 
now it's obvious that 5.3 inches is not
