00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
know where the swamp went and I don't

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.880 
know where the swamp went and I don't
care<00:02:31.980> their<00:02:32.190> message<00:02:32.519> box<00:02:33.170> um<00:02:34.170> there's<00:02:34.769> this

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
care their message box um there's this

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.410 
care their message box um there's this
guy<00:02:35.340> who's<00:02:35.519> super<00:02:36.060> annoying<00:02:36.299> I<00:02:38.420> honestly

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
guy who's super annoying I honestly

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.360 
guy who's super annoying I honestly
don't<00:02:40.200> know<00:02:40.790> what<00:02:41.790> else<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.420> do<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.370> think

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
don't know what else to do I think

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.190 
don't know what else to do I think
you're<00:02:44.489> over<00:02:44.790> world<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.209> broken<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.840> i<00:02:45.930> think

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
you're over world is broken and i think

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.070 
you're over world is broken and i think
that<00:02:46.860> i<00:02:47.160> am<00:02:47.670> done<00:02:48.000> moderating<00:02:48.569> this<00:02:48.720> because

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
that i am done moderating this because

00:02:49.080 --> 00:03:01.360 
that i am done moderating this because
there's<00:02:49.650> nothing<00:02:50.040> else<00:02:50.870> here<00:02:53.510> stupid<00:02:54.510> Chuck

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.380 

yep<00:03:03.260> well<00:03:04.260> then<00:03:04.500> oh<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:05.310> guess<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.849> get<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.060> die<00:03:06.329> in

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
yep well then oh I guess I get to die in

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.160 
yep well then oh I guess I get to die in
a<00:03:06.540> hilarious<00:03:07.350> way<00:03:07.590> oh<00:03:08.239> no<00:03:09.239> I<00:03:09.269> ran<00:03:09.840> into<00:03:10.140> a

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
a hilarious way oh no I ran into a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:21.379 
a hilarious way oh no I ran into a
muncher<00:03:15.470> hmm<00:03:16.470> yeah<00:03:17.420> pretty<00:03:18.420> sure<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:21.090> exit

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
muncher hmm yeah pretty sure the exit

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.870 
muncher hmm yeah pretty sure the exit
one<00:03:21.540> more<00:03:21.720> time<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:21.959> guess<00:03:22.639> double<00:03:23.639> check<00:03:23.850> and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
one more time I guess double check and

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.210 
one more time I guess double check and
there's<00:03:24.180> another<00:03:24.389> thing<00:03:24.680> even<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.859> exit

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
there's another thing even if the exit

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.660 
there's another thing even if the exit
did<00:03:26.370> work<00:03:26.579> properly<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.739> like<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.950> know<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.549> know

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
did work properly and like I know I know

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.009 
did work properly and like I know I know
it's<00:03:29.940> going<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.180> be<00:03:30.239> you're<00:03:30.420> like<00:03:30.540> really<00:03:30.720> hard

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
it's going to be you're like really hard

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.660 
it's going to be you're like really hard
to<00:03:31.470> have<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:31.709> happen<00:03:31.769> let's<00:03:32.519> say

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
to have this happen let's say

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.479 
to have this happen let's say
accidentally<00:03:33.329> just<00:03:33.540> oh<00:03:33.780> no<00:03:34.769> there<00:03:35.069> goes<00:03:35.100> my

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
accidentally just oh no there goes my

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.170 
accidentally just oh no there goes my
piece<00:03:35.700> which<00:03:36.709> then<00:03:37.709> I'd<00:03:37.859> be<00:03:37.980> stuck<00:03:38.220> here<00:03:38.250> and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
piece which then I'd be stuck here and

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.970 
piece which then I'd be stuck here and
I'd<00:03:39.690> have<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.019> die<00:03:40.170> because<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.650> don't<00:03:40.889> have

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
I'd have to die because you don't have

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:51.710 
I'd have to die because you don't have
any<00:03:41.370> reset<00:03:41.880> pipes<00:03:45.049> yeah<00:03:46.049> so<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.690> I

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
any reset pipes yeah so that is that I

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.430 
any reset pipes yeah so that is that I
guess<00:03:52.109> there's<00:03:52.620> nothing<00:03:52.889> else<00:03:53.160> here<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:55.260> yeah

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
guess there's nothing else here so yeah

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.890 
guess there's nothing else here so yeah
you're<00:03:55.709> going<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:55.920> need<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.250> fix<00:03:57.209> like<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.510> lot

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
you're going to need to fix like a lot

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.390 
you're going to need to fix like a lot
of<00:03:58.049> stuff<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.380> mean<00:03:58.530> personally<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.069> think<00:03:59.160> it'd

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
of stuff I mean personally I think it'd

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.050 
of stuff I mean personally I think it'd
be<00:03:59.430> easier<00:03:59.849> if<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.030> just<00:04:00.060> started<00:04:00.569> over<00:04:02.030> or<00:04:03.030> I

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
be easier if you just started over or I

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.699 
be easier if you just started over or I
guess<00:04:03.599> I<00:04:03.870> guess<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.139> could<00:04:04.170> technically

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
guess I guess you could technically

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.160 
guess I guess you could technically
submit<00:04:05.130> this<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.609> Kaiser<00:04:05.819> thing<00:04:06.630> but<00:04:06.989> it's

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
submit this to the Kaiser thing but it's

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.210 
submit this to the Kaiser thing but it's
not<00:04:07.319> really<00:04:07.530> cause<00:04:07.829> oh<00:04:08.040> it's<00:04:08.250> mostly<00:04:08.849> just

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
not really cause oh it's mostly just

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:18.310 
not really cause oh it's mostly just
bad<00:04:10.900> but<00:04:13.210> anyways<00:04:16.030> yeah<00:04:17.030> a<00:04:17.480> lot<00:04:17.959> of<00:04:18.110> stuff<00:04:18.260> you

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
bad but anyways yeah a lot of stuff you

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.599 
bad but anyways yeah a lot of stuff you
need<00:04:18.440> effects<00:04:18.709> see<00:04:18.950> if<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.070> can<00:04:19.220> list<00:04:19.370> them<00:04:19.519> all
