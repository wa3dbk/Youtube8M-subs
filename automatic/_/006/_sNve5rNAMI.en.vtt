picture itself and the only way to get
good<00:00:08.189> sound<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.940> get<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.179> microphone<00:00:09.630> as

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
good sound is to get the microphone as

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.169 
good sound is to get the microphone as
close<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.530> talent<00:00:10.860> as<00:00:10.980> possible<00:00:11.490> however

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
close to the talent as possible however

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.339 
close to the talent as possible however
there<00:00:12.420> are<00:00:12.509> times<00:00:12.630> when<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:12.990> don't<00:00:13.170> want<00:00:13.320> to

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
there are times when you don't want to

there are times when you don't want to
see<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.650> microphone<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.370> today<00:00:14.700> we're

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
see the microphone and so today we're

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.930 
see the microphone and so today we're
going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.210> talk<00:00:15.420> about<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.839> dark<00:00:16.049> art<00:00:16.260> of

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940

concealing microphones there are a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.050 
concealing microphones there are a
couple<00:00:26.039> places<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.730> could<00:00:26.849> hide<00:00:27.029> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
to be concerned about is high frequency

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.010 
to be concerned about is high frequency
fall-off<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.510> place<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> microphone

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
bit of strain relief to your cables you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.770 
bit of strain relief to your cables you
never<00:00:50.760> want<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.239> cable<00:00:51.600> that's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
never want to have a cable that's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.650 
never want to have a cable that's
perfectly<00:00:52.379> taut<00:00:53.300> essentially<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.510> want

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
perfectly taut essentially what you want

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.939 
perfectly taut essentially what you want
to<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.930> make<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.320> circle<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
to do is make a little circle with the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.470 
to do is make a little circle with the
cable<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:56.640> tape<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.000> together<00:00:57.120> before

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
cable and then tape it together before

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.630 
cable and then tape it together before
you<00:00:57.780> attach<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.410> your<00:00:58.440> talent<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.309> adds<00:00:59.520> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
you attach it to your talent this adds a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.459 
you attach it to your talent this adds a
little<00:00:59.760> bit<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.030> flexibility<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.780> slack<00:01:01.140> so

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
little bit of flexibility and slack so

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.720 
little bit of flexibility and slack so
that<00:01:01.590> when<00:01:01.710> your<00:01:01.829> talent<00:01:02.129> walks<00:01:02.280> around<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that when your talent walks around the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:13.070 
that when your talent walks around the
cable<00:01:03.120> doesn't<00:01:03.239> pull<00:01:03.480> off

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.970 

one<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.260> first<00:01:14.410> things<00:01:14.680> you're<00:01:14.830> going<00:01:14.920> to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
one of the first things you're going to

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.010 
one of the first things you're going to
run<00:01:15.160> into<00:01:15.490> is<00:01:15.670> clothing<00:01:16.210> rustle<00:01:16.540> or<00:01:16.660> the<00:01:16.780> sound

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
run into is clothing rustle or the sound

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.170 
run into is clothing rustle or the sound
that<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.320> cloth<00:01:17.560> makes<00:01:17.920> as<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.520> rubs<00:01:18.790> against

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
that the cloth makes as it rubs against

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.930 
that the cloth makes as it rubs against
the<00:01:19.240> microphone<00:01:19.750> now<00:01:20.350> generally<00:01:21.040> wools<00:01:21.550> and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
the microphone now generally wools and

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.600 
the microphone now generally wools and
cotton<00:01:22.600> are<00:01:22.780> considered<00:01:23.410> least<00:01:23.740> noisy<00:01:24.280> of<00:01:24.430> the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
cotton are considered least noisy of the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.150 
cotton are considered least noisy of the
fabrics<00:01:25.120> whereas<00:01:25.540> synthetic<00:01:26.500> fibers<00:01:26.890> and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
fabrics whereas synthetic fibers and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.040 
fabrics whereas synthetic fibers and
silks<00:01:27.580> are<00:01:27.730> extremely<00:01:28.240> noisy<00:01:28.360> so<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.840> want<00:01:28.990> to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
silks are extremely noisy so you want to

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.020 
silks are extremely noisy so you want to
minimize<00:01:29.170> that<00:01:29.650> a<00:01:32.460> clever<00:01:33.460> way<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.640> minimize

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
minimize that a clever way to minimize

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.910 
minimize that a clever way to minimize
clothing<00:01:34.360> rustle<00:01:34.840> is<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.110> use<00:01:35.230> moleskin

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
clothing rustle is to use moleskin

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.590 
clothing rustle is to use moleskin
essentially<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.730> want<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:36.940> cut<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.120> thin<00:01:37.450> strip

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
essentially you want to cut a thin strip

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.720 
essentially you want to cut a thin strip
off<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.050> piece<00:01:38.650> of<00:01:38.800> Mull<00:01:38.950> skin<00:01:39.190> and<00:01:39.340> wrap<00:01:39.580> it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
off a piece of Mull skin and wrap it

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.640 
off a piece of Mull skin and wrap it
around<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.060> microphone<00:01:40.540> element<00:01:40.720> before<00:01:41.530> you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
around the microphone element before you

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.950 
around the microphone element before you
place<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.160> on<00:01:42.280> your<00:01:42.370> talent<00:01:43.120> this<00:01:43.480> adds<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:43.840> very
