00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 equal to boys and girls I'm robbie and 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.330
 here I am again with all of you and 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.490
 welcome to a new video of gta 5 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.480
 the one that I 'm going to show you a new one 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.150
 method since the previous one they have 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.519
 patched with infinite money with the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.859
 help from a friend yes without waiting for 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.880
 agreement so inside what fits is the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.340
 best trick of money there 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.199
 currently in version 1.16 that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.060
 took advantage of let's say I tell you that the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.160
 take advantage we have seen you take advantage 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.960
 because the tricks already know that 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.029
 lately they come last as long 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.470
 one or two days not then with this tube 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.820
 recorded last night with danny red that 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.870
 good that is not with your username 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.790
 usual because he is because he is 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.469
 planned already I tell you I was here 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.329
 doing it with me not then 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.399
 we need is a bread I recommend you 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.629
 be somewhat tuned to the maximum and because 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.600
 a bit and not one of the good is also worth 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.489
 with one time but the both can not be 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.020
 have enough more than once so 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.280
 they are not going to give more money because with 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.170
 this trick what will give us money 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.789
 is with the modifications that the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.250
 agreement vehicle that is to say let's 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.500
 go up and replace with one side and revel and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.210
 then the value that the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.190
 Karen revealed one hour at the time of 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.930
 sell then the duplicate car goes to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.060
 be for the value of the modifications 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.690
 I hope you understand me but 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.670
 good 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.350
 you take a duck and you have it to the maximum value 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.300
 the next thing we have to do is go 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.620
 to what was the toolbox and 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.480
 move it that can be moved without any 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.250
 kind of problem up the bread yo 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.470
 I recommend that you be in that position of 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.650
 agreement and start with the trick of 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.670
 by itself as I say this can be done without 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.410
 no kind of lion should do anything 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.290
 special very well and what are you doing 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.200
 great just had to put that put 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.090
 I just had to put it now 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.410
 just once once the camera 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.450
 while in this position we are going to 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.500
 go here to buy a car buy it 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.540
 in quotes simply agree 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.590
 We need to have two garages worth it 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.480
 totally essential that we have 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.830
 two for two garages because what we're going 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.840
 to do is to do as we're going to 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.490
 buy a car and just when 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.870
 demos to buy will ask us in what 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.760
 garage we want to get it in agreement 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.860
 then we do not accept or cancel 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.120
 we just go into stealth mode 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.710
 to do it quietly good at 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.000
 normal mode if I'm a lot more skillful 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.830
 analyze it normal good calmly 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.270
 no and just now you can see that 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.340
 we can move the vehicle without any 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.900
 kind of problem this requires a 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.190
 little bit of practice because to me good what 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.510
 I'm going to cut because I'm sleeping 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.130
 take it to the site simply 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.140
 let's leave here agree that is 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.450
 the passenger door very important the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.160
 The passenger door has to be 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.420
 next to what is the circulito this 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.550
 blue vehicle management 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.319
 we remove the very important box that the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.209
 part more because sometimes it gives problems 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.519
 so just once done here 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.200
 close we have to be able to open the door 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.910
 of the passenger door vehicle 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.379
 we just cancel the menu and then 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.239
 we have to do now very simple is 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.250
 buy a rebel karim according to 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.200
 televisa you give the phone here Get off 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.489
 transportation in the super car is point with 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.260
 since down we bought the face and revel 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.760
 rusty is worth three thousand dollars 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.290
 that 's a pretty insignificant thing 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.569
 with the child that we are going to get we are going 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.310
 to get about two hundred thousand and peak 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.590
 if we have the point completely 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.420
 tuned and simply what we choose is 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.910
 any other vehicle that we go to 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.140
 want to lose I'm going to choose the lyrh 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.610
 8 that is there in the bottom of agreement 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.140
 then what we are going to have to do 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.930
 then once we have bought 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.190
 the karim revel is to open the door of the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.190
 copilot better be me here thinking 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.209
 that the car is the one that I'm going to replace and 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.310
 we just have to do it 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.480
 open the passenger door as I say and 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.980
 keep it open in agreement 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.630
 we just open it to 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.880
 triangle or wing and in the event that 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.860
 your 60 we move quickly 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.680
 so we can keep the door 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.299
 open copilot door open 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.319
 it's worth at that moment we tell our 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.120
 friend that simply 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.439
 in the corner in what is the corner 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.549
 between the door and the car and stay 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.109
 there agree that I do not advance much 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.980
 because if you move forward you see that the 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.659
 car what we have to do is 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.859
 just give the triangle a 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.359
 moment we are not sitting down to give the 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.499
 right cross the to the arrow to the 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.870
 right and so it's putting it up to 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:35.760
 left to activate what is 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.099
 the interaction menu of the vehicles 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.049
 ok then we just now look 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.639
 the point that was around here did not 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.579
 they found was here we marked the 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.169
 point and we mark the have the pro in the 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.549
 carling revel forgiveness for month we mark 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.280
 the reverse carling and as you see has been 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.139
 duplicate of agreement and due to the clip of 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.370
 agreement we tell the friend to leave 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.810
 because we are going to appear outside the 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.280
 vehicle we tell the friend that 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.930
 apart because the trick is done and 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.060
 we get very important is very 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.590
 important to go through the door of the 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.269
 copilot if not metes out the door 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.769
 of the co-pilot as the car goes to 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.819
 disappear according to the book is not going 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.530
 to produce then you can not duplicate 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.169
 once it has not been committed there in the background 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.849
 you are watching on the duplicate screen 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.799
 we simply reverse or march 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.780
 go ahead and that's it, we're just going 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.970
 to the saints put to sell the car 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.070
 that we just duplicated then as 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.750
 I say what more forgiveness what we are going to 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.669
 sell are the modifications you have 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.810
 the vehicle I insist can be done with 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.220
 The bird can be made with any 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.680
 vehicle even with vehicles 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.510
 or simply to tune everything 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.650
 you can then those improvements those 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.330
 modifications are those that we are going to 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.860
 sell in the vehicle that we have 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.470
 duplicated in this case is the one that 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.000
 is right next to the wheel of the 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.170
 circuit this blue and then 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.430
 simply because as I say we are going to 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.440
 the saints just nor are we going to be able 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.030
 sell them without waiting without having to 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.410
 wait for the 45 minutes that sometimes stop 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.300
 in the other tricks we had 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.520
 previously the truth that is a toucan 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.050
 although they will give us the whole pill 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.270
 that they were giving us earlier with 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.350
 Previous tricks then good for now 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.760
 it's the best we have so we have to 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.740
 take advantage of it because the truth 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.450
 the tlc is very expensive here buy a lot 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.100
 of things and how I did not get another say a 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.960
 lots of expensive things because we are not going to 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.490
 can buy it in guys as I say 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.930
 this has been the trick yes I hope that you 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.730
 has liked it is invoked and comment 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.620
 leave down yours and your gamer 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.540
 xbox 360 tactic to look for people 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.120
 to help you do the trick and nothing 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.120
 new next video goodbye guys
