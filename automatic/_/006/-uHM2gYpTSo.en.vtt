 he will be worried about making a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.240
 rice in making another carbohydrate to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.460
 make this recipe we will 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.619
 need potato balls or potatoes 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.180
 lollipop here has two pounds 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.779
 We'll need some cottage cheese too . 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.289
 salt thick scent green chives cream 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.199
 milk and Parmesan cheese has to be the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.940
 freshly grated parmesan cheese is another 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.540
 talk and that's how we're going to do it 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.600
 on here 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.390
 this recipe has two steps a part 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.670
 it is in the oven and the other step is 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.739
 sauce is that you will play on top of the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.410
 potato will get coarse salt will not 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.170
 exaggerating in my will not exaggerate is to give 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.960
 a small lined in the bottom of your 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.750
 chair I'm doing here with this 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.750
 glass platter but you can do 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.180
 with a baking pan also quiet then 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.219
 Oh, how you doing, you're not going to exaggerate the salt. 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.920
 There are two sequences. 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.170
 potato possibilities or this one 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.670
 glorious potato ball or potato 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.720
 lollipop even that's what we're going 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.060
 make our recipe 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.799
 but another possibility is to make the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.420
 traditional english potato 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.909
 You can do with it, too. 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.659
 cut in half and there you have the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.600
 potato 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.380
 in this way only in the way 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.130
 My, then you fill in with this 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.680
 potato 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.549
 We're going to make the potato here. 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.549
 lollipop right let's cover it here 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.490
 Lollipop potatoes have people who even cut 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.810
 cut lollipop potatoes in half to 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.090
 make this recipe 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.310
 so the staff is here the potato was the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 refractory crossbar is surprising that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.869
 is in shell with that hot potato there 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.850
 I'm fine, she was cleaned before 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.130
 You have to be careful because she's going to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.930
 to be consumed so a shell looks cool 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.360
 get crispy face nice 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.030
 now we will prepare she would do 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.310
 the fire will put the role of video're 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.049
 this potato will stay in the oven more or 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.700
 less 40 50 minutes covered nice like that 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.300
 they go to the oven, they are already 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.569
 very hot and let's put our 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.980
 glorious potato here and the potato will stay 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.390
 in the oven about half an hour 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.519
 I just wanted to say something to you. 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.280
 potato is roasting as it is now 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.769
 in which she tested and saw that she 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.069
 It's almost ready so it's time to do 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.510
 Potato sauce creamy beauty ball 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.640
 What we'll need for this will 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.310
 make the sauce goes stove despite a 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.700
 and I'll need those 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.950
 ingredients that are here to buy there 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.709
 to make the wonderful sensational 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.950
 hyper creamy potato dumpling sauce 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.480
 creamy 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.030
 first place the ingredients in the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.849
 pot or putting curd first 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.489
 this panela warms up really fast 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.430
 this stainless steel pan and get very warm 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.860
 fast will stick and can burn all your 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.599
 now soft then connect the people and I will 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.319
 put the sour cream to give a 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:14.150
 reduced in that curd or because its 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.200
 low fire now I'll add 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.810
 pressure 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.090
 I'll want some more truck and 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.079
 roll it on time 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:29.540
 so I think the parmesan is that 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:34.350
 It gives the flavor in the tech story. 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:38.130
 harmonize here and now I'm going to put the 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:41.579
 our green onion smells like it is 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:46.500
 well diluted a little more to 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.940
 still aim at being good not to stick 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.639
 How do you know your sauce is? 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.470

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:08.639

 to mount the dish removes the excess salt is 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.580
