00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.549
 Welcome to another test of 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 www handy.de 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.900
 I'll show you another clock 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.240
 which is already one 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.369
 you are not much older here that is 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.920
 the huawei interview it 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.410
 or as once whatever her 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.540
 want to call it something special 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.370
 this device we have a Huawei device 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.350
 with windows phone 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.390
 Let 's take a look at it I take it 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.989
 once out of the package once 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.499
 opened and you can see that rest 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.019
 it looks like that and I find something 

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:42.120
 First of all, you notice it especially when you are 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.109
 look at the price the device costs 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.420
 209 euros 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.519
 It looks fancier than others 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.300
 Huawei devices I have such a handle 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.789
 had and settlers and also a little bit 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.760
 still better processed anyway 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.789
 Of course we have plastic here 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.889
 yes you can see that but also dull 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.470
 black looks very good 

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:07.380
 find out yes windows 8 we have 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.310
 Here for measurements we have 125 millimeters 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.470
 times 64 mm x 10 millimeters thickest 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.750
 So do not be too fat and not yet 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.670
 so big is good in the hand we see 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.240
 can not be so easy from the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.650
 hand thanks to this rubberized surface 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.040
 and now if it looks from above 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.460
 then we'll see what we have here the 35 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.920
 mm jack for earphones of your choice then 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.450
 Here we have the other switch off 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.450
 on the right side we find the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.760
 quick start buttons the camera down the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.810
 micro usb input left the 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.450
 volume rocker we have the here 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.150
 Speakers a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.720
 led light front a front camera we 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.330
 can see and three buttons down here 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.280
 so and then we just look mine 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.740
 scope of delivery what is here with 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.090
 this device we have headphones 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:08.039
 in the scope of delivery with 3.5 mm jack 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.250
 of course the data cable micro usb 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.540
 USB to the whole with your computer too 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.480
 connect 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.390
 load music on it and so on or 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.060
 to charge the whole at the socket 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.719
 here with this adapter then we have 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.329
 Here is a battery that is a lithium ion 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:29.760
 1950 milliamp battery and one 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.220
 few instructions so if you have the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.730
 want to use battery then that is one 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.859
 little a formula 1 here in the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.760
 slit there you have to draw a bit 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.349
 So , actually, it's in a good mood 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.569
 somehow you think you 're traveling the thing 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.549
 right down here comes the sim card 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.970
 purely then you have here the entrance for 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.909
 the micro sd card and above you bet 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.000
 then just put the battery on it 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.709
 battery cover on it again and the device 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.870
 is ready to start now 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.209
 I already told you it costs 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.930
 209 euro is actually a decent one 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.540
 Price not so expensive for that one here 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.220
 little something is included 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.870
 I will tell you in the following 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.159
 following share the video tests 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.949
 of course, the operation more accurate 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.229
 of course then show how good 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.970
 the camera is what you play on 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:23.639
 could play and how to surf in the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:28.500
 internet works the whole weighs 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:30.959
 now with battery 120 grams is not synonymous 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.930
 so hard in my opinion as says 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.150
 is good in the hand first time purely 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.379
 Outwardly a great device we are 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.379
 curious how it goes on
