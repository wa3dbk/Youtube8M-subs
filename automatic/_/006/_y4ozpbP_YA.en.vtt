CSX wheels the mainly for outdoors they

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.160 
CSX wheels the mainly for outdoors they
say<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.739> on<00:03:14.920> them<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:16.239> two<00:03:16.420> back<00:03:16.630> ones<00:03:16.959> right

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
say that on them the two back ones right

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.630 
say that on them the two back ones right
here<00:03:17.200> are<00:03:18.570> 80<00:03:19.570> millimeter<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:21.190> front<00:03:21.459> ones

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
here are 80 millimeter and to front ones

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.770 
here are 80 millimeter and to front ones
are<00:03:21.820> 76<00:03:22.390> millimeter<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:23.440> compensate<00:03:24.010> with<00:03:24.250> the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
are 76 millimeter to compensate with the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.500 
are 76 millimeter to compensate with the
high/low<00:03:26.190> because<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.310> heel<00:03:27.489> part<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.970> up

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
high/low because the heel part is up

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.280 
high/low because the heel part is up
higher<00:03:28.810> than<00:03:29.200> what<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.070> told<00:03:30.220> should<00:03:30.489> be<00:03:31.290> so

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
higher than what you told should be so

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.110 
higher than what you told should be so
yes<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.010> have<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.280> bigger<00:03:33.489> wheel<00:03:33.670> in<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:33.970> back

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
yes I have a bigger wheel in the back

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.600 
yes I have a bigger wheel in the back
and<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:34.989> small<00:03:35.500> way<00:03:35.680> in<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.890> front<00:03:38.610> these

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
and a small way in the front these

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.870 
and a small way in the front these
wheels<00:03:40.000> have<00:03:40.590> mission<00:03:41.590> ABEC<00:03:42.010> 5<00:03:42.040> bearings<00:03:42.670> in

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
wheels have mission ABEC 5 bearings in

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.520 
wheels have mission ABEC 5 bearings in
them<00:03:43.739> which<00:03:44.739> give<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.549> some<00:03:46.269> speed<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:47.260> can't

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
them which give you some speed you can't

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.810 
them which give you some speed you can't
I<00:03:47.680> need<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:47.920> clean<00:03:48.190> them<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:49.950> they<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:50.980> little

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
I need to clean them so they a little

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.420 
I need to clean them so they a little
bit<00:03:51.940> slow<00:03:52.180> now<00:03:53.010> well

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
bit slow now well

I'm not the pretty strong they have the

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.699 
I'm not the pretty strong they have the
tracks<00:03:58.459> East<00:03:58.730> are<00:03:59.000> punched<00:03:59.810> in<00:04:00.790> wood<00:04:01.790> right

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
tracks East are punched in wood right

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.819 
tracks East are punched in wood right
yeah<00:04:04.090> punched<00:04:05.090> in<00:04:05.799> on<00:04:06.799> each<00:04:07.129> side<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:08.829> the

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
yeah punched in on each side and the

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.009 
yeah punched in on each side and the
wheels<00:04:10.069> oh<00:04:12.939> yeah<00:04:13.970> screws<00:04:14.390> that<00:04:14.569> goes<00:04:14.750> through

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
wheels oh yeah screws that goes through

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.140 
wheels oh yeah screws that goes through
the<00:04:15.079> middle<00:04:15.349> of<00:04:15.409> them<00:04:15.590> for<00:04:15.920> each<00:04:15.950> one<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.729> they

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
the middle of them for each one and they

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.949 
the middle of them for each one and they
give<00:04:17.329> me<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.479> special<00:04:17.900> tool<00:04:18.579> that<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:20.720> can<00:04:20.900> use

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
give me a special tool that you can use

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.800 
give me a special tool that you can use
to<00:04:21.320> take<00:04:21.500> apart<00:04:21.829> but<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:23.090> don't<00:04:23.419> know<00:04:23.509> mine<00:04:23.780> is

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
to take apart but I don't know mine is

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.150 
to take apart but I don't know mine is
right<00:04:24.199> now<00:04:24.350> so<00:04:25.340> it's<00:04:25.789> kind<00:04:26.000> of<00:04:26.030> hard<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.270> do

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
right now so it's kind of hard to do

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.360 
right now so it's kind of hard to do
other<00:04:28.160> than<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.780> well<00:04:29.780> these<00:04:30.229> are<00:04:31.070> some

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
other than that well these are some

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.370 
other than that well these are some
really<00:04:31.550> nice<00:04:31.789> caper<00:04:32.389> beep<00:04:32.600> speaks<00:04:33.080> for

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
really nice caper beep speaks for

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.770 
really nice caper beep speaks for
beginners<00:04:34.000> I<00:04:35.199> paid<00:04:36.199> I<00:04:36.560> think<00:04:37.479> $150<00:04:38.479> at<00:04:38.630> the

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
beginners I paid I think $150 at the

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.330 
beginners I paid I think $150 at the
time<00:04:38.990> but<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:39.650> can<00:04:39.830> get<00:04:39.979> them<00:04:40.160> for<00:04:40.280> cheaper

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
time but you can get them for cheaper

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.370 
time but you can get them for cheaper
now<00:04:40.760> because<00:04:41.240> they're<00:04:42.160> older<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:44.050> not<00:04:45.050> top<00:04:45.350> of

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
now because they're older and not top of

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.210 
now because they're older and not top of
the<00:04:45.500> line<00:04:45.910> from<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.419> axiom<00:04:47.960> series<00:04:48.380> and<00:04:48.650> now

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
the line from the axiom series and now

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.719 
the line from the axiom series and now
mission<00:04:49.789> has<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:49.940> new<00:04:50.240> series<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:50.690> came<00:04:51.050> out

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
mission has a new series that came out

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.330 
mission has a new series that came out
which<00:04:52.729> are<00:04:52.880> more<00:04:53.060> expensive<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.750> everything

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
which are more expensive and everything

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.980 
which are more expensive and everything
I<00:04:55.340> ordered<00:04:56.240> mine<00:04:56.389> from<00:04:56.630> Dick's<00:04:56.870> Sporting

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
I ordered mine from Dick's Sporting

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.540 
I ordered mine from Dick's Sporting
Goods<00:04:57.320> and<00:04:58.000> they<00:04:59.740> seemed<00:05:00.740> more<00:05:00.860> good<00:05:01.220> they

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550
