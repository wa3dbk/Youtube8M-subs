00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.090
 I can give you a little today 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.900
 further guest comments on the channel 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.480
 from the lay or stay hdx 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.340
 welcome and maybe first 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.410
 said a big thank you if I am 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.900
 you that I am here a little 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.279
 So there are 800 subscribers 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.750
 not very much, but I mean 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.570
 I'm just happy that I'm away from 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.360
 may introduce new audience and come 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.840
 then there directly to me i am the xbox 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.020
 or the body and have been doing it for nine 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.260
 months I believe on youtube videos yes 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.149
 But nine months have to be that way 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.270
 then also directly come too easy 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.440
 my topic and i would like to be in 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.649
 this video about my my mine yes 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.059
 tactics quasi give a few tactics tips 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.970
 how to successfully play black ops 2 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.119
 and how to successfully look 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.159
 abstract is good and that's where it starts 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.990
 Of course, first of all at the class 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.250
 however, I would like to be in this now 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.780
 video not go to class 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.310
 there is already a video on 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.640
 raymond kelly from whatever you like 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.170
 can look over classes or 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.030
 yuan classes can combine well and so on 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.320
 on and on and yes there could be 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 stop by just for the channel 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.770
 if you then the interested one 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.520
 Another very important point 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.220
 simply the point series because points 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.320
 series is important you have to do something 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.909
 best achieved because then it is 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.189
 really the most effective if you are 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.930
 for example, okay when you let go and 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.399
 if you are a student once 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.689
 okay but i mean when we go to 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.430
 Example of what I know plays on the 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.229
 panini and that only once later would like 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.159
 I prefer a little lore streak 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.119
 play and therefore I would be yours 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.950
 recommend 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.090
 depending on how good you are 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:10.190
 add matching points and so increase 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.180
 because a very good variant to 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.680
 low ones a little lower now 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.670
 shoot you play lemon of 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.580
 lightning strike resp 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.290
 she holds storm as everyone wants, so to speak 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.180
 and everyone can choose for themselves 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.070
 and then the tann hedi for what's up 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.810
 still for other variants so that is 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.330
 so in my opinion the most effective 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.790
 in lightning stroke recipients half as 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.690
 can then go up to 256 times 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.910
 kills like that 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.320
 the thalys are very strong anyway 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.060
 Of course, not immediately 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.620
 but it is rarely the case 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:47.040
 case 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:50.190
 and then what that actually is 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.370
 in my opinion the best low 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.340
 So you streak the one of the best 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.140
 Low stream tricks you can use 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.450
 can 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.540
 and yes for highstreet highstreet is 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.430
 My favorite, I say so the throne 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.350
 the orbital satellite and the roadster 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.270
 that is really that classic thing 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.760
 I often play when I'm right 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.050
 free so really high quotes 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.370
 ag is that then as in this video the 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.810
 swell the orbital science plos one 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.270
 then you can of course always like that 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.500
 you want the momentum through hundestaffel 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.900
 how great replace 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.820
 that should be left to each own 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.680
 but in my opinion it is tomorrow 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.110
 to the lock a pencil Judo right 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.770
 it is effective and good as well as great 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.200
 relatively good but lothar is always there 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:45.440
 and yes then the game is playing 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.960
 the game is there for you, so to speak 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.900
 the player asked himself depending on 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.280
 how the game played 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.520
 if you are more if you like something 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:04.800
 the more open the player 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.240
 if the player is the rest then it would 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.740
 I really recommend too 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.200
 correspondingly good weapon 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.860
 play and be offensive when you play 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.770
 the player he is rather defensive late 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.900
 you can always hold yourself back 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.420
 because, for example, playing a storm rifle 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.510
 sniper 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.270
 and there may also recently again 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.360
 Weapons then to come on killstreaks 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.310
 is there really in the black ops was 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.040
 a lot of variations as you stop next to 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.680
 The kills apply to come through 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.150
 for example, collect bookmarks by 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.800
 flags capture by dazzling as to 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.430
 example restrictions or search and 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.490
 destroy and that is really very 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.320
 very cool then because it is so 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.590
 some then still lost points 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.540
 because I own a stranger's hands 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.130
 heretical flag to heretical now 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.760
 for example, c of the enemies 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.620
 that will bring you 200 points and 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.290
 that is really so that has in part 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.350
 Of course, help further here 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.120
 corresponds purely by the kills on it 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.920
 come 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.980
 and yes the gameplay is over it 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.040
 was not there so long otherwise only 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.700
 just a few tips to say actually 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.940
 so far as I see here so I was 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.100
 do not realize now I would do it to everyone as well 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.000
 recommend 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:35.450
 rather than a city secondary or 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.490
 private and tactic grenades because easy 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.390
 to save and wildcards for 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.830
 extra horses 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.560
 I really have the best 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.160
 Experiences and then I say 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.110
 the agency 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.880
 Three people are doing well, I would be fine 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.820
 as I said extremely happy times if you 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.950
 could stop by and how 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.890
 said this video also weapons 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:58.930
 is located on a channel below 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.930
 his skin makes people feel good
