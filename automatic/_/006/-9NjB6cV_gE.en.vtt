00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
hair doesn't get very dry and I'd really

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.200 
hair doesn't get very dry and I'd really
use<00:00:42.840> pretty<00:00:43.140> moisturizing<00:00:43.739> conditioners<00:00:44.370> so

I don't usually do deep treatments but

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.850 
I don't usually do deep treatments but
that<00:00:48.450> doesn't<00:00:48.780> mean<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.140> shouldn't<00:00:49.620> i'm

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
that doesn't mean that I shouldn't i'm

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.319 
that doesn't mean that I shouldn't i'm
just<00:00:50.129> lazy<00:00:52.340> but<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.460> hair<00:00:53.640> has<00:00:53.789> been<00:00:53.969> feeling

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
just lazy but my hair has been feeling

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.689

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
kind of dry and tangley lately so i

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.889 
kind of dry and tangley lately so i
figured<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.059> was<00:00:57.149> time<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.570> deep<00:00:57.750> treatment

out of the length of my hair but it
really<00:05:59.370> get<00:05:59.550> it<00:05:59.610> out<00:05:59.700> at<00:05:59.820> the<00:05:59.940> top<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:00.810> I<00:06:01.050> could

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
really get it out at the top and I could

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.900 
really get it out at the top and I could
still<00:06:01.410> smell<00:06:01.590> it<00:06:01.740> while<00:06:02.010> drying<00:06:02.420> so<00:06:03.420> I<00:06:04.910> don't

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
still smell it while drying so I don't

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.490 
still smell it while drying so I don't
think<00:06:06.000> I<00:06:06.090> got<00:06:06.240> quite<00:06:06.510> all<00:06:06.660> about<00:06:06.960> but<00:06:07.140> making

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
think I got quite all about but making

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.040 
think I got quite all about but making
it<00:06:07.530> definitely<00:06:07.950> feels<00:06:08.070> lusher<00:06:08.880> and<00:06:09.240> more

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
it definitely feels lusher and more

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.710 
it definitely feels lusher and more
moisturize<00:06:10.560> um<00:06:11.010> it's<00:06:11.820> a<00:06:11.940> little<00:06:12.180> fly<00:06:12.510> way

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
moisturize um it's a little fly way

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.550 
moisturize um it's a little fly way
because<00:06:12.930> it<00:06:13.080> was<00:06:13.320> outside<00:06:13.650> and<00:06:14.190> it<00:06:14.400> was<00:06:14.550> Wendy

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
because it was outside and it was Wendy

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.990 
because it was outside and it was Wendy
but<00:06:16.560> i<00:06:16.590> think<00:06:16.860> i<00:06:16.980> will<00:06:17.100> definitely<00:06:17.490> add<00:06:17.790> this
