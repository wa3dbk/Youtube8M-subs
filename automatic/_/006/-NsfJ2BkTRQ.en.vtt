00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:49.620
 car to brake by the mind and that's it 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:01:06.870
 This truck is stopped here, it's all 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:09.720
 well, restful 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.200
 it's the guys who had already directed ii 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.170
 I think I'm a little crazy right because 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.370
 I 'm offensive, but I like camacho. 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.350
 of that force together 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.680
 is 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.530
 they do a lot in this city 6 - 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:32.140
 drivers and organs here is who made the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:34.360
 body has driver that required bk this 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.590
 was a regrettable is because the guy 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.409
 sixth rider / passenger gave signal 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.869
 nothing and is a reduced to join in the 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:48.850
 fourth beat serene so totally 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.500
 promoter knows there it's complicated but anyway 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.590
 these things aside 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.159
 It's people who had a mud slap I know 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.990
 what is having the car I do not know how to do and I will 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.060
 do what I think I know 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:08.050
 do that is addressed to commands 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.959
 enough question of so much is not 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:17.110
 Anything to take the sides here 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:18.040
 power 3d visualization mal reduction and 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.420
 really 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.400
 in the afternoon the buttons here turn to 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.989
 bride and the champion 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.060
 according to the panel is great / well worth the 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.920
 Are you looking for a steering wheel? 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:39.390
 wave of deco but here it fits 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.390
 on account and worth buying 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.909
 quietly 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.530
 you can control to have control of the 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.879
 cruise will not have the capital is 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.530
 owner is quiet too 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.870
 You went to just because he went to your 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.849
 province will be just a little bit he 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.849
 it accelerates a little bit and so it goes 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.400
 in a tournament that this way is a 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.300
 portal transports to the kitchen 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.050
 that chopstick accent was on the steering wheel 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:19.660
 very resistant to their level of death 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.660
 Durable bolatti is worth buying 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.740
 vote 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.020
 our forecast is that depending on the 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:31.070
 ground that was in our life 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.380
 here is a mistake of 20 br answers well 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.990
 something like that but you can 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.490
 control the settings of the apparent 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.490
 since they were left over from rolling 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.550
 the guys that's practically that's it 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.110
 I want you to see a little of how I 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.530
 trying to drive here I'm not 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.410
 learning a little but think of 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.789
 front and makes this deadline is 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:51.610
 to do the best in this moleque format 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:54.190
 beauty and that's it open in the sand 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.639
 with the intention that they speak Portuguese 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:01.740
 I counted on the luxury in staying for 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.740
 here he thinks and location
