00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.809 
berries were very interesting to look at
I<00:02:19.150> had<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:20.170> didn't<00:02:20.770> have<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.069> one<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.340> vibrant

grape I didn't have this on my list but

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.620 
grape I didn't have this on my list but
when<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:23.920> went<00:02:24.099> in<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.489> was<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.090> best<00:02:25.239> swatch

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
when I went in this was the best swatch

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.839 
when I went in this was the best swatch
on<00:02:25.930> me<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.590> think<00:02:27.130> they<00:02:27.220> were<00:02:27.310> interesting<00:02:27.730> they

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
on me I think they were interesting they

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.130 
on me I think they were interesting they
have<00:02:27.970> like<00:02:28.090> this<00:02:28.239> great<00:02:28.599> and<00:02:28.780> as<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.989> could

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
have like this great and as you could

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.470 
have like this great and as you could
see<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.590> goes<00:02:29.770> from<00:02:30.040> like<00:02:30.280> law<00:02:30.760> however<00:02:31.060> light

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
see it goes from like law however light

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.750 
see it goes from like law however light
to<00:02:31.660> dark<00:02:31.870> dark<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.319> light<00:02:32.459> very<00:02:33.459> very<00:02:33.640> pretty

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
to dark dark to light very very pretty

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.150 
to dark dark to light very very pretty
actually<00:02:34.689> um<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:36.159> I<00:02:36.189> think

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
actually um so I think

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.700 
actually um so I think
your<00:02:37.280> collector<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:38.030> items<00:02:38.480> this<00:02:39.050> will<00:02:39.230> be<00:02:39.350> one

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
your collector of items this will be one

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.080 
your collector of items this will be one
of<00:02:39.800> these<00:02:39.950> on<00:02:40.190> birds<00:02:40.400> would<00:02:40.490> be<00:02:40.610> great<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.940> have

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
of these on birds would be great to have

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.700 
of these on birds would be great to have
these<00:02:41.630> were<00:02:41.840> more<00:02:42.050> than<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.260> regular<00:02:42.410> brush

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
these were more than the regular brush

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.560 
these were more than the regular brush
but<00:02:43.010> blushes<00:02:43.580> though<00:02:43.700> these<00:02:43.790> are<00:02:43.930> $22<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.260> yeah

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
but blushes though these are $22 so yeah

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.240 
but blushes though these are $22 so yeah
so<00:02:47.570> that's<00:02:47.720> vibrant<00:02:48.140> great<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.920> other<00:02:49.070> one

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
so that's vibrant great the other one

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.490 
so that's vibrant great the other one
swatch<00:02:49.580> there<00:02:50.270> were<00:02:50.360> two<00:02:50.600> there<00:02:50.990> was<00:02:51.140> one<00:02:51.350> that

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
swatch there were two there was one that

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.870 
swatch there were two there was one that
was<00:02:51.560> I<00:02:51.650> think<00:02:51.770> right<00:02:52.070> Peter<00:02:52.430> knows<00:02:52.640> another

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.270 
was I think right Peter knows another
pink<00:02:53.210> one<00:02:53.390> azalea<00:02:54.170> something<00:02:54.740> but<00:02:55.190> they

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
pink one azalea something but they

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.560

high<00:03:21.260> hopes<00:03:21.410> for<00:03:21.680> this<00:03:21.710> but<00:03:22.040> this<00:03:22.280> is<00:03:22.430> what<00:03:22.550> I

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
high hopes for this but this is what I

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.100 
high hopes for this but this is what I

have one now as you can see it's pretty
neutral<00:03:24.440> I<00:03:24.770> thought<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:24.980> was<00:03:25.070> going<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.280> have

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
neutral I thought it was going to have

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.800 
neutral I thought it was going to have
more<00:03:25.610> color<00:03:25.910> or<00:03:26.180> be<00:03:26.300> a<00:03:26.330> little<00:03:26.510> bit<00:03:26.630> more

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
more color or be a little bit more

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.930 
more color or be a little bit more
opaque<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.410> like<00:03:27.890> lychee<00:03:28.340> luxe<00:03:28.550> but<00:03:28.760> more

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
opaque I like lychee luxe but more

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.710 
opaque I like lychee luxe but more
orange<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.960> it's<00:03:30.740> not<00:03:30.980> so<00:03:31.250> if<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.490> r<00:03:31.640> NW<00:03:31.970> 43

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
orange and it's not so if you r NW 43

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.250 
orange and it's not so if you r NW 43
and<00:03:33.790> darker<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:35.210> really<00:03:35.450> don't<00:03:35.630> need<00:03:35.810> this<00:03:36.050> if

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
and darker you really don't need this if

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.670 
and darker you really don't need this if
you<00:03:36.380> have<00:03:36.620> other<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:37.790> know<00:03:37.820> neutral<00:03:38.720> gold

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
you have other you know neutral gold

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.650 
you have other you know neutral gold
glasses<00:03:40.190> in<00:03:40.520> your<00:03:40.550> kit<00:03:40.820> if<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.000> are<00:03:41.390> lighter

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
glasses in your kit if you are lighter

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.449 
glasses in your kit if you are lighter
this<00:03:42.170> will<00:03:42.350> probably<00:03:42.500> show<00:03:42.830> up<00:03:42.860> more<00:03:43.160> on<00:03:43.310> you

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
this will probably show up more on you

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.760 
this will probably show up more on you
but<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:43.730> don't<00:03:43.880> think<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.360> need<00:03:44.540> this<00:03:44.840> if<00:03:45.620> your
