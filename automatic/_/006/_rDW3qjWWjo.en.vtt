00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:31.560 

I<00:01:14.329> too

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.660 

so<00:01:32.570> back<00:01:33.049> from<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.409> game<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:33.950> what<00:01:34.640> I

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
so back from the game and what I

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.630 
so back from the game and what I
fantastic<00:01:35.270> win<00:01:35.780> two<00:01:36.170> wins<00:01:36.530> in<00:01:36.829> four<00:01:37.159> days<00:01:37.430> I

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
fantastic win two wins in four days I

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.709 
fantastic win two wins in four days I
think<00:01:37.820> that's<00:01:37.939> something<00:01:38.060> like<00:01:38.299> our<00:01:38.509> first

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
think that's something like our first

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.020 
think that's something like our first
back-to-back<00:01:39.079> wins<00:01:39.649> in<00:01:39.979> eight<00:01:40.460> months<00:01:40.759> or

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
back-to-back wins in eight months or

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.850 
back-to-back wins in eight months or
something<00:01:41.270> ridiculous<00:01:41.450> like<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.110> we<00:01:42.409> really

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
something ridiculous like that we really

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.950 
something ridiculous like that we really
needed<00:01:43.219> that<00:01:43.250> tonight<00:01:43.670> especially<00:01:44.360> after<00:01:44.659> I

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
needed that tonight especially after I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.529 
needed that tonight especially after I
started<00:01:45.469> the<00:01:45.590> season<00:01:45.770> against<00:01:46.130> wolves<00:01:46.640> the

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
started the season against wolves the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.779 
started the season against wolves the
home<00:01:47.780> fans<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:48.679> will<00:01:48.860> absolutely<00:01:49.490> buzz

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
home fans that I will absolutely buzz

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
and I've never haven't felt like that I

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.789 
and I've never haven't felt like that I
care<00:01:52.039> owed<00:01:52.280> for<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:52.819> good<00:01:53.149> long<00:01:53.840> time<00:01:53.899> I<00:01:54.380> cut<00:01:54.619> I

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:36.849 
teams and today the away team took took
their<00:02:35.510> childs<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:35.900> what<00:02:36.049> fantastic<00:02:36.410> call<00:02:36.739> it

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.530 
their childs and what fantastic call it
was<00:02:37.010> but<00:02:37.280> after<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.790> we<00:02:37.850> really<00:02:38.239> got<00:02:38.359> back

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
was but after that we really got back

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.379 
was but after that we really got back
into<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.840> game<00:02:39.109> I<00:02:39.459> thought<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.910> midfield

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
into the game I thought the midfield

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.349 
into the game I thought the midfield
were<00:02:41.600> very<00:02:41.810> strong<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:43.760> allowed<00:02:44.060> us<00:02:44.090> to

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
were very strong and that allowed us to

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.660 
were very strong and that allowed us to
to<00:02:45.079> get<00:02:45.230> forwards<00:02:45.739> in<00:02:45.799> whole<00:02:45.980> possessions<00:02:46.519> and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
to get forwards in whole possessions and

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.580 
to get forwards in whole possessions and
just<00:02:46.850> calmly<00:02:47.150> going<00:02:47.389> down<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.630> bit<00:02:47.989> because<00:02:48.139> we

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
just calmly going down a bit because we

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.400 
just calmly going down a bit because we
didn't<00:02:48.829> expect<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.459> be<00:02:49.639> behind<00:02:50.630> after<00:02:50.900> 41

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
didn't expect it to be behind after 41

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.300 
didn't expect it to be behind after 41
seconds<00:02:52.069> but<00:02:52.850> we<00:02:53.630> had<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.870> make<00:02:54.139> the<00:02:54.950> most<00:02:55.130> of

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
seconds but we had to make the most of

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.160 
seconds but we had to make the most of
it<00:02:55.400> i<00:02:55.549> suppose<00:02:55.609> and<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.299> just<00:02:56.720> try<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:56.989> bounce
