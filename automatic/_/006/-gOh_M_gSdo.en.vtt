00:00:45.690 --> 00:01:02.000 

a<00:00:59.780> lot<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> filming<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.589> did<00:01:01.829> with

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
a lot of the filming that we did with

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.399 
a lot of the filming that we did with
him<00:01:02.040> initially<00:01:02.760> he<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.030> inside<00:01:03.510> quite<00:01:04.379> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
him initially he was inside quite a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.649 
him initially he was inside quite a
large<00:01:05.070> enclosure<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.940> we<00:01:06.299> were<00:01:06.390> filming

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
large enclosure and we were filming

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.719 
large enclosure and we were filming
through<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.560> fence<00:01:07.860> or<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.220> had<00:01:08.399> this<00:01:08.520> little

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
through the fence or we had this little

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.469 
through the fence or we had this little
movable<00:01:09.690> cage<00:01:09.899> so<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.530> should<00:01:10.770> go<00:01:11.430> inside<00:01:11.909> but

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
movable cage so we should go inside but

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.270 
movable cage so we should go inside but
just<00:01:12.690> we<00:01:13.049> were<00:01:13.140> sort<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.409> locked<00:01:13.920> away<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
just we were sort of locked away and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.230 
just we were sort of locked away and
they<00:01:14.340> couldn't<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.880> us<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:18.030> this

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
they couldn't get to us it's about this

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.960 
they couldn't get to us it's about this
time<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.539> think<00:01:18.929> the<00:01:19.080> boys<00:01:19.289> are<00:01:19.500> probably

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970
