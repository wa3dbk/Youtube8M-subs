I lose 56 hunting there at one point I

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.530 
I lose 56 hunting there at one point I
wanted<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.310> question<00:03:54.700> just<00:03:55.000> what<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:57.540> time

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
wanted a question just what is this time

but<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.419> think<00:04:22.629> it's<00:04:22.780> time<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.289> think<00:04:23.530> it's<00:04:23.620> time

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
but I think it's time I think it's time

but I think it's time I think it's time
and<00:04:24.069> it's<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.400> right<00:04:24.520> time<00:04:24.759> together<00:04:24.940> for<00:04:25.360> you

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
and it's the right time together for you

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:26.730 
and it's the right time together for you
visual<00:04:25.780> right<00:04:25.900> time<00:04:26.139> and<00:04:26.319> I<00:04:26.379> think<00:04:26.590> what

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
visual right time and I think what

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.820 
visual right time and I think what
Nikolas<00:04:27.009> is<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.729> fantastic<00:04:28.240> concept<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.770> I

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
Nikolas is a fantastic concept and I

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.040 
Nikolas is a fantastic concept and I
think<00:04:30.039> that<00:04:30.159> it<00:04:30.280> is

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
think that it is

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.749 
think that it is
and<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.590> think<00:04:31.650> that<00:04:31.919> everything<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.490> aligned

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
and I think that everything is aligned

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.240 
and I think that everything is aligned
perfectly<00:04:33.330> well<00:04:34.319> it<00:04:34.409> can<00:04:34.530> be<00:04:34.620> such<00:04:34.800> a<00:04:34.830> big<00:04:35.069> pot

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250
