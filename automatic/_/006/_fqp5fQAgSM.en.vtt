harder<00:02:30.830> than<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.040> looks<00:02:31.400> if<00:02:31.580> I<00:02:31.700> could<00:02:31.880> just<00:02:32.120> go

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
harder than it looks if I could just go

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.710 
harder than it looks if I could just go

conceptually this is also kind of
bizarre<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:16.880> mean<00:03:17.120> there's<00:03:17.270> better<00:03:17.450> ways<00:03:17.690> to

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
bizarre I mean there's better ways to

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.960 
bizarre I mean there's better ways to
save<00:03:18.200> miners<00:03:18.680> than<00:03:18.860> sending<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.280> crazy<00:03:19.550> person
