00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.799
 2 

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:11.320
 This time, I think I want to talk about How to Grow to edema 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:15.370
 Blooms, such as similar jar aristocrats I guess what I was saying, hibiscus 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.730
 Even though Well is the first time being in either Toka Hibiscus number 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:23.080
 Very favored by Japanese garden trees 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.930
 It is easy to grow so I see it in many places 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.850
 I think the plant is empty game yes 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.189
 Though it is attention point of how to bring up 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.730
 Well 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:41.430
 It's a plant that's okay if you cut it too hot 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.910
 Pretty as it can be seen from this Kedomo I think that has been sold in this kind of form in this seedling 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.760
 Yeah, you Toki batch batch 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:53.840
 I can do it here and there, and such a big branch has been cut with this place all the time 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:59.780
 Even blows of grain after it has been partitioned's completely okay to be coming 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:05.900
 Because it is a dignified plant with no wood grain , it is very fresh and cheap for garden trees 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.430
 It can also be winter recruiting outside I'm see in various places in the of one of the plant Iwaki 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.030
 Various colors 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.900
 Because there are white, grave and purple 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.180
 One of the most favored plants because there are variations of that color 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.700
 Hey 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.280
 It is pruning but 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.780
 There is a time of generation 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.790
 Really good 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.150
 Please listen in the spring of the next year from autumn 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.390
 That spring to summer 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.880
 New sprouts are growing and flower buds are not prepared 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.149
 It means that but from this spring 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.620
 Because if you cut it in summer you will also cut fireworks 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:49.780
 Falling leaf period from autumn to next spring 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.130
 If you want to shape and shape the branches, for example, they should be round and they should be fine 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.530
 a 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:02:02.880
 So Toka case that out of the brother mother the right to something plant So I do not want to rainy day right 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.470
 As you say , we select from spring to early spring of the next year and fall to spring of the next year 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.899
 is 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.950
 And as a basic way of raising 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.050
 Have sunny fertilizer, isn't it 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:20.080
 It is fertilizer at the time when flowers are blooming like this after having been given in winter 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.310
 In very Seidaka performance 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:29.770
 Please be sure to give fertilizers from that amount of fertilizer . 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.000
 And aphids also ignored that I'm the aphids from Well attaches to the various plant 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.430
 Even if 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.250
 It's Tsukkun, this is Ad Addiction 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.250
 That Kedomo tell a doctor hibiscus 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.069
 The foam is not 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.260
 Leaf row 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.470
 It is hard to understand this way 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.560
 What mother 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.910
 Leaves wee high school 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.120
 The leaves that are roughly stuck are coming out 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.060
 this 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.420
 It's called Hamami Kimshia, so here it proliferates and proliferates in the present 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.740
 a 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.830
 It's feeding on the port 0 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.400
 It is not so bad in this state, but this is also 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:20.620
 It's Teku more and more rapidly state before foaming was this child 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:24.190
 I do not know what to think in this way, but I guess maybe water or fate 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:29.650
 It would be like this to protect from the outside enemy, but 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.819
 There is no tear even if you take it, because it is in the state of cigar 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.210
 In the wind 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:42.000
 I think it is necessary to spray the applicable drug written on the drug 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.050
 Only there is Well selection and the beach severe only is quite 2 so after is the notes say and Notes 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.830
 So it's fine 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.980
 In Holinger Well okay mood 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:53.350
 Very suitable for Japanese garden trees 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.350
 We talked about how to grow mukuge
