00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.370 

so<00:00:20.910> first<00:00:21.150> things<00:00:21.390> first<00:00:21.510> make<00:00:22.140> sure<00:00:22.260> you

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
so first things first make sure you

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.930 
so first things first make sure you
protect<00:00:22.590> your<00:00:22.950> hair<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.280> thermal<00:00:23.730> spray

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
before you get started so to start these

before you get started so to start these
big<00:00:26.310> bouncy<00:00:26.460> curls<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.180> want<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.390> make<00:00:27.510> sure

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
big bouncy curls you want to make sure

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.350 
big bouncy curls you want to make sure
that<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.990> section<00:00:28.560> off<00:00:28.650> your<00:00:28.680> hair<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
that you section off your hair so that

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.450 
that you section off your hair so that
it's<00:00:30.510> easier<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.930> curl<00:00:31.290> so<00:00:31.950> sometimes<00:00:32.340> I

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
it's easier to curl so sometimes I

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.150 
it's easier to curl so sometimes I
smooth<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.730> off<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> hair<00:00:33.650> then<00:00:34.650> I<00:00:34.680> grab<00:00:35.040> it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
smooth it off the hair then I grab it

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.780 
smooth it off the hair then I grab it
the<00:00:35.309> plaits

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the plaits

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.760 
the plaits
wrap<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.480> over<00:00:37.400> twist<00:00:38.400> and<00:00:39.530> make<00:00:40.530> sure<00:00:40.650> that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
wrap it over twist and make sure that

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.320 
wrap it over twist and make sure that
it's<00:00:40.920> locked<00:00:41.129> between<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.550> plates<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.030> then

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
it's locked between the plates and then

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.890 
it's locked between the plates and then
quickly<00:00:44.660> make<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> curl<00:00:46.019> and<00:00:47.480> they<00:00:48.480> will<00:00:48.629> stay

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
quickly make the curl and they will stay

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.790 
quickly make the curl and they will stay
like<00:00:49.260> big<00:00:49.500> bouncy<00:00:49.890> curls<00:00:54.290> so<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.469> bangs<00:00:55.649> are

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
like big bouncy curls so the bangs are

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.410 
like big bouncy curls so the bangs are
really<00:00:56.040> interesting<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:56.850> nobody<00:00:57.239> likes

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
really interesting because nobody likes

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.790 
really interesting because nobody likes
a<00:00:57.510> giant<00:00:57.930> curl<00:00:58.170> right<00:00:58.410> by<00:00:58.590> their<00:00:58.770> eye

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
a giant curl right by their eye

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.459 
a giant curl right by their eye
especially<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.700> ringlet<00:01:00.059> curl<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.290> always

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
especially a ringlet curl so I always

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.080 
especially a ringlet curl so I always
kind<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.739> straight<00:01:02.040> mine<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.510> twist<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:05.090> then

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
kind of straight mine out twist and then

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.660 
kind of straight mine out twist and then
let<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:10.350> little<00:01:10.649> kind<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.130> look<00:01:11.640> more

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
let go and this little kind of look more

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.930 
let go and this little kind of look more
like<00:01:12.030> Farrah<00:01:12.330> Fawcett<00:01:12.899> after<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.979> falls<00:01:14.250> not

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
like Farrah Fawcett after it falls not

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.150 
like Farrah Fawcett after it falls not
too<00:01:15.180> much<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> ringlets<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:16.950> thing<00:01:17.070> I

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
too much of a ringlets so one thing I

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.889 
too much of a ringlets so one thing I
noticed<00:01:17.520> when<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.789> was<00:01:18.060> testing<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.690> this

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
noticed when I was testing out this

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.749 
noticed when I was testing out this
technique<00:01:19.289> is<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.920> could<00:01:20.280> use<00:01:20.399> the<00:01:20.550> wrap

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
technique is that I could use the wrap

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.279 
technique is that I could use the wrap
around<00:01:20.789> and<00:01:21.270> twist<00:01:21.539> technique<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.259> I

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
around and twist technique but I

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:23.539 
around and twist technique but I
couldn't<00:01:22.649> do<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> same<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.310> act

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
couldn't do the same for this act

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.340 
couldn't do the same for this act
because<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.270> curls<00:01:24.600> would<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:24.869> every<00:01:25.170> which

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
because the curls would go every which

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.960 
because the curls would go every which
way<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.280> kind<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.610> looked<00:01:26.760> like<00:01:26.880> they

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
way and that kind of looked like they

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.370 
way and that kind of looked like they
were<00:01:27.030> sticking<00:01:27.479> straight<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:27.810> instead<00:01:28.320> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
were sticking straight out instead of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.120 
were sticking straight out instead of
actually<00:01:28.799> curled<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.930> all<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.049> do<00:01:31.260> for<00:01:31.830> my<00:01:31.920> right

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
actually curled so all I do for my right

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.090 
actually curled so all I do for my right
side<00:01:32.400> or<00:01:33.080> for<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.229> whatever<00:01:34.619> site<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.009> is

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
side or for you whatever site it is

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.399 
side or for you whatever site it is
that's<00:01:35.340> harder<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.580> curl<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.840> take<00:01:37.229> it

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
that's harder to curl is just take it

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.980 
that's harder to curl is just take it
within<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.220> plaits<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.810> start

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
within the plaits and then just start

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.440 
within the plaits and then just start
twisting<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.680> iron

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.929 

and<00:01:47.540> now<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.439> have<00:01:48.650> a<00:01:48.680> beautiful<00:01:48.890> curl<00:01:49.400> just

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
and now you have a beautiful curl just

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.730 
and now you have a beautiful curl just
like<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.150> other<00:01:50.299> side<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:51.320> now<00:01:51.350> you're<00:01:51.619> just

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
like the other side so now you're just

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.530 
like the other side so now you're just
going<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.009> shake<00:01:52.250> out<00:01:52.400> your<00:01:52.549> hair<00:01:52.790> see<00:01:53.479> if

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
going to shake out your hair see if

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.620 
going to shake out your hair see if
there's<00:01:53.689> any<00:01:53.840> spaces<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:54.950> need<00:01:55.450> some<00:01:56.450> more

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
there's any spaces that need some more

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.320 
there's any spaces that need some more
curl<00:01:57.009> clearly<00:01:58.009> my<00:01:58.130> hair<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.430> fallen<00:01:58.880> which<00:01:59.149> is

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
curl clearly my hair is fallen which is

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.090 
curl clearly my hair is fallen which is
the<00:01:59.479> keys<00:01:59.720> in<00:01:59.930> this<00:01:59.990> entire<00:02:00.320> look<00:02:00.590> wait<00:02:00.890> for<00:02:01.040> it

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
the keys in this entire look wait for it

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.460 
the keys in this entire look wait for it
to<00:02:01.220> fall<00:02:01.460> after<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.240> finish<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:02.509> just<00:02:03.110> take

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470

some hairspray if you want to add some
more<00:02:04.909> volume<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:06.320> actually<00:02:06.830> start<00:02:07.159> by

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
more volume and I actually start by

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.500 
more volume and I actually start by
flipping<00:02:07.460> my<00:02:07.729> hair<00:02:07.759> over<00:02:08.209> I<00:02:11.770> spray<00:02:12.770> underneath

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
flipping my hair over I spray underneath

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.610 
flipping my hair over I spray underneath
and<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.540> just<00:02:14.840> gives<00:02:15.019> it<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.200> little<00:02:15.440> bit<00:02:15.530> of

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
and that just gives it a little bit of

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.930 
and that just gives it a little bit of
height<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:17.170> then<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.260> go<00:02:18.410> back<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.950> spray<00:02:19.340> any

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
height and then I go back and spray any

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.240 
height and then I go back and spray any
baby<00:02:20.930> hairs<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.470> may<00:02:21.680> have

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
baby hairs that I may have

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.979 
baby hairs that I may have
so<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.580> looks<00:02:22.730> clean<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.239> polished<00:02:23.750> and

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
so that looks clean and polished and

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.330 
so that looks clean and polished and
then<00:02:24.530> if<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:24.680> don't<00:02:24.800> want<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.040> use<00:02:25.130> hairspray

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.130 
then if you don't want to use hairspray

these right here they're a little bit
more<00:02:48.410> straight<00:02:48.799> that's<00:02:49.400> because<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.730> didn't

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
more straight that's because I didn't

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.550 
more straight that's because I didn't
curl<00:02:50.239> them<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.019> gives<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:51.290> more<00:02:51.319> of<00:02:51.500> a

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
curl them and it gives it more of a

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.430

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.110 
beach wave look which I like the final
