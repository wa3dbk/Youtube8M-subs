00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.309
 welcome dear friends my name is 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.510
 novels on her are pretty important 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.580
 cool topic 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.759
 let's talk about proteins today 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.430
 every possible amino acid money you 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.340
 often I hear such questions as 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.399
 when to take this sport pit what 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.910
 exactly sport drink protein pc or gainer 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:36.579
 before or after training but unfortunately 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.370
 rarely hear people ask questions 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.469
 how to eat little guys now 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.050
 who pays attention to the usual 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.019
 whose food lies and enjoyed which 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.960
 It sold at a nearby store understandable 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.820
 the thing that advertising does its thing is that 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.339
 when we advertise huge such 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.620
 relief jock some gainer or 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.530
 protein then in our us here immediately 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.899
 this information and belief in that 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.440
 that this same jock has grown precisely on 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.970
 of these gainers in proteins and pc 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.010
 recently and chatted with a guy who I 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.010
 said he bought a new can of protein in 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.590
 jar and so a couple for him and he noticed 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.149
 what is the use of this project and on 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.479
 he became really stronger 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.030
 forests began to grow in reality rod or or 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.310
 where did something come from 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.310
 previous batch of protein well yes it is he 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.070
 so said i asked him where did you come from 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.590
 I understand that you have this energy and power 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.829
 It was from this particular protein bank. 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.049
 they are from the Eden of pasta or flight or 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.359
 maybe you're so vigorous and strong 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.579
 this lord of school got a top five for 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:45.250
 what your girlfriend finally gave you 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.619
 and so one of the main questions is whether 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.930
 protein us energy and in general can we 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.359
 it does not matter to feel yourself 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.609
 protein or amino acids 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.649
 I will give such an example that sleep and 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:57.470
 happens when we sit on without 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.560
 carbohydrate 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.600
 in other words on a protein diet 100 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.210
 usb diet about sat on the so-called 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.910
 drying under understands what it is about when we 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.070
 begin our body carbohydrates we 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.220
 become less energetic we 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.800
 we become weak our forests are working 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.080
 fall on not that hard to train 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.470
 it's hard for us to move without carbohydrates and 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.780
 how much protein or so-called 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.640
 protein from it's scary and laid ska and 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.250
 a word that affects young people so much 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.920
 guys and how much would we eat this 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.830
 drank in sight to in our body not 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.980
 there will be more energy for that simple 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.050
 the reason that there is no muscle click n 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.840
 I don't know what glycogen is. 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.270
 energy reserve which is contained 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.730
 in separate muscle groups and which 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.459
 replenished only with carbohydrates 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.470
 simple or difficult protein how much would we 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.840
 he was not eaten does not restock 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.080
 glycogen and of course it does not 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.150
 affects our vigor and strength and protein we 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.489
 we take his name without carbohydrate diets 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.860
 just to keep your 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.400
 muscle mass that we have gained 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.560
 in the process of its mass set but also the heels 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.480
 To this day she is mistaken . because 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.540
 that did not own the information they consider 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.989
 what if they don't eat more 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.500
 this protein or amino acids 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.870
 fighter the stronger and more they will become 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.209
 but in practice everything happens at all 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.209
 on the contrary, they do not grow from these from these 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.390
 tricks because they didn't get it right 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.610
 normal protein food and the fighter is not 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.489
 are anabolic steroids and 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.590
 no effect on muscle growth 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.989
 thin greenhouse the problems 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.980
 just gaining weight often pay 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.959
 attention Rental Contract 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.940
 as in gamers prevails 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.150
 the amount of carbohydrates they think is 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.610
 if you do not drink as a result of the kinder and so 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.230
 four or five times a day then they will become 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.629
 more 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.599
 but if you read the sciences what is written 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.250
 on the packaging of this general composition then 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.530
 you will see that there is a large number 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.989
 sugar that is simple carbohydrates 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.930
 in other words, this protein is mixed with 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.099
 sugar that's all gainer question fuck 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.410
 pay more 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.660
 before that all very tasty again there 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.090
 all sorts of flavors and now in 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.790
 powder form can be eaten and so why 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.250
 I think that all this sport is pit to us 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.560
 didn't need medical 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.139
 research on this about how much 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.240
 requires protein for a person who 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.610
 trains and so and athletes who 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.350
 advertise various brands of sports 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.160
 nutrition insist that the protein 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.810
 need from two temples and more 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.510
 Medical research suggests 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.449
 what protein is required for exercising 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.729
 athlete no more than one and a half grams 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.830
 kilogram of its own weight, that is, if 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.110
 you will use the spirit more 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.169
 one and a half temple most likely he will 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.470
 bypass your muscles and get straight 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.340
 in the sewer then the question is why 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.800
 professional bodybuilders 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.669
 insist that you need more protein 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.430
 than in the mountains 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.530
 about two and more yes for that simple 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.570
 the reason that all professional 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.240
 bodybuilders use sports 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.970
 pharmacology and consuming with nasty 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.940
 pharmacology man digests protein 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.099
 much easier than you and me there are people 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.410
 who do not use partner 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:23.919
 if we burst this protein 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:26.349
 arthur and more then all the excess will be 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.570
 pass by your muscles why so 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.700
 happens because our body is just 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.849
 this amount of protein is not required 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.580
 food you just can not fool your 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.520
 the body is the amount of protein that it 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.710
 is required and the rest once the 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.680
 eat if the protein can go either in 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.810
 subcutaneous fat or just thrown away 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.120
 sewage regret today 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.669
 day a rare guy and pay attention 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.310
 present powered by which much 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.160
 more sense of what all of these jars with 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.770
 protein powder to maybe some 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.000
 In cases of this protein is not allowed to her husband 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.460
 when you are somewhere in 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.250
 a business trip where you have no opportunity 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.740
 eat normal protein then 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.050
 here he will help the shaker with stirred 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.930
 protein but in other cases when you 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.940
 live at home you eat at home you train 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.650
 local gym or exercise at home 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.860
 from protein 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.289
 then absolutely zero so guys my opinion 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.570
 about it until you have dealt with 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:28.690
 normal nutrition until you learned 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.639
 make up your diet depending on 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.729
 your goal for gaining muscle mass 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.560
 either for burning fat just for burqa 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.410
 all these sports supplements 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.740
 this way you save your money and 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.419
 finally start growing normally on this 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.090
 All friends, I wish you all good health 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:49.000
 all of you gain in muscle mass 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.300
 relief and good luck all the best see you soon 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.300
 meetings yet
