to get like master procedures on a first

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.080 
to get like master procedures on a first
couple<00:01:33.600> days<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> game<00:01:34.170> being<00:01:34.380> out<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:35.549> it's

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
couple days of a game being out but it's

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.850 
couple days of a game being out but it's
kind<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:37.049> your<00:01:37.290> playing<00:01:37.619> style

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
kind of up to like your playing style

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.190 
kind of up to like your playing style
and<00:01:38.220> everything<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.630> think<00:01:40.140> that

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
and everything like that I do think that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.330 
and everything like that I do think that
it's<00:01:40.439> good<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.710> they're<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:40.890> adding<00:01:41.130> this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it's good that they're not adding this

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
it's good that they're not adding this
because<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.180> kind<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.750> add<00:01:42.930> these

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
because they do kind of just add these

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.990 
because they do kind of just add these
procedures<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.250> lengthen<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.820> game's

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
procedures just to lengthen the game's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.539 
procedures just to lengthen the game's
lifespan<00:01:45.860> because<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.070> know<00:01:47.159> advanced

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
lifespan because you know advanced

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.069 
lifespan because you know advanced
warfare<00:01:47.640> was<00:01:48.060> dying<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:48.540> they're<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.840> oh

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
warfare was dying then they're like oh

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.530 
warfare was dying then they're like oh
maybe<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.560> should<00:01:49.740> put<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.189> some<00:01:50.549> new<00:01:51.090> Grand

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
maybe we should put in some new Grand

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.590 
maybe we should put in some new Grand
Master<00:01:51.990> procedures<00:01:52.610> just<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.759> lengthen<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
Master procedures just to lengthen the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.060 
Master procedures just to lengthen the
life<00:01:54.899> span<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.200> little<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> couple<00:01:55.979> more

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
life span a little bit get a couple more

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.830 
life span a little bit get a couple more
people<00:01:56.310> playing<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> am<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.659> excited

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
people playing but I am really excited

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.990 
people playing but I am really excited
to<00:01:58.290> see<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.770> Vonderhaar<00:01:59.340> was<00:01:59.460> talking<00:01:59.820> about

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
to see what Vonderhaar was talking about

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.910 
to see what Vonderhaar was talking about
when<00:02:00.659> they<00:02:00.840> said<00:02:01.110> they<00:02:01.229> were<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.530> add<00:02:01.649> in

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
when they said they were going to add in

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.550 
when they said they were going to add in
something<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:03.030> might<00:02:03.420> spice<00:02:03.780> things<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.259> for

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
something that might spice things up for

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.469 
something that might spice things up for
those<00:02:04.799> master<00:02:05.369> prestige<00:02:05.520> players<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.240> want

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
those master prestige players that want

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.359 
those master prestige players that want
to<00:02:06.600> keep<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:06.869> playing<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.350> can't<00:02:07.950> add<00:02:08.129> any

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
to keep on playing and can't add any

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.790 
to keep on playing and can't add any
more<00:02:08.459> perceived<00:02:09.060> levels<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.289> think<00:02:10.649> that's

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
more perceived levels so I think that's

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.199 
more perceived levels so I think that's
going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> cool<00:02:11.310> implementation<00:02:12.120> if

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
going to be a cool implementation if

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.490 
going to be a cool implementation if
they<00:02:12.330> do<00:02:12.390> go<00:02:12.720> ahead<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.080> implement

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
they do go ahead and implement

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.620 
they do go ahead and implement
because<00:02:14.340> they<00:02:14.520> did<00:02:14.670> say<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.270> can't

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
because they did say that they can't

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.720 
because they did say that they can't
guarantee<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.260> yet<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.250> hope<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.580> would

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
guarantee it yet but I hope that would

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.910 
guarantee it yet but I hope that would
you<00:02:17.850> see<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.390> hope<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.470> guys<00:02:19.650> did
