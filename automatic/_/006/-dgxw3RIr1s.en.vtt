00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
skyrockets so let's get the skyrocket

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.819 
skyrockets so let's get the skyrocket
here<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.549> slide<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.030> into<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> shell

here and just slide it into the shell
very<00:01:46.829> very<00:01:47.130> snug<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:48.119> could<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> suppose<00:01:48.590> use

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
very very snug you could I suppose use

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.200 
very very snug you could I suppose use
it<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.070> but<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.520> be<00:01:50.640> weird<00:01:50.880> because<00:01:51.060> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
it like this but to be weird because you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.560 
it like this but to be weird because you
have<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.630> bike<00:01:53.270> gap<00:01:54.270> where<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
have the bike gap where the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.780 
have the bike gap where the
polycarbonate<00:01:55.200> should<00:01:55.409> fit<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.490> let's<00:01:56.640> try

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
polycarbonate should fit in so let's try

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.490 
polycarbonate should fit in so let's try
to<00:01:56.850> install<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.360> polycarbonate<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:58.229> here

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
to install this polycarbonate on here

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.660 
to install this polycarbonate on here
we'll<00:01:58.649> get<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.600> volume<00:02:00.600> rocker<00:02:00.630> and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
we'll get it on the volume rocker and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.780 
we'll get it on the volume rocker and
