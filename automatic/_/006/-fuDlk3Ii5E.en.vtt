00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
to make a only pressure to call from a

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.839 
to make a only pressure to call from a
straw<00:00:05.629> this<00:00:06.629> straw<00:00:07.080> has<00:00:07.379> already<00:00:07.680> been<00:00:07.830> cut<00:00:08.069> up

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
straw this straw has already been cut up

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.870 
straw this straw has already been cut up
a<00:00:09.150> little<00:00:09.300> bit<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.809> made<00:00:10.469> other<00:00:10.620> calls<00:00:11.460> from<00:00:11.700> it

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
a little bit I made other calls from it

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.709 
a little bit I made other calls from it
and<00:00:12.380> just<00:00:13.380> it's<00:00:14.130> really<00:00:14.309> easy<00:00:14.610> cut<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.599> about

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
and just it's really easy cut it about

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.810 
and just it's really easy cut it about
inch<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.010> 3/4<00:00:17.550> long<00:00:19.310> trim<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> little<00:00:20.550> off

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
inch and 3/4 long trim a little off

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.880 
inch and 3/4 long trim a little off
doesn't<00:00:21.270> really<00:00:21.510> matter<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:22.590> be<00:00:22.680> that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
doesn't really matter it can be that

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.570 
doesn't really matter it can be that
long<00:00:23.160> or<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.699> be<00:00:23.850> like<00:00:24.260> that<00:00:25.260> long<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:26.279> if

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
long or it can be like that long just if

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.939 
long or it can be like that long just if
you<00:00:26.699> get<00:00:26.820> about<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.240> long<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:28.260> really

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
you get about that long it really

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.400 
you get about that long it really
doesn't<00:00:29.220> work<00:00:29.250> all<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:31.199> get<00:00:31.320> it

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
doesn't work all I just you can get it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.310 
doesn't work all I just you can get it
sometimes<00:00:31.619> we're<00:00:32.009> not<00:00:32.040> really<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:33.320> you're

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
sometimes we're not really but you're

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.639 
sometimes we're not really but you're
just<00:00:34.469> going<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> take<00:00:34.800> your<00:00:34.950> scissors<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:36.649> cut

it<00:00:38.270> about<00:00:39.320> right<00:00:40.320> there<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:42.600> cut<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.140> about

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
it about right there and cut it about

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.290 
it about right there and cut it about
right<00:00:44.329> there<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.059> sharp

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
right there you you can have it sharp

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.619 
right there you you can have it sharp
like<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.750> doesn't<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:49.710> matter

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
like that doesn't really matter

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.510 
like that doesn't really matter
top<00:00:51.629> sharp<00:00:51.960> bottoms<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.160> doesn't

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
top sharp bottoms not that doesn't

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.959 
top sharp bottoms not that doesn't
matter<00:00:54.120> at<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.500> if<00:00:55.500> they<00:00:55.739> still<00:00:56.340> work<00:00:56.460> usually

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
matter at all if they still work usually

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.619 
matter at all if they still work usually
usually<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:58.590> ya<00:00:59.250> show<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> if<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
usually but ya show you if it see if it

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.040 
usually but ya show you if it see if it
works

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
works

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.170 
works
but<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.859> got<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.129> flatten<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.640> first<00:01:03.769> we<00:01:05.180> gotta

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
but you got to flatten it first we gotta

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.640 
but you got to flatten it first we gotta
flatten<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.320> pretty<00:01:07.560> flat<00:01:08.010> but

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
flatten it out so it's pretty flat but

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.750 
flatten it out so it's pretty flat but
I'll<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.830> grab<00:01:11.010> another<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.490> made

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
I'll just grab another one I made

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.210 
I'll just grab another one I made
earlier<00:01:13.010> see<00:01:14.010> here's<00:01:14.369> another<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:15.560> see<00:01:16.560> not

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
earlier see here's another one see not

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.260 
earlier see here's another one see not
very<00:01:18.259> up<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.530> long<00:01:19.770> here's<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.490> shorter<00:01:20.939> one

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
very up that long here's a shorter one

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.690 
very up that long here's a shorter one
not<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.140> long<00:01:22.320> either<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:23.220> one's<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.520> little

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
not that long either this one's a little

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.300 
not that long either this one's a little
longer<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:25.200> they<00:01:25.350> all<00:01:25.500> work<00:01:25.950> pretty<00:01:25.979> good

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
longer and they all work pretty good

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.670 
longer and they all work pretty good
there's<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.729> short<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.479> makes<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.810> shorter

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
there's a short one it makes it shorter

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:38.440 
there's a short one it makes it shorter
they<00:01:28.799> are<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> higher<00:01:29.189> pitch<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.030> right

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.420 

that's<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.659> short<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.290> then<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:41.250> your

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that's a short one and then you get your

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.160 
that's a short one and then you get your
kind<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.119> medium<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.720> could<00:01:42.869> call<00:01:43.020> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
kind of medium one you could call it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:51.469 
kind of medium one you could call it
ninya<00:01:49.520> that's<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.700> medium<00:01:51.030> one<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.210> then

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
ninya that's the medium one and then

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:01.249 
ninya that's the medium one and then
here's<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> big<00:01:52.470> one

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.600 

it's<00:02:01.890> kind<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.899> lower-pitched<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.460> take

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
it's kind of lower-pitched but just take

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.670 
it's kind of lower-pitched but just take
your<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.090> made<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.509> flatten<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
your one you made and flatten it you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.889 
your one you made and flatten it you
have<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.860> get<00:02:07.979> them<00:02:08.069> pretty<00:02:08.250> flat<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.330> not

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
have to get them pretty flat like not

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.600 
have to get them pretty flat like not
like<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:11.160> pretty<00:02:11.700> flat<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:13.230> then<00:02:13.349> yeah

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
like that pretty flat and then yeah

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:26.660 
like that pretty flat and then yeah
should<00:02:14.610> work<00:02:24.380> that's<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.739> one<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.190> just<00:02:26.280> made

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
should work that's the one I just made

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.370 
should work that's the one I just made
but<00:02:26.970> doesn't<00:02:27.540> really<00:02:27.660> work<00:02:27.840> real<00:02:28.080> well<00:02:28.170> yet

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
but doesn't really work real well yet

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.820 
but doesn't really work real well yet
cuz<00:02:28.709> it's<00:02:28.860> not<00:02:28.980> overly<00:02:29.610> flat<00:02:30.650> just<00:02:31.650> keeps

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
cuz it's not overly flat just keeps

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.970 
cuz it's not overly flat just keeps
getting<00:02:32.280> big<00:02:32.599> right<00:02:33.599> yeah<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.380> just<00:02:34.560> use<00:02:34.950> it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
getting big right yeah you just use it

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.910 
getting big right yeah you just use it
you<00:02:35.130> put<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.630> have<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.930> little<00:02:37.440> split<00:02:37.680> ends

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
you put it have the little split ends

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.000 
you put it have the little split ends
here<00:02:38.099> put<00:02:38.880> them<00:02:39.260> just<00:02:40.260> right<00:02:40.530> behind<00:02:40.739> your

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
here put them just right behind your

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.000 
here put them just right behind your
lips<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:42.660> pinch<00:02:43.049> your<00:02:43.140> lips<00:02:43.410> around<00:02:43.560> about
