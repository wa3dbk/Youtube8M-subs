adopting the internet internet protocol

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.770 
adopting the internet internet protocol
across<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.160> railroad<00:01:06.370> we<00:01:07.210> wanted<00:01:07.570> something

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
across the railroad we wanted something

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.570 
across the railroad we wanted something
that<00:01:07.900> would<00:01:08.050> let<00:01:08.229> us<00:01:08.380> take<00:01:08.890> advantage<00:01:09.040> of<00:01:09.520> that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
that would let us take advantage of that

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.010 
that would let us take advantage of that
old<00:01:09.760> technology<00:01:10.300> to<00:01:10.450> kind<00:01:10.600> of<00:01:10.750> bring<00:01:10.990> it

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
old technology to kind of bring it

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.620 
old technology to kind of bring it
forward<00:01:11.410> and<00:01:11.650> so<00:01:11.830> we<00:01:11.950> created<00:01:12.280> this<00:01:12.400> IP<00:01:12.640> X<00:01:12.880> 1000

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
forward and so we created this IP X 1000

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.469 
forward and so we created this IP X 1000
to<00:01:13.920> basically<00:01:14.920> wrap<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.610> protocol<00:01:16.180> or

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
to basically wrap that protocol or

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.180 
to basically wrap that protocol or
isolate<00:01:16.960> that<00:01:17.080> protocol<00:01:17.590> and<00:01:17.740> be<00:01:17.830> able<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:18.040> run

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
isolate that protocol and be able to run

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.320 
isolate that protocol and be able to run
it<00:01:18.340> over<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.790> Internet

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
it over the Internet

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.640 
it over the Internet
this<00:01:19.479> is<00:01:19.660> stuff<00:01:19.840> that<00:01:19.869> we<00:01:20.110> designed<00:01:20.440> because

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
this is stuff that we designed because

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.770 
this is stuff that we designed because
we<00:01:20.950> have<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.160> core<00:01:21.580> capability<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.360> Electrical

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
we have a core capability of Electrical

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.270 
we have a core capability of Electrical
Engineering<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.320> software<00:01:23.619> engineering<00:01:24.040> and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
Engineering and software engineering and

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.580 
Engineering and software engineering and
the<00:01:25.150> ability<00:01:25.540> to<00:01:25.570> design<00:01:25.990> this<00:01:26.229> kind<00:01:26.440> of

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
the ability to design this kind of

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.320 
the ability to design this kind of
equipment<00:01:27.009> and<00:01:27.100> then<00:01:27.220> we<00:01:27.369> had<00:01:27.550> a<00:01:27.580> manufacturer

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
equipment and then we had a manufacturer

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.880 
equipment and then we had a manufacturer
to<00:01:28.540> throw<00:01:28.690> party<00:01:29.020> manufacturers<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.830> our

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
to throw party manufacturers to our

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.460 
to throw party manufacturers to our
specification<00:01:30.640> those<00:01:31.180> are<00:01:31.330> RFID<00:01:31.570> RFID

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
specification those are RFID RFID

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.060 
specification those are RFID RFID
readers<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:34.149> so<00:01:34.509> on<00:01:34.840> every<00:01:35.229> rail<00:01:35.440> car<00:01:35.770> on<00:01:35.950> the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
readers and so on every rail car on the

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.680 
readers and so on every rail car on the
side<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.520> rail<00:01:36.700> car<00:01:36.940> we<00:01:37.119> have<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.330> small

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
side of the rail car we have a small

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.859 
side of the rail car we have a small
RFID<00:01:38.229> tag<00:01:38.619> and<00:01:38.920> so<00:01:39.490> as<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.970> goes<00:01:40.119> by<00:01:40.420> that

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
RFID tag and so as it goes by that

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.630 
RFID tag and so as it goes by that
illuminates<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:41.710> tag<00:01:42.160> and<00:01:42.399> reads

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
illuminates that tag and reads

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.210 
illuminates that tag and reads

a million wheels through here we found a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.210 
a million wheels through here we found a
little<00:02:55.050> over<00:02:55.320> one<00:02:55.440> hundred<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.680> twenty<00:02:56.040> five

little over one hundred and twenty five
defective<00:02:56.910> wheels<00:02:57.180> probability<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.140> very

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
defective wheels probability is very

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.590 
defective wheels probability is very
high<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.190> number<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.850> those<00:03:00.000> wheels<00:03:00.390> have

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
high that a number of those wheels have

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.690 
high that a number of those wheels have
had<00:03:00.720> those<00:03:00.870> internal<00:03:01.350> defects<00:03:01.920> would<00:03:02.520> have

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
had those internal defects would have

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.520 
had those internal defects would have
had<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> catastrophic<00:03:03.300> failure<00:03:03.840> potentially

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
had a catastrophic failure potentially

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.410 
had a catastrophic failure potentially
leading<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.980> derailment<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:06.090> what<00:03:06.270> we're

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
leading to a derailment so what we're

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.260 
leading to a derailment so what we're
really<00:03:06.450> doing<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:07.110> eliminating<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:08.070> risk<00:03:08.580> by

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
really doing is eliminating that risk by

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.150 
really doing is eliminating that risk by
analyzing<00:03:10.200> these<00:03:10.500> wheels<00:03:10.800> with<00:03:11.010> this

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
analyzing these wheels with this

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.210 
analyzing these wheels with this
advanced<00:03:11.490> technology<00:03:12.150> we<00:03:12.890> change<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.040> wheels

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
advanced technology we change the wheels

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.060 
advanced technology we change the wheels
that<00:03:14.460> are<00:03:14.630> found<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.050> defects<00:03:16.770> in<00:03:16.950> them

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
that are found to have a defects in them

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.850 
that are found to have a defects in them
so<00:03:17.490> we<00:03:17.610> take<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:18.030> put<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.720> jack<00:03:18.990> in<00:03:19.260> which

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
so we take it put the jack in which

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.860 
so we take it put the jack in which
weighs<00:03:20.070> 5,800<00:03:20.820> pounds<00:03:20.850> we<00:03:21.300> use<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.540> combi

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
weighs 5,800 pounds we use the combi

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.800 
weighs 5,800 pounds we use the combi
lift<00:03:22.050> jack<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.590> cars<00:03:22.800> up<00:03:23.480> drop<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.510> wheel

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
lift jack the cars up drop the wheel

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.610 
lift jack the cars up drop the wheel
that's<00:03:26.060> got<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> bad<00:03:27.360> whip<00:03:27.630> impact<00:03:28.260> on<00:03:28.470> it

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
that's got the bad whip impact on it

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.190 
that's got the bad whip impact on it
take<00:03:29.490> it<00:03:29.670> out<00:03:29.790> put<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> new<00:03:30.180> wheel<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:31.080> used

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
take it out put the new wheel in it used

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.930 
take it out put the new wheel in it used
to<00:03:31.350> be<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.470> lot<00:03:31.650> different<00:03:31.800> process<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.490> change

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
to be a lot different process to change

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.730 
to be a lot different process to change
out<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.360> wheels<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.810> trains<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.620> was

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
out the wheels on the trains and it was

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.830 
out the wheels on the trains and it was
about<00:03:34.860> eleven<00:03:35.280> day<00:03:35.400> process<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:36.090> do<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.360> now

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
about eleven day process to do it now

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.780 
about eleven day process to do it now
it's<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.140> fifteen<00:03:37.500> minute<00:03:37.680> process<00:03:38.250> we<00:03:38.580> just

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
it's a fifteen minute process we just

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.430 
it's a fifteen minute process we just
started<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.240> about<00:03:39.540> four<00:03:39.870> or<00:03:39.990> five<00:03:40.170> years

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
started this about four or five years

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.610 
started this about four or five years
ago<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.910> it's<00:03:41.910> eliminated<00:03:42.600> having<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.440> set

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
ago and it's eliminated having to set

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.250 
ago and it's eliminated having to set
those<00:03:43.800> cars<00:03:44.070> out
