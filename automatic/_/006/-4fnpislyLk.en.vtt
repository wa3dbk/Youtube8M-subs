00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.700 
I'm going to use these little puffy
paints<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.420> want<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.810> make<00:00:24.960> sure<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.380> use

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
paints you want to make sure you use

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.279 
paints you want to make sure you use
puffy<00:00:26.160> paints<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.699> are<00:00:27.029> made<00:00:27.480> specifically

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
puffy paints that are made specifically

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.970 
puffy paints that are made specifically
for<00:00:28.730> fabric<00:00:29.730> because<00:00:30.539> if<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.929> use<00:00:31.289> paints

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
for fabric because if you use paints

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.979 
for fabric because if you use paints
that<00:00:32.040> are<00:00:32.250> not<00:00:32.610> fabric<00:00:33.180> safe<00:00:33.420> when<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.840> go<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
that are not fabric safe when you go to

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.650 
that are not fabric safe when you go to
wash<00:00:34.230> them<00:00:34.530> you're<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> mess<00:00:35.820> so

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
wash them you're going to have a mess so

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.060 
wash them you're going to have a mess so
you<00:00:37.079> want<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> make<00:00:37.440> sure<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.890> use

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
you want to make sure that you use

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.299 
you want to make sure that you use
paints<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:39.230> specifically<00:00:40.230> say<00:00:40.469> washable

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
paints that specifically say washable

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.430 
paints that specifically say washable
and<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:41.910> fabric<00:00:42.950> so<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.600> can<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:45.870> kinds

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and for fabric so you can do all kinds

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.029 
and for fabric so you can do all kinds
of<00:00:46.590> fancy<00:00:47.160> designs<00:00:48.530> perhaps<00:00:49.530> write<00:00:49.860> names<00:00:50.280> or

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
of fancy designs perhaps write names or

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.110 
of fancy designs perhaps write names or
things<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> shirt<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:54.090> like

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
things on the shirt that you like like

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
things on the shirt that you like like
smile<00:00:54.719> or<00:00:55.199> happy<00:00:55.680> or<00:00:55.920> something<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.370> that

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
smile or happy or something like that

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.459 
smile or happy or something like that
I'm<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.690> something<00:00:58.079> much<00:00:58.289> more

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
I'm going to do something much more

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.520 
I'm going to do something much more
simple<00:00:59.120> I<00:01:01.010> find<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:03.120> kind<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.690> paints

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
simple I find that these kind of paints

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.039 
simple I find that these kind of paints
are<00:01:05.930> better<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.470> use<00:01:07.590> dots<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.930> kind<00:01:09.930> of

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
are better to just use dots and kind of

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.990 
are better to just use dots and kind of
do<00:01:10.290> stuff<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.890> when<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.250> try<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
do stuff like that when you try to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.120 
do stuff like that when you try to
stretch<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.750> sometimes<00:01:13.320> they<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.860> air

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
stretch them out sometimes they get air

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.820 
stretch them out sometimes they get air
bubbles<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.820> don't<00:01:15.479> personally<00:01:15.810> find<00:01:16.350> them<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
bubbles I don't personally find them to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.039 
bubbles I don't personally find them to
to<00:01:17.280> work<00:01:17.729> very<00:01:18.030> well<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.390> way<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.869> can

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
to work very well that way but you can

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.440 
to work very well that way but you can
always<00:01:19.290> try<00:01:19.560> I'm<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:21.030> designs

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
always try I'm just going to do designs

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.219 
always try I'm just going to do designs
with<00:01:21.869> dots<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:23.720> first<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:24.960> going<00:01:25.140> to

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
with dots so first I'm just going to

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:35.390 
with dots so first I'm just going to
place<00:01:25.470> some<00:01:25.500> dots<00:01:26.009> along<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:28.130> neckline

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.190 

you<00:01:36.400> can<00:01:36.580> measure<00:01:36.820> it<00:01:37.030> out<00:01:37.210> if<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:37.750> want<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:38.050> be

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
you can measure it out if you want to be

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.830 
you can measure it out if you want to be
very<00:01:38.440> precise<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:39.370> just<00:01:40.150> kind<00:01:40.330> of<00:01:40.420> eyeball<00:01:40.810> it

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
very precise I just kind of eyeball it

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.390 
very precise I just kind of eyeball it
so<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:47.229> I'm<00:01:47.440> going<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.650> go<00:01:47.770> in<00:01:47.950> with<00:01:48.130> this

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
so now I'm going to go in with this

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.210 
so now I'm going to go in with this
color<00:01:48.460> I<00:01:49.180> like<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.080> pastels<00:01:50.590> for<00:01:50.740> spring

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
color I like the pastels for spring

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.310 
color I like the pastels for spring
they're<00:01:51.640> very<00:01:51.820> pretty

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.750 

sometimes<00:01:56.320> you<00:01:56.950> have<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.250> squeeze<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.550> little

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
sometimes you have to squeeze a little

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.310 
sometimes you have to squeeze a little
bit<00:01:57.940> harder<00:01:58.390> but<00:01:58.510> you<00:01:58.660> want<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:58.960> be<00:01:59.050> careful

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
bit harder but you want to be careful

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.020 
bit harder but you want to be careful
not<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.890> squeeze<00:02:00.160> too<00:02:00.369> hard<00:02:00.610> because<00:02:00.760> you<00:02:00.850> may

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
not to squeeze too hard because you may

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.980 
not to squeeze too hard because you may
get<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.390> big<00:02:01.660> glop<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.110> paint<00:02:02.650> on<00:02:03.030> your<00:02:04.030> item

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.810 

sometimes<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.229> need<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.410> go<00:02:08.649> in<00:02:08.800> there<00:02:08.950> with<00:02:09.489> a

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
sometimes you need to go in there with a

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:29.640 
sometimes you need to go in there with a
needle<00:02:10.239> or<00:02:10.300> something<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.810> clear<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.170> out

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.539 

and<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:30.340> can<00:02:30.519> use<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.879> point<00:02:31.180> if<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:32.379> want<00:02:32.590> to

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.550 

distribute<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:37.390> paint<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.870> little<00:02:38.200> bit<00:02:38.379> you

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
distribute the paint a little bit you

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.220 
distribute the paint a little bit you
can<00:02:38.739> kind<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.099> use<00:02:39.189> it<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.489> brush

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.309 

sometimes<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:45.780> paint<00:02:46.780> will<00:02:46.930> come<00:02:47.140> up

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
sometimes the the paint will come up

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.420 
sometimes the the paint will come up
higher<00:02:47.650> than<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.400> want<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.959> instead<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:50.430> lower

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
higher than you want it instead of lower

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.220 
higher than you want it instead of lower
and<00:02:51.849> rounder<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:52.689> can<00:02:52.840> just<00:02:52.989> kind<00:02:53.200> of
