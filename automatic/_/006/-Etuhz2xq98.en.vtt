00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
power system in it still kind of

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.850 
power system in it still kind of
undecided<00:02:22.849> I<00:02:25.430> think<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:27.620> would<00:02:28.620> do<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.770> lot

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
undecided I think that it would do a lot

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.339 
undecided I think that it would do a lot
better<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.340> heels<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.150> one<00:02:31.050> up<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
better on heels and one up in the

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.980 
better on heels and one up in the
mountains<00:02:31.800> if<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.239> if<00:02:33.239> I<00:02:33.420> had<00:02:33.450> that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990
