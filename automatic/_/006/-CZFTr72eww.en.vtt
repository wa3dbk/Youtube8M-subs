00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.080
 at the end of all these dogues signs are 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.879
 find themselves today for the 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.330
 new season of tutorials from 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.790
 minecraft in cinema 4d season 2 season 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.040
 2 which will be devoted to the creation of 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.240
 maps and the modeling of the items in 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.800
 particles and cubes 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.160
 so we'll see all this in this 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.840
 season and we left for the summary 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.760
 then as the first episode we will have the 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.800
 maps conversion to minecraft 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.620
 4d cinema open the other software of 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.210
 3d so you use something else so 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.489
 for example this map was created in 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.589
 cinema cats in minecraft forgiveness and on 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.769
 will convert it from minecraft to cinema 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.989
 4d a small a little addition attitude 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.820
 must this tutorial that will be how we can 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.710
 download maps from a server by 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.000
 example trend will not focus map 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.979
 unless you own the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.750
 server and so we'll see how we can 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.369
 download the map of a server for the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.989
 see in math minecraft and then the 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:01.890
 convert to 4d cinema 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.780
 so that will be episode 1 then 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.369
 episode 2 we'll see how we can create 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.600
 a map then there are several ways to 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.729
 create a brand so here we saw how 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.520
 we will see how we convert mahb 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.050
 of minecraft cinema 4d and here we will see 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.330
 what a few things about 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.980
 how can we create a map just at 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.510
 from blocks whose vaud there you see 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.770
 these maps created block by block 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.780
 so I click on blocks and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.880
 pearlescent entirely in 4d cinema and 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.500
 block by block as you recognize the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.960
 map I used for advertising 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.080
 two slots here so we'll see 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.060
 also the disadvantages and then the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.470
 advantages of each technique is so 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.900
 finally we will see the third technique 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.030
 which is then you will see hop 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.320
 we're no longer just part of a plan you 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.180
 see the plan we can still see it 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.280
 close here so it's a one and the same 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.860
 plan I extruded we'll see how 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.720
 we can extrude a plan to make for 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.010
 also make a map and therefore see 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.630
 that it's very very good for you for 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.070
 the grades for example you see the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.990
 cave she was relatively very 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.280
 simple to do without going through minecraft 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.190
 without going through cubes it's just a 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.479
 plan that extruded and it is known it is 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.800
 really useful for making caves or 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.080
 others other pieces on one time one 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.970
 will see that it was the 3rd the third 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.000
 part 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.009
 here is the fourth part we will have how 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.780
 we will make water and lava so 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.930
 water you can see here an example 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.660
 water so water I used here 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.330
 for for the sunrise in 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.380
 minecraft animated series and so we 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.840
 will see how we make water enough 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.640
 realistic of the laddh with a tool that 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.380
 you made a small effect of a glow at 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.800
 turn will see all this so the water and the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.970
 lava fourth part up fifth 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.070
 part of the tutorial 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.320
 we will focus on the items so everything 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.840
 which is thick pickax h but also 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.790
 items like steaks and ingots 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.410
 and all that we will see how to give them 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.970
 a little 3d effect you see that if I 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.120
 play a little here we see them at the sword a 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.280
 little 3d effect we'll see a little bit 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.850
 that's it for the items and then finally 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.470
 last tutorial 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.209
 we'll see we'll finally do I'll do a 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.110
 tutorial on all that is particular 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.310
 what particles is something 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.050
 which is relatively present in 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.000
 minecraft with regard to torches 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.530
 for example here the portal of a heather 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.910
 see that they emit particles and 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.410
 Research area is a lot of doc 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.330
 objects that emit particles 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.350
 so we'll see we're going to do things a 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.480
 little bit more on the 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.550
 particles and then we will also see 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.250
 the destruction the attractions everything 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.330
 which concerns the particles so here 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.700
 that was for the sake of 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.470
 season 2 of minecraft years of cinema 4d 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.350
 so a relatively short season but 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.209
 with a lot to see and who 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.489
 will be really important relief 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.590
 and then we'll be down soon for 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.970
 the beginning of the season here is this essay and 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.209
 works one finds oneself soon go hi 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.209
 to all
