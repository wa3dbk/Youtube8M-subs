00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.390
 Hello everyone, this time I bring you 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.340
 a very easy recipe to make that are 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.340
 some condensed milk muffins 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.590
 As you can see in the video we added in 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.800
 a bowl a small milk can 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.800
 condensed 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.500
 next we will add two eggs 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.870
 once we have these two 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.810
 ingredients in the bowl we turn to 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.810
 beat with a blender rods 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.040
 while we see the images I make a 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.450
 small note that you commented to us 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.329
 beginning of the video 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.189
 and that is that we preheat the oven while 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.500
 we're making the dough about 200 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.520
 degrees approximately anyway 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.520
 then I will remember it 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.789
 once we have activity seeing what 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.579
 what are eggs with milk 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.399
 condensed we melted the 130 grams of 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.039
 butter which we will incorporate 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.060
 to the dough and we will beat carefully as 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.060
 you can see in the images 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:24.750
 we also add a packet of yeast 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.750
 and then we will continue beating 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.069
 and finally we are adding in 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:39.390
 small amount and still beating 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.390
 220 grams of flour 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.080
 we continue beating until we get a 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.200
 mix with the consistency that we 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.560
 we want to fill our capsules 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.560
 clear 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.450
 once we have mixed well the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.370
 ingredients we went to fill what 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.550
 are the capsules or the baskets of 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.550
 muffin 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.680
 we will fill what is half because 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.660
 having yeast then rise and not 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.660
 we want it to overflow 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.910
 once we have them filled we pass 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.250
 to put them in the oven I remind you that at 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.230
 principle of the recipe when I'm 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.150
 making the dough is the oven 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.370
 preheated to about 200 degrees 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.769
 approximately once you already mind 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.710
 and the furnace more or less low to about 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.780
 180 degrees 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.170
 and we order it for about 20 minutes 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.170
 approximately 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.980
 good and so is our cupcake what 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.680
 which is the decoration is not very there but 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.480
 is that what I had at home so 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.020
 I hope you liked it and until the 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.020
 next video
