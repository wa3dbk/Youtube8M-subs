00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 
I think it's fair the price is four we

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.400 
I think it's fair the price is four we
just<00:06:31.560> need<00:06:31.770> to<00:06:31.889> use<00:06:32.190> two<00:06:32.880> times<00:06:33.330> to<00:06:33.930> treat<00:06:34.229> them

just need to use two times to treat them

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.770 
just need to use two times to treat them
so<00:06:34.590> we<00:06:34.740> go<00:06:34.949> one<00:06:35.280> to<00:06:35.400> two<00:06:35.550> times<00:06:35.759> a<00:06:35.970> week<00:06:36.210> for<00:06:36.570> dry
