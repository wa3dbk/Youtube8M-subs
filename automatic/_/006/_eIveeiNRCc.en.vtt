00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.900
 Hi guys, we're going to learn how to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:11.880
 do and there in mustard sauce point 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.519
 using the filet mignon I asked for my 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.440
 I dreamed to cut a slice for myself and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.050
 You have to the way you are. 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.189
 consulate here I will use salt and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.519
 Black pepper 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.849
 The secret of the pot bake is very hot you 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.189
 add some agent and I'll 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.170
 play a little butter because it 's a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.780
 little olive oil a little butter the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.930
 ideal for this recipe is the taste of 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.820
 butter but with butter a fat 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.579
 which burns very fast people 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.899
 add olive oil there do not burn 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.610
 so fast so 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.289
 here i'm using okay but you 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.039
 you can use a regular frying pan in your 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.510
 House 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.149
 I'll put a punch on the frying pan 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.430
 very hot and leave it there it did not 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.489
 blowing a kiss and now he relax 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.160
 until he gets a little tostada por 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.189
 down and you see that it 's lateral started to 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.100
 staying inclusive does not overload either 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.810
 your first because it decreases a lot 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.970
 her temperature 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.400
 the sambist will get bad if it is 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.470
 possible one to two bugs at a time 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.580
 It's sad and if I do not kiss, it's already 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.180
 I can already add the other one and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.180
 withdraw 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.259
 another cool trick is to leave the bug 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.450
 resting five minutes to all 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.179
 juices in the flesh take over the places 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.319
 perfect and she finishes cooking 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.319
 out of the fire 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:47.259
 the ready already be already cooked fried right 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.479
 I will now turn this pot already're 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.939

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.580
 you can make your mustard sauce 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.869
 dolif with that extra fat that's left 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.270
 It will be delightful. 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.610
 In case you do not like suava tonelli and 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.680
 make with the pan cleaned for the sauce 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.200

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:13.340
 pan will all melted

 Add the cream 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.660
 turn off the heat before the cream 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.660
 for he does not work 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:37.600

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.600

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.030
