 fight here we are all known 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.199
 characters on the left you can see that we have 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.779
 spiderman 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.650
 and we actually choose on what the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.470
 opponent we attack the girls beat and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.840

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.129
 And let's start the toy is full of donat 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.230
 at the beginning of the battle is shown as you see 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.100
 characteristics of the enemy and our 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.750
 specifications 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.860
 let's play now for wolverine 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.100
 control is not as 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.949
 injustice and a little bit different here 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.890
 heroes run towards each other swipe 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.010
 and drink that is your own there just forward 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.979
 Beats and our character swipe back 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.210
 jump forward went ahead do jerk 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:13.220
 with swipes we hold our heroes 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.630
 performs a stronger blow here 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.630
 pretty well done this 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.369
 fighting nice very graphics here 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.939
 by the way the graphics are more even than 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.180
 injustice like that 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.619
 very cute heroes really 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.579
 drawn as in some kind 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.850
 comics or cartoons so need to finish 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.540
 our opponent and now we finish it to 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.820
 sorry the hero who got 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.270
 damage next battle come already 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.909
 wounded it to me a little bit not like 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.100
 Well, how should not subscribe to 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.250
 they are sawed off proper after a while 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.659
 but fortunately if you have a lot of heroes 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.659
 you can simply 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.759
 pick and choose another so iron 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.159
 man stands in our way I know everything 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.159
 secrets well done well what are you a smart guy 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.050
 so spiderman 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.810
 well there i think spiderman should have it 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.660
 defeat let's go to battle let's see how 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.420
 our spider is fighting 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.940
 also characters can be improved in 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.650
 special menus why I like you 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.500
 I would not show all this because 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.510
 it's just plain boring to fight here 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:41.290
 not boring to fight very cool 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.690
 1 1 1 about get a guy make a dash 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.489
 forward we can make a breakthrough back a 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.530
 then immediately ahead and gang up on 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.380
 the enemy here in this way if for 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.940
 hold your fingers hold then do the block 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.790
 on the left yes here it is this block 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.140
 accordingly, the block now is ours 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:05.350
 opponent on the asphalt small pinched finger 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.170
 and he did such a blow, we filled up 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.390
 iron man is very easy 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.560
 graphics are generally super well I donâ€™t know guys 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.320
 nuther amateur 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.239
 we are in orge stessi there somehow done 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.190
 Well, not really svaypa, you look like crazy 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.440
 on the screen there is really possible screen 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.140
 so razdolbat and here precisely all as 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.100
 somehow clearly done and still wanted you 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.829
 say one of the most important 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.530
 features of this game let's go back i 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.690
 back that is in all these accrued 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.350
 menus are there there 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:42.459
 arena mode in which we can fight 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.829
 with real rivals it's very cool 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.299
 There is a mail on which they send you 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:51.160
 all kinds of stocks then there is a vault where 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:56.230
 everything is stored according to your 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.540
 champions here we still have a voice 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.400
 I know what kind of character 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.069
 I can sell, I can improve it 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.579
 for some reason in battle 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.260
 I don't need it 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:12.040
 improve let's try to do it 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.499
 I do not have things to him 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.449
 improve but there must be their fleets 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:23.050
 kind of thing go to tasks go so 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.740
 Generally I advise you to go 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.400
 you this 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.669
 game download and I could even call it 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.039
 something between a fighting game and 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.699
 slasher though there are no buttons 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:40.030
 various strikes and kombas are not particularly for 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:43.030
 to do but nevertheless this slasher 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.630
 very very high quality and pleasant but 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.759
 I caught a bug gamer who liked the video 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.610
 put likes subscribe to the channel 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:56.250
 and most importantly, we play only good ones 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.250
 games all just yet
