00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.990

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.440
 we are you and me again but with a 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.759
 different concept and how does a 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.560
 new concept 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.180
 Of course I'll show you some 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.340
 videoclips of some stupidity and what 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.380

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.199
 five this kid does not lose hope 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.199
 to leave number 67 think 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.590
 if this happens to me I 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.969
 my loves that I have a phone and 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.129
 call that is not used or linked to texts 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.229
 my loves before walking 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.050
 make sure your phone has one that 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.570
 is proof of something similar to this one by 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.579
 what 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.660
 so that the same thing that happened to you does not happen to you 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.770
 to 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.770
 look at your hand 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.390
 and if this happens to me I put that 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.610
 shame 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.700
 many people choose to convert their 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.970
 house in ruins but that has its 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.970
 consequence 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.280
 and if this happens to me I take that 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.369
 mask of shame 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.659
 crazy as you drive engines why not 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.820
 because he throws you and has a way 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.140
 different way the engine to handle 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.140
 a lot of good 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.640
 and if this happens to me I take that 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.930
 mask of shame 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.590

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.590

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.210
 why 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.960
 If this happens to me, I take that 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.729
 mask 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.369
