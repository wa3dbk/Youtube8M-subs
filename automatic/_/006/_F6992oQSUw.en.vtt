70 pipe system on it with the very inner
baffle<00:02:55.519> cut<00:02:56.239> out<00:02:56.709> so<00:02:57.709> it's<00:02:58.099> pretty<00:02:58.730> much<00:02:58.969> a

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000

straight<00:02:59.599> pipe<00:02:59.840> now<00:03:03.459> switch<00:03:07.780> now<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.989> does

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
straight pipe now switch now it does

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.879 
straight pipe now switch now it does
have<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.560> very<00:03:10.040> good<00:03:10.370> amount<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:10.969> compression

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
have a very good amount of compression

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.000 
have a very good amount of compression
you<00:03:12.889> cannot<00:03:13.340> start<00:03:13.699> these<00:03:13.879> bikes<00:03:14.709> this<00:03:15.709> bike

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
you cannot start these bikes this bike

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.030 
you cannot start these bikes this bike
and<00:03:16.400> gear<00:03:17.359> while<00:03:18.139> holding<00:03:18.379> the<00:03:18.530> clutching

because<00:03:19.909> it<00:03:20.269> will<00:03:20.389> just<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:22.040> kickstart<00:03:22.669> will

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
because it will just the kickstart will

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.160 
because it will just the kickstart will
just<00:03:23.030> spin<00:03:23.359> over

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:04:08.650 

all<00:03:30.170> right

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.560
