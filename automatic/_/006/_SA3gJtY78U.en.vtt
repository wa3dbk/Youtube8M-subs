00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.550
 It looks like this is how they have 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.529
 they are not strong for me 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.350

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.959
 let's talk about 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.470
 care so find which purchase

 this is my reinforcer at the moment 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:36.230
 ultra plus is a smart thing at the very 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.880
 In fact, I just use it as a base for 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.030
 manicure as an independent means 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.859
 You just need to go without a manicure in general 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.690
 this means i'm ready to sing 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:50.630
 The following inputs and means that in 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.350
 I like the principle but I don't think that 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.579
 worth it to spend money and this from 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:01.310

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.819
 yellowing agent 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.190
 nail cuticle care plate and 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.950
 I can not say that the effect is super at all 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.140
 duper but a little bit bleached plate but 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:17.130
 As for me, smart enamel for a lot but 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.109
 better i have experience with smart marie 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.530
 cut off my nails almost under 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.110
 root and I made a video 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.000
 let's say so where I reported for two 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.700
 weeks here leave a reference below 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.919
 please see a and last 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:37.890
 the last but one thing is the thing that 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:41.490
 I just need a while when mine 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:44.360
 nails are very fragile and this is a remedy for 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.060
 severin and nail repair products 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:53.010
 scout i have a shade of 300 i don't know in 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.350
 In general, this is such a viscous thing that is 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:00.180
 she she not such a liquid as ordinary varnish 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:03.060
 see here she dries for a very long time but this 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.550
 the thing just gives the iron your cover 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.890
 nails and can be applied on top but 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.230
 a little bit will be valid if you put 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.450
 on red it will be a little milky 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.460
 red and if on such nyudovye 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.970
 what colors it almost will not 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.660
 noticeably this thing is just crazy 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.010

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.669
 This is the right tool for 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:30.090
 spring when avitaminosis in the body and us 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:33.180
 missing these things or the last 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.470
 a thing to show you very often 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.380
 when we have here over here somewhere 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.000
 broken nails a little bit we all cut off 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.479
 but I can offer 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.650
 An alternative solution is varnish varnish glue 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:49.110
 ska so from zinger nail gla 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.680
 in general, so here it looks and there is 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.590
 he still in he has a nose but with a brush 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.960
 to the boiler ungulates called him varnish here 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.000
 much more convenient so small 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.140
 the brush is very comfortable you can just 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.419
 glue varnish Bernini varnish nail can 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.789
 glue just a little bit when here 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:12.360
 dries a little buff polishing 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:14.820
 walk and wear your lacquer on top and will 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:19.110
 general class and nail you yourself then 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.160
 grow in general here and here 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.280
 a secret who wanted to tell you 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.310
 I forgot to take it now but this is not the point if 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:29.040

 two means 1 is toothpaste and the second 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.870
 here is this smart enamel 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.780
 Now I will explain why the first tooth 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:42.870
 paste on at the moment just whitens your 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.480
 nails they become beautiful and flowed away 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.030
 the cuticle is probably due to fasting or 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.750
 for friction, it is unnecessary tears off say 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:54.300

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.430

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.560
 the enamel has dried one layer and i think that 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.970
 when you first go through your nails 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.580
