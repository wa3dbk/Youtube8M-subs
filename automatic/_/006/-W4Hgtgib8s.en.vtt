00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.779
 my channel so dr nokia has today 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.380
 again with a microwave test and 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.679
 This time I have Mike Mitchell 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.260
 cheeseburger well there we are too 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.890
 already at the flood of boxing it looks like that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.900
 good piece of mike using cheeseburger 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.640
 and here he is a serving suggestion 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.730
 is here, of course it again 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.310
 Serving suggestion so the thing is here 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.560
 touted with cheese spread salad 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.600
 tomatoes and of course a delicious one 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.969
 buns if we all that now 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.190
 However, look at it as I know 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.570
 not if that is going to happen 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.430
 microwave I can not really 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.829
 imagine that the cheese in the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.640
 will melt microwave there two 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.520
 resigned citizen fried meatballs with 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.600
 Melted cheese in sesame buns 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.670
 preparation for the unpacked 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.539
 Open cheeseburger and separate 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.079
 heat 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.960
 in the microwave at 600 15 minutes 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.030
 or in a preheated oven at 170 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 degrees ten to twelve minutes we would have 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.060
 recommend the preparation in the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.159
 so prepare the microwave in the 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.570
 Microwave is extra recommended and 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.369
 that's why I will too, of course 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.049
 do accordingly 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.220
 I have citizens for these two skis 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.090
 let me lie, I know, paid 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.850
 that not anymore 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.670
 and yes, the whole thing is half past half 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.460
 Lasted until 28 10 11 20 14 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.950
 So I still have a little time 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:37.040
 total weight 300 grams what is here 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:40.590
 everything in it for the 53 percent 80 percent 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.570
 maybe a fine part 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.909
 Crushed breadcrumbs blablabla 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.680
 wheat and so on so healthy is that 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.990
 definitely not and come now 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.070
 we first small we divide 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.530
 will be a petty bourgeois anyway 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.409
 if you break the walls do so here 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.170
 we have the nice bun then 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.950
 Do we take that and where are they? 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.680
 tomatoes 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.250
 where are the tomatoes of course is here 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.290
 very 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.820
 the suggestion on it but I do not see 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.520
 tomatoes still salad so the whole thing right 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.060
 right after meatballs and here is 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.240
 nothing on it is a dry one 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.620
 skis citizen I would have known that 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.090
 Of course I still agree 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.800
 I bought ingredients here now 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.900
 right on the dry bun with 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.930
 Meatball comes to count in any case 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.060
 now only the part with the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.570
 Microwave right up to welcome 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.670
 back to food testing the citizen knows 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.010
 how bird I believe one and a half 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.220
 minutes in the microwave at 600 watts 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.660
 and the cheese is actually melted 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.100
 Look at this, it looks up 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.630
 each case much better than 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.580
 before and if you stay here and 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.040
 the bun cheese is actually 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.050
 completely melted so the whole 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.630
 already looks very appetizing 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.980
 Of course, not so much as on 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.100
 the packaging touted 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.130
 or as in Serviervorschlag 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.620
 titled without salad or tomatoes without 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.510
 Other dumb and I have to unfortunately 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.400
 really confess I have nothing 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.930
 absolutely nothing in the house 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.940
 fridge anyway with what I 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.440
 but this citizen could celebrate now 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.959
 not clear, it also has a bit 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.489
 the feeling that it was the whole test 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.220
 somehow would not do it justice 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.299
 that's why I'm going to do it all now 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.200
 I'll have a look 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:31.320
 actually fast food fan burger fans the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.900
 Also like to the larger citizen chains 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.280
 like mcdonald's or burger king and the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.280
 Look twice here and that 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.700
 so I once rejected me and it 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.290
 through the warm no cold places 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.290
 not even inside the flesh 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.670
 does not taste so bad so 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:04.319
 lacked a little bit a little bit 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.180
 spice google so sliced ​​moderately missing 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.810
 I think that we are still a great one 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.870
 aftertaste 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.120
 otherwise I can do something remo 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.680
 I'm trying something that tastes 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.450
 I did not think so well 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:25.590
 I really did not expect it 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:26.880
 that it tastes so good so can 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.580
 Of course it's mine too 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:34.289
 first correct meal was 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.759
 Attention first right meal almost 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.710
 then from the microwave how can you 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:43.470
 because the meal decided so please 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.940
 what should I say except that the 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.110
 guinea pig of my roommate 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.479
 just back there 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:55.680
 especially great for the sound recordings 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:58.050
 sound recordings yes there come back to 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.080
 valuation school note system I give 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:06.990
 always notes from 1 to 6 1 very good six 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.880
 sentences very bad and measure price 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.039
 performance ratio a bit like that 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.240
 deducted the Serviervorschlag it works 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.220
 a bit negative in the 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.900
 always a rating if that 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:21.090
 here too much luck and delicious 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.409
 is advertised but taste and 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.849
 there is actually a microwave 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.400
 I'm still totally melted 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:31.020
 there are fascinating about it taste 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.669
 from me a smooth 2 - find 2 enough 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.610
 not because there is so much there 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.340
 something like gherkins and cucumbers 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.599
 even better, yes, no idea about it is missing 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.360
 then really a little more 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:44.759
 cheese because it calls itself a cheeseburger 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.949
 and a son slices cheese is then stop 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.080
 but a little too little I think and 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.949
 Well, what the hell was 2 - I think so 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.870
 will do justice to the whole 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.550
 I'll eat that on now and if 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.110
 I'm honest with the shooting 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.070
 the second thing also for cleaning the 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.870
 have you been mine i hope it has you 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.950
 Like always your thumbs 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.950
 Until next time
