00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
of the brain it follows three precisely

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.600 
of the brain it follows three precisely
defined<00:01:25.300> directions<00:01:25.990> now<00:01:26.979> these<00:01:27.130> directions

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
defined directions now these directions

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.140 
defined directions now these directions
are<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.760> little<00:01:27.910> bit<00:01:28.090> hard<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.330> spot<00:01:28.660> because<00:01:29.470> in

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
are a little bit hard to spot because in

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.400 
are a little bit hard to spot because in
embryological<00:01:31.150> life<00:01:31.690> they're<00:01:32.020> simple

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
embryological life they're simple

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.490 
embryological life they're simple
directions<00:01:32.860> but<00:01:33.220> then<00:01:33.400> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:35.110> adult<00:01:35.410> brain

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
directions but then in the adult brain

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.190 
directions but then in the adult brain
they<00:01:36.160> get<00:01:36.310> very<00:01:36.430> folded<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.300> curled<00:01:37.720> up<00:01:37.960> and

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
they get very folded and curled up and

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.380 
they get very folded and curled up and
so<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:38.950> surface<00:01:39.729> of<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.940> brain<00:01:40.119> that<00:01:40.270> you

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
so that surface of the brain that you

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.390 
so that surface of the brain that you
see<00:01:40.540> with<00:01:40.660> all<00:01:40.810> of<00:01:40.930> its<00:01:41.050> folds<00:01:41.470> has<00:01:41.890> pulled<00:01:42.220> the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
see with all of its folds has pulled the

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.210 
see with all of its folds has pulled the
wires<00:01:42.640> around<00:01:43.090> with<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:44.170> these<00:01:44.619> three

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
wires around with it and so these three

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.880 
wires around with it and so these three
directions<00:01:45.340> are<00:01:45.940> have<00:01:46.660> now<00:01:46.780> become<00:01:46.990> greatly

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
directions are have now become greatly

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.660 
directions are have now become greatly

less the same structure is always
present<00:02:23.260> but<00:02:23.830> as<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.190> go<00:02:24.370> from<00:02:24.580> small<00:02:24.910> simpler

brains<00:02:25.870> up<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.620> larger<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.040> more<00:02:27.160> complicated

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580

brains<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.600> gets<00:02:28.989> more<00:02:29.470> highly<00:02:29.860> curved<00:02:30.190> and

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
develops certain branches and turns but

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.940 
develops certain branches and turns but
the<00:02:34.000> basic<00:02:34.450> theme<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.470> structure<00:02:35.799> is

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
the basic theme of this structure is

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.660 
the basic theme of this structure is

preserved across so as a result of this

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.009 
preserved across so as a result of this
we<00:02:40.299> now<00:02:40.540> have<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:41.140> way<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:42.299> seeing<00:02:43.299> the
