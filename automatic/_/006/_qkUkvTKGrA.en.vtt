00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.920
 backup 1 this this tutorial is 100% 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.150
 well so in full hd because you saw I tried 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.650
 with several tutorials in the function 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.920
 stellar and good we left the folder 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.920
 which one 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.610
 this we leave it as it is 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.979
 second you have to move anything and good 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.869
 now we give this one click to what is 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.810
 the down 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.470
 we click right open with very weird 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.070
 archive 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:08.190
 and good will open this with what comes 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.950
 being winrar now we're going to here we 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.820
 will appear the dot folder will appear 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.680
 this metal and retail or metal and I do not know how 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.810
 you say here we have to click 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.570
 right and delete file but the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.860
 metal folder and this work of this one that 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.670
 is to avoid this that we now give to 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.890
 cents 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.650
 minecraft we give it in texture we give 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.349
 where says 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.480
 and here you are not all positioners 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.329
 the textures here we look for the one that 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.060
 call this point png and good obviously 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:47.269
 this is the dress so what are we going 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.069
 to do will be to copy the name we give 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.290
 control set 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.290
 and then let's give a click we give 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:02.060
 right click delete files 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:04.390
 it is expected that it will begin to guess 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.130
