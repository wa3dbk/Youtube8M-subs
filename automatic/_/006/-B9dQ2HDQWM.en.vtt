00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.859 
there's a little bit of a dip where the
home<00:02:02.009> button<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.729> other<00:02:02.880> than<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.149> it's

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
home button is but other than that it's

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.080 
home button is but other than that it's
really<00:02:03.960> pretty<00:02:04.680> hard<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> edges

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
really pretty hard to see and the edges

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.789 
really pretty hard to see and the edges
are<00:02:06.240> beveled<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.079> that's<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> things

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
are beveled and that's one of the things

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.160 
are beveled and that's one of the things
a<00:02:07.890> lot<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.160> screen<00:02:08.489> protector<00:02:08.989> makers<00:02:09.989> are

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
a lot of the screen protector makers are

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.300 
a lot of the screen protector makers are
doing<00:02:10.500> now<00:02:10.649> now<00:02:10.979> on

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
doing now now on

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.250 
doing now now on
that<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.940> one<00:02:12.150> also<00:02:12.360> has<00:02:12.569> an<00:02:12.930> oleophobic

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
that this one also has an oleophobic

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.410 
that this one also has an oleophobic
coating<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.400> don't<00:02:14.700> see<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.970> smudges<00:02:15.390> of

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
coating so you don't see the smudges of

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.620 
coating so you don't see the smudges of
your<00:02:15.660> finger<00:02:16.020> it's<00:02:16.590> super<00:02:17.160> clear<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:18.330> also

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
your finger it's super clear it's also

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.990 
your finger it's super clear it's also
very<00:02:19.050> strong<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.770> won't<00:02:20.040> scratch<00:02:20.370> just<00:02:20.730> from

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
very strong and won't scratch just from

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.600 
very strong and won't scratch just from
ski<00:02:21.330> just<00:02:21.810> from<00:02:21.989> keys<00:02:22.230> themselves<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.489> you'd

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
ski just from keys themselves so you'd

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.979 
ski just from keys themselves so you'd
need<00:02:23.790> something<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.209> little<00:02:24.420> bit<00:02:24.510> harder<00:02:24.690> than

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
need something a little bit harder than

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.320 
need something a little bit harder than
keys<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.590> order<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.010> scratch<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.239> I've

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
keys in order to scratch this so I've

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.570 
keys in order to scratch this so I've
been<00:02:27.420> using<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.050> about<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.500> week<00:02:28.620> or<00:02:29.099> so<00:02:29.310> and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
this one hasn't scratched at all so that

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.280 
this one hasn't scratched at all so that
one's<00:03:13.290> really<00:03:13.860> nice<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.549> I<00:03:15.359> love<00:03:15.630> how<00:03:15.840> thin<00:03:16.170> it

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
I've done a review on that it's a little

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.729 
I've done a review on that it's a little
camera<00:03:24.269> accessory<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:24.840> fits<00:03:25.079> over<00:03:25.230> here<00:03:25.560> as
