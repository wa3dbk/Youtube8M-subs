00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.410
 interesting in general the whole event 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.830
 find out what what what is this because 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.150
 I'm basically not a fan of ruha but 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.130
 interesting something new in our city 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.330
 happens we came here with chinese 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.070
 rock bands so we are very 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.170
 interested in seeing how they are 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.779
 plays most interest me 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.490
 foreign guest performers of course interesting 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.590
 what they will do what effects use 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.870
 technical side 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.600
 in general we are interested of course what 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.219
 cook the most butenko that he had in 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.640
 seeing under such a unique festival she 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.640
 more needed 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.600
 either just others I think something in 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.219
 whole event which will help both 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.100
 our groups show themselves because I 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.050
 I think that the people of our city 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.609
 Many groups do not even know why this 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.619
 great chance for our group hands 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.500
 the first time the festival is held therefore 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.480
 it is not known how she 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.460
 may affect the fate of local 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.390
 musicians seems to me at the moment 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.490
 as if local and not local for all 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.620
 equally important I thought at all 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.470
 were going to come bath curl 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.680
 great 25 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:37.440
 she ago 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:41.600
 and what will happen between on content 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.600
 I write to 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.020
 everything 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.530
 here are the teeth
