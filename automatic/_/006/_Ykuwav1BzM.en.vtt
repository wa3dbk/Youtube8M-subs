couldn't find it on eBay and stuff so

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.699 
couldn't find it on eBay and stuff so
what<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.180> do<00:02:29.269> is<00:02:29.510> I'm<00:02:29.660> going<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.959> do<00:02:30.049> it<00:02:30.200> upside

then<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.140> pull<00:02:36.440> my<00:02:36.530> ponytail<00:02:36.980> into<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.400> middle

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
then I pull my ponytail into the middle

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.009 
then I pull my ponytail into the middle
of<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> Topsy<00:02:38.239> tail<00:02:40.750> then<00:02:41.750> we're<00:02:41.840> going<00:02:41.959> to

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
of the Topsy tail then we're going to

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:52.050 
of the Topsy tail then we're going to
pull<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.470> up<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:43.370> through

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.790 

let's<00:02:52.630> see<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:52.750> made<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.080> ponytail<00:02:53.440> two<00:02:53.560> types

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
let's see I made the ponytail two types

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.310 
let's see I made the ponytail two types
and<00:02:54.010> then<00:02:54.190> we<00:02:54.280> sit<00:02:54.460> in<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.640> little<00:02:54.700> bit<00:02:54.910> more

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
and then we sit in a little bit more

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.730 
and then we sit in a little bit more
we'll<00:02:56.320> pull<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.590> through<00:02:56.740> without<00:02:56.890> color<00:02:58.740> so

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
we'll pull it through without color so

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.440 
we'll pull it through without color so
pretty<00:03:00.780> okay

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
pretty okay

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:14.700 
pretty okay
her<00:03:04.450> hair<00:03:04.660> is<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:04.810> thick

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.690 

all<00:03:15.310> right

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.880

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
now we're going to separate these two or

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.820 
now we're going to separate these two or
at<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.190> point<00:03:23.520> into<00:03:23.790> two<00:03:24.000> pieces<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.830> you
