00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.219
 Hello, guys, how are you today? 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.070
 a video that I think may result 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.020
 entertaining because many times you ask me 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.210
 I make videos about outfit and all this 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.070
 and the truth is that I always try 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.860
 to take up the subject of fashion a little 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.019
 channel but for lack of time almost 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.109
 always in the end it left him a little 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.150
 on the side and I really like it a lot 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.440
 true that is one of my greatest 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.330
 Hobbies together with makeup is worth 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.780
 the theme of the cloths you already know 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.610
 you but that I never just got 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.430
 seriously so I do not know I've proposed 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.699
 I wish I could fulfill it but I've 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.220
 proposed that at least at least one video 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.860
 of this type yes I want to go up to the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.820
 week or every 15 days to such a thing 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.049
 ok because good is a way of 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.150
 to please the people who want to 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.979
 watch fashion videos on the channel and also 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.600
 You can enjoy these videos because 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.850
 I really like doing it I like it 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.220
 combine I do not know how to give it ideas that you 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.049
 Do you do it to me anyway? I'm not going to 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.720
 roll up more like I say this is going to 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.370
 be the first video of 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.380
 I think it's the first video I make 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.050
 only one outfit and not combining 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.030
 Mario and all this is valid and I hope so 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.490
 As I tell you, I can do at least one 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.610
 a week or one every 15 days is worth 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.170
 according to allow me my free time and good 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.270
 nothing that I will leave you with the proposal 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.040
 today to see if you like it if it 's like that 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.770
 you want me to keep making videos of this 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.870
 type can give the finger voucher or 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.840
 leave me a comment what you want and 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.370
 nothing and especially since I say that 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.010
 I hope you like it and that you have 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.750
 understanding and I say understanding because in 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.960
 this fashion you already know that each one 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.650
 He has his style and his taste if someone does not 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.050
 He is not fond of vintage style 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.390
 the craft and maybe you do not like it but 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.070
 Well, be a little sympathetic. 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.440
 I will not you taking different things 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.150
 Worry that I 'm not vintage either 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.979
 now there is to death with that and never 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.350
 change from time to time change the roll 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.670
 of albert it is good that they go scratching a 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.670
 I leave you with the outfit 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.459
 Today's set is vintage style 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.890
 and will have as a base pledge this 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.959
 camel dress you see here the garment 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.360
 it's lady style with three quarter sleeves 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.569
 on the other hand they have a rounded neck 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.340
 very nice very elegant and down 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.530
 well cut lady with which 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.840
 accentuates we go very well waist and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.450
 we hide the hip this is going to 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.090
 come very well if we have a style of 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.920
 body rather with pear silhouette is worth or 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.840
 for example the typical clock silhouette 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.670
 of sand because I already say it's going to 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.590
 favor the curves and we will 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.190
 disguise the excess that we can have in 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.530
 the hip 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.510
 the dress comes prepared to put 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.910
 a belt but as it did not have any 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.590
 I have put this one here of 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.800
 stradivarius that I thought was very 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.750
 cool because of the texture and the 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.060
 thickness as per the color because 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.160
 contrasts very well with that of the dress and 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.900
 Well this belt we can put 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.880
 several ways I have put it loose or 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.040
 we can also make such a knot and 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.480
 How am I doing here? 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.240
 this way is a little bit more 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.360
 showy we can also simply 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.430
 finish placing the belt on the 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.620
 dress and it stays such that it does a little 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.330
 more straight ahead but to me 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.570
 honestly as I like the loose 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.570
 A) Yes 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.230
 as a complement I have chosen to use in 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.120
 hand this beautiful praise ring 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.900
 I think it's great that it's very 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.700
 ok with the set and the color and how 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.560
 pending this from here of essence 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.480
 vintage that are a montery that also 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.480
 they go that nor painted the dress 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.770
 if we decide to put a dress on 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.390
 cold season as appropriate as you know 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.160
 is to put on good socks that are 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.410
 bushy that are thick and that we 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.450
 wrap your legs very well 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.730
 example are chocolate color or 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.319
 chocolate color are chalcedony and the 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.970
 I have been for a while but let's go 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.310
 they have come out super good I have used it 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.200
 lots of times and we're going like 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.390
 new shoes on your part I 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.370
 They seem a little cute to me at least 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.040
 they love are from the firm Martinelli and 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.500
 they are mary jane style vouchers as well as 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.320
 Closed in front crossed with 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.180
 buckles are very feminine also more 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.830
 well vintage style and good I think 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.710
 that are beautiful they also have a 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.229
 little bit of heel but it's not excessive with 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.690
 which does not end up tiring us very much 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.550
 foot worth it does not end up very sore and it does not 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.360
 apart the color seems precious to me very 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.360
 very wearable 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.790
 and although the dress is very nice 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.410
 just do not forget that we are in 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.970
 winter and that we will need a 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.250
 extra layer so I think it 's 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.590
 Sana cardigan for example in color 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.120
 Clarito is going to bring that warmth that 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.400
 we need and apart a touch of 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.750
 luminosity look because I do not touch 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.750
 brown is a bit neutral 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.500
 Yes I think so sticking 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.060
 and as a bag I've been through this one here 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.889
 from my jacket that I think has a 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.740
 color very much in keeping with the rest of the fed 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.930
 and also with the style also has the 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.520
 advantage that we can put it crossed 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.720
 which is always more comfortable and more 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.720
 sure to go down the street 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.060
 and in general I think we're already 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.539
 ready to go from pingo a little kiss 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.539
 bye 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.879
 and up to here the proposal of 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:58.400
 outfits this week I hope that you 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:01.659
 have enjoyed a very big kiss and we 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.659
 we see in the next video chao 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.020
 and
