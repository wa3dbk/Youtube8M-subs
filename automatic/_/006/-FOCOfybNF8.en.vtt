let's talk a little about the display

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.769 
let's talk a little about the display
before<00:00:25.400> we<00:00:25.550> get<00:00:25.640> going<00:00:25.939> you<00:00:26.360> got<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.510> pair<00:00:26.750> of

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
before we get going you got a pair of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.499 
before we get going you got a pair of
buttons<00:00:27.050> over<00:00:27.200> here<00:00:27.320> on<00:00:27.529> either<00:00:27.650> side<00:00:28.010> you

show our range and the setting Marin
give<00:00:35.629> the<00:00:35.750> full<00:00:35.960> range<00:00:36.230> of<00:00:36.680> your<00:00:36.980> three

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
give the full range of your three

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.780 
give the full range of your three
assists<00:00:38.920> here<00:00:39.920> that<00:00:40.190> I<00:00:40.220> would<00:00:40.370> showing<00:00:40.670> our

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
assists here that I would showing our

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.960 
assists here that I would showing our
average<00:00:41.120> speed<00:00:41.440> max<00:00:42.440> in<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.769> speed<00:00:43.070> and<00:00:43.370> this

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
average speed max in the speed and this

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.490 
average speed max in the speed and this
setting<00:00:44.210> here<00:00:44.540> it<00:00:44.720> will<00:00:44.809> show<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.050> what<00:00:45.260> gear

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
setting here it will show you what gear

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.939 
setting here it will show you what gear
you're<00:00:45.620> in<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:47.690> when<00:00:48.050> you<00:00:48.199> shift<00:00:48.260> regarding

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
you're in and when you shift regarding

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.860 
you're in and when you shift regarding
regardless<00:00:49.820> of<00:00:49.969> which<00:00:50.090> mode<00:00:50.360> you're<00:00:50.540> in<00:00:50.660> when

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
regardless of which mode you're in when

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.299 
regardless of which mode you're in when
you<00:00:50.960> shift<00:00:51.200> it<00:00:51.380> will<00:00:51.500> tell<00:00:51.800> you<00:00:51.920> for<00:00:52.100> just<00:00:52.190> a

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
you shift it will tell you for just a

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.880 
you shift it will tell you for just a
second

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.420 

so<00:00:55.370> our<00:00:55.550> standard<00:00:55.970> mode<00:00:56.180> is<00:00:56.870> right<00:00:57.380> here<00:00:57.890> got<00:00:58.370> a

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
so our standard mode is right here got a

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.730 
so our standard mode is right here got a
clock<00:00:58.790> it's<00:00:59.570> over<00:00:59.750> here<00:00:59.960> you<00:01:00.140> can<00:01:00.290> choose<00:01:00.530> your

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
clock it's over here you can choose your

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.350 
clock it's over here you can choose your
three<00:01:00.980> levels<00:01:01.280> of<00:01:01.370> assist<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:01.940> cluding<00:01:02.210> off

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
three levels of assist and cluding off

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.780 
three levels of assist and cluding off
which<00:01:02.660> makes<00:01:02.810> four<00:01:03.110> levels<00:01:03.470> so<00:01:04.129> we<00:01:04.160> go<00:01:04.370> down<00:01:04.580> we

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
which makes four levels so we go down we

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.910 
which makes four levels so we go down we
got<00:01:05.000> off<00:01:06.250> eco<00:01:07.360> norm<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.810> hi<00:01:09.530> I'm<00:01:09.710> going<00:01:09.860> to

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
got off eco norm and hi I'm going to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.580 
got off eco norm and hi I'm going to
leave<00:01:10.040> it<00:01:10.130> on<00:01:10.190> high<00:01:10.430> shoot<00:01:11.330> right<00:01:11.810> handed<00:01:12.170> now

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
leave it on high shoot right handed now

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.170 
leave it on high shoot right handed now
the<00:01:12.650> one<00:01:12.920> thing<00:01:13.130> I<00:01:13.340> really<00:01:13.640> like<00:01:13.790> about<00:01:13.820> this

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
the one thing I really like about this

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.150 
the one thing I really like about this
bike<00:01:14.390> is<00:01:14.420> something<00:01:15.020> mid<00:01:15.410> drive<00:01:15.620> bikes<00:01:15.860> have

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
bike is something mid drive bikes have

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.640 
bike is something mid drive bikes have
needed<00:01:16.430> for<00:01:16.580> a<00:01:16.610> long<00:01:16.640> time<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.660> that<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:18.620> a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
needed for a long time and that is a

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.550 
needed for a long time and that is a
power<00:01:18.979> interrupt<00:01:19.580> when<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:20.150> shifts<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:21.500> that

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
power interrupt when it shifts and that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.770 
power interrupt when it shifts and that
really<00:01:22.520> takes<00:01:22.760> a<00:01:22.910> load<00:01:23.090> off<00:01:23.120> the<00:01:23.390> drivetrain

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
setting how's it shift over here burn

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.970 
setting how's it shift over here burn
third<00:01:29.900> gear<00:01:30.080> now<00:01:30.290> we're<00:01:30.500> going<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.650> go<00:01:30.770> up<00:01:30.860> the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
so here at insta neatest bike warehouse

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.859 
so here at insta neatest bike warehouse
they're<00:01:37.149> having<00:01:37.329> a<00:01:37.390> demo<00:01:37.570> day<00:01:37.840> so<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:39.869> don't

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
they're having a demo day so I don't

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:41.700 
they're having a demo day so I don't
know<00:01:40.990> if<00:01:41.049> you're<00:01:41.140> going<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.320> be<00:01:41.409> able<00:01:41.469> to<00:01:41.590> feel

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
know if you're going to be able to feel

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.899 
know if you're going to be able to feel
it<00:01:41.860> so<00:01:41.979> I'm<00:01:42.039> going<00:01:42.159> to<00:01:42.219> pedal<00:01:42.490> really<00:01:42.579> hard

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
it so I'm going to pedal really hard

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.330 
it so I'm going to pedal really hard
under<00:01:43.090> full<00:01:43.329> power<00:01:43.649> shift<00:01:44.649> a<00:01:44.799> little<00:01:45.100> minor

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340

electrics let up on the power to loud

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.419 
electrics let up on the power to loud
make<00:01:55.869> a<00:01:55.899> nice<00:01:56.140> clean<00:01:56.380> shift<00:01:56.799> without<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.159> lot<00:01:57.340> of
