00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.219 
over here all of this helps to bring the
wind<00:01:56.670> over<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.150> mirror<00:01:57.510> those<00:01:57.869> are<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.080> kind

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
wind over the mirror those are the kind

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.420 
wind over the mirror those are the kind
of<00:01:58.260> things<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.530> went<00:01:58.770> into<00:01:58.890> getting<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
of things that went into getting the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.240 
of things that went into getting the
coefficient<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.270> drag<00:02:00.450> down<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.140> 0.29<00:02:01.950> which

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
coefficient of drag down to 0.29 which

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.850 
coefficient of drag down to 0.29 which
is<00:02:02.430> which<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.450> tremendous<00:02:04.049> and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
is which is really really tremendous and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.399 
is which is really really tremendous and
I<00:02:05.220> believe<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.729> Ag<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.090> point<00:02:06.390> three<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.930> just

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
I believe in Ag is point three so just

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.139 
I believe in Ag is point three so just
to<00:02:07.470> put<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.799> perspective<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.549> you<00:02:08.850> can<00:02:08.970> see

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
to put it in perspective and you can see

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.820 
to put it in perspective and you can see
that<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> styling<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.320> pretty<00:02:10.560> pretty

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
that the styling is is pretty pretty

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.490 
that the styling is is pretty pretty
good<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.580> leaf<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.970> really<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.660> great<00:02:13.049> driving

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
good the leaf is really a great driving

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.009 
good the leaf is really a great driving

to bag weight ratio it handles quite

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.610 
to bag weight ratio it handles quite
nicely<00:02:50.609> and<00:02:51.139> accelerates<00:02:52.139> it's<00:02:52.439> just

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.559 
indicator says battery level low you can
see<00:03:04.409> 11<00:03:04.950> mile<00:03:05.159> range<00:03:05.489> is<00:03:05.790> flashing<00:03:06.150> and

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
see 11 mile range is flashing and

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.559 
see 11 mile range is flashing and
there's<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.590> orange<00:03:08.340> what<00:03:08.760> looks<00:03:08.969> like<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.180> gas

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
there's a orange what looks like a gas

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
pump it's really a charging station with

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.610 
pump it's really a charging station with
a<00:03:11.790> plug<00:03:12.269> on<00:03:12.389> the<00:03:12.510> end<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.719> it<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:12.989> that's<00:03:13.349> what's

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
a plug on the end of it so that's what's

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.890 
a plug on the end of it so that's what's
happening<00:03:14.069> on<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.549> dash<00:03:14.939> and<00:03:15.299> in<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.629> center

for<00:03:23.519> stations<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.060> we're<00:03:24.150> gonna<00:03:24.269> do<00:03:24.419> that<00:03:26.840> it's

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
for stations so we're gonna do that it's

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.140 
for stations so we're gonna do that it's
searching<00:03:28.319> for<00:03:28.349> nearby<00:03:28.859> stations<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.760> it's

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
searching for nearby stations and it's

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.390 
searching for nearby stations and it's
located<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.720> couple<00:03:31.049> which<00:03:31.229> thankfully<00:03:32.190> is

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
located a couple which thankfully is

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.149 
located a couple which thankfully is
right<00:03:32.609> here<00:03:32.819> good<00:03:33.120> old<00:03:33.269> Nissan<00:03:33.599> wait<00:03:34.159> but

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
right here good old Nissan wait but

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.679 
right here good old Nissan wait but
that's<00:03:35.280> essentially<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.879> process<00:03:36.329> you'd<00:03:36.479> go

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
that's essentially the process you'd go

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.339 
that's essentially the process you'd go
through<00:03:36.959> now<00:03:37.859> as<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:39.000> can<00:03:39.120> see<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.840> -<00:03:40.019> looks

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
through now as you can see this - looks

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.210
