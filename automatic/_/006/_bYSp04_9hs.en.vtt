here the more of the mesh style here and
from<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> side<00:01:06.720> it'll<00:01:07.170> help<00:01:07.470> their<00:01:07.680> range<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
from the side it'll help their range of

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.390 
from the side it'll help their range of
motion

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
motion

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.490 
motion
it's<00:01:08.549> where<00:01:08.880> Nike<00:01:09.299> said<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.900> when<00:01:10.260> players

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
it's where Nike said that when players

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.320 
it's where Nike said that when players
sweat<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.040> most<00:01:11.280> then<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:11.909> needed<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
sweat the most then they needed that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.539 
sweat the most then they needed that
breathability<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> side<00:01:14.340> so

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
breathability here and on the side so

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.929 
breathability here and on the side so
you'll<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:15.200> that<00:01:16.200> area<00:01:16.619> move<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.700> will<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:17.909> a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
you'll see that area move that will be a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.190 
you'll see that area move that will be a
big<00:01:18.180> difference<00:01:18.360> there<00:01:18.720> from<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> players

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
big difference there from the players

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.020 
big difference there from the players
from<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.560> field<00:01:19.830> standpoint<00:01:20.340> especially<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
from a field standpoint especially a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.210 
from a field standpoint especially a
receiver<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.689> Witten<00:01:22.080> who<00:01:22.409> uses<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.890> range

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
receiver like Witten who uses that range

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
receiver like Witten who uses that range
of<00:01:23.400> motion<00:01:23.460> tries<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.240> get<00:01:24.360> his<00:01:24.479> hands<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
of motion tries to get his hands in the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.570 
of motion tries to get his hands in the
air<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> make<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> catches<00:01:25.710> speaking<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.430> that
