00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.190
 When I was little, my doctor told me 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.690
 I had a volcano in my belly I was 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.769
 asleep but at any time 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.769
 I could wake up 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.770
 Crohn's disease is a process 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.110
 chronic inflammatory that can affect 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.779
 any part of the digestive tract if 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.790
 well most often affects the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.790
 end of the small intestine and the 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.030
 colon and patients who suffer from 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:40.110
 disease usually manifest the form 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.769
 of abdominal pain of diarrhea and other 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.769
 overall status 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.900
 70% of patients do not respond 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.680
 treatments that we currently have and 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.450
 they end up needing surgery therefore 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.420
 we are very far from having a 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.760
 optimal treatment for this disease 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.449
 and we need 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.340
 resources to develop projects of 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.830
 research of both new drugs 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.060
 as in innovative ways of 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.060
 treatment like cell therapy 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.950
 listen to the music was for me 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.170
 transport me to another world where I do not 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.200
 there were no hospital beds 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.060
 serums or anything and always the music has 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.369
 been a good therapy for me even 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.909
 when I went into the operating room when I 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.700
 They had to operate while I was sleeping I 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.280
 I sang a song to give me 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.069
 good energies and so that everything was 10 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.539
 then I guess that's what the 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:47.880
 idea to join crohn and music and make a 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.310
 charity concert to raise money 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.459
 for new research for this 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.459
 disease 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.450
 ah 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.230
 we are already here 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.709
 and you 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.629
 find out
