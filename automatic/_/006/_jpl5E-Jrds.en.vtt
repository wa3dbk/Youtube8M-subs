00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.940
 durable shemka I did not particularly delay 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.750
 had their own problems so you 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.059
 excuse me here's the scheme by which 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.969
 self-excitation generator is working 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.529
 Immediately, I note that this is what 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.119
 here and so take this classic 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.859
 the generator these years already have 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.490
 current generators I especially do not 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.939
 Modified rather did not develop it 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.680
 already developed not by me immediately I will say 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.100
 would just use this effect like him 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.020
 It happens especially too difficult 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.750
 answer but he is here further if u 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.960
 you 8 generator will be here at anchor 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.239
 stand brushes get them brushes 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.449
 we remove relyushku she 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.730
 one contact is drilled directly 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.129
 goes on plus there timka second contact 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.379
 we burn on a minus it for the person 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.950
 which is very much requested is burning very 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.180
 much need not forgot know but sorry 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.439
 I have tightened the second I want to immediately 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.970
 to tell 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.740
 voltage will not immediately not from small 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.090
 turns 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.820
 the voltage will start somewhere with 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:27.189
 if on tachometer 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:29.110
 somewhere from 4000 and for 0 to 4000 with us 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.320
 there was tension and then she 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.869
 it works if you go down below somewhere 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.740
 most likely 1000 rpm or a bit 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.970
 less than a thousand turns and a generator 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:46.630
 Well, not enough for work, you have it 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.990
 the flow is roughly put out again 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.450
 will know to re-sound to 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.179
 generation appeared again so you need 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.729
 will either do something with pulleys 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.649
 to increase speed 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.470
 initial if the engine is small 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.409
 resourceful either if it is normal but 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.679
 if this is a regular engine I don't know 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.540
 what a trump is worth if you usually believe 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.840
 it basically everything should be fine 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.319
 farther at the exit we get not 12 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.350
 volt 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.010
 Immediately warn you that people who want 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.459
 try on without a regulator relay he 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.359
 will give all that he can give 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:34.840
 black probably need 30 volts somewhere 20 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:39.190
 20 volts it will issue freely to 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.470
 36 volt light bulb when I start at 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.660
 Start it on full glow on on 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.380
 it works a little less later 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.690
 enough power chainsaws to 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.470
 I did not put on the engine 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.299
 I did not have time to experiment I left 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:01.959
 hometown gave us here in principle 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:04.780
 on the scheme that you can still add such 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.639
 say here you can put 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.840
 capacitor so that the fall was when 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.840
 turnovers will fall less than 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.070
 the generator works to lower here 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.280
 peak which he will be on 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.670
 fall dropped heavily eyes 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.300
 generator stalled 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:35.410
 here, too, can be added to the output, I would 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:39.470
 Of course I put a good capacitor 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:44.090
 to smooth 1 and jump can even to 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:47.270
 the restaurant if this is all man 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:54.020
 who wants to do no experiment 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:57.200
 use his car if if 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.530
 the inverter allows you to work here jumps 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.470
 free to eat means basically you can 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.470
 nothing much to do in 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.440
 Basically everyone who wants to repeat 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.650
 repeat the only thing back 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.800
 I repeat that there will not be 14 not 12 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.750
 volt on a lot more so you can 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.680
 burn if you try just on 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.419
 car and make you can burn the light bulbs 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.280
 everything else all electronics all that 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.000
 there may be and before the voltage will be 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.160
 very high and most probably 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.890
 the last thing I want to add is that in such 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.540
 mode, the generator will give all the same 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:41.690
 he can without any restrictions 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.220
 it is naturally fraught with overheating if 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.080
 on his chest a little more than a ton 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.040
 can naturally burn also 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.470
 warn in this so that again 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.210
 everything comes with tests with experiments 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:59.120
 I especially did not test how much he 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.900
 survivability the survivability of these generators 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.010
 so I will be glad if you make an answer 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.180
 by 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.630
 how he lived on a quiet 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.770
 I will survive or how much he worked all 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.729
 Thanks for attention 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.729
 successful experiments for you
