 water circulated 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.410
 giving temperature difference salon more than 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.660
 ascetic but I will not grumble because 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.590
 such little car they drove and quite 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.540
 respectable gentlemen and even whole families 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.060
 of course in this fiat 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.240
 sit comfortably even to man 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.360
 average height is not easy the distance between 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.790
 the back of the chair and the steering wheel is quite small 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.500
 amazing nights stuffy at first sight 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.840
 motor accelerates the car completely 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.440
 decently you just need to get used to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.090
 gears 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.760
 cramped little car and so 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.620
 closely that shift knob 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.630
 is under my knee and to

 synchronizers were 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.200
 The top 2 gears valyl very bright and 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.850

 phrase in relation to 508 on 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.049
 modern language sounds naive 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.909
 maximum speed is on the passport only 85 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.360
 kilometers per hour but for its time 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.530
 it was an advanced car with him 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.829
