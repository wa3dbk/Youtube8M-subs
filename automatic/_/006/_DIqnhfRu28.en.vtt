00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.160 
format come October they'll still be
around<00:04:31.740> in<00:04:32.100> 12<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.430> printed<00:04:32.880> so<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:33.630> know<00:04:33.870> what

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
around in 12 is printed so you know what

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.790 
around in 12 is printed so you know what
better<00:04:34.350> than<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.560> print<00:04:34.860> oring<00:04:35.220> as<00:04:35.640> an<00:04:36.210> answer

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
better than to print oring as an answer

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.640 
better than to print oring as an answer
so<00:04:37.800> now<00:04:37.920> we<00:04:37.980> have<00:04:38.280> explorer<00:04:39.380> explorer<00:04:40.380> is<00:04:40.500> one

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
so now we have explorer explorer is one

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.830 
so now we have explorer explorer is one
of<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.800> cards<00:04:41.160> that<00:04:41.370> I<00:04:41.640> feel<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.510> know<00:04:42.630> is

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
of the cards that I feel you know is

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.500 
of the cards that I feel you know is
from<00:04:43.620> a<00:04:43.680> set<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.400> it<00:04:44.700> could<00:04:44.880> have<00:04:45.000> could

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
from a set that it could have could

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.840 
from a set that it could have could
eventually<00:04:45.750> be<00:04:46.020> reprinted<00:04:46.740> just<00:04:47.490> because<00:04:47.730> of

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
eventually be reprinted just because of

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.880 
eventually be reprinted just because of
the<00:04:47.880> fact<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.240> again<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.930> does<00:04:49.200> not<00:04:49.350> have<00:04:49.620> a

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
the fact that again it does not have a

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.970 
the fact that again it does not have a
block<00:04:50.280> only<00:04:50.640> print<00:04:51.050> type<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.200> ability<00:04:52.560> you

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
block only print type of ability you

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.950 
block only print type of ability you
know<00:04:53.070> it's<00:04:53.669> essentially<00:04:54.120> a<00:04:54.300> better<00:04:54.660> version

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
know it's essentially a better version

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.200 
know it's essentially a better version
of<00:04:55.380> rampant<00:04:56.340> growth<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.880> akan<00:04:57.540> can<00:04:57.720> trip

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
of rampant growth and akan can trip

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.670 
of rampant growth and akan can trip
obviously<00:05:00.210> after<00:05:00.300> that<00:05:00.540> got<00:05:00.960> in<00:05:01.230> question

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
obviously after that got in question

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.960 
obviously after that got in question
kozilek<00:05:02.750> again<00:05:03.750> Inquisition<00:05:04.580> better<00:05:05.580> version

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
kozilek again Inquisition better version

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.480 
kozilek again Inquisition better version
of<00:05:06.030> duress<00:05:06.360> for<00:05:06.900> three<00:05:07.080> and<00:05:07.200> under<00:05:07.290> now<00:05:08.250> grin

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
of duress for three and under now grin

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.830 
of duress for three and under now grin
not<00:05:08.700> saying<00:05:08.940> duress<00:05:09.240> wouldn't<00:05:09.540> also<00:05:09.720> be

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
not saying duress wouldn't also be

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.320 
not saying duress wouldn't also be
printed<00:05:10.110> in<00:05:10.200> that<00:05:10.380> set<00:05:10.650> of<00:05:11.310> info<00:05:11.790> I'm<00:05:12.060> just

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
printed in that set of info I'm just

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.000 
printed in that set of info I'm just
saying<00:05:12.540> they<00:05:12.900> could<00:05:13.050> also<00:05:13.170> refer<00:05:13.410> it<00:05:13.650> there

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
saying they could also refer it there

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.500 
saying they could also refer it there
they<00:05:14.130> could<00:05:14.250> also<00:05:14.370> print<00:05:14.670> Inquisition<00:05:15.450> of

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
they could also print Inquisition of

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.260 
they could also print Inquisition of
Gaza<00:05:15.630> lack<00:05:16.760> obviously<00:05:17.760> after<00:05:17.880> that<00:05:18.060> for

mystic asked I've actually seen a couple

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.090 
mystic asked I've actually seen a couple
people<00:05:48.480> talk<00:05:48.780> about<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:49.140> I've<00:05:49.260> seen<00:05:49.470> pro<00:05:49.860> I've

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
people talk about it I've seen pro I've

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.220 
people talk about it I've seen pro I've
heard<00:05:50.430> pros<00:05:50.640> talk<00:05:50.850> about<00:05:51.090> this<00:05:51.180> card<00:05:51.420> and<00:05:51.630> they

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
heard pros talk about this card and they

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.250 
heard pros talk about this card and they
said<00:05:52.500> it's<00:05:53.400> good<00:05:53.580> number<00:05:53.820> format<00:05:54.150> that<00:05:54.900> alone

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
said it's good number format that alone

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.080 
said it's good number format that alone
makes<00:05:56.010> me<00:05:56.130> think<00:05:56.400> it<00:05:56.490> needs<00:05:56.640> be<00:05:56.730> reprinted

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
makes me think it needs be reprinted

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.250 
makes me think it needs be reprinted
that<00:05:57.720> and<00:05:57.990> the<00:05:58.170> price<00:05:58.380> tag<00:05:58.560> of<00:05:58.590> $25<00:05:59.340> definitely

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
that and the price tag of $25 definitely

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.820 
that and the price tag of $25 definitely
means<00:06:01.260> it<00:06:01.440> needs<00:06:01.530> to<00:06:01.650> be<00:06:01.710> reprinted<00:06:03.830> obviously

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
means it needs to be reprinted obviously

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.970 
means it needs to be reprinted obviously
