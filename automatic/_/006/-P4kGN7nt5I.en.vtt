you're running you can always do that

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.820 
you're running you can always do that
definitely<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> good<00:00:26.849> option<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.109> now<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
definitely a good option to have now a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.500 
definitely a good option to have now a
lot<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.160> these<00:00:29.220> DVD<00:00:29.640> recorders<00:00:30.060> are<00:00:30.240> probably

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
lot of these DVD recorders are probably

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.330 
lot of these DVD recorders are probably
all<00:00:30.689> made<00:00:30.900> by<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.109> same<00:00:31.230> company<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:31.949> Taiwan

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
all made by the same company in Taiwan

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.610 
all made by the same company in Taiwan
or<00:00:32.369> China<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.149> really<00:00:33.690> doesn't<00:00:33.989> matter<00:00:34.110> this

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
or China so really doesn't matter this

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.799 
or China so really doesn't matter this
one<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> benq<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.640> don't<00:00:35.969> know<00:00:36.120> where<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.510> got<00:00:36.600> I

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
one is a benq I don't know where I got I

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.479 
one is a benq I don't know where I got I
think<00:00:36.960> probably<00:00:37.559> newegg<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.370> those

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
think probably newegg one of those

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.310 
think probably newegg one of those
places<00:00:38.670> probably<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.540> twenty<00:00:39.840> dollars<00:00:40.170> or

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
places probably like twenty dollars or

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.889 
places probably like twenty dollars or
something<00:00:41.120> so<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> don't<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:42.750> there's<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
something so I don't think there's a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.319 
something so I don't think there's a
real<00:00:43.140> necessity<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:44.010> spend<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.760> hundred

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
real necessity to spend a hundred

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.720 
real necessity to spend a hundred
dollars<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> sony<00:00:46.230> DVD<00:00:46.680> drive<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.309> because

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
dollars on a sony DVD drive just because

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.310 
dollars on a sony DVD drive just because
you<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> has<00:00:48.390> Sony's<00:00:48.750> name<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.200> they

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
you know it has Sony's name on it they

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.529 
you know it has Sony's name on it they

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the OEM software and they all seem to be

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.520 
the OEM software and they all seem to be
pretty<00:00:54.750> nice<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:55.680> when<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:57.079> purchase<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
pretty nice now when you purchase it the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.560 
pretty nice now when you purchase it the
DVD<00:00:58.829> recordable<00:00:59.520> drives<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.149> know<00:01:00.270> make<00:01:00.420> sure

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
DVD recordable drives you know make sure

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.540 
DVD recordable drives you know make sure
it<00:01:00.690> sports<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> lot<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.440> format's<00:01:01.829> minus<00:01:02.340> r

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it sports a lot of the format's minus r

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.719 
it sports a lot of the format's minus r
plus<00:01:03.000> r<00:01:03.239> RW<00:01:03.840> all<00:01:04.260> those<00:01:04.500> ones<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.400> new<00:01:05.549> ones

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
plus r RW all those ones the new ones

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.370 
plus r RW all those ones the new ones
are<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> double-layer<00:01:06.570> drive<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.260> if

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
are like the double-layer drive so if

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.510 
are like the double-layer drive so if
you<00:01:07.470> get<00:01:07.619> something<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.369> have

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
you get something like that you have

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.780 
you get something like that you have
options<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.570> various<00:01:10.049> media<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
options for all your various media and

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.719 
options for all your various media and
also<00:01:12.560> make<00:01:13.560> sure<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.740> has<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> pretty<00:01:14.369> decent

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
also make sure that has a pretty decent

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.160 
also make sure that has a pretty decent
buffer<00:01:15.030> size<00:01:15.210> probably<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.720> around<00:01:15.810> eight

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
buffer size probably like around eight

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.700 
buffer size probably like around eight
megabytes<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.729> way<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.710> stops

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
megabytes and up that way it just stops

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.350 
megabytes and up that way it just stops
you<00:01:20.070> know<00:01:20.159> errors<00:01:20.490> from<00:01:20.640> occurring<00:01:21.119> things

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
you know errors from occurring things

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.480 
you know errors from occurring things
like<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.560> buffer<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.130> when<00:01:23.369> it's

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
like that and the buffer is when it's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
like that and the buffer is when it's
you<00:01:23.700> know<00:01:23.790> copying<00:01:24.270> software<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.140> things

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
you know copying software and things

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.200 
you know copying software and things
like<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.400> builds<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.790> buffer<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
like that so it just builds a buffer and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.359 
like that so it just builds a buffer and
just<00:01:27.450> refers<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.130> pretty

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
just refers to that and it just pretty

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.789 
just refers to that and it just pretty
much<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> memory<00:01:29.939> module<00:01:30.540> within<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.380> DVD

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
much a memory module within the DVD

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.980 
much a memory module within the DVD
drive<00:01:31.920> itself<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.659> most<00:01:33.840> part

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
drive itself and for the most part

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.780 
drive itself and for the most part
nowadays<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.890> don't<00:01:34.920> need<00:01:35.220> any<00:01:35.400> video

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
nowadays you don't need any video

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.940 
nowadays you don't need any video
decoders<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:36.570> anything<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
decoders or anything like that the the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.530 
decoders or anything like that the the
software<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.400> comes<00:01:38.579> with<00:01:38.729> even<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.119> OEM

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
software that comes with even the OEM

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.069 
software that comes with even the OEM
drives<00:01:39.869> most<00:01:40.110> likely<00:01:40.530> will<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.670> your<00:01:42.150> DVD

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
drives most likely will have your DVD

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.139
