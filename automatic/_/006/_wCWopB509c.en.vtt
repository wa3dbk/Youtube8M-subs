00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.610
 hello to accompany you in 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.680
 installing your device I you 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.970
 offers in some pictures of you 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.630
 show the key points of 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.809
 Installation 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:18.720
 we will mount the five supports 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.660
 triangular so we master screw from 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:28.949
 this way and we just press back 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:30.539
 to the legs of the beauf of the movable arm a 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.050
 once the five triangular supports 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.750
 are tight to the key I just placed 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.200
 one of the parabolic plates so by 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.360
 above the second triangular support 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.190
 and against the first super triangular 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.260
 in this way I can insert the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.460
 first two vi right in front of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.160
 holes for the 12th jail it takes 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.879
 loosen the handle here is reassembled on 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.800
 arm up to the top 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.750
 then the second such parabolic 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.589
 that we just press on this triple 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:13.529
 angular support and that we come 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:17.159
 adjust on the other once every 

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:27.539
 cities are mounted we return devices 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:29.819
 to perform the final tightening for the 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.310
 setting must put the dish facing the 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:36.630
 sun so for that there are two settings 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.880
 rotation and elevation here just 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.709
 to catch the moving arm of this 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.719
 way to loosen up here is to come 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:48.119
 look for the white point here this is the 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.439
 reflection of this piece here we have a 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.500
 quota that appears here and we have 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.209
 settled now that we have the point 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.259
 white it has an optimum setting of the focus 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:05.189
 we can control with a piece of 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:07.950
 wood that instantly ignites 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.390
 that cooking is over we remove the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.609
 grid using a manic because 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.910
 that it can still be hot and 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:17.310
 can return the device to position 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.030
 off until next spring 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.030
 all year
