00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.340 

which<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.330> not<00:01:12.600> very<00:01:12.840> good<00:01:13.170> because

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
which they are not very good because

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.600

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.400 

and<00:01:19.150> they<00:01:19.420> have<00:01:19.690> two<00:01:20.970> edges<00:01:21.970> one<00:01:23.070> has<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.100> brush

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
and they have two edges one has a brush

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.370 
and they have two edges one has a brush
which<00:01:26.410> is<00:01:26.620> not<00:01:26.830> as<00:01:27.040> thin<00:01:27.550> as<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.910> other<00:01:28.030> one

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
which is not as thin as the other one

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:40.330 
which is not as thin as the other one
but<00:01:29.380> it's<00:01:29.560> thinner<00:01:30.400> than<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.640> other<00:01:33.990> polishes

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.520 

you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.490> also<00:01:41.670> use<00:01:41.850> these<00:01:42.330> words<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:43.140> draw

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
you can also use these words to draw

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.890

lines<00:01:46.010> paints<00:01:47.010> dots

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.810 

this<00:01:53.470> way

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:06.039 

but<00:01:57.510> on<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.350> other<00:01:58.409> side<00:02:00.890> but<00:02:01.890> she's<00:02:02.220> like

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.120 

here<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.890> open<00:02:08.569> on<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.720> top<00:02:09.990> just<00:02:10.860> wait
