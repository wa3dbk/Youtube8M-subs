I think if we would have had the same

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.229 
I think if we would have had the same
sort<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.440> support<00:04:02.890> network<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:04.000> know<00:04:04.120> it

sort of support network you know it

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.170 
sort of support network you know it
wouldn't<00:04:04.420> have<00:04:04.540> been<00:04:04.660> as<00:04:04.959> bad<00:04:05.200> for<00:04:05.260> me<00:04:05.709> and

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
wouldn't have been as bad for me and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.430 
wouldn't have been as bad for me and
teachers<00:04:07.180> are<00:04:07.330> busy<00:04:07.450> they<00:04:07.780> have<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.959> lot<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.290> do

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
teachers are busy they have a lot to do

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.289 
teachers are busy they have a lot to do
they<00:04:08.739> don't<00:04:08.920> have<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.190> time<00:04:09.400> or<00:04:09.760> resources<00:04:09.820> to

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
to help in the way that they can so I

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.539 
to help in the way that they can so I
think<00:04:13.510> peer<00:04:14.019> relationships<00:04:14.739> are<00:04:14.920> very<00:04:15.310> very

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
think peer relationships are very very

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.009 
think peer relationships are very very
important<00:04:16.000> within<00:04:16.180> school<00:04:16.540> and<00:04:16.840> if<00:04:16.900> they

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
important within school and if they

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.170 
important within school and if they
would<00:04:17.080> have<00:04:17.140> had<00:04:17.290> a<00:04:17.320> program<00:04:17.590> like<00:04:18.040> this<00:04:18.609> when

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
would have had a program like this when

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.460 
would have had a program like this when
I<00:04:19.209> was<00:04:19.419> at<00:04:19.540> school<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:19.810> think<00:04:20.109> things<00:04:20.260> would<00:04:20.410> be

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
I was at school I think things would be

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.890 
I was at school I think things would be
very<00:04:20.500> different<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:22.000> was<00:04:22.419> like<00:04:22.570> well<00:04:22.720> what

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
very different and I was like well what

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.940 
very different and I was like well what
