00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.840
 Barca against Barca but it is Argentina against Chile 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.940
 Bravo, dancing in his line 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.220
 Messi, three steps ... 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.500
 straight to the corner 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.300
 we are tied to one 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 Well, Claudio Bravo looks into his eyes 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.380
 and he reads it beautifully 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.400
 but Messi, his kick and location beat his partner 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.800
 guess the right side 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 a few quick steps on the line 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.660
 a great attempt 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.460
 but it escapes to the side 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.100
 Now, Arturo Vidal ... 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.680
 King Arthur 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.800
 Vidal, three goals in this tournament 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.480
 from the maximum penalty 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.500
 crucial to breaking this tie 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.880
 a direct race 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.980
 Rower, ankles in the lineaaaa 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 he put his hand but could not stop it 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.760
 Chile, again in front 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.860
 tremendous powerful force of Arturo 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.120
 he was so close to denying the goal 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.600
 the man of Sampdoria 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 he reads it well 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.700
 it seems that he put his arm 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.800
 And he did 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 the ball passes under the stretched arm 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.500
 6 inches closer 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.100
 and it was stopped by Sergio Romero 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.400
 but could not 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.100
 and draw blood again 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.100
 and now Gonzalo Higuaín 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.700
 with the opportunity to erase those memories of that failure in regulatory time 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.880
 against Braaaaaavo 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.440
 Gonzalo Higuain 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.480
 the feet of clay fall apart 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.800
 I must say that it is strange that Tata Martino 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.480
 I sent him with all those wrong goals in his head 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.780
 there's no way I could get her 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.140
 look at it from this angle 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.620
 dreams made dust 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.820
 but Chile still needs to take advantage 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.740
 Charles Aránguiz 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.300
 two goals for him also 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.000
 now in the penal 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.140
 to take advantage of Higuain's ruling 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.100
 Rosemary in the middle 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.100
 a direct race of Aránguiz 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.100
 He killed her down 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.700
 What confidence of Aránguiz 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.200
 I guessed the side but Romero did not stop 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.800
 well Aranguiz 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.500
 it was something between a pitch and a corner 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.500
 what confidence from him 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.820
 kicked bright! 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.360
 hits and traverses with power 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.560
 and execute with extreme prejudice 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.340
 to take Chile one step closer to its nirvana 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
 This here 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.940
 can determine if the cup wins 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.500
 Bravo 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.400
 dancing side by side 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.100
 the whistle 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.900
 the approach 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.200
 AND HE WILL DENY IT !!!!! 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.000
 Claudio Bravo with the stop !! 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.300
 and Chile at the door 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.000
 great goalkeeper reading 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.200
 Claudio Bravo with his name on high 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.900
 look at Banega .. eye to eye 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.900
 like a shooting from the old west 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.560
 looking who will move first 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.440
 Who blinks primo 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.180
 breaking hearts 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.000
 and everything concludes, maybe, with this moment 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.460
 Sanchez approaches and waits for Bravo to leave the area 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.100
 # * @ &amp; ^ $ @ # &amp; $ * &amp; # ^ (I do not hear na 'what it says here) 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.080
 Chile will be able to do the same this time .. 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.000
 you will be able to stand up Chile 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.200
 and win his first Copa America 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.500
 and the right person to win it 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.200
 the man of the Arsenal 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.900
 AND CHILE CROPS CHAMPION !!!!!!! 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.820
 NOBODY MORE DESERVED IT 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.720
 FORWARD 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.220
 HERO 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.500
 THIS MAN 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.900
 WITH ALL THE PRESSURE 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.400
 THAT WAS FOOT AND PUT 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.900
 ALL PRESSURE LIKE A COLLAR 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 NOT LIKE A HAMMER NECKLACE 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.900
 BUT AS A PURE DIAMOND NECKLACE 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.080
 ALEXIS SANCHEZ 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.680
 PASS THROUGH THE FIRE AGAIN 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.040
 AND IT LEADS TO RED TOWARDS GLORY 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.200
 MARES DE JÚBILO AND EMOCIÓN INMENZA 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.720
 OF LADIES CRYING 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.500
 TEARS OF PORTE DE PIÑAS 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.800
 AND ALL CAN NOT BELIEVE WHAT COMES 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.200
 A SAD MESSI 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.740
 WITH THE ALBICELESTE 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.020
 BUT WHO CAN DENY THIS BEAUTIFUL NATION 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.000
 TREMENDOUS TOURNAMENT THAT THEY HAVE DONE 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.980
 THE WAY THAT THEY CLOSED TO MESSI 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.000
 AND SAMPAOLI ARRIVED WITH AN ATTACK PLAN THAT CAME OUT TO PERFECTION AT THE END 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.800
 AND ARGENTINA WITH THE LOOK OF REPENTANCE 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.000
 KNOWING THAT TROUBLE OPPORTUNITY WAS LOST 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.900
 WITH THE LAST TOUCH OF THE BALL, THE CUP COULD BE OF THEM 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.900
 (MY WIFE: Cabros, I've never seen him cry in my life ... NEVER!) 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.200
 THE LAST TOUCH OF THE BALL CAME TO GONZALO HIGUAIN 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.320
 BUT I COULD NOT RESPOND TO THE CALL 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.300
 AND CHILE SAID, IT'S WELL, HERE WE ARE 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.100
 and it is again Leo Messi who gets the albiceleste shirt 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.300
 and someone else celebrates at the end of the tournament 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.300
 it was Higuain who failed but the questions still arise 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.540
 for Chile, there are no questions 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.500
 just joy 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.500
 they will have to cut down a whole forest of trees 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.800
 to be able to print this news in all the newspapers of the world 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.300
 especially in Argentina 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.840
 Tata Martino will have many criticisms 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.500
 for having sent Higuaín who has not had a goal 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.900
 it's time to present the best player 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.060
 presented by Delta 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.500
 Claudio Bravo 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.600
 the man who covered the penitentiary that prepared the stage for Alexis Sanchez 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.740
 there are so many to thank ... Gary Medel 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.700
 the same Sanchez 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.200
 and Claudio Bravo stops at the top and Chile remains as champion! 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.100
 it is not time to talk about gods ... looking at Argentina 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.740
 but who can deny this to Gary Medel's men 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.300
 it was truly a game that one did not want to say that a team won 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.400
 because the two were on an equal footing from the beginning 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.400
 It was the destiny of two teams ... to face each other. two boxers 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.040
 an unstoppable confrontation 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.700
 an emotional wear 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.000
 alomejor, emotionally overwhelming for Gonzalo Higuaín 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.900
 and also
