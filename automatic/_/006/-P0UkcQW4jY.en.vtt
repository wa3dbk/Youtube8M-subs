YouTube really makes back school videos
about<00:00:17.850> design<00:00:18.210> which<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.900> an<00:00:19.199> excellent<00:00:19.470> point

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
about design which is an excellent point

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.410 
about design which is an excellent point
so<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.100> thought<00:00:20.430> I'd<00:00:20.520> give<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.789> go<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.240> hope

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
so I thought I'd give it a go so hope

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.790 
so I thought I'd give it a go so hope
that<00:00:21.449> if<00:00:21.660> you're<00:00:21.750> going<00:00:21.869> off<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.109> study<00:00:22.380> design

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
that if you're going off to study design

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.099 
that if you're going off to study design
or<00:00:23.130> art<00:00:23.369> or<00:00:23.670> photography<00:00:24.210> or<00:00:24.240> any<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.900> those

or art or photography or any of those
creative<00:00:25.529> subjects<00:00:26.220> really<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.300> video

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
creative subjects really that this video

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.880 
creative subjects really that this video
will<00:00:27.779> help<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.080> out<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.439> give<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.680> some

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
will help you out and give you some

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.620 
will help you out and give you some
advice<00:00:29.189> I've<00:00:29.789> broken<00:00:30.060> into<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.390> few<00:00:30.599> different

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
advice I've broken into a few different

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.959 
advice I've broken into a few different
categories<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.679> first<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.340> what<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
categories and the first one is what to

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.240 
categories and the first one is what to
expect<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.570> my<00:00:34.079> experience<00:00:34.590> studying<00:00:34.980> design

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
expect in my experience studying design

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.069 
expect in my experience studying design
is<00:00:35.550> quite<00:00:35.940> different<00:00:36.180> from<00:00:36.360> studying<00:00:36.840> other

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
is quite different from studying other

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.560 
is quite different from studying other
subjects<00:00:37.500> because<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.579> less<00:00:38.850> sitting<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
subjects because it's less sitting and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.630 
subjects because it's less sitting and
listening<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.930> lectures<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.680> more<00:00:41.219> about

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
listening to lectures and more about

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.700 
listening to lectures and more about
making<00:00:42.090> things<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.600> doing<00:00:42.870> things<00:00:43.110> which<00:00:43.440> is

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
making things and doing things which is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
making things and doing things which is
what<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.070> really<00:00:44.460> loved<00:00:44.640> about<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.030> there<00:00:45.719> will

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
what I really loved about it there will

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.959 
what I really loved about it there will
most<00:00:46.230> likely<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> few<00:00:47.160> Theory<00:00:47.579> classes

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
most likely be a few Theory classes

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.729 
most likely be a few Theory classes
though<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.480> they<00:00:48.780> are<00:00:48.960> really<00:00:49.230> important<00:00:49.649> as

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
though and they are really important as

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.860 
though and they are really important as
well<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.239> valuable<00:00:51.480> as

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
well because I think it's so valuable as

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.959 
well because I think it's so valuable as
a<00:00:51.899> designer<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> know<00:00:53.190> about<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> history<00:00:53.940> of

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
a designer to know about the history of

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.450 
a designer to know about the history of
Art<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.600> Design<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.350> where<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> industry

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
Art and Design and where the industry

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.310 
Art and Design and where the industry
started<00:00:56.670> basically<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.170> probably

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
started basically that you can probably

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.930 
started basically that you can probably
expect<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.890> most<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.309> your<00:00:59.430> time<00:00:59.609> will<00:00:59.910> be

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
expect that most of your time will be

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.450 
expect that most of your time will be
spent<00:01:00.149> making<00:01:00.600> things<00:01:00.989> which<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.590> pretty<00:01:02.219> cool

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
spent making things which is pretty cool

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.100 
spent making things which is pretty cool
really<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.940> your<00:01:03.180> first<00:01:03.449> few<00:01:03.629> weeks<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.989> might

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
really in your first few weeks you might

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.840 
really in your first few weeks you might
notice<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.470> some<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.400> fellows<00:01:05.700> who

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
notice that some of you fellows who

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.640 
notice that some of you fellows who
didn't<00:01:06.030> seem<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.360> absolute<00:01:06.810> pros<00:01:07.170> already

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
didn't seem like absolute pros already

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.320 
didn't seem like absolute pros already
there<00:01:08.340> definitely<00:01:08.460> happen<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.970> me<00:01:09.090> but

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
there definitely happen to me but

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.789 
there definitely happen to me but
honestly<00:01:09.600> don't<00:01:10.080> leave<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.560> down

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
honestly don't leave that get you down

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.770 
honestly don't leave that get you down
remember<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.090> got<00:01:12.270> into<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> same

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
remember that you got into the same

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.050 
remember that you got into the same
course<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.320> they<00:01:13.439> did<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.890> you've<00:01:14.340> got<00:01:14.790> just

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
course that they did so you've got just

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.820 
course that they did so you've got just
as<00:01:15.180> much<00:01:15.299> right<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.780> there<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.259> they've

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
as much right to be there and they've

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.320 
as much right to be there and they've
probably<00:01:17.009> got<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.670> much<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.000> learn<00:01:18.150> as

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
probably got just as much to learn as

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.210 
probably got just as much to learn as
you<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:19.110> equipment<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:19.830> likely<00:01:20.189> that

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
you do for equipment it's likely that

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.950 
you do for equipment it's likely that
your<00:01:20.460> school<00:01:20.700> will<00:01:20.909> give<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.270> list<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
your school will give you a list of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.270 
your school will give you a list of
things<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.229> need<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.619> there<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.890> anything<00:01:23.130> in

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
things you need if there is anything in

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.640 
things you need if there is anything in
particular<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.360> my<00:01:24.540> university<00:01:25.140> did<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
particular I know my university did and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.010 
particular I know my university did and
I<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.729> got<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> ton<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.299> art<00:01:27.509> supplies<00:01:27.840> left

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
I have got a ton of art supplies left

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.140 
I have got a ton of art supplies left
over<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.680> they<00:01:28.979> said<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> needed<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.790> never

of<00:01:34.110> teaching<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.799> learning<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.060> need

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
of teaching and learning and you need

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.010 
of teaching and learning and you need
different<00:01:36.420> things<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.960> different

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
different things for different

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.870

assignments<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.400> equipment<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
assignments so with equipment I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.310 
assignments so with equipment I
definitely<00:01:39.210> recommend<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.750> taking<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.170> as

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
definitely recommend just taking it as

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.649 
definitely recommend just taking it as
it<00:01:40.439> comes<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.009> buying<00:01:41.700> what<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> need<00:01:42.180> asset

working on design assignments can be a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.950 
working on design assignments can be a

guess if you've never done that sort of

them to give some feedback they might

them to give some feedback they might
see<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.910> few<00:03:01.239> things<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.750> maybe<00:03:01.959> you've

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
see a few things that maybe you've

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.110 
see a few things that maybe you've
missed<00:03:02.410> because<00:03:02.769> you've<00:03:02.950> been<00:03:03.130> looking<00:03:03.910> at<00:03:04.000> it

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
missed because you've been looking at it

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.810 
missed because you've been looking at it
too<00:03:04.239> closely<00:03:04.269> if<00:03:04.870> they<00:03:05.019> make<00:03:05.200> sense<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.920> make

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
too closely if they make sense so make

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.100 
too closely if they make sense so make
sure<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:07.060> do<00:03:07.180> there<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.570> then<00:03:07.690> return<00:03:07.959> the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
sure you do there and then return the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.479 
sure you do there and then return the
favor<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.440> look<00:03:08.620> at<00:03:08.739> their<00:03:08.950> work<00:03:09.130> as<00:03:09.250> well

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
favor and look at their work as well

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.220 
favor and look at their work as well
critiquing<00:03:10.030> other<00:03:10.269> people's<00:03:10.600> work<00:03:10.810> can<00:03:11.140> be

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
critiquing other people's work can be

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.020 
critiquing other people's work can be
hard<00:03:11.410> at<00:03:11.500> first<00:03:11.680> but<00:03:12.100> once<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.760> get<00:03:12.850> more

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
hard at first but once you get more

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.790 
hard at first but once you get more
comfortable<00:03:13.239> with<00:03:13.810> your<00:03:14.080> classmates<00:03:14.590> and

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
comfortable with your classmates and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.070 
comfortable with your classmates and
with<00:03:15.130> design<00:03:15.820> itself<00:03:16.269> you'll<00:03:16.540> find<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.930> lot

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
with design itself you'll find it a lot

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.690 
with design itself you'll find it a lot
easier<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.500> give<00:03:17.680> feedback<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.310> think<00:03:18.370> there's

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
easier to give feedback I think there's

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.920 
easier to give feedback I think there's
a<00:03:18.760> lot<00:03:18.940> more<00:03:18.970> advice<00:03:19.329> I<00:03:19.480> can<00:03:19.540> give<00:03:19.780> about

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
a lot more advice I can give about

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.780 
a lot more advice I can give about
critiquing<00:03:20.230> but<00:03:20.860> maybe<00:03:21.340> there<00:03:21.519> should<00:03:21.670> be<00:03:21.760> a

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
critiquing but maybe there should be a

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.640 
critiquing but maybe there should be a
separate<00:03:22.360> video<00:03:22.540> later<00:03:22.810> on<00:03:22.930> when<00:03:23.380> you're<00:03:23.530> just

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
separate video later on when you're just

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.380 
separate video later on when you're just
starting<00:03:23.769> out<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.160> might<00:03:24.280> find<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:25.060> you

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
starting out you might find that you

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.720 
starting out you might find that you
unintentionally<00:03:26.350> copy<00:03:27.070> other<00:03:27.370> designs

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
unintentionally copy other designs

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.880 
unintentionally copy other designs
you've<00:03:27.910> seen<00:03:28.150> or<00:03:28.450> maybe<00:03:28.810> copy<00:03:29.530> what<00:03:29.769> your

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
you've seen or maybe copy what your

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.590 
you've seen or maybe copy what your
classmates<00:03:30.370> are<00:03:30.519> doing<00:03:30.549> and<00:03:31.120> that's<00:03:31.269> okay

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
classmates are doing and that's okay

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.000 
classmates are doing and that's okay
because<00:03:31.750> it's<00:03:31.989> all<00:03:32.110> about<00:03:32.230> learning<00:03:32.799> and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
because it's all about learning and

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.430 
because it's all about learning and
trying<00:03:33.340> things<00:03:33.670> out<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.209> seeing<00:03:35.170> how<00:03:35.320> they

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
trying things out and seeing how they

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.860 
trying things out and seeing how they
work<00:03:35.680> but<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.130> is<00:03:36.160> really<00:03:36.459> important<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.180> take

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
work but it is really important to take

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.360 
work but it is really important to take
the<00:03:37.989> things<00:03:38.200> that<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.440> learned<00:03:38.709> from<00:03:39.070> copying

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
the things that you learned from copying

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.789 
the things that you learned from copying
and<00:03:39.880> put<00:03:40.390> your<00:03:40.510> own<00:03:40.630> twist<00:03:40.840> on<00:03:41.110> them<00:03:41.350> to<00:03:41.560> try

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
and put your own twist on them to try

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.470 
and put your own twist on them to try
and<00:03:41.829> make<00:03:42.100> something<00:03:42.340> your<00:03:42.549> own<00:03:42.700> because<00:03:43.209> you

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
and make something your own because you

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.300 
and make something your own because you
don't<00:03:43.660> want<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:43.870> just<00:03:44.019> be<00:03:44.110> putting<00:03:44.290> out<00:03:44.500> design

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
don't want to just be putting out design

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.580 
don't want to just be putting out design

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
it's called steal like an artist because

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.420 
it's called steal like an artist because
the<00:04:01.630> basic<00:04:01.900> premise<00:04:02.170> is<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.350> artists<00:04:03.340> who

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
the basic premise is that artists who

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.310 
the basic premise is that artists who
are<00:04:03.519> heavily<00:04:03.700> influenced<00:04:04.209> by<00:04:04.269> things<00:04:04.660> don't

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
are heavily influenced by things don't

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.080 
are heavily influenced by things don't
just<00:04:05.410> copy<00:04:05.620> them<00:04:05.799> exactly<00:04:06.070> but<00:04:06.519> rather<00:04:06.760> they

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
just copy them exactly but rather they

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.420 
just copy them exactly but rather they
remix<00:04:07.900> them<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.410> reimagine<00:04:09.010> them<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.280> make

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
remix them and reimagine them to make

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.860 
remix them and reimagine them to make
something<00:04:09.700> new<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:10.060> think<00:04:10.359> this<00:04:10.480> little<00:04:10.600> book

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
something new I think this little book

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.420 
something new I think this little book
is<00:04:11.079> something<00:04:11.380> that<00:04:11.530> every<00:04:11.829> design<00:04:12.070> student

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
is something that every design student

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.160 
is something that every design student
should<00:04:12.579> read<00:04:12.790> so<00:04:13.090> definitely<00:04:13.720> check<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:13.959> out

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
should read so definitely check it out

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.140 
should read so definitely check it out
