heard<00:00:47.390> people<00:00:47.570> complaining<00:00:48.079> about<00:00:48.230> the

heard people complaining about the

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.080 
heard people complaining about the
terminology<00:00:48.890> but<00:00:49.430> we<00:00:49.550> have<00:00:49.670> to<00:00:49.760> call<00:00:49.879> it

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
terminology but we have to call it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.790 
terminology but we have to call it
something<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:50.629> that's<00:00:50.719> what<00:00:50.989> I<00:00:51.050> originally

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
something and that's what I originally

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.770 
something and that's what I originally
talked<00:00:52.039> about<00:00:52.340> for<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.879> Splash<00:00:53.120> Damage<00:00:53.149> work

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
talked about for the Splash Damage work

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.869 
talked about for the Splash Damage work
with<00:00:54.079> enemy<00:00:54.379> territory<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:55.190> we're<00:00:55.579> sort<00:00:55.789> of

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
with enemy territory and we're sort of

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.029 
with enemy territory and we're sort of
into<00:00:56.149> version<00:00:56.570> 2<00:00:56.750> or<00:00:56.899> version<00:00:57.320> 3<00:00:57.590> with<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.829> in

thread core and then eight

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.580 
thread core and then eight
specialized<00:01:52.030> course<00:01:52.390> in<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.630> cell<00:01:52.840> processor

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
specialized course in the cell processor

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.380 
specialized course in the cell processor
but<00:01:54.070> you<00:01:54.160> can<00:01:54.310> still<00:01:54.520> use<00:01:54.580> modern<00:01:55.210> tools

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
but you can still use modern tools

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.720 
but you can still use modern tools
modern<00:01:56.050> languages<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:57.010> it<00:01:57.280> still<00:01:57.520> works

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
modern languages and it still works

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.090 
modern languages and it still works
reasonably<00:01:58.360> well<00:01:58.480> but<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.140> is<00:01:59.380> it<00:01:59.650> is<00:01:59.710> kind<00:01:59.980> of

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
reasonably well but it is it is kind of

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.800 
reasonably well but it is it is kind of
a<00:02:00.190> pain<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.940> question<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.360> hard<00:02:01.600> drive

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
a pain the question of hard drive

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.900 
a pain the question of hard drive
requirements<00:02:02.440> on<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.680> 360<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.310> something

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
requirements on the 360 is something

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.700

that's<00:02:04.180> been<00:02:04.450> stressing<00:02:05.200> us<00:02:05.290> out<00:02:05.410> a<00:02:05.470> little

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
that's been stressing us out a little

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.380 
that's been stressing us out a little
bit<00:02:05.920> this<00:02:06.100> year<00:02:06.160> where<00:02:06.610> Microsoft<00:02:07.210> has

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
bit this year where Microsoft has

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.480 
bit this year where Microsoft has

requirement<00:02:10.270> on<00:02:10.420> there<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.020> we<00:02:11.200> are<00:02:11.230> now

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
requirement on there so we are now

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.980 
requirement on there so we are now
working<00:02:12.130> hard<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.580> see<00:02:12.790> how<00:02:13.150> well<00:02:13.420> we<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:13.870> make

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
experience is going to be and obviously

work<00:02:31.120> it's<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.810> question<00:02:31.989> of<00:02:32.230> if<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.620> run

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
work it's just a question of if you run

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.830 
work it's just a question of if you run
around<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.580> corner<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.090> flip<00:02:34.300> around<00:02:34.600> and

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
around the corner and flip around and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.210 
around the corner and flip around and
look<00:02:34.959> someplace<00:02:35.350> completely<00:02:35.530> different

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
look someplace completely different

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.070 
look someplace completely different
whether<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.550> wind<00:02:36.790> up<00:02:36.970> spending<00:02:37.180> two<00:02:37.630> seconds

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
whether you wind up spending two seconds

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.690 
whether you wind up spending two seconds
looking<00:02:38.380> at<00:02:38.470> blurry<00:02:38.800> textures<00:02:39.190> before

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
looking at blurry textures before

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.910 
looking at blurry textures before
everything<00:02:40.120> comes<00:02:40.390> in<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:41.140> we<00:02:41.470> really<00:02:41.800> won't

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
everything comes in and we really won't

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.880 
everything comes in and we really won't
know<00:02:42.190> till<00:02:43.000> six<00:02:43.630> months<00:02:43.900> from<00:02:44.050> now<00:02:44.110> how<00:02:44.650> well

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
know till six months from now how well

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.500 
know till six months from now how well
that<00:02:45.070> actually<00:02:45.250> turns<00:02:45.489> out<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.150> that's<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.390> lot

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
that actually turns out and that's a lot

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.880 
that actually turns out and that's a lot
of<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.720> work<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.080> goes<00:02:47.200> between<00:02:47.620> where<00:02:47.860> we

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
of the work that goes between where we

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.860 
of the work that goes between where we
are<00:02:48.160> right<00:02:48.370> now<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.300> final<00:02:49.660> shipping

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
are right now and the final shipping

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.050 
are right now and the final shipping
game<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.890> most<00:02:51.130> significant<00:02:51.730> difference

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
game the most significant difference

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.430 
game the most significant difference
that<00:02:52.120> we're<00:02:52.360> looking<00:02:52.450> at<00:02:52.720> right<00:02:52.959> now<00:02:53.020> between

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
that we're looking at right now between

that we're looking at right now between
the<00:02:53.650> platforms<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:54.880> on<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.120> blu-ray<00:02:55.840> DVD

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
the platforms is that on a blu-ray DVD

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.770 
the platforms is that on a blu-ray DVD
on<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.560> ps3<00:02:56.860> we<00:02:57.280> actually<00:02:57.670> have<00:02:57.850> enough<00:02:58.510> space

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
on the ps3 we actually have enough space

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.630 
on the ps3 we actually have enough space
to<00:02:58.840> get<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.200> quality<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.709> we<00:02:59.860> want<00:02:59.950> with<00:03:00.489> the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
to get the quality that we want with the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.400 
to get the quality that we want with the
compression<00:03:00.940> ratios<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.450> we<00:03:01.750> want<00:03:01.989> on<00:03:02.170> the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
compression ratios that we want on the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.520 
compression ratios that we want on the
entire<00:03:02.680> game<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.310> we're<00:03:04.060> really<00:03:04.360> feeling<00:03:05.230> the

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
entire game and we're really feeling the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.620 
entire game and we're really feeling the
pinch<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.950> lot<00:03:06.220> on<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.610> DVDs<00:03:07.030> we're<00:03:07.269> going<00:03:07.540> to

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
pinch a lot on the DVDs we're going to

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.650 
pinch a lot on the DVDs we're going to
be<00:03:07.720> at<00:03:07.870> least<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.230> 2<00:03:08.410> DVD<00:03:08.860> game<00:03:09.100> on<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.790> 360<00:03:10.450> and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
be at least a 2 DVD game on the 360 and

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.630 
be at least a 2 DVD game on the 360 and
honestly<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:11.680> would<00:03:11.769> kind<00:03:12.070> of<00:03:12.130> like<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.489> be<00:03:12.610> a

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
honestly we would kind of like to be a

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.640 
honestly we would kind of like to be a
free<00:03:12.910> DVD<00:03:13.090> game<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.810> would<00:03:13.930> be<00:03:14.019> about<00:03:14.230> that

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
free DVD game that would be about that

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.380 
free DVD game that would be about that
would<00:03:14.769> match<00:03:14.950> out<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.370> blu-ray<00:03:15.760> pretty<00:03:16.150> well

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
would match out the blu-ray pretty well

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.150 
would match out the blu-ray pretty well
on<00:03:16.600> there<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:17.019> doesn't<00:03:17.320> fit<00:03:17.500> really<00:03:17.709> well<00:03:17.830> with

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
on there it doesn't fit really well with

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.880 
on there it doesn't fit really well with
how<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.310> game<00:03:18.580> is<00:03:18.760> divided<00:03:19.150> but<00:03:19.989> we<00:03:20.440> are<00:03:20.590> going

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
how the game is divided but we are going

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.080 
how the game is divided but we are going
to<00:03:20.980> have<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:21.250> wind<00:03:21.430> up<00:03:21.610> making<00:03:21.730> some

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
to have to wind up making some

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.090 
to have to wind up making some
compression<00:03:22.570> quality<00:03:22.799> sacrifices<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:23.950> fit

onto<00:03:24.250> two<00:03:24.489> DVDs<00:03:24.970> on<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.209> 360<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:26.380> that's<00:03:26.530> one

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
onto two DVDs on the 360 and that's one

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.380 
onto two DVDs on the 360 and that's one
thing<00:03:26.890> that<00:03:27.070> I<00:03:27.100> really<00:03:27.400> do<00:03:27.580> wish<00:03:27.760> Microsoft

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
thing that I really do wish Microsoft

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.420 
thing that I really do wish Microsoft
would<00:03:28.600> make<00:03:28.750> some<00:03:28.989> some<00:03:29.620> concessions<00:03:30.220> on

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
would make some some concessions on

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.400 
would make some some concessions on
because<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:30.970> have<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.209> pay<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.900> really

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
because you have to pay and really

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.240 
because you have to pay and really
onerous<00:03:33.060> licensing<00:03:34.060> fee<00:03:34.239> per<00:03:34.540> DVD<00:03:34.780> pad<00:03:35.590> if<00:03:35.890> you

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
onerous licensing fee per DVD pad if you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.330 
onerous licensing fee per DVD pad if you
look<00:03:36.519> at<00:03:36.670> it<00:03:36.820> as<00:03:37.140> kind<00:03:38.140> of<00:03:38.230> cost<00:03:38.500> per<00:03:38.890> gigabyte

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
look at it as kind of cost per gigabyte

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.880 
look at it as kind of cost per gigabyte
on<00:03:39.880> there<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.329> ps3<00:03:40.810> has<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.930> huge<00:03:41.290> advantage<00:03:41.650> if

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
on there the ps3 has a huge advantage if

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.560 
on there the ps3 has a huge advantage if
you're<00:03:42.040> doing<00:03:42.160> a<00:03:42.310> large<00:03:42.549> game<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.150> that's

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
you're doing a large game and that's

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.970 
you're doing a large game and that's
really<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.930> one<00:03:44.110> thing<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.530> come<00:03:44.769> down

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
really the one thing that I come down

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.190 
really the one thing that I come down
and<00:03:45.190> say<00:03:45.340> Sony's<00:03:45.760> got<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:45.970> better<00:03:46.269> system<00:03:47.140> for

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
and say Sony's got a better system for

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.560 
and say Sony's got a better system for
us<00:03:47.530> there<00:03:47.829> we're<00:03:48.160> running<00:03:48.850> off<00:03:48.970> of<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.180> blu-ray

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
us there we're running off of a blu-ray

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.479 
us there we're running off of a blu-ray
there<00:03:49.840> or<00:03:50.019> if<00:03:50.110> we<00:03:50.230> I<00:03:50.530> don't<00:03:50.950> expect<00:03:51.250> we're

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
there or if we I don't expect we're

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:52.650 
there or if we I don't expect we're
going<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:51.820> but<00:03:51.940> if<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.120> wanted<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.540> do<00:03:52.630> a

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
going to but if you wanted to do a

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.170 
going to but if you wanted to do a
double<00:03:53.019> layer<00:03:53.170> blu-ray<00:03:53.620> DVD

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
double layer blu-ray DVD

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.910 
double layer blu-ray DVD
you<00:03:54.239> can<00:03:54.359> have<00:03:54.510> incredibly<00:03:55.079> massive<00:03:55.590> amounts

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
you can have incredibly massive amounts

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.160 
you can have incredibly massive amounts
of<00:03:56.040> data<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:57.390> technology<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:57.959> we've

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
of data and the technology that we've

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.110 
of data and the technology that we've
got<00:03:58.319> now<00:03:58.530> really<00:03:58.859> does<00:03:59.040> wind<00:03:59.310> up<00:03:59.430> using<00:03:59.700> all<00:04:00.060> of

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
got now really does wind up using all of

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.539 
got now really does wind up using all of
that<00:04:00.299> data<00:04:00.629> or<00:04:01.019> good<00:04:01.319> productive<00:04:01.829> things<00:04:02.189> and

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
that data or good productive things and

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.940 
that data or good productive things and
being<00:04:03.239> limited<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.659> the<00:04:04.290> DVDs<00:04:04.709> which

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
being limited to the DVDs which

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.740 
being limited to the DVDs which
Microsoft<00:04:05.310> already<00:04:05.849> takes<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.239> couple<00:04:06.390> gigs

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
Microsoft already takes a couple gigs

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.300 
Microsoft already takes a couple gigs
off<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.230> just<00:04:07.469> because<00:04:07.680> of<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.829> way<00:04:07.920> they<00:04:08.099> set

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
off of just because of the way they set

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.770 
off of just because of the way they set
things<00:04:08.579> up<00:04:08.790> for<00:04:08.849> their<00:04:09.090> different<00:04:09.329> security

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
things up for their different security

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.089 
things up for their different security
architectures<00:04:10.379> and<00:04:10.560> all<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.799> kind<00:04:11.040> of

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
architectures and all is kind of

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.430 
architectures and all is kind of
unfortunate
