all these strings at one time some

here
will<00:00:41.489> actually<00:00:41.850> warp<00:00:42.330> depending<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
will actually warp depending on the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.189 
will actually warp depending on the
amount<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.280> tension<00:00:44.520> that's<00:00:44.820> lost<00:00:45.180> per<00:00:45.840> string

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
amount of tension that's lost per string

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.740 
amount of tension that's lost per string
so<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:46.949> I'll<00:00:47.190> show<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.519> how<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.360> take

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
so what I'll show you how to do is take

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.299 
so what I'll show you how to do is take
one<00:00:49.019> string<00:00:49.290> off<00:00:49.409> one<00:00:49.680> at<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> time

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
one string off one at a time

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.680 
one string off one at a time
as<00:00:50.519> you<00:00:50.699> can<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:50.970> we're<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.269> to<00:00:51.360> start<00:00:51.570> with

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
as you can see we're going to start with

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.049 
as you can see we're going to start with
this<00:00:51.780> low<00:00:52.019> E<00:00:52.260> string<00:00:52.290> and<00:00:52.830> then<00:00:53.430> simply<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.940> go

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
this low E string and then simply we go

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.869 
this low E string and then simply we go
to<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.300> other<00:00:54.479> e<00:00:54.720> we<00:00:55.409> go<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.589> the<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.830> we've<00:00:56.760> got

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
now some guys would actually use maybe a

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.780 
now some guys would actually use maybe a
lower<00:01:03.180> powered<00:01:04.010> electric<00:01:05.010> screwdriver<00:01:05.519> now

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
off I want to line up the string right

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.649 
off I want to line up the string right
along<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.619> ridge<00:01:22.890> line<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.520> ass<00:01:24.090> bridge<00:01:24.299> pin

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.190 

what<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.690> typically<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> do<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.550> bend

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
what I typically like to do is to bend

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.430 
what I typically like to do is to bend
right<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.500> at<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.430> thumb<00:01:35.840> about<00:01:36.840> probably<00:01:37.409> a

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
right here at the thumb about probably a

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.710 
right here at the thumb about probably a
half<00:01:37.800> of<00:01:37.950> an<00:01:38.040> inch<00:01:38.220> away<00:01:38.430> from<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.030> very<00:01:39.240> ball

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
half of an inch away from the very ball

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.859 
half of an inch away from the very ball
into<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.320> string<00:01:40.650> now<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.210> does<00:01:42.270> is

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
into the string now what this does is

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.950 
into the string now what this does is
simply<00:01:43.610> just<00:01:44.610> secure<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.300> little<00:01:45.570> bit<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
simply just secure just a little bit it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.870 
simply just secure just a little bit it
just<00:01:46.170> all<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.800> does<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.250> breaks<00:01:47.640> some

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
just all it does is really breaks some

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.999 
just all it does is really breaks some
of<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.030> tension<00:01:48.509> that's<00:01:49.229> gonna<00:01:49.410> be<00:01:49.560> placed<00:01:49.830> on

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
of the tension that's gonna be placed on

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.760 
of the tension that's gonna be placed on
the<00:01:50.100> bone<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.780> some<00:01:52.380> guys<00:01:52.530> don't

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
the bone so it's not some guys don't

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.530 
the bone so it's not some guys don't
think<00:01:52.800> it's<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.100> big<00:01:53.250> deal<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.880> prefer

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
think it's a big deal but I I prefer

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.780 
think it's a big deal but I I prefer
that's<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:55.020> me<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.340> string<00:01:56.580> all<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
that's just me know that string all the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.630 
that's just me know that string all the
way<00:01:56.880> through<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.390> whole<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:57.930> tuner<00:01:58.640> what

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
way through the whole of the tuner what

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.370 
way through the whole of the tuner what
we<00:01:59.729> want<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> good<00:02:00.690> amount<00:02:01.170> of

we want to do is have a good amount of

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.510 
we want to do is have a good amount of

five six and six now how do you do that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.900 
five six and six now how do you do that
well<00:02:12.959> it's<00:02:13.500> kind<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.920> little<00:02:14.640> bit<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.820> a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910

typically<00:02:20.670> use<00:02:20.760> about<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.660> probably

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
typically use about this is probably

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.259 
typically use about this is probably
about<00:02:22.019> four<00:02:22.350> inches<00:02:22.709> now<00:02:22.920> four<00:02:23.220> inches<00:02:23.580> about

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
about four inches now four inches about

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.850 
about four inches now four inches about
that<00:02:24.570> four<00:02:24.930> or<00:02:24.989> five<00:02:25.110> inches<00:02:25.290> will<00:02:25.560> give<00:02:25.739> you

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that four or five inches will give you

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.670 
that four or five inches will give you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
two loops around the post here so what I

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.710 
two loops around the post here so what I
want<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.890> do<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.280> hold<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:29.940> up<00:02:30.090> here<00:02:30.330> like<00:02:30.660> that

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
want to do is hold it up here like that

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.680 
want to do is hold it up here like that
I<00:02:31.170> got<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> set<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.130> I'm<00:02:32.910> going<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.120> loop<00:02:33.329> this

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
I got a set and I'm going to loop this

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.440 
I got a set and I'm going to loop this
into<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.230> string<00:02:34.590> underneath<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:39.299> original

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
into the string underneath the original

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.729 
into the string underneath the original
string<00:02:40.640> pull<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.940> like<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.470> pull<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.560> up<00:02:43.650> a

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
string pull it to like that pull it up a

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.610 
string pull it to like that pull it up a
little<00:02:43.829> bit<00:02:44.269> now<00:02:45.269> this<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.570> how<00:02:45.690> we<00:02:45.750> lock<00:02:46.170> the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
little bit now this is how we lock the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.880 
little bit now this is how we lock the
actual<00:02:47.010> string<00:02:47.370> around<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.780> post<00:02:49.049> we<00:02:49.590> want<00:02:49.799> to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
actual string around the post we want to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.310 
actual string around the post we want to
lock<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:51.180> how<00:02:51.329> we're<00:02:51.510> doing<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.140> now

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
lock it so how we're doing this is now

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.860 
lock it so how we're doing this is now
I'm<00:02:52.530> pulling<00:02:52.860> up<00:02:53.070> just<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.549> tighten<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:54.060> and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
I'm pulling up just to tighten it and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.380 
I'm pulling up just to tighten it and
now<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.140> pull<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.890> me<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.790> give<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.060> good<00:02:57.209> luck

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
now I pull it to me to give it good luck

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.080 
now I pull it to me to give it good luck
as<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.200> wind<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.560> tuner<00:02:58.829> I<00:02:59.130> want<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.579> keep<00:02:59.670> pulling

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
as I wind a tuner I want to keep pulling

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.090 
as I wind a tuner I want to keep pulling
up<00:03:00.239> on<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.660> string<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.260> locking<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
up on the string and locking it to the

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.729 
up on the string and locking it to the
post<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:02.700> way<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.299> doesn't<00:03:03.540> slip<00:03:03.930> with<00:03:04.590> my

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
post so that way it doesn't slip with my

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.500 
post so that way it doesn't slip with my
finger<00:03:05.100> I'm<00:03:05.280> pressing<00:03:05.730> down<00:03:05.940> on<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.180> string

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
finger I'm pressing down on the string

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.080 
finger I'm pressing down on the string
to<00:03:07.230> actually<00:03:07.860> tune<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.280> flat<00:03:08.690> against<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.720> peg

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
to actually tune it flat against the peg

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:20.290 
to actually tune it flat against the peg
so<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.239> way<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.420> have<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.690> even<00:03:12.900> spool

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.000 

now<00:03:20.870> as<00:03:21.050> you<00:03:21.170> can<00:03:21.260> see<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.440> British<00:03:21.710> pen<00:03:21.890> is

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
now as you can see the British pen is

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.740 
now as you can see the British pen is
popping<00:03:22.430> up<00:03:22.550> so<00:03:22.850> you<00:03:22.910> don't<00:03:23.240> want<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.600> to

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
popping up so you don't want that to

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
popping up so you don't want that to
happen<00:03:25.870> when<00:03:26.870> you're<00:03:26.990> tuning<00:03:27.230> up<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.530> peghead

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
happen when you're tuning up the peghead

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.410 
happen when you're tuning up the peghead
you<00:03:28.100> want<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.340> watch<00:03:28.520> what's<00:03:28.820> happening<00:03:28.880> down

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
you want to watch what's happening down

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.740 
you want to watch what's happening down
at<00:03:29.720> 7<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:31.220> what<00:03:31.400> I<00:03:31.430> couldn't<00:03:31.790> do<00:03:31.880> is<00:03:32.030> as<00:03:32.270> I'm

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
at 7 so what I couldn't do is as I'm

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.830 
at 7 so what I couldn't do is as I'm
winding<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:34.220> tighten<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.730> string<00:03:35.060> I'm<00:03:35.570> also

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
winding and tighten the string I'm also

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.310 
winding and tighten the string I'm also
holding<00:03:36.260> down<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:38.030> bridge<00:03:38.270> pin<00:03:38.570> so<00:03:39.050> that<00:03:39.200> way

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
holding down the bridge pin so that way

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:48.370 
holding down the bridge pin so that way
it<00:03:39.380> doesn't<00:03:39.440> pop<00:03:39.770> up<00:03:47.020> now<00:03:48.020> we're<00:03:48.200> actually

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
it doesn't pop up now we're actually

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.080 
it doesn't pop up now we're actually
going<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.710> stretch<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.220> string<00:03:49.520> to<00:03:49.760> get<00:03:49.880> all

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
going to stretch the string to get all

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.700 
going to stretch the string to get all
the<00:03:50.270> newness<00:03:50.660> out<00:03:50.870> we<00:03:51.080> want<00:03:51.320> to<00:03:51.410> stretch<00:03:51.680> the

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
the newness out we want to stretch the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.800 
the newness out we want to stretch the
string<00:03:52.130> properly<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:52.940> that<00:03:52.970> way<00:03:53.300> it<00:03:53.570> doesn't

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
string properly so that way it doesn't

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.140 
string properly so that way it doesn't
d-team<00:03:54.380> when<00:03:54.560> we<00:03:54.650> play<00:03:54.890> now<00:03:55.520> what<00:03:55.790> we're<00:03:55.940> going

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
d-team when we play now what we're going

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.900 
d-team when we play now what we're going
to<00:03:56.210> do<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.960> grab<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.290> string<00:03:57.830> we're<00:03:58.700> going<00:03:58.730> to

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
to do is to grab a string we're going to

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.330 
to do is to grab a string we're going to
