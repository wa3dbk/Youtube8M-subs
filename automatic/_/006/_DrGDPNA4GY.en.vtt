vents and fall down be it into the sir
I<00:00:16.500> don't<00:00:16.920> know<00:00:17.010> firewall<00:00:17.789> or<00:00:17.820> bulkhead<00:00:18.480> area

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
I don't know firewall or bulkhead area

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.689 
I don't know firewall or bulkhead area
I'm<00:00:19.289> not<00:00:19.500> really<00:00:19.619> mechanically<00:00:20.250> minded<00:00:20.430> so

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
I'm not really mechanically minded so

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.970 
I'm not really mechanically minded so
don't<00:00:20.910> know<00:00:20.970> whether<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:21.449> actually<00:00:21.779> cold<00:00:22.020> so

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
don't know whether it's actually cold so

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.620 
don't know whether it's actually cold so
that<00:00:23.010> fills<00:00:23.369> up<00:00:23.490> full<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.820> water<00:00:23.970> then<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.480> gets

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
that fills up full of water then it gets

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.570 
that fills up full of water then it gets
quite<00:00:24.840> high<00:00:25.080> or<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.470> then<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.070> starts<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.400> leak

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
quite high or and then it starts to leak

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.790 
quite high or and then it starts to leak
inside<00:00:26.760> your<00:00:27.269> actual<00:00:27.900> car<00:00:28.080> itself<00:00:28.470> into<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
inside your actual car itself into the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.470 
inside your actual car itself into the
foot<00:00:28.980> wells<00:00:29.189> cause<00:00:29.910> all<00:00:30.090> kinds<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.420> problems

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
foot wells cause all kinds of problems

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.060 
foot wells cause all kinds of problems
so<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:30.990> need<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.349> obviously<00:00:31.439> get<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.890> water

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
so you need to obviously get that water

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.840 
so you need to obviously get that water
out<00:00:32.480> best<00:00:33.480> way<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:35.190> pull<00:00:35.700> back

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
out best way to do this is to pull back

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.639 
out best way to do this is to pull back
to<00:00:36.000> fit<00:00:36.690> rubber<00:00:36.930> strip<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> can<00:00:37.530> see

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
to fit rubber strip that you can see

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.240 
to fit rubber strip that you can see
there<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:39.210> fin<00:00:39.450> rubber<00:00:39.690> strip<00:00:40.250> then

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
there on the fin rubber strip then

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.950 
there on the fin rubber strip then
you're<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.550> need<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> undo<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.510> bracket

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
you're going to need to undo the bracket

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.510 
you're going to need to undo the bracket
for<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> battery<00:00:43.500> which<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:46.160> this<00:00:47.160> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
for the battery which is this this is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.160 
for the battery which is this this is

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
down the front of the battery so if you

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.189 
down the front of the battery so if you
look<00:00:49.350> down<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.739> wall<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.960> middle

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
look down this wall here in the middle

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.930 
look down this wall here in the middle
of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> battery<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.070> will<00:00:53.219> see<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.489> bracket

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
of the battery you will see this bracket

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.849 
of the battery you will see this bracket
you<00:00:54.300> need<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.510> undo<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> allen<00:00:55.469> key

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.139 

pull<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.579> then<00:00:59.760> you'll<00:00:59.879> be<00:00:59.910> able<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
grime on the bottom of the battery there

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.469 
grime on the bottom of the battery there
from<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.690> its<00:01:03.809> leaves<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.439> stuff<00:01:05.479> so

blockage<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> plug<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.299> see

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
blockage in the plug now you can see

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.530 
blockage in the plug now you can see
this<00:01:18.509> black<00:01:18.720> plastic<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.939> plug<00:01:21.150> hole<00:01:21.330> is

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
this black plastic here the plug hole is

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020 
this black plastic here the plug hole is
directly<00:01:21.930> underneath<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.790> we'll<00:01:23.909> see
