you guys don't know I I did hard khalix

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.859 
you guys don't know I I did hard khalix
on<00:00:23.820> my<00:00:24.060> phantom<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.430> that<00:00:26.430> was<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.090> would<00:00:27.840> have

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
on my phantom and that was I would have

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.150 
on my phantom and that was I would have
to<00:00:28.050> say<00:00:28.109> pretty<00:00:28.710> easy<00:00:29.099> but<00:00:30.980> definitely<00:00:31.980> though

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
to say pretty easy but definitely though

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.130 
to say pretty easy but definitely though
doing<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:32.940> or<00:00:33.360> doing<00:00:33.570> khalix<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
doing it on or doing khalix on the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.160 
doing it on or doing khalix on the
Nightlord<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.579> much<00:00:36.390> easier<00:00:36.530> go<00:00:37.530> party<00:00:39.170> all

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
Nightlord is so much easier go party all

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.630 
Nightlord is so much easier go party all
right<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> reason<00:00:40.829> why<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.070> say<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.399> is

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
right and the reason why I say that is

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.139 
right and the reason why I say that is
because<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.770> you<00:00:43.770> literally<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.340> stand

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
because it's you literally just stand

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.979 
because it's you literally just stand
there<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:46.190> spam<00:00:47.420> quadruple<00:00:48.420> throw<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
there and spam quadruple throw and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.459 
there and spam quadruple throw and
that's<00:00:49.890> kind<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.850> all<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.960> really

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
that's kind of all you have to do really

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.180 
that's kind of all you have to do really
and<00:00:53.149> basically<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.510> let<00:00:54.690> your<00:00:54.899> um<00:00:55.160> what<00:00:56.160> are

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and basically you let your um what are

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.370 
and basically you let your um what are
they<00:00:56.489> want<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> call<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.059> exactly<00:00:57.539> debts

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.100 

night<00:01:01.950> lords<00:01:02.190> mark<00:01:02.540> basically<00:01:03.540> just<00:01:03.720> let<00:01:03.900> that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:11.070 

almost<00:04:00.489> done

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.200 

so<00:04:11.680> yeah<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:12.130> since<00:04:12.370> your<00:04:12.580> arranged<00:04:12.970> class

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
so yeah and since your arranged class

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.199 
so yeah and since your arranged class
went<00:04:13.570> to<00:04:13.600> go<00:04:13.780> up<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.110> top<00:04:14.290> platform

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
went to go up to the top platform

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.759 
went to go up to the top platform
literally<00:04:16.209> once<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:16.660> teleport<00:04:17.110> up<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.470> think

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
literally once you teleport up I think

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.920 
literally once you teleport up I think
you<00:04:17.860> should<00:04:18.040> still<00:04:18.280> be<00:04:18.430> safe<00:04:18.790> but<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.480> think

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
you should still be safe but I think

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.070 
you should still be safe but I think
it'd<00:04:20.019> be<00:04:20.049> better<00:04:20.470> or<00:04:20.830> safer<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.519> go<00:04:21.850> up<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.390> or

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
it'd be better or safer to go up to or

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.830 
it'd be better or safer to go up to or
to<00:04:23.380> move<00:04:23.590> over<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.040> side<00:04:24.280> actually<00:04:25.590> nope

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
up to the portal on the right side the

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.080 
up to the portal on the right side the
farthest<00:05:40.250> right<00:05:40.400> side<00:05:40.669> when<00:05:40.880> you<00:05:40.970> actually

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
farthest right side when you actually

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
farthest right side when you actually
enter<00:05:41.620> Daleks<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:42.800> then<00:05:43.660> go<00:05:44.660> up<00:05:44.840> kill

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.780 
enter Daleks and then go up kill
everything<00:05:45.350> go<00:05:45.890> up<00:05:45.950> to<00:05:46.070> the<00:05:46.160> shoulder<00:05:46.460> kill

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
everything go up to the shoulder kill

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.790 
everything go up to the shoulder kill
that<00:05:46.970> and<00:05:47.270> then<00:05:47.630> I<00:05:48.140> don't<00:05:48.410> know<00:05:48.500> why<00:05:48.740> this

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
that and then I don't know why this

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.230 
that and then I don't know why this
exactly<00:05:49.640> happens<00:05:50.180> but<00:05:51.880> when<00:05:52.880> you<00:05:52.970> kill<00:05:53.120> the

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
exactly happens but when you kill the

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.870 
exactly happens but when you kill the
shoulder<00:05:53.780> it<00:05:54.110> um<00:05:54.460> it's<00:05:55.460> kind<00:05:55.610> of<00:05:55.640> weird

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
shoulder it um it's kind of weird

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.840 
shoulder it um it's kind of weird
because<00:05:56.140> I'd<00:05:57.140> expect<00:05:57.710> one<00:05:58.010> of<00:05:58.040> the<00:05:58.280> hands<00:05:58.580> at

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
because I'd expect one of the hands at

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.500 
because I'd expect one of the hands at
least<00:05:59.060> pop<00:05:59.300> up<00:05:59.540> but<00:05:59.840> it<00:05:59.960> doesn't

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
least pop up but it doesn't

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.850 
least pop up but it doesn't
I<00:06:01.600> don't<00:06:02.230> really<00:06:02.350> know<00:06:02.530> why<00:06:02.980> but<00:06:03.550> yeah

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
I don't really know why but yeah

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.340 
I don't really know why but yeah
actually<00:06:05.860> I<00:06:06.100> have<00:06:06.310> noticed<00:06:06.760> though<00:06:07.230> if<00:06:08.230> you

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
actually I have noticed though if you

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.920 
actually I have noticed though if you
move<00:06:08.530> over<00:06:08.800> to<00:06:08.920> the<00:06:09.040> right<00:06:09.400> slightly<00:06:09.850> one<00:06:10.660> hand

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
move over to the right slightly one hand

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.900 
move over to the right slightly one hand
actually<00:06:11.170> does<00:06:11.470> pop<00:06:11.740> up<00:06:11.980> so<00:06:12.280> I<00:06:12.370> think<00:06:12.430> it's<00:06:12.670> out

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
actually does pop up so I think it's out

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.270 
actually does pop up so I think it's out
of<00:06:12.940> the<00:06:13.150> range<00:06:13.390> for<00:06:13.840> it<00:06:13.990> or<00:06:14.170> something<00:06:14.740> it's

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
of the range for it or something it's

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.850 
of the range for it or something it's
kind<00:06:15.520> of<00:06:15.550> weird<00:06:15.820> but<00:06:16.120> yeah<00:06:16.930> it's<00:06:17.140> it's<00:06:17.710> just

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
kind of weird but yeah it's it's just

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.910 
kind of weird but yeah it's it's just
very<00:06:18.430> easy<00:06:18.700> to<00:06:18.940> do<00:06:19.060> this<00:06:19.210> on<00:06:19.540> a<00:06:19.600> night<00:06:20.290> Lord<00:06:20.530> so
