hello<00:00:00.750> Nancy<00:00:01.050> here<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:01.890> I<00:00:02.159> want<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.520> just<00:00:02.730> talk

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
hello Nancy here and I want to just talk

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.150 
hello Nancy here and I want to just talk
to<00:00:03.030> you<00:00:03.270> about<00:00:03.330> right<00:00:03.990> side<00:00:04.319> versus<00:00:04.890> wrong

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
to you about right side versus wrong

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.849 
to you about right side versus wrong
side<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.790> see<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:06.660> in<00:00:06.779> patterns<00:00:07.230> all<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.620> time

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
side you see it in patterns all the time

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.310 
side you see it in patterns all the time
and<00:00:08.099> again<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.760> more<00:00:09.059> for<00:00:09.690> new<00:00:09.900> knitters

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
and again this is more for new knitters

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.490 
and again this is more for new knitters
and<00:00:10.940> it's<00:00:11.940> extremely<00:00:12.540> important<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.440> you

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
and it's extremely important that you

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.609 
and it's extremely important that you
understand<00:00:14.400> which<00:00:14.730> side<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.240> which

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
understand which side is which

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.930 
understand which side is which
particularly<00:00:16.619> when<00:00:16.830> your<00:00:16.980> patterns<00:00:17.460> getting

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
particularly when your patterns getting

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.560 
particularly when your patterns getting
a<00:00:18.119> more<00:00:18.570> detailed<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.520> don't<00:00:21.029> know<00:00:21.300> what

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
a more detailed if you don't know what

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.830 
a more detailed if you don't know what
side<00:00:21.900> you're<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.980> could<00:00:23.220> end<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:23.840> shaping

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
side you're on you could end up shaping

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.990 
side you're on you could end up shaping
an<00:00:24.960> armhole<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.160> wrong<00:00:26.400> side<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
an armhole on the wrong side of a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.240 
an armhole on the wrong side of a
pattern<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.779> could<00:00:27.990> end<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.260> adding<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.769> cable

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
pattern you could end up adding a cable

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.540 
pattern you could end up adding a cable
on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> side<00:00:29.760> where<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.150> doesn't<00:00:30.390> belong<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
on the side where it doesn't belong and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.270 
on the side where it doesn't belong and
long<00:00:32.550> tail<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.329> one<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.200> those<00:00:34.380> cast<00:00:34.890> stones

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
long tail is one of those cast stones

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.940 
long tail is one of those cast stones
that<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.700> very<00:00:36.210> easy<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.809> detect<00:00:37.200> which<00:00:37.590> side

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that is very easy to detect which side

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.180 
that is very easy to detect which side
is<00:00:38.280> wrong<00:00:38.610> side<00:00:38.969> versus<00:00:39.510> right<00:00:39.780> side<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.379> one

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
is wrong side versus right side and one

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.590 
is wrong side versus right side and one
thing<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.520> want<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> show<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:45.149> bottom

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
thing I want to show you is the bottom

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.869 
thing I want to show you is the bottom
here<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.530> look<00:00:46.770> at<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.309> long<00:00:47.579> tail

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
here if you look at this is long tail

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.260 
here if you look at this is long tail
cast<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.600> now<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.379> other<00:00:49.739> cast<00:00:50.219> ons<00:00:50.579> use<00:00:50.910> many

cast on now the other cast ons use many

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.240 
cast on now the other cast ons use many
of<00:00:51.449> them<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.809> more<00:00:52.050> forgiving<00:00:52.620> both<00:00:52.890> sides

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
of them are more forgiving both sides

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.299 
of them are more forgiving both sides
are<00:00:53.489> attractive<00:00:54.210> long<00:00:55.020> tail<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.039> case

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
are attractive long tail is not the case

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.139 
are attractive long tail is not the case
on<00:00:56.930> other<00:00:57.930> patterns<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.829> other<00:00:58.949> cast<00:00:59.280> ons<00:00:59.640> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
on other patterns and other cast ons you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.000 
on other patterns and other cast ons you
would<00:01:00.329> probably<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.840> pin<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> side<00:01:01.739> that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
would probably just pin the side that

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.399 
would probably just pin the side that
you<00:01:02.160> think<00:01:02.520> you're<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> designate<00:01:04.170> as

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
you think you're going to designate as

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.649 
you think you're going to designate as
your<00:01:04.799> right<00:01:05.220> side<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.729> pattern<00:01:06.000> will<00:01:06.270> often

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
your right side and a pattern will often

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.840 
your right side and a pattern will often
tell<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> want<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.549> quick

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
tell you that but if you want a quick

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.300 
tell you that but if you want a quick
glance<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.450> long<00:01:09.720> tail

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
glance on long tail

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.370 
glance on long tail
notice<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.580> staff<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.360> slashes<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.140> guess

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
notice the staff the slashes I guess

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.719 
notice the staff the slashes I guess
you'd<00:01:13.590> call<00:01:13.619> them<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.220> looks<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
you'd call them and it looks like the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.490 
you'd call them and it looks like the
waves<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.210> an<00:01:15.330> ocean<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.720> see<00:01:15.990> how<00:01:16.140> nice<00:01:16.470> that

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
waves of an ocean you see how nice that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.090 
waves of an ocean you see how nice that
looks<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:18.210> flip<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.570> over<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.799> look

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
looks if you flip it over and you look

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.380 
looks if you flip it over and you look
here<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:22.140> bottom<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.860> all<00:01:23.040> bumpy<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
here the bottom is all bumpy it's not a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.920 
here the bottom is all bumpy it's not a
nice<00:01:24.780> smooth<00:01:25.350> line<00:01:25.729> if<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.000> were<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.360> use<00:01:27.600> this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
nice smooth line if you were to use this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.960 
nice smooth line if you were to use this
and<00:01:28.229> not<00:01:28.590> pay<00:01:28.920> attention<00:01:28.950> if<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.640> were<00:01:29.759> making

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
and not pay attention if you were making

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.499 
and not pay attention if you were making
a<00:01:30.240> hat<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.900> had<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> outside<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
a hat and had this on the outside the I

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.380 
a hat and had this on the outside the I
would<00:01:34.140> probably<00:01:34.799> drop<00:01:35.369> down<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.150> this

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
would probably drop down and see this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.289 
would probably drop down and see this
and<00:01:36.630> find<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.290> less<00:01:37.560> attractive<00:01:38.400> then<00:01:39.060> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and find it less attractive then it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.319 
and find it less attractive then it
would<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.750> looking<00:01:40.619> at<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.490> I'm<00:01:42.150> just

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
would be looking at this and I'm just

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.969 
would be looking at this and I'm just
going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> move<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.990> over<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.500> same<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.950> true

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
going to move this over the same is true

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.030 
going to move this over the same is true
for<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.520> ribbing<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.110> see<00:01:46.409> there's<00:01:46.890> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
for this ribbing you can see there's a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.850 
for this ribbing you can see there's a
nice<00:01:47.310> slash<00:01:47.790> when<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.329> turn<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.750> over<00:01:48.899> it's

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
nice slash when you turn it over it's

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.700 
nice slash when you turn it over it's
just<00:01:50.850> not<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.390> attractive<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.649> think

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
just not as attractive and and I think

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.889 
just not as attractive and and I think
once<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.340> understand<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> difference<00:01:54.630> your

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
once you understand the difference your

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.160 
once you understand the difference your
eye<00:01:54.930> will<00:01:55.439> automatically<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.930> that<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
eye will automatically see that the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.770 
eye will automatically see that the
detail<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.799> totally<00:01:59.549> different<00:01:59.969> again

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
detail is totally different again
