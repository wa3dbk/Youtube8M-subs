00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
been playing this in Smash 4 and I

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.200 
been playing this in Smash 4 and I
remember<00:00:50.160> talking<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.579> person<00:00:50.760> about

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
remember talking to one person about

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.970 
remember talking to one person about
this<00:00:51.329> he<00:00:51.449> said<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.809> foe<00:00:52.079> has<00:00:52.590> much<00:00:52.800> more

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
this he said you know foe has much more

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.350 
this he said you know foe has much more
experience<00:00:53.399> with<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> character<00:00:54.210> but

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
experience with the character but

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.240 
experience with the character but
sometimes<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.989> cat<00:00:55.199> makes<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.039> little

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
sometimes the cat makes just a little

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.590 
sometimes the cat makes just a little
bit<00:00:56.370> more<00:00:56.489> intelligent<00:00:56.760> options<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.510> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
bit more intelligent options and I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.660 
bit more intelligent options and I
wonder<00:00:57.899> how<00:00:58.170> we're<00:00:58.379> gonna<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.190> here<00:00:59.520> oh

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
wonder how we're gonna see that here oh

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.660 
wonder how we're gonna see that here oh
definitely<00:01:00.359> um<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.309> both<00:01:02.640> of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
definitely um we do know that both of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.520 
definitely um we do know that both of
these<00:01:02.850> characters<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> same<00:01:04.019> toolkit

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
these characters have the same toolkit

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.500 
these characters have the same toolkit
so<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.309> think<00:01:05.580> what<00:01:05.820> we're<00:01:05.939> gonna<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.360> see

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
so I think what we're gonna have to see

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.510 
so I think what we're gonna have to see
here<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.960> basically<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.770> different

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
here is just basically a different

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.940 
here is just basically a different
playstyle<00:01:08.939> see<00:01:09.210> how<00:01:09.390> either<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.170> them<00:01:10.350> can

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
playstyle see how either of them can

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
playstyle see how either of them can
best<00:01:11.280> each<00:01:11.490> other<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.820> match<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.390> thing<00:01:12.540> I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
best each other to match up one thing I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.109 
best each other to match up one thing I
will<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.320> looking<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.700> who

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
will be looking out for is to see who

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.140 
will be looking out for is to see who
can<00:01:15.360> get<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.259> other<00:01:16.470> mess<00:01:16.770> offstage<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.790> then

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
can get the other mess offstage and then

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.690 
can get the other mess offstage and then

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
after that force the upbeat then used a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.670 
after that force the upbeat then used a
sign<00:01:20.970> nightmare<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> upper<00:01:22.259> hand<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
sign nightmare to get the upper hand and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.100 
sign nightmare to get the upper hand and
get<00:01:22.860> rid<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.460> quickly<00:01:23.880> that's<00:01:24.840> it's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
get rid of this not quickly that's it's
