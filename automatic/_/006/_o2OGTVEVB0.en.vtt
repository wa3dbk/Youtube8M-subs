there<00:00:05.600> are<00:00:05.660> four<00:00:05.870> main<00:00:06.050> factors<00:00:06.590> that<00:00:06.620> go<00:00:06.890> into

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
there are four main factors that go into

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.430 
there are four main factors that go into
wildlife<00:00:07.430> photography<00:00:08.059> and<00:00:08.270> the<00:00:08.960> two<00:00:09.290> most

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
wildlife photography and the two most

wildlife photography and the two most
important<00:00:09.920> ones<00:00:10.100> have<00:00:10.430> nothing<00:00:10.820> to<00:00:10.880> do<00:00:11.000> with

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
important ones have nothing to do with

work how the tides change the behavior
of<00:00:29.240> water<00:00:29.750> birds<00:00:30.170> for<00:00:30.800> example<00:00:31.220> you'll<00:00:31.640> be

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
of water birds for example you'll be

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.729 
of water birds for example you'll be
watching<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.150> phases<00:00:32.510> of<00:00:32.540> the<00:00:32.720> Moon<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:33.320> the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
weather and the rain time is the most

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.960 
weather and the rain time is the most
important<00:00:36.949> factor<00:00:37.309> and<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:37.489> great<00:00:37.640> wildlife

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
important factor and the great wildlife

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.149 
important factor and the great wildlife
photographers<00:00:38.629> they<00:00:39.199> might<00:00:39.409> have<00:00:39.559> great<00:00:39.710> gear

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
photographers they might have great gear

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:42.399 
photographers they might have great gear
but<00:00:40.580> the<00:00:40.610> biggest<00:00:40.850> factor<00:00:41.269> is<00:00:41.420> they<00:00:41.870> put<00:00:42.110> in<00:00:42.229> a

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:42.409 
but the biggest factor is they put in a

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.590 
but the biggest factor is they put in a
lot<00:00:42.589> of<00:00:42.710> time<00:00:42.949> the<00:00:43.820> second<00:00:44.089> most<00:00:44.180> important

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
lot of time the second most important

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.930 
lot of time the second most important
factor<00:00:44.629> is<00:00:45.140> distance<00:00:45.890> getting<00:00:46.309> closer<00:00:46.640> and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
factor is distance getting closer and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.020 
factor is distance getting closer and
closer<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.600> closer<00:00:48.019> to<00:00:48.350> your<00:00:48.440> subject

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
closer and closer to your subject

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.430 
closer and closer to your subject
experience<00:00:50.030> helps<00:00:50.540> you<00:00:50.659> get<00:00:50.960> closer<00:00:51.260> without

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
experience helps you get closer without

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.049 
experience helps you get closer without
disturbing<00:00:52.070> them<00:00:52.190> things<00:00:52.519> like<00:00:52.610> camouflage

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
disturbing them things like camouflage

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.219 
disturbing them things like camouflage
lets<00:00:53.930> me<00:00:54.049> get<00:00:54.229> maybe<00:00:54.460> 25<00:00:55.460> percent<00:00:55.489> closer<00:00:56.229> the

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
lets me get maybe 25 percent closer the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.259 
lets me get maybe 25 percent closer the
third<00:00:57.409> most<00:00:57.589> important<00:00:58.010> factor<00:00:58.339> are<00:00:58.909> lenses

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
third most important factor are lenses

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.030 
third most important factor are lenses
and<00:01:00.129> you<00:01:01.129> go<00:01:01.280> from<00:01:01.780> 400<00:01:02.780> millimeters<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.589> 500

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
and you go from 400 millimeters to 500

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.140 
and you go from 400 millimeters to 500
millimeters<00:01:04.519> you're<00:01:04.640> going<00:01:04.760> to<00:01:04.820> go<00:01:04.940> from

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
millimeters you're going to go from

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.300 
millimeters you're going to go from
spending<00:01:05.740> $1,300<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:07.430> six<00:01:07.700> or<00:01:08.299> $10,000<00:01:09.259> I<00:01:09.469> get

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
spending $1,300 to six or $10,000 I get

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.609 
spending $1,300 to six or $10,000 I get
about<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.640> same<00:01:10.670> extra<00:01:11.509> reach<00:01:11.719> out<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.229> some

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
about the same extra reach out of some

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.700 
about the same extra reach out of some
camo<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:14.270> can<00:01:14.390> spend<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.689> whole<00:01:14.840> lot<00:01:15.020> on<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.380> lens

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
camo you can spend a whole lot on a lens

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.010 
camo you can spend a whole lot on a lens
and<00:01:16.009> big<00:01:16.340> prime<00:01:16.670> lenses<00:01:17.030> like<00:01:17.270> this<00:01:17.570> one<00:01:17.810> are

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
and big prime lenses like this one are

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.529 
and big prime lenses like this one are
real<00:01:18.680> real<00:01:18.920> expensive<00:01:19.340> they<00:01:20.149> will<00:01:20.329> make<00:01:20.509> a

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
real real expensive they will make a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.109 
real real expensive they will make a
difference<00:01:20.990> but<00:01:21.649> getting<00:01:22.310> closer<00:01:22.640> is<00:01:22.850> always

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
difference but getting closer is always

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.490 
difference but getting closer is always
the<00:01:23.210> better<00:01:23.329> option<00:01:23.780> because<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.140> big<00:01:24.320> lens

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
the better option because the big lens

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.039 
the better option because the big lens
won't<00:01:25.280> overcome<00:01:25.820> atmospheric<00:01:26.119> conditions

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
won't overcome atmospheric conditions

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
the less sharp you're going to get no

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.789 
the less sharp you're going to get no

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
you can get close even at 70 to 300 lens

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.690 
you can get close even at 70 to 300 lens
will<00:01:37.850> produce<00:01:38.509> great<00:01:39.259> results<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:40.460> last

that's<00:01:44.030> what<00:01:44.149> we're<00:01:44.240> talking<00:01:44.509> about<00:01:44.570> today

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
that's what we're talking about today

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.139 
that's what we're talking about today
because<00:01:45.170> I<00:01:45.259> have<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.439> brand-new<00:01:45.740> canon<00:01:46.460> 5d<00:01:46.700> SR

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
because I have the brand-new canon 5d SR

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.919 
because I have the brand-new canon 5d SR
with<00:01:47.390> 50<00:01:48.009> megapixels<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:49.219> no<00:01:49.929> anti-aliasing

towards<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:12.860> you<00:03:13.069> need<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:13.910> be<00:03:14.000> shooting<00:03:14.209> for

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
towards you you need to be shooting for

five<00:03:14.720> or<00:03:14.900> six<00:03:14.930> seconds<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:16.010> gets<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.310> be

you start forcing yourself to wait until

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.990 
you start forcing yourself to wait until

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
the bird gets closer and closer and

closer before you start hitting that
shutter<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.060> 5d<00:03:26.420> SR<00:03:26.720> isn't<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.500> best<00:03:27.680> for

the<00:04:18.169> frame<00:04:18.349> is<00:04:18.560> if<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:18.769> put<00:04:19.010> about<00:04:19.459> 25

you're going to fill the frame on a
full-frame<00:04:45.200> camera<00:04:45.710> so<00:04:46.520> most<00:04:46.730> people<00:04:46.960> will
