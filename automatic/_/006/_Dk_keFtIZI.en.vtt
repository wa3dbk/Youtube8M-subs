yeah so let's start here just at the at
the<00:02:23.580> flat<00:02:23.850> flat<00:02:24.360> position

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.250 

if<00:02:31.189> you<00:02:31.310> bring<00:02:31.579> in<00:02:31.849> some<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.659> bass<00:02:32.870> boost

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
if you bring in some of the bass boost

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.119 
if you bring in some of the bass boost
and<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:39.170> also<00:02:39.349> have<00:02:39.620> quite<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:39.950> bit<00:02:40.099> of

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
and you also have quite a bit of

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.970 
and you also have quite a bit of
high-end<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.819> can<00:02:40.970> accentuate<00:02:44.829> so<00:02:45.829> it's

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
high-end you can accentuate so it's

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.099 
high-end you can accentuate so it's
really<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.310> very<00:02:46.519> very<00:02:47.090> versatile<00:02:47.780> instrument

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
really a very very versatile instrument

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.819 
really a very very versatile instrument
with<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.220> single<00:02:49.579> pickup<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.359> just<00:02:51.049> a<00:02:51.170> lot<00:02:51.680> of

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
with the single pickup and just a lot of

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.800 
with the single pickup and just a lot of
capability<00:02:52.609> to<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:52.939> for<00:02:53.090> different<00:02:53.420> types<00:02:53.629> of

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
capability to it for different types of

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.410 
capability to it for different types of
music<00:02:54.319> ranging<00:02:55.250> from<00:02:55.430> all<00:02:55.730> kinds<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.239> things

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
music ranging from all kinds of things

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.300 
music ranging from all kinds of things
of<00:02:56.569> course<00:02:56.720> from<00:02:56.930> rock<00:02:57.470> through<00:02:57.709> jazz<00:02:57.980> and

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
of course from rock through jazz and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.640 
of course from rock through jazz and
blues<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.879> pretty<00:02:59.420> much<00:02:59.540> whatever<00:02:59.780> you<00:02:59.989> can

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
blues and pretty much whatever you can

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.740 
blues and pretty much whatever you can
use<00:03:01.129> your<00:03:01.280> imagination<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:02.239> reach<00:03:02.450> out<00:03:02.720> for

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
use your imagination to reach out for

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.410 
use your imagination to reach out for
now<00:03:03.500> we're<00:03:03.680> hearing<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.159> through<00:03:04.310> an<00:03:04.459> AER<00:03:05.060> amp

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
now we're hearing it through an AER amp

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.830 
now we're hearing it through an AER amp
and<00:03:05.780> 80<00:03:06.019> yards<00:03:06.379> are<00:03:06.560> great<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:08.540> know<00:03:08.569> but

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
and 80 yards are great and you know but

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.899 
and 80 yards are great and you know but
it's<00:03:08.959> small<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.099> but<00:03:10.489> even<00:03:10.730> though<00:03:10.849> this

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
it's small and and but even though this

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.089 
it's small and and but even though this
is<00:03:11.120> small<00:03:11.480> it's<00:03:11.810> like<00:03:12.139> that<00:03:12.379> low-end<00:03:12.829> like<00:03:12.980> you

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
is small it's like that low-end like you

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.160 
is small it's like that low-end like you
mentioned<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.579> really<00:03:14.000> deep<00:03:14.329> you<00:03:14.870> can<00:03:15.019> only

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
mentioned is really deep you can only

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.050 
mentioned is really deep you can only
imagine<00:03:15.439> like<00:03:15.950> if<00:03:15.980> this<00:03:16.220> were<00:03:16.370> through<00:03:16.670> like<00:03:16.909> I

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
imagine like if this were through like I

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.879 
imagine like if this were through like I
don't<00:03:17.150> know<00:03:17.299> an<00:03:17.359> SVT<00:03:17.780> or<00:03:18.109> something<00:03:18.500> is

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
don't know an SVT or something is

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.589 
don't know an SVT or something is
cranked<00:03:19.519> it<00:03:19.609> it<00:03:19.879> would<00:03:20.030> be<00:03:20.150> some<00:03:20.450> serious

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
cranked it it would be some serious

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.530 
cranked it it would be some serious
low-end<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:22.220> also<00:03:22.459> because<00:03:23.060> of<00:03:23.329> the

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
low-end so and also because of the

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.890 
low-end so and also because of the
active<00:03:24.200> circuit<00:03:24.650> that's<00:03:24.799> here<00:03:25.069> which<00:03:25.250> has<00:03:25.489> a

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
active circuit that's here which has a

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.410 
active circuit that's here which has a
high<00:03:26.900> level<00:03:27.379> low<00:03:27.980> impedance<00:03:28.400> signal<00:03:29.090> coming

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
high level low impedance signal coming

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.979 
high level low impedance signal coming
out<00:03:29.569> of<00:03:29.720> it

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
out of it

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.990 
out of it
you<00:03:30.260> can<00:03:30.409> go<00:03:30.560> directly<00:03:30.980> into<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.489> front<00:03:31.760> end

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
you can go directly into the front end

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.569 
you can go directly into the front end
of<00:03:32.239> recording<00:03:32.750> saw<00:03:33.260> consoles<00:03:33.980> or<00:03:34.220> mixing

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
of recording saw consoles or mixing

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.030 
of recording saw consoles or mixing
boards<00:03:35.060> without<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.449> direct<00:03:35.870> box<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.470> get<00:03:37.010> a

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
boards without a direct box and get a

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.150 
boards without a direct box and get a
fantastic<00:03:37.910> sound<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.750> without<00:03:39.650> any<00:03:40.040> of

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
fantastic sound to it without any of

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.580 
fantastic sound to it without any of
those<00:03:40.250> extra<00:03:40.489> items<00:03:41.480> in<00:03:41.660> this<00:03:41.810> in<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.199> signal

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
those extra items in this in the signal

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.830 
those extra items in this in the signal
chain<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:43.489> that's<00:03:43.699> one<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.030> advantages<00:03:44.780> of

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
chain so that's one of the advantages of

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.819 
chain so that's one of the advantages of
this<00:03:45.379> type<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.650> electronic<00:03:46.400> setup<00:03:47.090> also<00:03:47.829> cool

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
this type of electronic setup also cool

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.849 
this type of electronic setup also cool
so<00:03:49.099> is<00:03:49.609> this<00:03:50.049> so<00:03:51.049> new<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.560> don't<00:03:51.709> have<00:03:51.769> a

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
price at yet or do you know what this is

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:54.990 
price at yet or do you know what this is
going<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.540> be<00:03:53.629> going<00:03:53.810> for<00:03:54.109> on<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.319> street<00:03:54.560> I
