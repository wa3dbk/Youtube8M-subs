00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.160
 if all roads lead to Rome as 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.650
 you leave blunt sometimes think 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.450
 too much and feel very little my grandfather 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.790
 always said that if someone wants 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.039
 seriously being part of your life will make 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.230
 the impossible to be in it although in 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.330
 somehow we lose between screens the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.400
 value of the looks forgetting that 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.869
 When someone dedicates his time we 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.330
 is giving away the only thing that is not 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.850
 will ever recover is that life those 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.910
 moments you know I'm here now and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.710
 tomorrow I do not know, so I wanted to 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.589
 tell you that if you ever want something 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.510
 if you want something really go for it 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.559
 without looking back looking at the middle of 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.170
 front and eyes 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.059
 delivering everything and giving the soul taking out 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.830
 the child you carry inside that believes 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.619
 it is not impossible if the moon would be 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.989
 touch a star so I do not know what 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:57.659
 it will be my tomorrow but this sun always 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.239
 is going to be the same as yours and the 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.580
 friends of the family that we chose and I 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.110
 I choose you I choose you for being 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.210
 owner of the wrinkles that would have 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.580
 lips of an old woman who bet strongly 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.690
 all these years saturated at night 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.420
 in candle 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.150
 the laughter the secrets and the loves of the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.430
 past your hugs like that because if without 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.970
 come to story or have to celebrate 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.970
 something 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.619
 and it is that in this time I have given 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.020
 Notice that the little details are 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.450
 those who do the great things that you 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.070
 you have made my limit infinite so you 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.770
 I thank you for being the only person 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.320
 able to make me cry laughing for 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.880
 look like my life with that crazy smile 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.250
 that shine the eyes able to fight 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.710
 against a million tsunamis so no 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.799
 I do not know where we will be in ten 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.649
 I do not even know how to get out of roman 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.850
 I can assure nothing but I promise you that 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.159
 whatever happens 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.220
 wherever you are, I'll remember you 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.399
 all my life and that's why he gave me a go 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.049
 be always with you because you 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.740
 You taught to live each day as the 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.610
 first day of the rest of my life and that 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.610
 I will never forget that
