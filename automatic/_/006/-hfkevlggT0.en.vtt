00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.639
 hello i am robert gibbs and we are 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.320
 Still on the cebit that is always 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.759
 still day zero and it is not all too 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.929
 busy because first of all after 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.610
 secondly, it was also straight 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.470
 the mobile world congress but what me 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.480
 I found this delicious samsung 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.130
 series seven ultrabook that is the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.810
 version without touch to recognize at the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.340
 Names 730 u3 is a great part that is 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.980
 the thing was a few months ago 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.150
 Amazon appeared for 799 euro in 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.619
 the version with four gigabytes 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.030
 RAM but in Germany 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.620
 Unfortunately, only the version comes with six 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.110
 gigabytes of memory and the cost 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.740
 then right now just 999 euros instead 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.970
 these hoped for mine 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.530
 opinion after a very pity is 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.760
 you still get a lot for it 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.310
 because the device is really very very 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.930
 neatly equipped because it has in 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.750
 the german version 6 megabyte 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.940
 memory 128 gb ssd minimum the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.740
 However, it also goes to 256 then 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.320
 of course a whole corner more expensive but 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.240
 one thing is just that here a 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.730
 radeon add-on graphics card by amd 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.590
 it puts a 58 50 m chip set in it 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.750
 he has 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.520
 an opponent with additional own 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.170
 memory therefore loads the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.650
 RAM is not and we have here 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.250
 that 's the 35 37 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.870
 that goes from 2 ghz to 3.1 ghz high that 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.880
 is therefore quite a powerhouse and 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.410
 there is still a 1 7 version but the 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.570
 costs then of course also correspond 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.280
 the whole device is as far as I can see 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.810
 Can aluminum and why feels 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.909
 not so much now but me 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.280
 I think that's alu 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.469
 13.3 inch display full HD resolution 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.509
 that's why it's so great and it has one 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.369
 relatively matte display already reflects 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.229
 a little bit of work is already 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.600
 Coated is therefore also as matt 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.450
 You do not even need to market it 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.640
 necessarily the touchscreen because of this 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.890
 trackpad is so good that you can 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.420
 so comfortable from the side vision 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.509
 can execute the gestures at the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.979
 windows 8 are common for example 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.929
 what else is there to say there is one 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.090
 quite a battery inside which should be up 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.369
 for just under 8 hours 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.450
 I believe 44 hours was the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.340
 the announcement is 6100 milliamps 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.800
 and we let's see real quick around here 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.930
 we have the kensington lock in the back there 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.310
 next to the normal usb port one more 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.720
 normal usb port this is by the way 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.970
 some weird fuse of 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.470
 Samsung is a full SD card reader 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.920
 there are some ultrabooks yes 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.530
 no more 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.720
 and as you can see it is also relatively thin 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.519
 By the way, the whole thing will be 165 cinema 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.660
 would have to be in the version and even got me 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.069
 be a little bit lighter 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.170
 here we have the provider 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.970
 trackpad with the built-in mouse buttons 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.040
 the keyboard works quite well as well 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.750
 is actually quite neat though 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.280
 not as good as the session though 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.140
 Nobody can pay anyway 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.660
 over there we have a relatively small shift 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.739
 button but there you can also 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.180
 get used to it so what do I do 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.980
 personally only use the link shop 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.239
 the left shift button of meyer would 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.010
 Maybe it bothers me a bit 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.410
 Let's go on the left side 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.810
 there we have the displayport and on 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.459
 is it with a headphone jack that 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.220
 is the usb 3 0-port of which there is 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.060
 apparently only one hdmi connection 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.170
 of full size and a normal one 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.959
 ethernet port in the back and there is more to come 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.160
 the electricity connection that was open 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.450
 Unfortunately you can not like the device 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.829
 common with so many nowadays 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.090
 ultrabooks up here we see the 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.609
 loudspeakers blow so in the direction 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.290
 of the ground and pretty much 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.180
 Local products and I hope so 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.980
 that he would soon cheaper than this 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.130
 I would like to have it myself 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.130
 then
