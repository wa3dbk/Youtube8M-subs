hill what you put in to powered rail put
in<00:00:30.720> your<00:00:31.099> regular<00:00:32.099> way<00:00:32.430> which<00:00:32.669> will<00:00:32.820> act<00:00:33.000> as

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
in your regular way which will act as

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.870 
in your regular way which will act as
the<00:00:33.329> curve<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.950> at<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> end<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.760> that

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the curve and then at the end of that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.930 
the curve and then at the end of that
curve<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.510> detector<00:00:36.989> rail<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.940> now

curve but I detector rail like so now

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.990 
curve but I detector rail like so now
you'll<00:00:39.120> need<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> way<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.660> powering<00:00:40.410> these

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
you'll need a way of powering these

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.569 
you'll need a way of powering these
powered<00:00:42.000> rails<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.420> top<00:00:42.629> here<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.489> can<00:00:44.489> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

wire<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:12.689> bit<00:01:12.780> later<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.290> we

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
wire a little bit later but we

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.130 
wire a little bit later but we
definitely<00:01:14.549> need<00:01:14.880> wire<00:01:15.150> all<00:01:15.390> along<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.020> whole

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
definitely need wire all along the whole

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.999 
definitely need wire all along the whole
top<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.950> RS<00:01:17.220> nor<00:01:17.369> latch<00:01:18.229> okay<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.290> there's

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
top of the RS nor latch okay so there's

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.679 
top of the RS nor latch okay so there's
one<00:01:20.490> part<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:21.000> let's<00:01:21.240> begin<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.659> next<00:01:21.810> slot

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
one part now let's begin the next slot

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.359 
one part now let's begin the next slot
this<00:01:24.689> down<00:01:24.960> here<00:01:27.110> in<00:01:28.110> same<00:01:28.560> pattern<00:01:29.009> put<00:01:29.340> a

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
this down here in same pattern put a

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:38.360 
this down here in same pattern put a
butcher<00:01:30.140> he'll<00:01:31.140> like<00:01:31.439> so

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.860 

detector<00:01:39.370> rail<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.960> take<00:01:41.590> this<00:01:41.770> out<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.070> put<00:01:42.430> a

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
detector rail so take this out to put a

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.390 
detector rail so take this out to put a
perm<00:01:43.870> in<00:01:43.990> redstone<00:01:44.410> torch<00:01:44.650> here<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:47.080> then<00:01:47.830> put

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
perm in redstone torch here and then put

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:59.210 
perm in redstone torch here and then put
in<00:01:48.520> another<00:01:50.400> RS<00:01:51.400> nor<00:01:51.640> latch

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.910 

okay<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.060> you'll<00:02:00.810> need<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> connect<00:02:01.530> this

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
okay so you'll need to connect this

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.020 
okay so you'll need to connect this
detector<00:02:02.520> rail<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:02.910> toward<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.200> our<00:02:04.560> last

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
detector rail now toward the our last

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.390 
detector rail now toward the our last
our<00:02:06.030> first<00:02:06.510> slot<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.560> I'd<00:02:08.430> put<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.820> a<00:02:08.940> little

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
our first slot so I'd put in a little

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:20.600 
our first slot so I'd put in a little
here<00:02:13.640> oops<00:02:15.980> there<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.010> go<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:19.100> one<00:02:20.100> one<00:02:20.340> last

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
all right there and place that on top of

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.910 
all right there and place that on top of
the<00:02:26.880> redstone<00:02:27.570> torch<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.110> power<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:28.560> each<00:02:28.740> of

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
the redstone torch that power is each of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:37.190 
the redstone torch that power is each of
your<00:02:29.040> slots<00:02:31.580> alright<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:34.970> there<00:02:35.970> we<00:02:36.330> go<00:02:36.360> um<00:02:36.840> I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
your slots alright so there we go um I

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.510 
your slots alright so there we go um I
think<00:02:37.440> there's<00:02:37.620> one<00:02:37.800> last<00:02:37.980> thing<00:02:38.160> I'm<00:02:38.340> missing

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
is actually put in a bit of redstone

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.090 
is actually put in a bit of redstone
wire<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.690> connect<00:02:46.050> if<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.709> have<00:02:46.860> any<00:02:47.010> other

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
where I'm facing but I think that's all

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.620 
where I'm facing but I think that's all
you<00:02:55.530> need<00:02:55.680> once<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.400> have<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.850> pattern<00:02:57.390> here

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
you need once you have this pattern here

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.140 
you need once you have this pattern here
of<00:02:57.660> one<00:02:58.440> going<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.130> right<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.760> one<00:02:59.790> going

of one going to the right and one going
to<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.330> left<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:01.080> can<00:03:01.230> then<00:03:01.350> just<00:03:01.590> copy<00:03:01.800> this

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
to the left you can then just copy this

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.810 
to the left you can then just copy this
as<00:03:02.370> many<00:03:02.520> times<00:03:02.640> as<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.150> want<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.890> however

button and it'll that should be enough

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.240 
button and it'll that should be enough
just<00:03:36.269> be<00:03:36.450> aware<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:37.070> you'll<00:03:38.070> need<00:03:38.190> a

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
just be aware that you'll need a

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.520 
just be aware that you'll need a
detector<00:03:38.790> rail<00:03:39.000> after<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:39.600> say<00:03:40.049> this<00:03:40.230> card

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
detector rail after this say this card

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.199 
detector rail after this say this card
leaves<00:03:40.799> you'll<00:03:41.160> need<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.310> detector<00:03:41.640> rail<00:03:41.790> here

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
leaves you'll need a detector rail here

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.470 
leaves you'll need a detector rail here
that<00:03:42.750> will<00:03:43.019> power<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.250> RS<00:03:44.820> nor<00:03:45.000> latch<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.420> the

second to second two fronts lon I and I

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.020 
second to second two fronts lon I and I
guess<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:48.870> would<00:03:48.959> call<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.519> when

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
guess you would call it so that when

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.600 
guess you would call it so that when
this<00:03:51.330> card<00:03:51.690> passes<00:03:52.320> over<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.890> detector<00:03:53.430> rail

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
this card passes over this detector rail

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.610 
this card passes over this detector rail
it'll<00:03:54.739> alert<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:56.070> this<00:03:56.370> second<00:03:57.030> front<00:03:57.620> car

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
it'll alert the this second front car

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.559 
it'll alert the this second front car
too

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
too

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.739 
too
the<00:03:59.689> front<00:03:59.959> as<00:04:00.140> well<00:04:00.400> so<00:04:01.400> oh<00:04:01.939> and<00:04:02.269> when<00:04:02.659> it

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:02.749 
the front as well so oh and when it

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:05.679 
the front as well so oh and when it
comes<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.200> cart<00:04:04.010> overflow<00:04:04.549> I<00:04:04.790> have<00:04:05.450> this<00:04:05.629> a

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
comes to cart overflow I have this a

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.989 
comes to cart overflow I have this a
purple<00:04:06.409> one<00:04:06.620> this<00:04:07.159> is<00:04:07.310> sort<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.519> an<00:04:07.609> extra

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:07.999 
purple one this is sort of an extra

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.209 
purple one this is sort of an extra
piece<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.959> whole<00:04:09.139> dispenser<00:04:09.650> but<00:04:09.859> this

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:10.219 
piece to the whole dispenser but this

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:11.709 
piece to the whole dispenser but this
was<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.430> one<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:10.999> this<00:04:11.180> is<00:04:11.299> the<00:04:11.389> RS<00:04:11.599> nor

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:11.719 
was the one that this is the RS nor

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.709 
was the one that this is the RS nor
latch<00:04:11.810> that<00:04:12.079> controls<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:13.299> switch<00:04:14.299> over<00:04:14.569> here

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:14.719 
latch that controls the switch over here

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.560 
latch that controls the switch over here
so<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:14.959> see<00:04:15.200> that<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:16.099> output<00:04:16.130> of<00:04:16.699> this<00:04:17.180> RS

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
so you see that the output of this RS

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.360 
so you see that the output of this RS
nor<00:04:17.720> latch<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:18.199> connected<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.799> this<00:04:18.949> redstone

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
nor latch is connected to this redstone

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.279 
nor latch is connected to this redstone
torch<00:04:19.849> which<00:04:20.539> controls<00:04:21.229> a<00:04:21.500> switch<00:04:21.799> so<00:04:23.289> again

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
torch which controls a switch so again

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.870 
torch which controls a switch so again
the<00:04:24.410> two<00:04:24.560> inputs<00:04:24.949> apply<00:04:25.250> here<00:04:25.610> so<00:04:26.289> this<00:04:27.289> input

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
the two inputs apply here so this input

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.550 
the two inputs apply here so this input
when<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:29.000> card<00:04:29.330> goes<00:04:29.509> over<00:04:29.810> this<00:04:29.930> this<00:04:30.259> turns

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
when the card goes over this this turns

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.879 
when the card goes over this this turns
on<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.280> RS<00:04:31.550> nor<00:04:31.729> latch<00:04:31.789> and<00:04:32.349> this<00:04:33.349> one<00:04:33.590> turns

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
on the RS nor latch and this one turns

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.710 
on the RS nor latch and this one turns
it<00:04:34.099> off<00:04:34.990> depending<00:04:35.990> on<00:04:36.259> which<00:04:36.500> direction<00:04:36.530> your

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
it off depending on which direction your

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.999 
it off depending on which direction your
dispenser<00:04:38.720> is<00:04:38.780> facing<00:04:39.169> you'll<00:04:39.259> have<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.680> fill

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
dispenser is facing you'll have to fill

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.980 
dispenser is facing you'll have to fill
around<00:04:40.280> with<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.729> output<00:04:41.240> this<00:04:41.479> this<00:04:41.810> guy

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
around with the output this this guy

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.800 
around with the output this this guy
here<00:04:42.400> depending<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:43.430> because<00:04:44.150> again<00:04:44.389> it's<00:04:44.690> a

here depending on because again it's a
switch<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.470> really<00:04:45.889> depends<00:04:46.250> on<00:04:46.340> which

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
switch it really depends on which

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.420 
switch it really depends on which
direction<00:04:46.699> and<00:04:47.180> it'll<00:04:48.050> orientate<00:04:48.770> that

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
direction and it'll orientate that

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.469 
direction and it'll orientate that
differently<00:04:49.849> depending<00:04:49.970> on<00:04:50.300> which<00:04:50.449> direction
