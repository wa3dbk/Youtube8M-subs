00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.750
 welcome to home linda today I'm going to 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.150
 teach how to make centerpieces 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.269
 super-cheap super-cheap can be three 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.070
 different and vegetable let's paint 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.459
 agüita and with this know fabulación 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.459
 honeycombs 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.660
 The basis of these centerpieces is 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.820
 vegetable paint and water of what you 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.980
 you want to put extra that already depends on you 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.289
 me for example this first what you 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.290
 I put are marbles and marbles you can 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.870
 put mechanical stones with colors like 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.390
 these are many colors too 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.070
 personal i like the same color 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.650
 so what I did is easy, we put 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.680
 down and what follows is how to put 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.400
 water we fill two crimes before 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.400
 to fill everything 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:55.289
 what we are going to put is vegetable paint 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.269
 in the cakes you see everything is a droplet 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.100
 let's start from less to more 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.100
 the good thing is with a stick 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.790
 I personally like to do a lot 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.900
 tray I feel like that simplifies 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.450
 the Superbonito phases 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.600
 like nothing else putting like this goes up 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.600
 price 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.009
 there it looks nice to me I love it but what 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.500
 which can be to make it even more 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.000
 nice is to put flowers or the flowers of 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.119
 plastic if everything is doing a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.679
 baby shower I do not know about baby things 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.039
 if you want to make a lot of party 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:34.140
 in your summer house then look super 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.250
 cute so super sprint which will leave 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.859
 us and they will be that as it looks 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.859
 super cheap and easy 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.740
 If it is much more serious we will make 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.460
 all colors set I am already simply 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.550
 dried plastic flowers where they go to 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.350
 thwart 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.360
 and push inward to make pressure 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.400
 so that he stays 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.850
 and now to us like this is more 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.940
 little one is obviously cut it this what 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.640
 You can put in your dining room or even in the 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.030
 entrance of your house in the hallway until 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.770
 in the bathroom 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.320
 if you want to make them for the bathroom this 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.530
 the same process can be the same as with 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.830
 others if you grab and you put yellow 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.140
 for a little sepia is made equal 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.870
 with the adif or the droplet you can put 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.340
 also the dye you have to be 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.710
 later like me at least because 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:39.450
 twitter that I like to do later 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.150
 but it is very yellow it is a droplet of 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.030
 Red 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.730
 even in the grandmother's house I promise you 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.560
 if I will like what I have done is 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.829
 this our second option if it is more 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.829
 she 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.390
 and today we are going with this third and 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.760
 last option that I have you remember 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.200
 that can make countless centers of 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.200
 previous table I have today 3 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.709
 this if you are a little bit more what 4 king 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.140
 heras that are higher does not matter anymore 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.650
 that they fit a little water and the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.650
 things like that 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.980
 now let's fill this with water 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.990
 and I tell you because this if you are more what 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.410
 mattress says as well as what colors more 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.550
 strong then there is now if we cast 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:34.820
 1234 of blue we go for the red 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.820
 12 34 same with being moral 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.220
 I like how it looks like that of a 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.810
 color and other not so much 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.810
 since you follow the glasses 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.900
 gives you a trick says to check the 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.310
 floating all the candles float and these 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.709
 more look where those who put 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.709
 normally for him I had lists and 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.410
 one 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.390
 we instituted three options one for 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.430
 do the command with another if you are more 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.230
 serious and others for parties for the 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.390
 center of your house for the center of table 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.520
 or even some for your bath all 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.020
 It's up to you and remember to write to me 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.020
