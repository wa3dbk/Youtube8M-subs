00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:40.370
 two three words it's already lightweight elegant 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.590
 and quality the very sexy cm2 that's all 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.930
 simply the phone can not complete 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.280
 which is lifted on the market clearly so 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.270
 I had to buy a phone by 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 report to those who were presented 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.769
 recently we will not name names I 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.629
 will be safer to lausanne 2 in 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.489
 the ecosystem sony different devices 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.080
 who are each going to have a role on the ps4 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.059
 which acts as a media center that will 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.530
 centralize the entire digital profile on 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.510
 to one of the two who can act as 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.620
 remote control or the second screen we're going 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.879
 see the smartphone that will us 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.500
 accompany us on a daily basis 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.250
 allow on our activity 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.250
 have a newspaper 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.700
 I could test the function of high 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.700
 standing is pretty impressive 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.869
 must understand that any lawsuit 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.909
 done on the smartphone so at heart this 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.320
 paris loaded on this function losc 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.250
 in fact these lines as soon as one puts 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.630
 headphones but 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.320
 the ears we had the music do 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.320
 to appear a mount 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.689
 I tested the slow motion paint 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.490
 timeshifting next match and that's 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.210
 precisely these things that I love with 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.390
 the camera 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.090
 so we will film and then behind we go 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.560
 resume the video while idling 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.479
 where one wishes to be bluffed by the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.610
 simplicity and paris makes you want to 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.899
 do not have your back is the best 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.899
 quality that exists on a smartphone 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.750
 seeing that we went cameras to 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.300
 reflexes switch to smartphones with 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.530
 precisely from the film and in 4k above that 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.630
 is interesting ie today 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.980
 we will be able to make films that we 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.350
 can really be exploited tomorrow we will 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.820
 have a katia image on the SLRs is 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.680
 not yet the case where it all happens 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.110
 just while on the phones here 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.010
 it's cheaper and doing things 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.010
 ten times better with 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.400
 relationship to trends I find 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.590
 interesting is that we are actually 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.780
 not on a standard electronic coach 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.580
 I prefer pedometer that she can do 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.690
 wake up morning is not everything if I think 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.000
 that it's true complementarity 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.730
 we all more and more want to 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.310
 measure oneself as the 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.180
 the words are in fashion and it's true 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.830
 that we do not always want to have the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.090
 smartphone in the pocket to make for 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.720
 do these measurements there behind we have 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.770
 really a layer 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.960
 maybe more alive and say that 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.850
 it is a companion of life in fact it is 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.430
 a bit of a listening ear that is going 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.290
 listen to every action that will follow us 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.520
 the least displacement that will 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.750
 to immortalize moments 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.880
 important of our everyday life it can 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.780
 to be the first panels if that can 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.780
 to be a beautiful sunset 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.690
 classes still a fashion object 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.450
 somewhere tony sought to produce 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.340
 a device really more layout 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.330
 as a companion as a bracelet 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.330
 e final 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.580
