matte finish for the keys which is great

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.140 
matte finish for the keys which is great
because<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.799> glossy<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.400> polished<00:01:11.850> finish

because the glossy or polished finish

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.630 
because the glossy or polished finish
attracts<00:01:12.659> fingerprints<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.740> matt<00:01:14.040> doesn't

the spacebar has a textured surface to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.380 
the spacebar has a textured surface to
help<00:01:16.890> distinguish<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.640> from<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.909> other<00:01:18.060> keys

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
help distinguish it from the other keys

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.660 
help distinguish it from the other keys
plus<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.930> adds<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.290> nice<00:01:19.590> overall<00:01:20.009> look<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
plus it adds a nice overall look to the
keyboard<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.450> also<00:01:21.810> really<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> red

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
keyboard I also really like the red

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.499 
keyboard I also really like the red
outline<00:01:22.860> behind<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> keys<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.150> definitely

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
outline behind the keys it definitely

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.420 
outline behind the keys it definitely
makes<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> entire<00:01:25.140> keyboard<00:01:25.439> pop<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
makes the entire keyboard pop out and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.490 
makes the entire keyboard pop out and
black<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.150> red<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.600> looks<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.049> damn<00:01:28.259> good

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
black and red just looks so damn good

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.929 
black and red just looks so damn good
together<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.250> I'm<00:01:29.340> sure<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.610> guys<00:01:29.729> already

very smooth and linear response with

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.569 
very smooth and linear response with
each<00:01:33.810> key<00:01:34.110> press<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.740> they<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.070> less<00:01:35.250> clicky

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579

the<00:02:23.640> keyboard<00:02:23.970> not<00:02:24.120> only<00:02:24.330> looks<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.630> lot<00:02:24.780> better

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
the keyboard not only looks a lot better

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.200 
the keyboard not only looks a lot better

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
with no holes on the sides but you can

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.120

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
also run the cable outward and straight

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.100 
also run the cable outward and straight
into<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> back<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.820> your<00:02:29.940> PC<00:02:30.120> which<00:02:30.810> looks

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
into the back of your PC which looks

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.110 
into the back of your PC which looks
more<00:02:31.350> natural<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:32.010> also<00:02:32.280> really<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.880> fact

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
more natural I also really like the fact

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.880 
more natural I also really like the fact
that<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.390> keyboard<00:02:33.780> isn't<00:02:33.930> extended<00:02:34.710> with

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
that the keyboard isn't extended with

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.160 
that the keyboard isn't extended with
extra<00:02:35.280> macro<00:02:35.610> keys<00:02:35.850> on<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.240> sides<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.870> I

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
extra macro keys on the sides that I

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.320 
extra macro keys on the sides that I
never<00:02:37.380> end<00:02:37.620> up<00:02:37.710> using<00:02:37.950> anyways<00:02:38.610> there<00:02:39.180> also

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
never end up using anyways there also

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.510 
never end up using anyways there also
isn't<00:02:39.660> any<00:02:39.959> dedicated<00:02:40.200> multimedia<00:02:41.190> buttons

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
isn't any dedicated multimedia buttons

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520 
isn't any dedicated multimedia buttons
anywhere<00:02:42.090> on<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.300> keyboard<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.990> instead

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
anywhere on the keyboard and instead

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.230 
anywhere on the keyboard and instead
they<00:02:43.680> added<00:02:43.980> them<00:02:44.100> alongside<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.790> F<00:02:44.910> keys

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
they added them alongside the F keys

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.430 
they added them alongside the F keys
which<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.660> brilliant

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
which is brilliant

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.990 
which is brilliant
they<00:02:46.560> only<00:02:46.680> kept<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.100> important<00:02:47.520> keys<00:02:47.730> which

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
they only kept the important keys which

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.640 
they only kept the important keys which
contributes<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> smaller<00:02:49.110> more<00:02:49.410> compact

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
contributes to a smaller more compact

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.920 
contributes to a smaller more compact
form<00:02:50.250> factor<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.540> bottom<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.870> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
form factor on the bottom of the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.300 
form factor on the bottom of the
keyboard<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.380> can<00:02:52.410> find<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.830> four<00:02:53.130> rubber

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
keyboard you can find the four rubber

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.280 
keyboard you can find the four rubber
feet<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.030> corners<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.690> they<00:02:54.780> work<00:02:54.959> really

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
feet on the corners and they work really

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.620 
feet on the corners and they work really
well<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:56.130> also<00:02:56.280> get<00:02:56.520> two<00:02:56.700> tiny<00:02:57.030> legs<00:02:57.300> if<00:02:57.510> you

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
well you also get two tiny legs if you

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.150 
well you also get two tiny legs if you
want<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.930> keyboard<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.440> be<00:02:58.590> at<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.770> slight

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
want the keyboard to be at a slight

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.040 
want the keyboard to be at a slight
angle<00:02:59.340> now<00:03:00.060> I'm<00:03:00.150> sure<00:03:00.300> most<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.720> know<00:03:00.840> that

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
angle now I'm sure most of you know that

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.690 
angle now I'm sure most of you know that
I<00:03:01.080> have<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> black<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.830> red<00:03:02.010> theme<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.550> this

really<00:03:09.180> no<00:03:09.420> need<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.630> pay<00:03:09.870> extra<00:03:10.080> if<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.890> only

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
really no need to pay extra if the only

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.250 
really no need to pay extra if the only
colour<00:03:11.370> you're<00:03:11.640> after<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.209> red<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:13.050> as<00:03:13.140> I

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
colour you're after is red so as I

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.750 
colour you're after is red so as I
mentioned<00:03:13.530> before<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.890> keyboard<00:03:14.250> comes<00:03:14.489> with

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
mentioned before the keyboard comes with

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.850 
mentioned before the keyboard comes with
a<00:03:14.790> three<00:03:15.270> setting<00:03:15.660> brightness<00:03:16.050> control<00:03:16.560> we

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
a three setting brightness control we

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.370 
a three setting brightness control we
have<00:03:17.010> low<00:03:17.310> medium<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.209> high<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.780> for<00:03:19.230> some

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
have low medium and high and for some

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.960 
have low medium and high and for some
reason<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.739> light<00:03:19.950> radiates<00:03:20.400> from<00:03:20.640> top<00:03:20.940> to

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
reason the light radiates from top to

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.789 
reason the light radiates from top to
bottom<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.630> video<00:03:21.750> but<00:03:22.350> it's<00:03:22.500> not<00:03:22.620> like

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
bottom in the video but it's not like

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.830 
bottom in the video but it's not like
that<00:03:23.010> in<00:03:23.160> person<00:03:23.730> instead<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.269> get<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.450> solid

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
that in person instead you get a solid

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.170 
that in person instead you get a solid
static<00:03:25.560> color<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:26.220> also<00:03:26.790> like<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
static color I also like the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.940 
static color I also like the
backlighting<00:03:27.810> being<00:03:27.989> exposed<00:03:28.440> from<00:03:28.769> both

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
backlighting being exposed from both

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.440 
backlighting being exposed from both
sides<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.640> think<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.910> really<00:03:30.000> makes<00:03:30.269> the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
sides I think it really makes the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.240 
sides I think it really makes the
keyboard<00:03:30.810> stand<00:03:31.110> out<00:03:31.320> especially<00:03:31.739> when

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
keyboard stand out especially when

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.530 
keyboard stand out especially when
you're<00:03:32.430> using<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.850> at<00:03:33.000> night

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
you're using it at night

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.940 
you're using it at night
productivity<00:03:34.019> why<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.590> thing<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.890> the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
productivity why is the thing that the

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.259 
productivity why is the thing that the
keyboard<00:03:35.370> will<00:03:35.489> be<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.640> lot<00:03:35.850> more<00:03:36.030> comfortable

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
keyboard will be a lot more comfortable

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.330 
keyboard will be a lot more comfortable
with<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.750> wrist<00:03:37.110> rest<00:03:37.380> if<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.799> are<00:03:37.920> planning<00:03:38.190> on

now<00:03:40.739> for<00:03:40.950> gaming<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.519> experienced<00:03:42.030> no<00:03:42.239> problems

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
now for gaming I experienced no problems

now for gaming I experienced no problems
at<00:03:42.900> all<00:03:42.930> since<00:03:43.500> majority<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.070> time<00:03:44.310> my

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760
