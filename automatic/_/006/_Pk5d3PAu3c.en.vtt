it was a very special victory for me I'm

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.580 
it was a very special victory for me I'm
a<00:00:15.599> circuit<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:15.960> I've<00:00:16.109> enjoyed<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.529> past

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
a circuit that I've enjoyed in the past

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.290 
a circuit that I've enjoyed in the past
and<00:00:17.070> they<00:00:17.160> were<00:00:17.220> second<00:00:17.580> there<00:00:17.670> last<00:00:17.880> year<00:00:18.000> so

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and they were second there last year so

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.269 
and they were second there last year so
it's<00:00:18.990> been<00:00:19.199> kind<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.560> me<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.740> last<00:00:19.890> couple<00:00:20.010> of

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
it's been kind to me the last couple of

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.490 
it's been kind to me the last couple of
years<00:00:20.340> every<00:00:21.300> race<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.510> do<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.930> experienced

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
years every race you do is experienced

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.890 
years every race you do is experienced
but<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.400> don't<00:00:23.580> think<00:00:23.730> I'll<00:00:23.910> change<00:00:24.390> my<00:00:24.539> driving

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
but I don't think I'll change my driving

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.500 
but I don't think I'll change my driving
style<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.529> way<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.830> thinking<00:00:26.220> because<00:00:26.490> i<00:00:26.730> think

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
style my way of thinking because i think

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.919 
style my way of thinking because i think
is<00:00:27.599> an<00:00:27.960> f1<00:00:28.230> driver<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.680> never<00:00:28.890> give<00:00:29.130> up<00:00:29.250> and

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
is an f1 driver you never give up and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.030 
is an f1 driver you never give up and
whatever<00:00:30.929> position<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.470> find<00:00:31.740> yourself

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
whatever position you find yourself

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.410 
whatever position you find yourself
you're<00:00:32.250> still<00:00:32.460> always<00:00:32.669> fight<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.239> get<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
you're still always fight to get the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.960 
you're still always fight to get the
best<00:00:33.600> position<00:00:33.840> by<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.500> end<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> race

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.000 

we<00:00:43.540> have<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:43.720> few<00:00:43.810> new<00:00:44.110> parts<00:00:44.500> and<00:00:44.650> I<00:00:44.710> hope<00:00:44.860> that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
we have a few new parts and I hope that

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.810 
we have a few new parts and I hope that
they're<00:00:45.130> going<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:45.310> make<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:45.460> bit<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.760> a

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
they're going to make a bit of a

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.070 
they're going to make a bit of a
difference<00:00:46.120> in<00:00:46.270> qualifying<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:46.810> bring<00:00:46.990> us

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
difference in qualifying and bring us

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.510 
difference in qualifying and bring us
closer<00:00:47.380> to<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.740> to<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.100> Red<00:00:48.310> Bull's

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
closer to the to the Red Bull's

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.230 
closer to the to the Red Bull's
Sebastian<00:00:48.730> Vettel<00:00:49.630> has<00:00:49.780> a<00:00:49.810> 60-point<00:00:50.410> lead<00:00:51.240> but

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
Sebastian Vettel has a 60-point lead but

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.640 
Sebastian Vettel has a 60-point lead but
we<00:00:52.330> saw<00:00:52.510> him<00:00:52.690> cracking<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.200> pressure<00:00:53.410> at<00:00:53.590> the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
we saw him cracking the pressure at the

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.260 
we saw him cracking the pressure at the
last<00:00:53.830> race<00:00:54.070> which<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.430> good<00:00:54.580> to<00:00:54.700> see<00:00:54.730> I<00:00:55.090> think

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
last race which is good to see I think

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.330 
last race which is good to see I think
for<00:00:55.600> one<00:00:55.840> as<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:55.990> whole<00:00:56.200> wants<00:00:56.470> to<00:00:56.590> see<00:00:56.770> somebody

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
for one as a whole wants to see somebody

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.210 
for one as a whole wants to see somebody
challenging<00:00:58.890> Sebastian<00:00:59.890> and<00:00:59.980> I<00:01:00.040> think

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
challenging Sebastian and I think

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.320 
challenging Sebastian and I think
there's<00:01:00.340> going<00:01:00.430> to<00:01:00.520> be<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.640> few<00:01:00.820> drivers<00:01:01.030> here

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
there's going to be a few drivers here

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.450 
there's going to be a few drivers here
that<00:01:01.450> can<00:01:01.570> really<00:01:01.720> fight<00:01:02.050> it<00:01:02.770> Sebastian<00:01:03.280> for

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
that can really fight it Sebastian for

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.460 
that can really fight it Sebastian for
the<00:01:03.520> victory<00:01:03.760> aim<00:01:04.300> is<00:01:04.630> the<00:01:04.720> same<00:01:04.930> as<00:01:05.110> everyone

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
the victory aim is the same as everyone

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.850 
the victory aim is the same as everyone
free<00:01:05.680> to<00:01:06.160> win<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:07.510> think<00:01:07.780> for<00:01:07.960> my<00:01:08.140> point

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
free to win I think for my point

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.130 
free to win I think for my point
probably<00:01:09.130> too<00:01:09.550> just<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.570> get<00:01:10.720> another

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
probably too just to get another

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:20.029 
probably too just to get another
finishing<00:01:11.560> would<00:01:11.740> be<00:01:11.860> good

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.139 

there's<00:01:21.039> a<00:01:21.100> lot<00:01:21.250> of<00:01:21.280> long<00:01:21.520> straights<00:01:21.880> here<00:01:22.060> in

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
there's a lot of long straights here in

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.660 
there's a lot of long straights here in
Valencia<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:23.380> lot<00:01:24.130> of<00:01:24.159> very<00:01:24.399> slow<00:01:24.609> speed

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
Valencia and a lot of very slow speed

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.429 
Valencia and a lot of very slow speed
corners<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.450> it's<00:01:25.750> it's<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.079> street<00:01:26.259> circuit

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
corners and it's it's a street circuit

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.169 
corners and it's it's a street circuit
so<00:01:26.770> most<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.069> them<00:01:27.189> are<00:01:27.280> blind<00:01:27.520> it's<00:01:27.819> very<00:01:27.939> very

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
so most of them are blind it's very very

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.319 
so most of them are blind it's very very
tricky<00:01:28.479> you<00:01:29.020> need<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.229> have<00:01:29.319> quite<00:01:29.530> good<00:01:30.329> good

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
tricky you need to have quite good good

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.719 
tricky you need to have quite good good
low<00:01:31.509> speed<00:01:31.780> down<00:01:31.960> force<00:01:32.369> which<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:33.520> think

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
low speed down force which I think

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.069 
low speed down force which I think
hopefully<00:01:33.880> finish<00:01:34.270> one<00:01:34.420> we<00:01:34.539> should<00:01:34.689> have<00:01:34.840> so

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
hopefully finish one we should have so

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.929 
hopefully finish one we should have so
that'd<00:01:35.229> be<00:01:35.350> good<00:01:35.469> I<00:01:35.709> think<00:01:36.009> those<00:01:36.130> 71<00:01:36.729> gear

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
that'd be good I think those 71 gear

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.260 
that'd be good I think those 71 gear
changes<00:01:37.479> per<00:01:37.929> lap<00:01:38.200> around<00:01:38.350> here<00:01:38.740> which<00:01:39.009> is

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
changes per lap around here which is

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.699 
changes per lap around here which is
massive<00:01:40.270> there's<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:40.929> lot<00:01:41.079> of<00:01:41.109> gear<00:01:41.289> changes

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
massive there's a lot of gear changes

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.370 
massive there's a lot of gear changes
here<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.270> that's<00:01:43.270> something<00:01:43.509> that<00:01:43.869> we<00:01:44.200> just

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
here and that's something that we just

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.469 
here and that's something that we just
hope<00:01:44.560> we<00:01:45.459> have<00:01:45.579> a<00:01:45.609> strong<00:01:45.819> gearbox<00:01:46.209> and<00:01:46.390> I

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
hope we have a strong gearbox and I

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.699 
hope we have a strong gearbox and I
think<00:01:46.659> that<00:01:46.780> we<00:01:46.840> do<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.259> think<00:01:47.469> you'll<00:01:47.590> make

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
think that we do and I think you'll make

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:56.220 
think that we do and I think you'll make
a<00:01:47.770> big<00:01:48.159> difference<00:01:48.369> right<00:01:48.549> in

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.390 

today<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.440> event<00:01:57.680> was<00:01:57.830> fun<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.250> know<00:01:58.310> I

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
today the event was fun you know I

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.190 
today the event was fun you know I
always<00:01:58.760> loved<00:01:59.210> driving<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.540> go-kart<00:01:59.690> it's<00:02:00.020> very

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
always loved driving a go-kart it's very

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.060 
always loved driving a go-kart it's very
unusual<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.680> i<00:02:00.740> get<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.120> jump<00:02:02.120> into<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.360> car

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
unusual that i get to jump into a car

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.140 
unusual that i get to jump into a car
you<00:02:04.070> know<00:02:04.160> it's<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.310> very<00:02:04.490> small<00:02:04.580> circuit<00:02:05.060> but

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
you know it's a very small circuit but
