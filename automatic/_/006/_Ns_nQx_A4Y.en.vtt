here's where the braiding begins take a
chunk<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.350> hair<00:01:47.630> split<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.900> two<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
chunk of hair split it in two at the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.700 
chunk of hair split it in two at the
normal<00:01:49.920> three<00:01:50.220> sections<00:01:50.760> and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.520 

take<00:01:56.710> one<00:01:56.980> over<00:01:57.310> like<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:57.970> normal<00:01:58.360> brain<00:01:58.540> he's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
take one over like a normal brain he's

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.830 
take one over like a normal brain he's
closer<00:01:59.890> to<00:02:00.040> your<00:02:00.280> face

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
closer to your face

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.790 
closer to your face
grab<00:02:01.840> another<00:02:02.350> section<00:02:03.750> parent<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:05.290> remember

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
grab another section parent and remember

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.470 
grab another section parent and remember
a<00:02:05.830> help<00:02:06.160> think<00:02:06.430> of<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.640> section<00:02:07.000> you're<00:02:07.150> taking

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
a help think of a section you're taking

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.700 
a help think of a section you're taking
because<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.810> want<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.170> break<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.560> look

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
because you want the break to look

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.469 
because you want the break to look
pretty<00:02:08.979> even<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.640> you're<00:02:10.119> going<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.330> be

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
pretty even so you're going to be

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.720 
pretty even so you're going to be
continuing<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.560> take<00:02:11.770> that<00:02:12.130> sample<00:02:12.550> out<00:02:13.290> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
continuing to take that sample out and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.940 
continuing to take that sample out and
then<00:02:15.730> bring<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:17.970> grab<00:02:18.970> another<00:02:19.330> section

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.970 

break<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:26.050> now<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.320> have<00:02:26.620> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
break that in and now you have the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.710 
break that in and now you have the
smallest<00:02:27.280> piece<00:02:27.730> which<00:02:28.060> has<00:02:28.090> not<00:02:28.450> had<00:02:28.690> a

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
smallest piece which has not had a

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.110 
smallest piece which has not had a
section<00:02:29.200> graph<00:02:29.440> yet<00:02:29.650> be<00:02:30.280> very<00:02:30.520> careful<00:02:31.000> with

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
section graph yet be very careful with

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.950 
section graph yet be very careful with
this<00:02:31.300> one<00:02:32.910> after<00:02:33.910> this<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.270> becomes<00:02:34.600> easier

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
this one after this it becomes easier

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.700 
this one after this it becomes easier
keep<00:02:35.590> repeating<00:02:36.450> it's<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.690> simple<00:02:38.080> it<00:02:38.470> takes

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
keep repeating it's that simple it takes

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.980 
keep repeating it's that simple it takes
a<00:02:39.160> couple<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.880> tries<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.390> get<00:02:40.510> used<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
a couple of tries to get used to the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.080 
a couple of tries to get used to the
motion<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.250> once<00:02:42.490> you're<00:02:42.640> used<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.940> the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
motion but once you're used to the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.890 
motion but once you're used to the
motion

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
motion

00:02:43.900 --> 00:03:04.860 
motion
it's<00:02:44.320> just<00:02:44.590> repetitive<00:03:03.209> right<00:03:04.209> you're<00:03:04.360> as<00:03:04.510> far

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
it's just repetitive right you're as far

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.670 
it's just repetitive right you're as far
down<00:03:04.900> as<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.620> can<00:03:05.770> go<00:03:06.300> tie<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.360> off<00:03:07.840> just<00:03:08.500> where

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
down as you can go tie it off just where

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.410 
down as you can go tie it off just where
the<00:03:08.770> bobby<00:03:08.950> pins<00:03:09.280> come<00:03:09.520> in<00:03:09.700> depending<00:03:10.270> on<00:03:10.360> your

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
the bobby pins come in depending on your

the bobby pins come in depending on your
layers<00:03:10.720> depending<00:03:11.620> how<00:03:12.040> many<00:03:12.100> bottom<00:03:12.520> pins

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760

you're<00:03:12.910> going<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.360> need<00:03:13.570> I<00:03:13.810> am<00:03:14.709> just<00:03:14.950> going<00:03:15.160> to

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
you're going to need I am just going to

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.180 
you're going to need I am just going to
put<00:03:16.720> one<00:03:16.930> there<00:03:16.959> I'm<00:03:17.620> just<00:03:17.800> going<00:03:18.130> to

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
put one there I'm just going to

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.050 
put one there I'm just going to
crisscross<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:21.340> can<00:03:21.550> pull<00:03:22.090> these<00:03:22.690> apart

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
crisscross it you can pull these apart

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.780 
crisscross it you can pull these apart
but<00:03:25.060> be<00:03:25.239> careful<00:03:25.660> around<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.989> big<00:03:26.140> area

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
but be careful around the big area

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.190 
but be careful around the big area
because<00:03:27.790> at<00:03:27.910> least<00:03:28.030> for<00:03:28.150> me<00:03:28.420> some<00:03:28.870> are<00:03:28.989> very

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
because at least for me some are very

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.660 
because at least for me some are very
short<00:03:29.530> like<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:29.800> one's<00:03:29.980> already<00:03:30.100> poking<00:03:30.370> out

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
short like this one's already poking out

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.820 
short like this one's already poking out
and<00:03:32.070> mess<00:03:33.070> up<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.310> braid

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
and mess up the braid

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.060 
and mess up the braid
make<00:03:34.610> this<00:03:34.790> great<00:03:35.120> pattern<00:03:35.500> as<00:03:36.500> long<00:03:36.740> as<00:03:36.920> it

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
make this great pattern as long as it

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.920 
make this great pattern as long as it
you<00:03:37.340> have<00:03:37.580> it<00:03:37.760> tight<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.330> secure<00:03:38.720> when<00:03:38.870> you

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
you have it tight and secure when you

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.430 
you have it tight and secure when you
first<00:03:39.140> do<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.530> then<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.340> can<00:03:40.370> put<00:03:40.670> step<00:03:40.910> after

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
first do it then you can put step after

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.870 
first do it then you can put step after
