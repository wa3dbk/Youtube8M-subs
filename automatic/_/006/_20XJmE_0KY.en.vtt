00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.649
 the truck as a workplace brings 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:07.810
 However, great responsibility also exists 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.550
 risks 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.470
 the compromise between security and 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.640
 speed is a constant 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:19.099
 companion the mtc fahrtechnik offers 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.470
 immediately in addition to practice training with 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.150
 the emergency vehicle also a special 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.490
 simulator training on 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.239
 The simulator is based on a real one 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.460
 use vehicle over a panorama 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:35.030
 Canvas become photorealistic couple 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.079
 Procedures recorded all hand movements 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.489
 take place as in a real use 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.170
 the instructor chooses during the 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.059
 trainings from a variety of 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.739
 simulated events on the 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.489
 Participants must respond everyday 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.070
 dangerous situations like suddenly 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.079
 Obstacles that occur can be practically oriented 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.660
 and be trained safely 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.460
 the combination of exercises in the 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.679
 real training as well as simulator 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.989
 helps the participant critical 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.770
 recognize driving situations in good time 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.729
 and respond to it properly 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.229
 in addition to the training of divers 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.479
 Driving situations can also 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.939
 Impairments as different 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.409
 simulated weather and road conditions 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.479
 become 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.729
 the simulator does not replace the practice 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.159
 we offer much more drive from 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.770
 service vehicles the possibility real 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.149
 situations to train safely and 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.220
 to sharpen the senses 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.320
 in combination with the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.440
 driving technique training becomes the driver 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.630
 optimally prepared for use 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.790
 The new training package is now available 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.130
 in the driving technique center marchtrenk 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.660
