00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Nac's night is a big part of it 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.270
 the country has been known for many years a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.130
 home game of marks can in Breda 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.240
 be very cozy or very restless 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.469
 end 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.420
 that of course greatly depends on it 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.460
 result but the nac supporters stir 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.910
 I always know Richard too 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.650
 sums 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.039
 support and compile nac yourself 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.150
 this photo album about nac supporters by the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.519

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.590
 Zigzagge Zigzagge How would you look? 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.980
 Richard himself and really an action gates 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.980
 want to describe 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.380
 criterion for no nice no I think they are 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.149
 say companions about their folk club and 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 for me they ship everyone 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:44.730
 there is therefore a real everyone for that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 also a teacher and the driver and all 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.890

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.710

 to bring out culture and to 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.769
 to hold 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.109

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.989
 paragon of everything that happens and 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.359
 what happened was a better one 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.489
 moment hits him just right okay okay 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.799
 people can keep something 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.760
 it's one of the better moments late 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.799
 just a bit through the book 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.690
 because how did you build this? 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.910
 well i am now she has started 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.540
 watching the lives of people 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.519
 mate once a week 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.859
 it twice in the wft some the two 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.019
 weeks at home and people apparently have 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.060
 need more night and nac 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:40.050
 shows itself in all sorts of things 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.410
 in life me like people are home 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.190
 get dressed then comes a portion 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.670
 nac at 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.630
 yes if people will see him then what this 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.520
 is a house, isn't it? 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.830
 yazid and average nac supporters 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.530
 house out well average don't know 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.239
 may take learn do i who who has it 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.630
 in that has because at that time he had 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.330
 more than 200 unique limp even one 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.330
 mature man with request and who who 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.739
 he just wants to do that as people 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.390
 so for example a pair admit 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.330
 then later put back all put under 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.819
 with nac or with breda or something 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.260
 it will go very far that will 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.549
 I just show it is not just 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.489
 something for those people 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.460
 if people were, people died 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.770
 and then gravestones is the logo I know 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.630
 I have three people with three 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.160
 birth announcements with van van van 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.780
 children and they then have the initials 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.360
 and hc back 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.190
 this is again it works well with that 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.810
 working at nac years good look i think i 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.250
 find it very important and that is one 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.350
 for every association there is 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.150
 important because by working with people 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.530
 and keep working and we pokémon from nothing 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.470
 and everyone very said I have 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.210
 actually other natural but 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.740
 well the search field sleep and a choice can 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.080
 but then it is greatly appreciated 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.640
 there is also a look very often at your club 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.340
 see what goes with that banner 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:04.350
 the whole the whole tribune and that man who 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.110
 who just showed it 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.000
 He also got a banner too 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.680
 a mega banner why because he just 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.610
 so important is all the others 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.650
 people 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.270
 great yes that's the second this comes to 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.550
 the people this he nice old images 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.940

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.889
 between numbers you are known for on Sunday 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.510
 the evening nac 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.360
 great that there is a nice picture of it 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.889
 that too but it is again that it is 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.660
 of course very difficult because you have 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.560
 it all found is all in the 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.750

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.060

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.340
 yes good is still a photo with a 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.090
 last saturday you can also get one 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.550
 maria 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.110

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.490
 You have presented the book to you times 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.590
 was before the match against FC 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.910
 utrecht it was very nice for that 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.150
 the e5 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.710
 defeat and white responded to book 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.330
 only one positive has that 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.850
 positive responses and then you go 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.320
 actually we know i can't agree with this 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.990
 those pictures say so much 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.340
 months so cool material and it is too 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.470

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.680
 I asked the boy interest, I think 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.030
 I also let other people 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.580
 see those who have nothing to do with NAC or 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.590
 have to do with football and those that 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.830
 those who keep on browsing, you know 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.780
 what are restauriert look what they do and 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.550

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.290

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.550

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.710
 only yes well what i say with nac is just 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.539
 a little more excitement just being tidy 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.340
 not a judgment that goes wrong also knows 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.479

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.889
