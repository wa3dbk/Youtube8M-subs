00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.030

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.149 

I<00:01:44.070> don't<00:01:44.670> think<00:01:44.730> it<00:01:44.910> that<00:01:45.000> he<00:01:45.210> said<00:01:45.240> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
I don't think it that he said that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.770 
I don't think it that he said that
but<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:47.999> the<00:01:48.210> Department<00:01:48.749> of

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
but this is the Department of

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
but this is the Department of
Transportation<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.560> responsibility<00:01:50.159> not

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
Transportation is responsibility not

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.290 
Transportation is responsibility not
mine

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:11.780 

now

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.770 

yeah<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:12.819> think<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.300> problem<00:02:13.450> when<00:02:13.660> it's

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
yeah I think it's a problem when it's

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.470 
yeah I think it's a problem when it's
when<00:02:13.959> only<00:02:14.290> if<00:02:14.349> it's<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.800> know<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.760> moralizer

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
when only if it's you know a moralizer

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.910 
when only if it's you know a moralizer
or<00:02:16.660> defacing<00:02:17.050> someone's<00:02:17.500> private<00:02:17.890> property

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
or defacing someone's private property

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.300 
or defacing someone's private property
but<00:02:18.430> for<00:02:18.670> some<00:02:18.790> public<00:02:19.120> property<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:20.739> know<00:02:20.890> I

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
but for some public property you know I

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.280 
but for some public property you know I
think<00:02:21.489> it's<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:22.150> form<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:22.690> like<00:02:22.870> freedom<00:02:23.170> of

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
think it's a form of like freedom of

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.780 
think it's a form of like freedom of
speech<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.950> sense<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.489> they<00:02:24.580> should<00:02:24.730> all

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
speech in a sense and they should all

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.190 
speech in a sense and they should all
know<00:02:24.819> like<00:02:25.090> all<00:02:25.300> other<00:02:25.540> things<00:02:25.690> only<00:02:25.840> takes<00:02:26.080> a
