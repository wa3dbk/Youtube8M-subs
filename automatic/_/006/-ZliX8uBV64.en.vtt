was<00:01:12.390> my<00:01:12.540> initial<00:01:12.780> thought<00:01:13.170> when<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.350> pulls<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
was my initial thought when I pulls it

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.820 
was my initial thought when I pulls it
out<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.010> box<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.820> does<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.869> somewhat

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
out the box but it does have a somewhat

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.830 
out the box but it does have a somewhat
dummy<00:01:17.189> phone<00:01:17.520> type<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.970> feel<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.600> makes

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
dummy phone type of feel if that makes

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.780 
dummy phone type of feel if that makes
any<00:01:18.960> sense<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:19.979> used<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> holding<00:01:20.700> my
