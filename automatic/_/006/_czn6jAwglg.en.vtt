Alex I think you see that semi in an

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980 
Alex I think you see that semi in an
auto<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.549> ambidextrius'<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.810> both

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
auto it's ambidextrius' so it's on both

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.530 
auto it's ambidextrius' so it's on both
sides<00:01:22.400> same<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> sling<00:01:23.880> mount<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.390> got

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
games over there um um I don't think I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.570 
games over there um um I don't think I
said<00:02:39.210> everything<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.660> need<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.810> say<00:02:40.580> to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
said everything I need to say to

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.800 
said everything I need to say to
effective<00:02:42.360> range<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.960> about<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:44.040> hundred<00:02:44.810> it's

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
effective range is about a hundred it's

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.750 
effective range is about a hundred it's
it<00:02:45.989> on<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.140> website<00:02:46.290> hundred<00:02:46.560> 6280<00:02:47.489> but<00:02:47.730> I

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
it on the website hundred 6280 but I

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.810 
it on the website hundred 6280 but I
think<00:02:48.060> more<00:02:48.180> like<00:02:48.330> 130<00:02:49.130> just<00:02:50.130> some<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:50.580> a

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
think more like 130 just some it's a

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.580 
think more like 130 just some it's a
submachine<00:02:51.600> gun<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.020> really<00:02:52.260> doesn't<00:02:52.440> have

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
submachine gun so it really doesn't have

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.479 
submachine gun so it really doesn't have
that<00:02:52.770> great<00:02:53.100> range<00:02:53.430> um<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:55.340> have<00:02:56.340> any

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489
