00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
actually somewhat hard to find

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.110 
actually somewhat hard to find
they've<00:00:35.350> been<00:00:35.470> backordered<00:00:36.120> almost

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
they've been backordered almost

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.990 
they've been backordered almost
everywhere<00:00:37.570> and<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:39.160> I've<00:00:39.280> heard<00:00:39.309> is<00:00:39.970> that

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
everywhere and what I've heard is that

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.369 
everywhere and what I've heard is that
the<00:00:40.270> water<00:00:40.510> transfer<00:00:40.989> machine<00:00:41.170> that

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
now so there's just this huge backorder

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.280 
now so there's just this huge backorder
that's<00:00:45.550> causing<00:00:45.820> people<00:00:46.089> to<00:00:46.300> have<00:00:47.050> a<00:00:47.110> hard

time<00:00:47.470> finding<00:00:47.680> these<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:48.280> a<00:00:48.519> lot<00:00:48.670> of<00:00:48.760> the

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
time finding these and a lot of the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
they have some backup and hopefully

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.380 
they have some backup and hopefully
we'll<00:00:56.800> be<00:00:56.830> able<00:00:56.949> to<00:00:57.129> find<00:00:57.850> these<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.059> little<00:00:58.210> bit

was<00:01:32.289> a<00:01:32.820> actually<00:01:33.820> not<00:01:33.939> let's<00:01:34.210> step<00:01:34.479> back<00:01:34.509> even

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
was a actually not let's step back even

further before camo there was snow

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.880 
further before camo there was snow

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
far as glasses go this specific pattern

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.359 
far as glasses go this specific pattern
didn't<00:02:01.329> really<00:02:01.509> last<00:02:01.659> too<00:02:01.899> long<00:02:01.929> and<00:02:02.289> this<00:02:03.159> is

didn't really last too long and this is
more<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.700> just<00:02:03.969> sort<00:02:04.509> of<00:02:04.539> a<00:02:04.630> streaking<00:02:04.960> of

moving to different styles they actually

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.230 
moving to different styles they actually

the black or night camel there's also a
dark<00:02:24.700> camel<00:02:25.060> which<00:02:25.150> appeared<00:02:25.480> on<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.660> new

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620

pattern<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.280> don't<00:02:30.520> have<00:02:30.640> an<00:02:30.730> example<00:02:30.970> of

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.270 
pattern that I don't have an example of
that<00:02:31.360> but<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.230> have<00:02:32.380> seen<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.620> in<00:02:32.680> person<00:02:33.100> and

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
that but I have seen it in person and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.180 
that but I have seen it in person and
it's<00:02:34.050> without<00:02:35.050> light<00:02:35.620> shining<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.070> it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
it's without light shining that it

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.860 
it's without light shining that it
almost<00:02:36.340> looks<00:02:36.520> just<00:02:36.850> plain<00:02:37.030> black<00:02:37.270> so<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:37.600> tend

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
almost looks just plain black so I tend

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.680 
almost looks just plain black so I tend
to<00:02:37.960> not<00:02:38.290> really<00:02:38.560> like<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.700> as<00:02:39.790> much<00:02:39.820> there<00:02:40.570> was

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
to not really like it as much there was

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.050 
to not really like it as much there was
a<00:02:40.720> snow<00:02:41.020> camo<00:02:41.440> which<00:02:41.770> appeared<00:02:42.250> on<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.730> SI

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
a snow camo which appeared on the SI

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.090 
a snow camo which appeared on the SI
boot<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.780> that's<00:02:44.230> even<00:02:44.530> lighter<00:02:44.740> than<00:02:44.980> this

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
boot and that's even lighter than this

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.460 
boot and that's even lighter than this
it's<00:02:45.340> almost<00:02:45.640> indistinguishable<00:02:46.210> from<00:02:47.020> white

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
it's almost indistinguishable from white

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.440 
it's almost indistinguishable from white
with<00:02:48.070> just<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.370> few<00:02:48.520> patterns<00:02:48.760> here<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.300> there

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
with just a few patterns here and there

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.750 
with just a few patterns here and there
but<00:02:50.440> fur<00:02:50.590> glasses<00:02:50.980> was<00:02:51.130> pretty<00:02:51.340> much<00:02:51.490> white

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
but fur glasses was pretty much white

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.110 
but fur glasses was pretty much white
camo<00:02:52.180> night<00:02:52.780> camo<00:02:53.459> then<00:02:54.459> we<00:02:54.550> also<00:02:54.700> have<00:02:54.910> blue

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
camo night camo then we also have blue

camel which was only on the fat cat a
lot<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:58.959> retailers<00:02:59.350> were<00:02:59.410> actually<00:02:59.650> afraid<00:02:59.860> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
lot of retailers were actually afraid to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.380 
lot of retailers were actually afraid to
order<00:03:00.220> these<00:03:00.520> because<00:03:00.850> they<00:03:00.940> think<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.300> they

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
order these because they think that they

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.060 
order these because they think that they
wouldn't<00:03:01.570> sell<00:03:01.900> which<00:03:02.140> made<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.590> hard<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:02.860> find

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
wouldn't sell which made it hard to find

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.380 
wouldn't sell which made it hard to find
for<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.370> while<00:03:03.580> but<00:03:03.760> then<00:03:03.910> they<00:03:04.000> showed<00:03:04.150> up<00:03:04.270> in

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
for a while but then they showed up in

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.030 
for a while but then they showed up in
vaults<00:03:04.660> everywhere<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.290> they<00:03:05.890> weren't

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
vaults everywhere and they weren't

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.400 
vaults everywhere and they weren't
really<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.340> hard<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.700> find<00:03:06.970> after<00:03:07.180> all<00:03:07.480> and

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
really that hard to find after all and

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.790 
really that hard to find after all and
on<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:08.830> wisdom<00:03:09.010> which<00:03:09.700> was<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:10.050> 2003<00:03:11.050> ish<00:03:11.230> there

on the wisdom which was a 2003 ish there

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.770 
on the wisdom which was a 2003 ish there
was<00:03:12.010> green<00:03:12.310> camo<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.270> there's<00:03:13.450> been<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.570> ton<00:03:13.750> of

cameras in the goggles goggles have just

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.840 
cameras in the goggles goggles have just

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
colors everywhere they're a little bit

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.600

more flexible on the goggles partially

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.740 
more flexible on the goggles partially
because<00:03:21.760> they're<00:03:21.940> cheaper<00:03:22.300> or<00:03:22.360> partially

because you're on a mountain styles can
be<00:03:25.570> a<00:03:25.600> little<00:03:25.690> bit<00:03:25.870> crazier<00:03:26.260> as<00:03:26.350> opposed<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.709> an

be a little bit crazier as opposed to an

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.940 
be a little bit crazier as opposed to an
everyday<00:03:27.100> wearable<00:03:27.640> glass<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:29.290> also<00:03:29.410> had<00:03:29.650> red

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
everyday wearable glass we also had red

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.580 
everyday wearable glass we also had red
camo<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.180> appeared<00:03:31.510> on<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.110> thump<00:03:32.380> as

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
camo and this appeared on the thump as

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.390 
camo and this appeared on the thump as
well<00:03:32.769> as<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.190> Little<00:03:33.430> John<00:03:33.610> exclusive<00:03:34.330> zero

well as the Little John exclusive zero

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.370 
well as the Little John exclusive zero
the<00:03:36.400> thing<00:03:37.030> about<00:03:37.239> red<00:03:37.510> camos<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.260> only

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
the thing about red camos and it only

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.930 
the thing about red camos and it only
comes<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:38.920> polished<00:03:39.340> whereas<00:03:39.640> these<00:03:39.790> are

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
comes and polished whereas these are

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.210 
comes and polished whereas these are
more<00:03:40.060> of<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.239> matte<00:03:40.450> finish<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.709> think<00:03:41.890> the

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
more of a matte finish and I think the

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.920 
more of a matte finish and I think the
red<00:03:42.340> camel<00:03:42.670> would<00:03:42.760> be<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.150> lot<00:03:43.360> better<00:03:43.390> in<00:03:43.750> math

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
red camel would be a lot better in math

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.420 
red camel would be a lot better in math

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
feeling to it the glossy polished almost

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.180 
feeling to it the glossy polished almost
makes<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.030> feel<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.180> little<00:03:49.330> bit<00:03:49.480> cheap<00:03:49.840> but<00:03:50.260> you

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
makes it feel a little bit cheap but you

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.840

and I think um on the straightjacket - I

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.630 
and I think um on the straightjacket - I
like<00:04:38.170> it<00:04:38.320> here<00:04:38.530> because<00:04:38.680> it's<00:04:38.980> broken<00:04:39.220> up<00:04:39.430> by<00:04:39.610> a

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
like it here because it's broken up by a

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.450 
like it here because it's broken up by a
lot<00:04:39.850> of<00:04:39.940> accents<00:04:40.330> on<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.750> gas<00:04:41.380> can<00:04:41.740> whenever

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
lot of accents on the gas can whenever

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.180 
lot of accents on the gas can whenever
you<00:04:42.640> have<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:43.000> hinge<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:44.260> patterns<00:04:44.710> just<00:04:44.950> they

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
you have a hinge the patterns just they

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.980 
you have a hinge the patterns just they
break<00:04:45.400> too<00:04:45.610> abruptly<00:04:46.060> so<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.390> don't<00:04:46.690> really

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
break too abruptly so I don't really

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.230 
break too abruptly so I don't really
like<00:04:47.200> how<00:04:47.380> it's<00:04:47.560> applied<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:48.040> this<00:04:48.240> they're

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
like how it's applied to this they're

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.820 
like how it's applied to this they're
going<00:04:49.390> crazy<00:04:49.600> with<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:49.990> king's<00:04:50.230> camo<00:04:50.650> or

going crazy with the king's camo or

they're calling also with in camo it's
more<00:04:52.750> of<00:04:52.810> a<00:04:52.870> generic<00:04:53.500> name<00:04:54.120> I<00:04:55.290> think<00:04:56.290> it<00:04:56.380> needs

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
more of a generic name I think it needs

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.140 
more of a generic name I think it needs
to<00:04:56.650> be<00:04:56.710> sort<00:04:57.070> of<00:04:57.100> apply<00:04:57.400> it<00:04:57.460> almost<00:04:57.700> sparingly

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
to be sort of apply it almost sparingly

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.570 
to be sort of apply it almost sparingly
or<00:04:58.270> possibly<00:04:59.050> with<00:04:59.170> some<00:04:59.320> breaks<00:04:59.590> in<00:04:59.770> it<00:04:59.920> well

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
or possibly with some breaks in it well

or possibly with some breaks in it well
it's<00:05:00.700> just<00:05:00.760> all<00:05:01.540> over<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:01.870> place<00:05:02.850> some<00:05:03.850> people
