00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
remember this balloon that I made which

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.379 
remember this balloon that I made which
has<00:00:06.359> this<00:00:06.509> nice<00:00:06.750> symmetry<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.880> now<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:08.940> made

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
has this nice symmetry to it now I made

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.000 
has this nice symmetry to it now I made
this<00:00:09.690> because<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.170> was<00:00:10.410> trying<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.860> make

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
this because I was trying to make

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.670 
this because I was trying to make
actually<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.240> soccer<00:00:13.019> ball<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:15.199> here<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.379> my

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
actually a soccer ball and here is my

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.150 
actually a soccer ball and here is my
first<00:00:17.160> prototype<00:00:18.710> essentially<00:00:19.710> i'm<00:00:19.800> going<00:00:20.070> to

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
first prototype essentially i'm going to

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.720 
first prototype essentially i'm going to
be<00:00:20.250> using<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.910> course<00:00:21.380> all<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:23.160> same<00:00:23.400> color

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
be using of course all the same color

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.370 
be using of course all the same color
balloon<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:25.019> help<00:00:25.140> me

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
balloon but this is just to help me

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.370 
balloon but this is just to help me
understand<00:00:26.340> what's<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.869> here

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
understand what's going on and so here

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.380 
understand what's going on and so here
what<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:31.700> well<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.969> soccer<00:00:33.210> ball

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
what we have is a well the soccer ball

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.160 
what we have is a well the soccer ball
so<00:00:33.750> Pentagon's<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.950> then<00:00:35.190> hexagons<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.600> and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
so Pentagon's and then hexagons here and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.060 
so Pentagon's and then hexagons here and
so<00:00:37.350> right<00:00:37.620> now<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.890> Pentagon's<00:00:39.980> sort<00:00:40.980> of

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
so right now the Pentagon's sort of

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
so right now the Pentagon's sort of
bubble<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> bit<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.480> possible<00:00:43.110> what

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
bubble out a bit and it's possible what

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.990 
bubble out a bit and it's possible what
I'll<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.680> instead<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.100> having<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.340> go<00:00:44.489> out<00:00:44.700> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
I'll do is instead of having to go out I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.069 
I'll do is instead of having to go out I
might<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:47.719> that<00:00:48.719> might<00:00:48.930> be

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
might have to go in and that might be

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.959 
might have to go in and that might be
more<00:00:49.230> effective<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.860> then<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.370> fill<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.789> I'm

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
more effective and then to fill it I'm

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.990 
more effective and then to fill it I'm
just<00:00:51.210> going<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.390> put<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.780> little<00:00:52.050> mini

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
just going to put in a little mini

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.930 
just going to put in a little mini
balloon<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> middle<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.940> probably

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
balloon in the middle and so probably

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.290 
balloon in the middle and so probably
what<00:00:57.120> I'd<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.020> black<00:00:59.300> balloons

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
what I'd like to have is black balloons

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.819 
what I'd like to have is black balloons
on<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> inside<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> white<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.680> on

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
on the inside and then a white one on

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.399 
on the inside and then a white one on
the<00:01:01.920> inside<00:01:02.280> anyway<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.539> was<00:01:04.309> it's<00:01:05.309> possible

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
the inside anyway this was it's possible

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.280 
the inside anyway this was it's possible
there<00:01:07.409> are<00:01:07.590> six<00:01:08.070> balloons<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:10.170> my

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
there are six balloons here I for my

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.359 
there are six balloons here I for my
prototype<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.280> used<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:12.030> 60s<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.990> 61<00:01:13.619> 60<00:01:14.130> s<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
prototype I used one 60s so 61 60 s and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.670 
prototype I used one 60s so 61 60 s and
then<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.930> I<00:01:15.930> don't<00:01:16.320> know<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
then one I don't know what that is

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.969 
then one I don't know what that is
actually<00:01:18.020> but<00:01:19.020> anyway<00:01:21.110> it<00:01:22.110> looked<00:01:22.650> better<00:01:22.860> on

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
actually but anyway it looked better on

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.230 
actually but anyway it looked better on
paper<00:01:23.310> than<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.820> does<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.090> now<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> think<00:01:26.240> but

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
paper than it does right now I think but

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.580 
paper than it does right now I think but
it's<00:01:27.390> kind<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.630> nice<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> be<00:01:27.990> able<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.380> say<00:01:28.560> that

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
it's kind of nice to be able to say that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.240 
it's kind of nice to be able to say that
yes<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:30.119> six<00:01:30.360> de<00:01:30.540> lunes<00:01:31.009> do<00:01:32.009> this

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
yes you can with six de lunes do this

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.390 
yes you can with six de lunes do this
type<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.520> thing<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.979> might<00:01:35.130> look<00:01:35.280> pretty

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
type of thing and it might look pretty

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.590 
type of thing and it might look pretty
good<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.860> use<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.100> color<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.570> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
good if I if I use one color and have a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.830 
good if I if I use one color and have a
nice<00:01:39.869> white<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:41.070> which<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.490> don't<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.909> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
nice white one which I don't have so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.100 
nice white one which I don't have so
it's<00:01:43.170> possible<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.799> my<00:01:44.189> first<00:01:44.579> real<00:01:45.049> attempt<00:01:46.049> at

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
it's possible I my first real attempt at

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.800 
it's possible I my first real attempt at
this<00:01:46.320> will<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.670> black<00:01:48.210> one<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> middle

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
this will have a black one in the middle

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.560 
this will have a black one in the middle
and<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.229> all<00:01:49.560> white<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.329> black

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and then all white so you get that black

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.539 
and then all white so you get that black
and<00:01:51.750> white<00:01:51.840> aspect<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.659> but<00:01:54.659> anyway<00:01:55.549> there

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
and white aspect to it but anyway there

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.870 
and white aspect to it but anyway there
you<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.479> soccer<00:01:58.259> ball<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.579> some

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
you have it a soccer ball or in some

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.499 
you have it a soccer ball or in some
ways<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.590> drunken<00:02:01.590> truncated<00:02:02.490> icosahedron

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509
