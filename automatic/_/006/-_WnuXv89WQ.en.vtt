00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
king-size bed here and it's really easy

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.890 
king-size bed here and it's really easy
to<00:00:34.620> make

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
to make

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.670 
to make
you<00:00:36.900> need<00:00:37.079> these<00:00:37.350> pieces<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:39.170> then<00:00:40.170> just

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
you need these pieces and then just

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.360 
you need these pieces and then just
normal<00:00:41.780> bricks<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.020> fill<00:00:43.200> up<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.470> rest<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
normal bricks to fill up the rest of the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.290 
normal bricks to fill up the rest of the
space<00:00:44.719> but<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.930> saw<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:47.579> there<00:00:47.760> wasn't<00:00:48.090> much

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
space but I saw that there wasn't much

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.220 
space but I saw that there wasn't much
room<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.660> our<00:00:49.079> bedside<00:00:49.590> table<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.780> then

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
room for our bedside table here and then

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.619 
room for our bedside table here and then
I<00:00:52.350> saw<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.710> pillar<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.640> middle<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I saw this pillar in the middle and I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.360 
I saw this pillar in the middle and I
thought<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.109> could<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> pillar

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
thought what could I do with the pillar

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.540 
thought what could I do with the pillar
to<00:00:56.579> make<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.850> more<00:00:56.940> interesting<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.769> I<00:00:58.769> have

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
to make it more interesting and I have

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.530 
to make it more interesting and I have
come<00:00:59.850> up<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.420> pretty<00:01:01.109> cool<00:01:02.929> adjustment<00:01:03.929> I

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
come up with a pretty cool adjustment I

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.380 
come up with a pretty cool adjustment I
thought<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.780> could<00:01:07.370> embed<00:01:08.370> a<00:01:08.730> bedside

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
thought that I could embed a bedside

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.750 
thought that I could embed a bedside
table<00:01:09.570> inside<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.230> pillar<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.610> what

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
table inside the pillar so this is what

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.110 
table inside the pillar so this is what
I<00:01:11.790> did<00:01:17.870> okay<00:01:18.870> so<00:01:19.050> this<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.350> what<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> did<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> got

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
I did okay so this is what I did I got

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.520 
I did okay so this is what I did I got

your hat or your glass on there but I
can't<00:03:13.520> find<00:03:13.700> glass<00:03:13.970> at<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.300> moment<00:03:15.130> so

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
can't find glass at the moment so

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.980 
can't find glass at the moment so
install<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.120> back<00:03:17.270> in<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:18.590> rather<00:03:18.920> simple<00:03:19.990> you

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
install it back in is rather simple you

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.920 
install it back in is rather simple you
just<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:24.890> just<00:03:24.920> bend<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.210> house<00:03:26.390> out<00:03:26.750> of

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
just you just bend the house out of

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:36.420 
just you just bend the house out of
shape<00:03:27.200> for<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.560> bit<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:35.060> then<00:03:35.180> when<00:03:35.330> it's<00:03:35.480> in

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
shape for a bit and then when it's in

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.090 
shape for a bit and then when it's in
push<00:03:37.430> everything<00:03:37.700> back<00:03:37.850> down

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
push everything back down

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.070 
push everything back down
make<00:03:40.100> sure<00:03:40.310> everything's<00:03:40.790> back<00:03:41.270> in<00:03:41.630> its

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
make sure everything's back in its

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:53.620 
make sure everything's back in its
proportion<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:52.220> yeah<00:03:52.400> that's<00:03:52.850> how<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.120> make<00:03:53.390> a

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
proportion so yeah that's how to make a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.890 
proportion so yeah that's how to make a
folding<00:03:54.760> bedside<00:03:55.760> table<00:03:56.270> in<00:03:56.450> this<00:03:56.690> hillside

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
folding bedside table in this hillside

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.150 
folding bedside table in this hillside
house<00:03:57.350> that<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.860> also<00:03:58.580> included<00:03:59.420> another<00:04:00.160> tiny

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
house that I also included another tiny

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.990 
house that I also included another tiny
feature<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:05.540> right<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.930> end<00:04:06.080> here<00:04:06.790> I'm<00:04:07.790> not

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
feature just right the end here I'm not

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.070 
feature just right the end here I'm not
sure<00:04:08.060> if<00:04:08.300> you<00:04:08.420> can<00:04:08.540> see<00:04:08.780> if<00:04:08.870> I<00:04:09.020> know<00:04:09.460> but<00:04:10.460> there

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
sure if you can see if I know but there

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.240 
sure if you can see if I know but there
I've<00:04:12.080> added<00:04:12.470> a<00:04:12.740> lever<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:15.170> open<00:04:15.200> that<00:04:15.650> up<00:04:15.710> like

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
I've added a lever to open that up like

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.110 
I've added a lever to open that up like
a<00:04:17.590> fire<00:04:18.590> escape<00:04:18.830> something<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:19.820> that's<00:04:20.000> to

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
a fire escape something so that's to

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.850 
a fire escape something so that's to
leave<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.450> there<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:22.030> that<00:04:23.030> just<00:04:23.540> turns<00:04:23.860> and

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
leave it there and that just turns and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.530 
leave it there and that just turns and
you<00:04:25.820> can<00:04:26.000> easily<00:04:26.330> work<00:04:26.660> out<00:04:26.870> how<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:27.050> did<00:04:27.380> that
