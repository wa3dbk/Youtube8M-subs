these<00:00:03.120> two<00:00:03.360> items<00:00:03.810> are<00:00:06.560> filter<00:00:07.560> caps<00:00:07.799> for<00:00:08.040> this

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
these two items are filter caps for this

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.470 
these two items are filter caps for this
amp<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.900> even<00:00:09.900> though<00:00:10.050> they're<00:00:10.230> not<00:00:10.260> worn<00:00:10.830> out

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480

there are over 10 years old dis amps a
75<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.630> we're<00:00:15.809> going<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.049> replace<00:00:16.260> them<00:00:16.590> anyway

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
75 so we're going to replace them anyway

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.550 
75 so we're going to replace them anyway
those<00:00:17.820> exact<00:00:18.270> filter<00:00:18.930> caps<00:00:19.170> are<00:00:19.410> not

those exact filter caps are not
available<00:00:19.830> anymore<00:00:20.779> what<00:00:21.779> we're<00:00:21.930> going<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.080> do

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
available anymore what we're going to do

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.640 
available anymore what we're going to do
is<00:00:23.039> we've<00:00:23.340> gotten<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.789> ones<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.470> are<00:00:25.470> used

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
is we've gotten the ones that are used

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.820 
is we've gotten the ones that are used
in<00:00:25.800> Marshall<00:00:26.189> style<00:00:26.460> amps<00:00:27.439> with<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
in Marshall style amps with the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.170 
in Marshall style amps with the
accompanying<00:00:29.310> clamp<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:31.969> we're<00:00:32.969> going<00:00:33.120> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
accompanying clamp and we're going to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.030 
accompanying clamp and we're going to
bend<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.870> tab<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.670> fits<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.270> mount

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
bend this tab so it fits on that mount

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.280 
bend this tab so it fits on that mount
there<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:39.300> we're<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.840> mount<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.140> this

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
there and we're going to mount it this

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.880 
there and we're going to mount it this
way<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.300> two<00:00:42.570> sections<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.290> 40<00:00:43.590> micro

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
way this one is two sections of 40 micro

way this one is two sections of 40 micro
farad's<00:00:44.309> at<00:00:44.780> 450<00:00:45.780> volts<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:47.100> guy<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.340> two

volts<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.160> these<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:53.489> equivalent<00:00:53.989> type<00:00:54.989> items

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
volts so these are equivalent type items

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
volts so these are equivalent type items
so<00:00:56.850> we've<00:00:57.000> already<00:00:57.180> discharged<00:00:57.809> our<00:00:58.020> filter

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so we've already discharged our filter

so we've already discharged our filter

I<00:02:53.790> probably<00:02:54.790> should<00:02:55.060> shorten<00:02:55.420> those<00:02:55.600> wires

solder<00:04:49.029> going<00:04:49.449> I<00:04:49.629> actually<00:04:50.529> use<00:04:50.799> two<00:04:51.009> 80<00:04:51.279> watt

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:51.549

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:53.799

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:57.839 
irons together to heat it up and then I
and<00:04:54.759> I<00:04:54.849> lift<00:04:55.059> the<00:04:55.209> tabs<00:04:55.799> so<00:04:56.799> this<00:04:56.949> is<00:04:57.129> the<00:04:57.369> one

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
and I lift the tabs so this is the one

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.749
