a<00:02:14.920> hair<00:02:15.160> dryer<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.640> then<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:15.940> use<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> flat<00:02:16.420> iron

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
a hair dryer and then I use a flat iron

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.080 
a hair dryer and then I use a flat iron
so<00:02:17.290> when<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.710> came<00:02:17.800> time<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:18.100> dry<00:02:18.430> my<00:02:18.760> hair<00:02:18.910> this

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
so when it came time to dry my hair this

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.720 
so when it came time to dry my hair this
time<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.660> was<00:02:20.620> kind<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.860> surprised<00:02:21.250> at<00:02:21.490> what

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
time I was kind of surprised at what

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.870 
time I was kind of surprised at what
happened<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:23.230> frizziness<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.670> would

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
happened the frizziness that I would

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.480 
happened the frizziness that I would
normally<00:02:25.090> experience<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:26.140> would<00:02:26.830> say<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.370> was

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
normally experience I would say it was

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.610 
normally experience I would say it was
about<00:02:27.700> fifty<00:02:28.240> percent<00:02:28.270> of<00:02:28.960> what<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.410> normally

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
about fifty percent of what it normally

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.420 
about fifty percent of what it normally
was<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> only<00:02:32.560> thing<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.100> use

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
was so this is the only thing I use

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.490 
was so this is the only thing I use
today<00:02:33.850> so<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.270> has<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.510> be<00:02:34.870> because<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.290> this

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
today so it has to be because of this

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.200 
today so it has to be because of this
product<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.220> didn't<00:02:36.580> have<00:02:36.640> the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
product that I didn't have the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.780 
product that I didn't have the
frizziness<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.380> normally<00:02:38.470> do<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.640> because

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
frizziness that I normally do so because

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.630 
frizziness that I normally do so because
of<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.540> didn't<00:02:40.870> take<00:02:41.140> as<00:02:41.320> much<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.860> the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
of that it didn't take as much of the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.280 
of that it didn't take as much of the
flat<00:02:42.880> iron<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.420> feel<00:02:43.600> like<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.840> did<00:02:44.020> less

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
flat iron so I feel like I did less

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.740 
flat iron so I feel like I did less
damage<00:02:44.860> on<00:02:45.040> my<00:02:45.160> hair<00:02:45.370> today<00:02:45.610> because<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:46.300> didn't

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
damage on my hair today because I didn't

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.090 
damage on my hair today because I didn't
have<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.020> much<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.440> had<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.770> smooth<00:02:48.070> down

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
have that much to had to smooth down

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.220 
have that much to had to smooth down
that<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.090> already<00:02:49.330> helped<00:02:49.630> take<00:02:49.750> care<00:02:49.810> of<00:02:50.110> it

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
that this already helped take care of it

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.320 
that this already helped take care of it
so<00:02:50.740> this<00:02:50.920> was<00:02:51.070> just<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.760> know<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.940> first<00:02:52.150> time

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
so this was just you know the first time

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.020 
so this was just you know the first time
using<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.900> don't<00:02:53.080> know<00:02:53.170> if<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.860> will<00:02:54.340> feel

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.710 
that after using it several times in a
row<00:02:57.490> will<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:57.970> weigh<00:02:58.090> my<00:02:58.240> hair<00:02:58.480> down<00:02:58.660> or
