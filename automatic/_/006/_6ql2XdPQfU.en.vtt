00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.210 
get from harness darkness
which<00:02:14.850> at<00:02:15.150> three<00:02:15.450> stacks<00:02:15.750> whenever<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:17.040> use

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
which at three stacks whenever you use

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.070 
which at three stacks whenever you use
your<00:02:17.370> force<00:02:17.700> lightning<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.360> twelve<00:02:18.780> percent

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
your force lightning it's twelve percent

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.650 
your force lightning it's twelve percent

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
of your health restored which for me is

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.350 
of your health restored which for me is
about<00:02:22.460> 2200<00:02:23.460> ish<00:02:23.670> HP<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.580> mean<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.150> just

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
about 2200 ish HP so I mean I it's just

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.020 
about 2200 ish HP so I mean I it's just
hard<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.630> turn<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.050> down<00:02:28.550> as<00:02:29.550> far<00:02:29.880> as

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
hard to turn that down as far as

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.210 
hard to turn that down as far as
deception<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.750> go<00:02:31.140> far<00:02:31.380> enough<00:02:31.500> into<00:02:31.710> deception

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
deception I go far enough into deception

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.400 
deception I go far enough into deception
to<00:02:32.340> grab<00:02:32.490> my<00:02:32.640> darks<00:02:32.970> well<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.480> deceptive

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
power and my induction so basically

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.950 
power and my induction so basically
you're<00:02:38.880> grabbing<00:02:39.030> everything<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.570> can<00:02:39.780> to

buff your stealth your mall on your
thrashing<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:43.350> these<00:02:44.160> two<00:02:44.430> make<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.670> very

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
thrashing and these two make it very

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.790 
thrashing and these two make it very
good<00:02:45.360> especially<00:02:45.660> for<00:02:45.900> one-on-one<00:02:46.230> fights

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
good especially for one-on-one fights

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.040 
good especially for one-on-one fights
where<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.640> have<00:02:47.820> six<00:02:48.360> seconds<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.810> fifty

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050

percent<00:02:49.350> force<00:02:49.710> region<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.340> then<00:02:50.970> what<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.450> do

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
percent force region and then what I do

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.720 
percent force region and then what I do
for<00:02:52.080> my<00:02:52.140> dark<00:02:52.470> slope<00:02:52.709> which<00:02:53.100> makes<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.520> so<00:02:53.700> that

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
for my dark slope which makes it so that

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.270 
for my dark slope which makes it so that
you<00:02:54.060> get<00:02:54.240> this<00:02:54.750> again<00:02:55.140> whenever<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.770> pop<00:02:56.040> your

about<00:03:02.550> fifty<00:03:02.880> percent<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.480> will<00:03:04.050> usually<00:03:04.260> spike

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
about fifty percent I will usually spike

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
about fifty percent I will usually spike

and mall reason being mall is kind of

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.610 
and mall reason being mall is kind of
bugged<00:03:09.180> out<00:03:09.390> right<00:03:09.600> now<00:03:09.780> sometimes<00:03:10.440> they'll

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
bugged out right now sometimes they'll

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.050 
bugged out right now sometimes they'll
just<00:03:10.800> throw<00:03:10.950> your<00:03:11.130> lights<00:03:11.310> near<00:03:11.520> around<00:03:11.850> and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
just throw your lights near around and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.340 
just throw your lights near around and
it<00:03:12.120> won't<00:03:12.300> ever<00:03:12.510> actually<00:03:12.720> finish<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
it won't ever actually finish the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.110 
it won't ever actually finish the
animation<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.250> won't<00:03:14.490> actually<00:03:14.640> do<00:03:14.970> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
animation and you won't actually do the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.440 
animation and you won't actually do the
damage<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.890> spike<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.790> run<00:03:18.060> around<00:03:18.180> back

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
damage so I spike and run around back

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.210 
damage so I spike and run around back
for<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.720> free<00:03:18.989> mall<00:03:19.230> whenever<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.620> have<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.830> proc

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
for a free mall whenever I have the proc

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.729 
for a free mall whenever I have the proc
up<00:03:20.459> which<00:03:21.420> gives<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.200> bunch<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.470> armor

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
up which gives a bunch of armor

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.570 
up which gives a bunch of armor
penetration<00:03:22.920> from<00:03:23.880> duplicity<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:25.580> the

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
penetration from duplicity and the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.190 
penetration from duplicity and the
problem<00:03:26.880> with<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.750> uses<00:03:27.930> almost

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
problem with that is that it uses almost

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.310 
problem with that is that it uses almost
your<00:03:28.470> entire<00:03:28.500> bar<00:03:29.360> this<00:03:30.360> is<00:03:30.540> 50<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:30.959> then<00:03:31.260> I

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
your entire bar this is 50 and then I

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.780 
your entire bar this is 50 and then I
believe<00:03:31.620> spike<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.310> 30<00:03:33.170> yeah<00:03:34.170> 30<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:35.519> that

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
believe spike is 30 yeah 30 so that

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.759 
believe spike is 30 yeah 30 so that
almost<00:03:35.940> uses<00:03:36.300> up<00:03:36.450> my<00:03:36.600> entire<00:03:36.840> force<00:03:37.170> bar<00:03:37.440> so

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
almost uses up my entire force bar so

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.220 
almost uses up my entire force bar so
immediately<00:03:38.310> after<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.790> pop<00:03:39.090> my<00:03:39.120> blackout<00:03:39.780> for

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
immediately after I pop my blackout for

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.870 
immediately after I pop my blackout for
the<00:03:41.190> dark<00:03:42.060> swamp<00:03:42.360> Rock<00:03:43.459> giving<00:03:44.459> me<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.640> fifty

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
the dark swamp Rock giving me the fifty

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.070 
the dark swamp Rock giving me the fifty
percent<00:03:45.180> regen<00:03:45.570> again<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:47.840> aside<00:03:48.840> from<00:03:48.870> that

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
percent regen again and aside from that

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.670 
percent regen again and aside from that
my<00:03:49.500> typical<00:03:50.040> rotation<00:03:50.850> usually<00:03:51.500> involves<00:03:52.500> me

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
my typical rotation usually involves me

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.820 
my typical rotation usually involves me
going<00:03:52.830> in<00:03:53.100> stealth<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.580> course<00:03:53.870> I<00:03:54.870> try<00:03:55.769> and

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
going in stealth of course I try and

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.850 
going in stealth of course I try and

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
unavoidable because their CC and then

specifically<00:05:07.170> what<00:05:07.560> I'm<00:05:07.710> going<00:05:07.980> to<00:05:08.100> address

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
specifically what I'm going to address

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.360 
specifically what I'm going to address
is<00:05:08.700> troopers<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:09.630> bounty<00:05:09.930> hunters<00:05:10.260> make<00:05:11.100> sure

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
is troopers and bounty hunters make sure

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.720 
is troopers and bounty hunters make sure
that<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:11.730> use<00:05:11.760> your<00:05:12.180> jolt<00:05:12.720> on<00:05:13.070> either<00:05:14.070> tracer

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
that you use your jolt on either tracer

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.450 
that you use your jolt on either tracer
missile<00:05:15.120> for<00:05:15.420> bounty<00:05:15.840> hunters<00:05:16.140> or<00:05:16.410> grab<00:05:16.950> found

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
missile for bounty hunters or grab found

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.510 
missile for bounty hunters or grab found
I<00:05:17.760> think<00:05:18.030> it's<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.180> ground<00:05:18.810> for<00:05:19.680> troopers

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
I think it's the ground for troopers

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.190 
I think it's the ground for troopers
because<00:05:21.090> they're<00:05:21.240> going<00:05:21.480> to<00:05:21.600> span<00:05:21.810> them<00:05:22.050> and

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
because they're going to span them and

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.420 
because they're going to span them and
they're<00:05:22.290> going<00:05:22.410> to<00:05:22.620> do<00:05:22.740> more<00:05:22.980> and<00:05:23.100> more<00:05:23.250> damage

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
they're going to do more and more damage

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.260 
they're going to do more and more damage
depending<00:05:23.880> on<00:05:25.160> how<00:05:26.160> many<00:05:26.220> they've<00:05:26.820> hit<00:05:27.120> you

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
depending on how many they've hit you

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.790 
depending on how many they've hit you
with<00:05:27.420> so<00:05:27.780> make<00:05:27.960> sure<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.170> interrupt<00:05:28.500> that<00:05:28.620> and

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
with so make sure you interrupt that and

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.320 
with so make sure you interrupt that and
lock<00:05:28.950> them<00:05:29.130> out<00:05:29.220> of<00:05:29.280> it<00:05:29.520> um<00:05:31.760> if<00:05:32.760> they<00:05:32.940> get<00:05:33.120> away

that<00:05:59.460> to<00:05:59.490> wear<00:05:59.760> off<00:05:59.940> because<00:06:00.210> they<00:06:00.330> can't<00:06:00.540> pop

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
that to wear off because they can't pop

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.410 
that to wear off because they can't pop
it<00:06:00.900> again<00:06:01.140> but<00:06:01.380> we're<00:06:02.000> pretty<00:06:03.000> much<00:06:03.180> useless

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
it again but we're pretty much useless

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.250 
it again but we're pretty much useless
against<00:06:03.900> an<00:06:04.050> entrenched<00:06:04.290> sniper<00:06:05.030> um<00:06:06.260> but

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260
