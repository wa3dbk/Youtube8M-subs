00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.270 
alternatively is you could use a kitchen
cup<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:08.840> could<00:01:09.080> fill<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.440> up<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.740> then

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
cup and you could fill it up and then

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.040 
cup and you could fill it up and then
once<00:01:10.520> it's<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.940> freezer<00:01:11.119> and<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:11.720> starts

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
once it's in the freezer and it starts

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.330 
once it's in the freezer and it starts
to<00:01:12.170> set<00:01:12.380> up<00:01:12.500> for<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.770> little<00:01:12.890> bit<00:01:13.040> you<00:01:13.190> could

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
to set up for a little bit you could

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.580 
to set up for a little bit you could
stick<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.670> popsicle<00:01:14.180> stick<00:01:14.390> in<00:01:14.840> in<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.380> middle

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
stick a popsicle stick in in the middle

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.320 
stick a popsicle stick in in the middle
of<00:01:15.710> it<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.369> could<00:01:16.580> do<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.149> then

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
of it and you could do that and then

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.060 
of it and you could do that and then
what<00:01:17.509> you<00:01:17.660> would<00:01:17.750> do<00:01:17.930> is<00:01:18.110> just<00:01:18.290> take<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:18.979> out

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
what you would do is just take it out

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.950 
what you would do is just take it out
for<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.340> few<00:01:19.490> minutes<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.970> let<00:01:20.149> it<00:01:20.180> fall<00:01:20.570> just<00:01:20.840> a

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
for a few minutes and let it fall just a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.359 
for a few minutes and let it fall just a
little<00:01:21.170> bit<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:21.440> it<00:01:21.560> will<00:01:21.710> loosen<00:01:21.860> from<00:01:22.250> the

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
little bit so it will loosen from the

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.800 
little bit so it will loosen from the
sides<00:01:22.580> of<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.880> cup<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:23.330> could<00:01:23.479> just<00:01:23.630> pull

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
sides of the cup and you could just pull

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.389 
sides of the cup and you could just pull
it<00:01:23.899> out<00:01:29.319> to<00:01:30.319> make<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.590> pushpot<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.130> I'm<00:01:31.190> going

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
into the mold and I'm going to leave a

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.459 
into the mold and I'm going to leave a
little<00:02:24.670> space<00:02:24.849> at<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.180> top<00:02:25.269> for<00:02:25.780> expansion

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:26.469 
little space at the top for expansion

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.199 
little space at the top for expansion
when<00:02:27.010> they<00:02:27.129> freeze<00:02:27.430> they'll<00:02:27.640> expand<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.180> little

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
when they freeze they'll expand a little

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:35.910 
when they freeze they'll expand a little
bit<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:34.569> just<00:02:34.870> continue<00:02:35.379> to<00:02:35.409> all<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.620> have<00:02:35.769> them

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
bit and just continue to all I have them
