00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
wire but I've already done that remember

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.000 
wire but I've already done that remember
to<00:00:56.030> flush<00:00:56.299> cut<00:00:56.659> both<00:00:56.930> ends<00:00:57.409> so<00:00:57.470> that<00:00:57.619> they're

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
to flush cut both ends so that they're

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.280 
to flush cut both ends so that they're
flat<00:00:58.339> not<00:00:58.670> pointy<00:00:59.180> and<00:01:00.080> I've<00:01:00.650> also<00:01:00.830> got<00:01:01.280> my

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
flat not pointy and I've also got my

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.980 
flat not pointy and I've also got my
nylon<00:01:03.290> pliers<00:01:03.710> handy<00:01:04.159> in<00:01:04.489> case<00:01:04.659> now<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.720> last

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
nylon pliers handy in case now the last

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.540 
nylon pliers handy in case now the last
step<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.350> this<00:01:06.650> is<00:01:07.220> to<00:01:07.760> work<00:01:08.390> harden<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:09.200> wire

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
step of this is to work harden the wire

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.250 
step of this is to work harden the wire
so<00:01:10.550> you<00:01:10.610> will<00:01:11.090> need<00:01:11.300> something<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:11.900> do<00:01:12.050> that

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
so you will need something to do that

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.740 
so you will need something to do that
with<00:01:12.440> otherwise<00:01:12.950> it's<00:01:13.820> likely<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.240> come<00:01:14.540> loose

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
with otherwise it's likely to come loose

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.690 
with otherwise it's likely to come loose
especially<00:01:15.290> if<00:01:15.380> you're<00:01:15.500> using<00:01:15.620> soft<00:01:16.100> sterling

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
especially if you're using soft sterling

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.420 
especially if you're using soft sterling
using<00:01:17.180> half<00:01:17.360> hard<00:01:17.660> or<00:01:17.870> hard<00:01:18.170> hard<00:01:19.160> would<00:01:19.340> be

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
using half hard or hard hard would be

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.130 
using half hard or hard hard would be
very<00:01:19.640> difficult<00:01:19.790> but<00:01:20.060> half<00:01:20.540> hard<00:01:20.810> wire<00:01:20.840> it's

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
very difficult but half hard wire it's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.100 
very difficult but half hard wire it's
not<00:01:21.290> such<00:01:21.470> an<00:01:21.620> issue<00:01:21.910> so<00:01:22.910> you<00:01:22.940> want<00:01:23.270> an<00:01:23.600> evil

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
not such an issue so you want an evil

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.980 
not such an issue so you want an evil
and<00:01:24.350> probably<00:01:24.740> in<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:24.860> line<00:01:25.250> hammer<00:01:25.460> to<00:01:26.270> work

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
and probably in the line hammer to work

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.520 
and probably in the line hammer to work
harden<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.470> afterwards<00:01:28.510> okay<00:01:29.510> so<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.350> first

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
harden it afterwards okay so the first

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.840 
harden it afterwards okay so the first
thing<00:01:30.680> we're<00:01:30.920> just<00:01:30.950> going<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.280> make<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.430> simple

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
thing we're just going to make a simple

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.990 
thing we're just going to make a simple
s<00:01:32.000> style<00:01:32.330> style<00:01:32.690> class<00:01:33.400> grasp<00:01:34.400> it<00:01:34.610> at<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.850> end

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
s style style class grasp it at the end

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.140 
s style style class grasp it at the end
like<00:01:35.300> so<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:36.280> then<00:01:37.280> we're<00:01:37.460> going<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.850> just

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
like so and then we're going to just

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.590 
like so and then we're going to just
twist<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.659> around<00:01:40.030> again<00:01:41.030> at<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.270> smallest

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
twist it around again at the smallest

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.560 
twist it around again at the smallest
piece<00:01:42.020> just<00:01:42.800> like<00:01:43.100> when<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.490> were<00:01:43.520> making<00:01:44.480> a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
piece just like when you were making a

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.550 
piece just like when you were making a
spiral<00:01:45.340> okay<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:46.400> that's<00:01:46.790> one<00:01:47.030> bit<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:48.350> then

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
spiral okay so that's one bit and then

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.020 
spiral okay so that's one bit and then
I'm<00:01:48.650> going<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.830> grasp<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:49.280> up<00:01:49.400> here<00:01:49.670> at<00:01:49.790> the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
I'm going to grasp it up here at the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.740 
I'm going to grasp it up here at the
thick<00:01:50.420> end<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:52.310> I'm<00:01:52.550> going<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:52.940> wrap<00:01:53.540> it

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
thick end and I'm going to wrap it

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.010 
thick end and I'm going to wrap it
around<00:01:54.010> that<00:01:55.010> way<00:01:55.250> like<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:56.330> until

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
around that way like so until

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.530 
around that way like so until
the<00:01:58.470> long<00:01:58.680> bit<00:01:58.920> meets<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.880> curve<00:02:00.120> that<00:02:00.360> you've

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
the long bit meets the curve that you've

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.530 
the long bit meets the curve that you've
done<00:02:00.720> there<00:02:01.490> okay<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.940> that's<00:02:03.120> where<00:02:03.330> we're<00:02:03.450> up

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
done there okay so that's where we're up

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.310 
done there okay so that's where we're up
to<00:02:03.750> sofa<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:05.430> next<00:02:05.760> part<00:02:05.970> is<00:02:06.120> the<00:02:06.180> end<00:02:06.570> now

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
to sofa the next part is the end now

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.050 
to sofa the next part is the end now
this<00:02:07.620> part<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.039> I'm<00:02:08.130> making<00:02:08.460> now<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.820> where

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
this part that I'm making now is where

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.600 
this part that I'm making now is where
the<00:02:09.330> wire<00:02:10.050> will<00:02:10.350> actually<00:02:10.800> attach<00:02:11.100> them<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the wire will actually attach them the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.550 
the wire will actually attach them the
chain<00:02:11.850> will<00:02:12.030> actually<00:02:12.360> touch<00:02:12.600> so<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.350> want<00:02:13.500> to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
chain will actually touch so you want to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.070 
chain will actually touch so you want to
make<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.860> little<00:02:13.950> bit<00:02:14.130> bigger

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
make it a little bit bigger

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.230 
make it a little bit bigger
okay<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.370> just<00:02:17.580> wrap<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:18.090> around<00:02:19.790> again<00:02:20.820> like

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
okay so just wrap that around again like

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.820 
okay so just wrap that around again like
so

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.830 

so<00:02:26.370> there<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.550> go<00:02:26.850> that's<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.390> first<00:02:27.600> part

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
so there you go that's the first part

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.040 
so there you go that's the first part
that's<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.290> clasp<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:30.150> little<00:02:30.480> bit<00:02:30.630> here

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
that's the clasp this little bit here

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.690 
that's the clasp this little bit here
you<00:02:31.200> know<00:02:31.290> it's<00:02:31.440> variable<00:02:31.800> you're<00:02:32.370> going<00:02:32.580> to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
you know it's variable you're going to

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.370 
you know it's variable you're going to
need<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.030> either<00:02:33.210> put<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.720> chain<00:02:33.960> directly

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
need to either put the chain directly

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.290 
need to either put the chain directly
through<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.710> or<00:02:35.010> put<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> jump<00:02:35.730> ring<00:02:35.910> through<00:02:36.150> it

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
through it or put a jump ring through it

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.680 
through it or put a jump ring through it
to<00:02:36.420> attach<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.990> chain<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.760> then<00:02:38.760> we<00:02:39.030> have<00:02:39.300> this

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
to attach the chain on then we have this

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.010 
to attach the chain on then we have this
part<00:02:39.960> now<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.500> going<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.890> be<00:02:41.450> what<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
part now this is going to be what the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.190 
part now this is going to be what the
hoobat<00:02:43.380> are<00:02:43.560> those<00:02:43.890> who<00:02:44.100> hook<00:02:44.370> attaches<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.200> so

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
hoobat are those who hook attaches to so

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.950 
hoobat are those who hook attaches to so
you<00:02:46.320> need<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.800> make<00:02:46.980> sure<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:48.210> loop

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
you need to make sure that this loop

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.170 
you need to make sure that this loop
that<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.470> make<00:02:49.770> here<00:02:50.040> will<00:02:50.490> fit<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.910> through

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
that I make here will fit that through

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.050 
that I make here will fit that through
it<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.560> little<00:02:53.040> bit<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.370> adjustment<00:02:53.760> might

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
it so a little bit of adjustment might

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.050 
it so a little bit of adjustment might
be<00:02:54.210> necessary<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.990> will<00:02:55.110> start<00:02:55.410> about<00:02:55.650> here

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.630 

okay<00:03:00.500> I've<00:03:01.500> made<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:02.270> little<00:03:03.270> bit<00:03:03.420> Tyler<00:03:04.640> now

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
okay I've made that little bit Tyler now

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.100 
okay I've made that little bit Tyler now
let's<00:03:05.850> see<00:03:06.060> if<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.270> fits

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
let's see if it fits

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.640 
let's see if it fits
yes<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.710> does<00:03:08.890> beautiful<00:03:09.930> okay<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:10.990> we'll<00:03:11.500> take

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
yes it does beautiful okay so we'll take

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.600 
yes it does beautiful okay so we'll take
it<00:03:11.800> off<00:03:11.920> again<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:13.110> then<00:03:14.110> I'll<00:03:14.230> just<00:03:14.410> do<00:03:14.620> on

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
it off again and then I'll just do on

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.840 
it off again and then I'll just do on
the<00:03:15.790> other<00:03:15.910> side<00:03:16.120> again<00:03:16.390> where<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:17.850> chains

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
the other side again where the chains

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.690 
the other side again where the chains
going<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.180> attach<00:03:19.450> make<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.440> relatively<00:03:21.160> small

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
going to attach make it relatively small

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.200 
going to attach make it relatively small
because<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:21.970> want<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.180> make<00:03:22.330> this<00:03:22.480> neat

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.470 

okay<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:31.130> basically<00:03:31.520> want<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.820> try<00:03:32.240> just<00:03:32.270> for

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
okay you basically want to try just for

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.160 
okay you basically want to try just for
the<00:03:35.480> sake<00:03:35.720> of<00:03:35.980> prettiness<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:38.510> get<00:03:38.690> these<00:03:38.870> two

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
the sake of prettiness to get these two

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.020 
the sake of prettiness to get these two
meeting<00:03:39.530> up<00:03:39.760> at<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.850> same<00:03:41.060> spot<00:03:41.650> like<00:03:42.650> that

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
meeting up at the same spot like that

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.230 
meeting up at the same spot like that
okay<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:46.160> way<00:03:46.280> it's<00:03:46.460> going<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.700> work<00:03:46.850> and

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
okay so the way it's going to work and

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.930 
okay so the way it's going to work and
you'll<00:03:47.540> attach<00:03:47.840> these<00:03:48.050> two<00:03:48.320> ends<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.700> wire

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
you'll attach these two ends to the wire

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.390 
you'll attach these two ends to the wire
and<00:03:50.270> then<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.140> will<00:03:51.350> slip<00:03:51.620> on<00:03:51.740> and<00:03:52.070> slip<00:03:52.220> off

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
and then this will slip on and slip off

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.130 
and then this will slip on and slip off
here<00:03:52.640> so<00:03:53.150> what<00:03:53.300> you<00:03:53.390> want<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.660> do<00:03:53.750> is<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:53.990> want

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
here so what you want to do is you want

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.510 
here so what you want to do is you want
to<00:03:54.170> make<00:03:54.350> sure<00:03:54.380> there's<00:03:54.710> a<00:03:54.800> very<00:03:54.830> small<00:03:55.340> gap

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
to make sure there's a very small gap

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.720 
to make sure there's a very small gap
here<00:03:55.730> because<00:03:55.910> you<00:03:56.000> want<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.240> bit<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.810> bit<00:03:57.440> of

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
here because you want a bit of a bit of

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:05.920 
here because you want a bit of a bit of
hold<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:59.420> when<00:03:59.990> it<00:04:00.110> pulls<00:04:00.350> through<00:04:04.930> okay

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
hold so when it pulls through okay

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.640 
hold so when it pulls through okay
that's<00:04:06.440> all<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.680> two<00:04:07.040> time

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.229 

when<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.310> pulls<00:04:11.519> through<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:11.879> want<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.150> to

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
when it pulls through you want it to

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.449 
when it pulls through you want it to
kind<00:04:12.450> of<00:04:12.540> clip<00:04:12.870> clip<00:04:13.440> in<00:04:13.620> rather<00:04:14.250> than<00:04:14.370> just

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
kind of clip clip in rather than just

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.250 
kind of clip clip in rather than just
sliding<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.450> there<00:04:15.629> I've<00:04:15.810> got<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:15.959> bit<00:04:16.109> of<00:04:16.199> a

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
sliding on so there I've got a bit of a

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.580 
sliding on so there I've got a bit of a
click<00:04:16.470> there<00:04:16.500> now<00:04:17.780> what<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.810> do<00:04:18.930> now<00:04:19.260> is<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.530> to

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
click there now what I do now is I to

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.620 
click there now what I do now is I to
touch<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:20.370> jump<00:04:20.609> rings<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.269> ends<00:04:21.510> or<00:04:21.600> the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
touch the jump rings to the ends or the

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.330 
touch the jump rings to the ends or the
chains<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.350> ends<00:04:22.650> very<00:04:23.580> simply<00:04:24.770> okay<00:04:25.770> you

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
chains to the ends very simply okay you

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.330 
chains to the ends very simply okay you
just<00:04:26.370> grasp<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.860> same<00:04:28.860> with<00:04:29.010> jump<00:04:29.250> rings

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
just grasp that and same with jump rings

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.360 
just grasp that and same with jump rings
turn<00:04:29.729> it<00:04:29.850> to<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.090> side<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:30.720> you<00:04:30.750> don't<00:04:30.930> lose

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
turn it to the side so you don't lose

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.050 
turn it to the side so you don't lose
you<00:04:32.370> will<00:04:32.550> loop<00:04:33.060> shape<00:04:33.419> okay<00:04:34.199> and<00:04:34.910> then<00:04:35.910> you

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
you will loop shape okay and then you

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.610 
you will loop shape okay and then you
can<00:04:36.210> just<00:04:36.389> when<00:04:36.810> you've<00:04:36.960> got<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.199> chain<00:04:37.440> in

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
can just when you've got the chain in

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.110 
can just when you've got the chain in
there<00:04:37.800> turn<00:04:38.699> it<00:04:38.850> back<00:04:39.060> again<00:04:39.500> till<00:04:40.500> it's<00:04:40.650> flat

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
there turn it back again till it's flat

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.629 
there turn it back again till it's flat
okay<00:04:42.120> now<00:04:42.930> as<00:04:43.229> I<00:04:43.470> said<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.950> want<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.310> kind<00:04:44.550> of

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
okay now as I said you want to kind of

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.030 
okay now as I said you want to kind of
want<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.880> work<00:04:45.030> hard<00:04:45.330> in<00:04:45.479> this<00:04:45.650> so<00:04:46.650> you'll<00:04:46.830> get

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
want to work hard in this so you'll get

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.200 
want to work hard in this so you'll get
your<00:04:48.200> angle

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
your angle

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.420 
your angle
now<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:51.270> might<00:04:51.540> also<00:04:51.690> like<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.200> actually

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
now you might also like to actually

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.340 
now you might also like to actually
flatten<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.520> wire<00:04:53.729> and<00:04:54.150> we'll<00:04:54.300> do<00:04:54.510> little<00:04:54.840> bit

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
flatten the wire and we'll do little bit

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.900 
flatten the wire and we'll do little bit
so<00:04:55.560> that<00:04:55.590> it's<00:04:55.889> a<00:04:55.979> bit<00:04:56.100> flatter<00:04:56.370> than<00:04:56.610> others

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
so that it's a bit flatter than others

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.870 
so that it's a bit flatter than others
or<00:04:57.030> whatever<00:04:57.889> I'm<00:04:58.889> not<00:04:59.100> actually<00:04:59.250> going<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.669> do

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
or whatever I'm not actually going to do

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.640 
or whatever I'm not actually going to do
that<00:05:00.060> because<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.660> makes<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.990> lot<00:05:01.080> of<00:05:01.139> noise<00:05:01.229> but

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
that because it makes a lot of noise but

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.440 
that because it makes a lot of noise but
basically<00:05:02.280> you<00:05:02.460> just<00:05:02.520> tap<00:05:02.850> it<00:05:03.000> a<00:05:03.060> few<00:05:03.090> times

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
basically you just tap it a few times

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.990 
basically you just tap it a few times
nice<00:05:04.260> and<00:05:04.500> hard<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:04.919> harden<00:05:05.250> it<00:05:05.310> and<00:05:05.610> then<00:05:05.880> if

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
nice and hard to harden it and then if

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000 
nice and hard to harden it and then if
you<00:05:06.150> want<00:05:06.479> to<00:05:06.539> actually<00:05:06.660> flatten<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.650> you<00:05:07.770> get

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
you want to actually flatten it you get

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.550 
you want to actually flatten it you get
your<00:05:08.220> proper<00:05:09.030> hammer<00:05:09.660> replenishing<00:05:10.350> hammer

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
your proper hammer replenishing hammer

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.189 
your proper hammer replenishing hammer
just<00:05:11.460> any<00:05:11.610> other<00:05:11.789> hammer<00:05:12.030> and<00:05:12.449> you<00:05:12.840> can<00:05:13.020> use

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
just any other hammer and you can use

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.900 
just any other hammer and you can use
that<00:05:13.410> one<00:05:13.620> just<00:05:14.130> make<00:05:14.280> sure<00:05:14.490> when<00:05:14.729> you're

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
that one just make sure when you're

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.710 
that one just make sure when you're
hammering<00:05:15.240> wire<00:05:15.570> to<00:05:15.960> actually<00:05:16.910> alter<00:05:17.910> it<00:05:18.270> that

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
hammering wire to actually alter it that

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.050 
hammering wire to actually alter it that
the<00:05:18.990> hammer<00:05:19.590> face<00:05:19.950> so<00:05:20.460> this<00:05:20.550> part<00:05:20.820> here<00:05:21.030> is

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
the hammer face so this part here is

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.550 
the hammer face so this part here is
nice<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:21.479> smooth<00:05:21.780> because<00:05:21.960> any<00:05:22.110> marks<00:05:22.440> you

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
nice and smooth because any marks you

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.140 
nice and smooth because any marks you
had<00:05:22.710> on<00:05:22.830> there<00:05:22.979> will<00:05:23.160> impart<00:05:23.460> to<00:05:23.580> your<00:05:23.729> wire<00:05:23.910> so

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
had on there will impart to your wire so

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.879 
had on there will impart to your wire so
it's<00:05:24.300> really<00:05:24.479> important<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.169> you<00:05:25.560> don't<00:05:25.680> do

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
it's really important that you don't do

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.790 
it's really important that you don't do
that<00:05:26.030> so<00:05:27.030> there<00:05:27.180> you<00:05:27.300> go<00:05:27.450> very<00:05:28.200> simple<00:05:28.470> little

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
that so there you go very simple little

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.100 
that so there you go very simple little
clasp<00:05:29.160> set<00:05:29.550> just<00:05:30.150> make<00:05:30.330> sure<00:05:30.539> when<00:05:30.720> you<00:05:30.840> finish

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
clasp set just make sure when you finish

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.450 
clasp set just make sure when you finish
with<00:05:31.229> them<00:05:31.380> that<00:05:31.560> all<00:05:31.680> these<00:05:31.830> gaps<00:05:32.130> are<00:05:32.340> nice

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
with them that all these gaps are nice

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.120 
with them that all these gaps are nice
and<00:05:32.700> closed<00:05:32.910> up<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:33.389> you'll<00:05:34.320> be<00:05:34.410> done

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.850
