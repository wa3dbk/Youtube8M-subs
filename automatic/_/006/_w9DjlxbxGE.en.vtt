at the moment unfortunately their mom
actually<00:00:09.960> abandoned<00:00:10.650> them<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:11.130> monitored

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
actually abandoned them we monitored

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.820 
actually abandoned them we monitored
that<00:00:11.880> three<00:00:12.599> times<00:00:12.929> when<00:00:13.259> they<00:00:13.380> were<00:00:13.440> going<00:00:13.679> in

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
that three times when they were going in

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.320 
that three times when they were going in
and<00:00:13.980> being<00:00:14.130> fed<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.700> noticed<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.120> they

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
and being fed and we noticed that they

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.849 
and being fed and we noticed that they
weren't<00:00:15.540> going<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.170> feeding<00:00:16.379> quite<00:00:16.740> as

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
weren't going in and feeding quite as

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.349 
weren't going in and feeding quite as
often<00:00:17.039> as<00:00:17.310> they<00:00:17.460> should<00:00:17.520> do<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> chicks

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
often as they should do and the chicks

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.510 
often as they should do and the chicks
we're<00:00:18.570> actually<00:00:18.720> getting<00:00:19.050> quite<00:00:19.289> hungry<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.490> I

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
we're actually getting quite hungry so I

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.099 
we're actually getting quite hungry so I
made<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> decision<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.300> hand<00:00:21.539> drew<00:00:21.779> isn't

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
made the decision to hand drew isn't

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.630 
made the decision to hand drew isn't
something<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:22.949> lightly<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.519> much

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
something that we do lightly with much

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.950 
something that we do lightly with much
preferred<00:00:23.970> parents<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.779> themselves

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
preferred parents to do it themselves

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.790 
preferred parents to do it themselves
and<00:00:25.550> so<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:26.730> came<00:00:26.910> down<00:00:26.970> aged<00:00:27.660> about<00:00:28.140> 12

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
and so they came down aged about 12

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.740 
and so they came down aged about 12
weeks<00:00:29.070> old<00:00:29.340> now<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.000> they've<00:00:30.390> been<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.720> us

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
weeks old now and they've been with us

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.139 
weeks old now and they've been with us
for<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> last<00:00:31.170> 15<00:00:31.529> days<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:32.279> started<00:00:32.730> off<00:00:32.880> by

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
for the last 15 days we started off by

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.850 
for the last 15 days we started off by
weighing<00:00:33.899> what<00:00:34.200> their<00:00:34.380> weights<00:00:34.620> were

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
weighing what their weights were

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.459 
weighing what their weights were
offering<00:00:35.489> them<00:00:35.670> some<00:00:35.910> fish<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:37.230> from

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
offering them some fish and going from

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.170 
offering them some fish and going from
there<00:00:37.739> really<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.309> then<00:00:38.460> gradually<00:00:38.850> building

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
there really and then gradually building

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.790 
there really and then gradually building
up<00:00:39.300> their<00:00:39.510> fish<00:00:39.719> intake<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.379> their<00:00:40.559> weights

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
up their fish intake as their weights

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.770 
up their fish intake as their weights
increased<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.790> we're<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.450> anything

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
increased and we're not going anything

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.940 
increased and we're not going anything
over<00:00:43.020> ten<00:00:43.200> percent<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.590> their<00:00:43.680> body<00:00:43.770> weight

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
over ten percent of their body weight

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.619 
over ten percent of their body weight
during<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> course<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> day<00:00:45.059> though<00:00:45.329> so

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
during the course of the day though so

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.060 
during the course of the day though so
they've<00:00:45.840> been<00:00:45.989> quite<00:00:46.200> strict<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> at

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
they've been quite strict with it at

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.069 
they've been quite strict with it at
times<00:00:47.340> we've<00:00:47.820> been<00:00:47.850> really<00:00:48.329> fortunate<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
times we've been really fortunate in the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.360 
times we've been really fortunate in the
fact<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.469> haven't<00:00:49.649> had<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.920> blend<00:00:50.100> any

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
fact that we haven't had to blend any

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.100 
fact that we haven't had to blend any
other<00:00:50.670> fish<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:50.910> they've<00:00:51.210> been<00:00:51.360> taking<00:00:51.809> whole

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
other fish and they've been taking whole

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.720 
other fish and they've been taking whole
fish<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.800> started<00:00:53.070> off<00:00:53.190> quite<00:00:53.340> small

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
fish so we started off quite small

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.430 
fish so we started off quite small
splitting<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> fish<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.960> half<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
splitting one of the fish in half and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.290 
splitting one of the fish in half and
then<00:00:55.530> offering<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.070> now<00:00:56.550> they're<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.059> small

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
then offering it now they're on to small

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.760 
then offering it now they're on to small
herring<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.899> they're<00:00:58.020> actually<00:00:58.350> taking<00:00:58.500> it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
herring and they're actually taking it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.470 
herring and they're actually taking it
really<00:00:58.980> willingly<00:00:59.399> because<00:01:00.120> they've<00:01:00.239> got<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
really willingly because they've got the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.090 
really willingly because they've got the
hooks<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.899> their<00:01:01.079> tongue<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.590> they<00:01:01.949> actually

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
hooks on their tongue and they actually

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.529 
hooks on their tongue and they actually
don't<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.609> he<00:01:02.699> goes<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.059> way<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.390> that

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
don't go and he goes one way so that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.600 
don't go and he goes one way so that
scales<00:01:03.840> don't<00:01:04.140> get<00:01:04.320> caught<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.430> offer

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
scales don't get caught and you offer

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.070 
scales don't get caught and you offer
them<00:01:05.880> they'll<00:01:06.119> flip<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.510> round<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.990> they'll

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
them they'll flip it round and they'll

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
them they'll flip it round and they'll
actually<00:01:07.229> take<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.680> head<00:01:07.860> down<00:01:08.070> each<00:01:08.250> time<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
actually take it head down each time and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.820 
actually take it head down each time and
then<00:01:09.210> once<00:01:09.630> they've<00:01:09.869> got<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.320> certain<00:01:10.500> point

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
then once they've got to a certain point

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.289 
then once they've got to a certain point
they'll<00:01:11.100> actually<00:01:11.220> start<00:01:11.400> shaking<00:01:12.119> and
