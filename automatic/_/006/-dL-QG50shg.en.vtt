function<00:00:39.640> on<00:00:39.970> this<00:00:40.090> guitar<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:42.070> this<00:00:42.250> it's<00:00:42.550> set

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
function on this guitar so this it's set

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.540 
function on this guitar so this it's set
at<00:00:43.090> 20<00:00:43.480> DB<00:00:43.660> so<00:00:44.230> it's<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:44.710> substantial<00:00:44.890> boost

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
at 20 DB so it's a substantial boost

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.480 
at 20 DB so it's a substantial boost
very<00:00:46.120> quiet<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.530> it<00:00:47.560> doesn't<00:00:47.860> color<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.220> tone

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
very quiet so it doesn't color the tone

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.460 
very quiet so it doesn't color the tone
just<00:00:48.940> really<00:00:49.300> kicks<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.720> signal<00:00:50.079> up<00:00:50.230> on<00:00:50.410> a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
just really kicks the signal up on a

00:00:50.470 --> 00:01:02.940 
just really kicks the signal up on a
clean<00:00:50.890> setting<00:00:51.310> I'll<00:00:51.760> demonstrate<00:00:52.000> that<00:01:01.950> so

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
clean setting I'll demonstrate that so

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.229 
clean setting I'll demonstrate that so
now<00:01:03.040> I'll<00:01:03.160> demonstrate<00:01:03.310> the<00:01:03.910> different

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
now I'll demonstrate the different

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:12.500 
now I'll demonstrate the different
settings<00:01:05.070> with<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.100> boost<00:01:09.720> here's<00:01:10.720> our<00:01:10.870> piezo

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510

here's<00:01:16.250> our<00:01:16.400> blend

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.100 

here's<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.530> blend<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> boost

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:35.850 

here's<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.230> magnetic<00:01:31.690> here's<00:01:32.690> a<00:01:32.750> dirty<00:01:33.080> sound

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:46.190 

dirty<00:01:36.860> sound<00:01:37.190> with<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.640> boost

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.920 

so<00:01:51.250> when<00:01:51.400> you're<00:01:51.520> boosting<00:01:52.120> on<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.420> dirty

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
so when you're boosting on a dirty

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.410 
so when you're boosting on a dirty
signal<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:54.670> Distortion

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
signal with Distortion

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.660 
signal with Distortion
it<00:01:55.930> doesn't<00:01:56.440> boost<00:01:56.620> up<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:56.979> volume<00:01:57.400> but<00:01:57.580> it

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
it doesn't boost up the volume but it

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.370 
it doesn't boost up the volume but it
really<00:01:57.940> brings<00:01:58.240> out<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.540> overtones<00:01:59.140> and

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
really brings out the overtones and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.040 
really brings out the overtones and
sustain<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.130> these<00:02:00.970> pickups<00:02:01.510> were<00:02:01.630> designed

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
sustain and these pickups were designed

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.490 
sustain and these pickups were designed
for<00:02:02.290> a<00:02:02.710> fast<00:02:03.070> attack<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:04.260> they're<00:02:05.260> really

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
for a fast attack and they're really

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.650 
for a fast attack and they're really
good<00:02:05.710> at<00:02:05.800> doing<00:02:06.040> that<00:02:06.220> this<00:02:07.150> guitar<00:02:07.330> also

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660
