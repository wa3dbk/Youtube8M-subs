final steps of this easter egg basically

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.939 
final steps of this easter egg basically
we<00:00:19.560> caught<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:21.080> but<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.230> didn't<00:00:22.680> quite

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
we caught on to this but we didn't quite

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.830 
we caught on to this but we didn't quite
get<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.970> don't<00:00:24.060> take<00:00:24.300> full<00:00:24.480> credit<00:00:24.630> for

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
get it so we don't take full credit for

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.420 
get it so we don't take full credit for
it<00:00:25.140> other<00:00:25.380> people<00:00:25.619> did<00:00:25.890> find<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.130> before

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
it other people did find a before

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.859 
it other people did find a before
iceberg<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:27.029> just<00:00:27.240> thought<00:00:27.300> we'd<00:00:27.449> bring<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.750> to

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
iceberg we just thought we'd bring it to

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.540 
iceberg we just thought we'd bring it to
you<00:00:27.990> because<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.500> only<00:00:28.590> video<00:00:28.769> wikify<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.429> in

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
you because the only video wikify was in

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.020 
you because the only video wikify was in
Spanish<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:31.160> we<00:00:32.160> thought<00:00:32.309> we'd<00:00:32.520> up<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.940> in

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
Spanish and we thought we'd up it in

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.340 
Spanish and we thought we'd up it in
English<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.480> basically<00:00:33.809> I'm<00:00:34.020> just<00:00:34.050> showing

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
English but basically I'm just showing

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.580 
English but basically I'm just showing
you<00:00:34.469> now<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.710> dials<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.469> they're<00:00:37.469> quite

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you now the dials and they're quite

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.020 
you now the dials and they're quite
tricky<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:38.430> you've<00:00:38.610> got<00:00:38.730> doing<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
tricky to do because you've got doing a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.150 
tricky to do because you've got doing a
certain<00:00:39.329> sequence<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:40.079> if<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.649> turn<00:00:40.860> one

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
certain sequence because if you turn one

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.430 
certain sequence because if you turn one
in<00:00:41.340> terms<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.730> one<00:00:41.879> above<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.480> well<00:00:42.660> but

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
in terms the one above it as well but

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.260 
in terms the one above it as well but
basically<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.489> see<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> code<00:00:44.969> fair

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
basically you can see the code fair

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.490 
basically you can see the code fair
because<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> different

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
because they all have the different

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.250 
because they all have the different
individual<00:00:47.100> colors<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.730> well<00:00:48.110> but<00:00:49.110> once

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
individual colors as well but once

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.869 
individual colors as well but once
you've<00:00:49.350> done<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.530> you'll<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:50.579> want<00:00:50.610> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you've done that you'll then want to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.340 
you've done that you'll then want to
head<00:00:51.090> over<00:00:51.120> find<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.620> glitch<00:00:53.340> radios<00:00:54.350> this

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
head over find the glitch radios this

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.130 
head over find the glitch radios this
one's<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.219> main<00:00:56.460> ship<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.629> below<00:00:57.899> where

and I think yeah so opposite the door

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.699 
and I think yeah so opposite the door
with<00:01:59.450> our<00:01:59.600> waste<00:01:59.810> or<00:01:59.959> egg<00:02:00.079> starts<00:02:00.350> or

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
with our waste or egg starts or

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.279 
with our waste or egg starts or
achievements<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:02.209> just<00:02:02.390> basically<00:02:02.689> hit<00:02:03.109> that

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
achievements you just basically hit that

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.410 
achievements you just basically hit that
and<00:02:03.829> that<00:02:04.789> will<00:02:04.939> be<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.090> part<00:02:05.509> done<00:02:07.420> and

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
and that will be that part done and

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.580 
and that will be that part done and
we've<00:02:08.929> got<00:02:09.110> do<00:02:09.259> now<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.709> go<00:02:09.920> up<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:11.590> ship

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
and then turn the steering wheel to the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.259 
and then turn the steering wheel to the
right<00:02:35.319> twice<00:02:36.319> so<00:02:37.129> you<00:02:37.220> see<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.370> brown<00:02:37.730> handle

basically before that it was like a
Morse<00:02:50.120> code<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:51.709> know<00:02:51.829> the<00:02:52.130> guy<00:02:52.310> who

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
Morse code so you know the guy who

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.460 
Morse code so you know the guy who
figured<00:02:52.609> that<00:02:52.850> out<00:02:52.970> fair<00:02:53.780> play<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:53.989> him<00:02:54.170> you
