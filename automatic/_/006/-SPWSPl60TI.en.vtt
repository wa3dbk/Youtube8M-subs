also<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:19.170> new<00:00:20.130> netbook<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.730> new<00:00:20.910> device<00:00:21.180> seems<00:00:21.660> to

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
also a new netbook a new device seems to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.500 
also a new netbook a new device seems to
me<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:21.960> prototype<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:23.119> reference<00:00:24.119> design

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
me like prototype or reference design

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.130 
me like prototype or reference design
from<00:00:25.199> quanta<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:26.250> super<00:00:26.849> slim<00:00:27.150> definitely

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140

never<00:00:28.769> seen<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.340> one<00:00:29.550> before<00:00:29.689> so<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:31.230> you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
never seen that one before so if you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.979 
never seen that one before so if you
just<00:00:31.529> take<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.740> look<00:00:32.059> just<00:00:33.059> my<00:00:33.180> finger<00:00:33.540> next<00:00:33.690> to

behind the battery so we might take a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.950 
behind the battery so we might take a
closer<00:01:35.030> look<00:01:35.660> at<00:01:36.590> this<00:01:36.890> afterwards<00:01:37.900> there's<00:01:38.900> a

putting<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:17.360> small<00:02:17.720> tab<00:02:18.680> keys<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.220> there

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
putting this small tab keys on there

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.039 
putting this small tab keys on there
makes<00:02:20.060> them<00:02:20.269> sent<00:02:20.480> especially<00:02:20.810> when<00:02:20.930> you're

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
makes them sent especially when you're

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.210 
makes them sent especially when you're
filling<00:02:21.230> out<00:02:21.409> a<00:02:21.439> form<00:02:21.500> in<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.980> end<00:02:22.099> then

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
filling out a form in the end then

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.949 
filling out a form in the end then
you're<00:02:22.340> always<00:02:22.579> using<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.879> tab<00:02:23.090> key<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.480> no

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
you're always using the tab key and no

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.929 
you're always using the tab key and no
one<00:02:24.349> is<00:02:24.560> going<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:25.340> use<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.670> caps

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
one is going to use the caps

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.839 
one is going to use the caps
lock<00:02:26.209> key<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.470> mean<00:02:27.829> that's<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.670> that's

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
lock key so I mean that's it that's

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.759 
lock key so I mean that's it that's
always<00:02:29.299> a<00:02:29.329> kind<00:02:29.599> of<00:02:29.720> epic<00:02:29.989> fail<00:02:30.230> when<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.560> comes

n270 so 945 geez do you see I'm chipset
pretty<00:03:25.250> much<00:03:25.459> as<00:03:25.579> with<00:03:25.699> the<00:03:26.599> hardware

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
pretty much as with the hardware

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.730 
pretty much as with the hardware
platform<00:03:27.590> oh<00:03:27.739> wow

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
platform oh wow

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.030 
platform oh wow
there<00:03:29.400> we<00:03:29.580> go<00:03:29.840> we<00:03:30.840> just<00:03:30.870> got<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.380> specs<00:03:31.650> over

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
there we go we just got the specs over

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.620 
there we go we just got the specs over
here<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:33.150> that's<00:03:33.960> an<00:03:34.080> SST<00:03:34.440> device<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.670> it

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
here so that's an SST device and it

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.580 
here so that's an SST device and it
comes<00:03:36.810> with<00:03:36.930> 512mb<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:38.040> ram<00:03:38.520> and<00:03:38.790> it's<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.810> 10.1

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
comes with 512mb of ram and it's a 10.1

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.880 
comes with 512mb of ram and it's a 10.1
inch<00:03:41.010> screen<00:03:41.570> so<00:03:42.570> we<00:03:42.600> might<00:03:42.960> end<00:03:43.350> up<00:03:43.650> with<00:03:43.860> a

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
inch screen so we might end up with a

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.380 
inch screen so we might end up with a
resolution<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.520> 1024<00:03:45.240> by<00:03:45.390> 576

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
resolution of 1024 by 576

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.520 

well<00:03:49.170> all<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.680> can<00:03:49.830> say<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:51.590> wow<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:53.160> looks<00:03:53.220> cool

with the anonymous network it's really

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.819 
with the anonymous network it's really
really<00:04:02.790> pretty
