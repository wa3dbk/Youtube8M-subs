I<00:00:10.940> want<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.030> show<00:00:12.180> you<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.539> mega<00:00:12.780> math<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
I want to show you the mega math the

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.169 
I want to show you the mega math the
mega<00:00:13.469> math<00:00:13.709> is<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.010> pioneer<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.790> new

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
mega math is the pioneer of a new

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.060 
mega math is the pioneer of a new
technology<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:16.110> call<00:00:16.349> it<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.650> three

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
technology we call it the three

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.179 
technology we call it the three
dimensional<00:00:17.790> technology<00:00:18.830> because<00:00:19.830> as<00:00:20.070> you

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
dimensional technology because as you

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.390 
dimensional technology because as you
see<00:00:20.750> there<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.779> not<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> two

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
see there is not like in the two

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.490 
see there is not like in the two
dimensional<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> regular<00:00:24.630> two<00:00:25.050> dimensional

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
dimensional the regular two dimensional

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.169 
dimensional the regular two dimensional
technology<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.400> self-inflating<00:00:26.820> nets

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
technology with self-inflating nets

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.030 
technology with self-inflating nets
there<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.900> no<00:00:28.699> edges<00:00:29.699> which<00:00:30.029> sloped<00:00:30.480> down<00:00:31.040> it's

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
there is no edges which sloped down it's

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.450 
there is no edges which sloped down it's
all<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:33.470> horizontal<00:00:34.470> surface<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.339> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
all one horizontal surface so it's a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.420 
all one horizontal surface so it's a
much<00:00:35.730> larger<00:00:36.480> usable<00:00:37.050> surface<00:00:37.589> basically

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
much larger usable surface basically

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.420 
much larger usable surface basically
it's<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.820> your<00:00:39.330> home<00:00:39.570> mat<00:00:39.780> mattress<00:00:40.430> brought

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it's like your home mat mattress brought

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.630 
it's like your home mat mattress brought
to<00:00:41.729> the<00:00:41.850> outdoors<00:00:42.269> right<00:00:43.040> that's<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.400> let

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
to the outdoors right that's it so let

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.579 
to the outdoors right that's it so let
me<00:00:44.670> show<00:00:44.790> you<00:00:44.970> now<00:00:45.150> how<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:46.010> inflate<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:48.589> the

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
me show you now how to inflate it the

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.460 
me show you now how to inflate it the
first<00:00:49.860> time<00:00:50.159> you<00:00:51.119> pull<00:00:51.330> out<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.629> net<00:00:51.839> which<00:00:52.320> I

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
first time you pull out the net which I

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.869 
first time you pull out the net which I
do<00:00:52.530> now<00:00:54.890> it<00:00:55.890> really<00:00:56.190> might<00:00:57.059> take<00:00:57.299> a<00:00:57.330> while<00:00:58.879> but

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
do now it really might take a while but

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.299 
do now it really might take a while but
that's<00:01:00.059> because<00:01:00.540> it<00:01:00.750> was<00:01:00.930> shipped<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:01.890> in

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that's because it was shipped in the in

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.690 
that's because it was shipped in the in
the<00:01:03.119> it<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.199> shipped<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.619> six<00:01:04.830> weeks<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.489> was

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the it was shipped for six weeks it was

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.120 
the it was shipped for six weeks it was
laying<00:01:06.030> with<00:01:06.630> distributor<00:01:07.380> maybe<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.619> week<00:01:07.860> two

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
laying with distributor maybe a week two

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.580 
laying with distributor maybe a week two
weeks<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.520> retailer<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.900> initial

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
weeks at the retailer so the initial

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.520 
weeks at the retailer so the initial
form<00:01:10.859> needs<00:01:11.579> quite<00:01:11.969> some<00:01:12.119> time<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.450> grow<00:01:13.170> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
form needs quite some time to grow so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.649 
form needs quite some time to grow so
just<00:01:13.920> let<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.250> sit<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.490> 24<00:01:15.030> hours<00:01:15.450> however

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
just let it sit for 24 hours however

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.080 
just let it sit for 24 hours however
just<00:01:16.619> putting<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.039> the<00:01:17.250> inflation<00:01:17.880> valve

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
just putting up the inflation valve

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.060 
just putting up the inflation valve
there<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.539> an<00:01:18.689> inflation<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.229> deflation<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.890> as

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
there is an inflation or deflation up as

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.739 
there is an inflation or deflation up as
you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.399> and<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> inflation<00:01:21.390> valve<00:01:21.420> has

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749 
you can see and the inflation valve has

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:24.679 
you can see and the inflation valve has
a<00:01:21.780> tab<00:01:22.109> pretty<00:01:22.859> easy<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.340> identify<00:01:23.509> just<00:01:24.509> pull

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
a tab pretty easy to identify just pull

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.440 
a tab pretty easy to identify just pull
it<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.929> you<00:01:25.799> immediately<00:01:26.039> hear<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> second

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
it and you immediately hear the second

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.190 
it and you immediately hear the second
sound<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.229> air<00:01:29.149> that's<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.359> foam<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.899> there

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
sound of air that's the foam in there

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
sound of air that's the foam in there
that<00:01:31.920> grows<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:34.759> until<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:35.909> really

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that grows now and until it's really

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.969 
that grows now and until it's really
completely<00:01:37.049> full<00:01:37.850> at<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.770> show

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
completely full at the and I will show

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.429 
completely full at the and I will show
you<00:01:41.039> now<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.030> already<00:01:42.319> inflated<00:01:45.439> we

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you now when it's already inflated we

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.090 
you now when it's already inflated we
have<00:01:46.710> integrated<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.719> little<00:01:48.719> mini<00:01:48.929> pump<00:01:49.259> so

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
have integrated a little mini pump so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.399 
have integrated a little mini pump so
you<00:01:50.789> are<00:01:50.939> able<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.689> almost<00:01:54.079> totally<00:01:55.079> fully

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
you are able to almost totally fully

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.709 
you are able to almost totally fully
inflate<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.490> over<00:01:56.850> inflate<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.389> fully

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
inflate not over inflate but fully

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.559 
inflate not over inflate but fully
inflate<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> mat<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.609> able<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.030> adjust<00:02:00.119> it

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
inflate the mat to be able to adjust it

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.749 
inflate the mat to be able to adjust it
to<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:01.109> Anatomy<00:02:01.499> let<00:02:02.130> me<00:02:02.219> show<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.459> that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
to your Anatomy let me show you that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.590 
to your Anatomy let me show you that
just<00:02:03.170> open<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.549> inflation<00:02:05.549> valve<00:02:05.609> there's<00:02:06.359> no

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
just open the inflation valve there's no

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.389 
just open the inflation valve there's no
nothing<00:02:07.049> no<00:02:07.469> air<00:02:07.649> coming<00:02:07.950> out<00:02:08.190> because

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
nothing no air coming out because

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.240 
nothing no air coming out because
there's<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.819> one-way<00:02:09.209> flap<00:02:09.929> which<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.039> quite

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
there's a one-way flap which is quite

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.500 
there's a one-way flap which is quite
useful<00:02:11.750> just<00:02:12.750> flip<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.050> on

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
useful just flip it on

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.619 
useful just flip it on
and<00:02:18.700> now<00:02:19.700> there<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.150> go<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:21.110> then<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.709> can

and now there you go and then you can
you<00:02:23.629> might<00:02:23.780> grab<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.230> here<00:02:27.280> really<00:02:28.280> inflated

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
you might grab it here really inflated

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.880 
you might grab it here really inflated
strongly<00:02:31.480> put<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.599> out<00:02:33.160> leave<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.310> open<00:02:34.640> like

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.400 
your body you want to adjust it just
right<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.959> your<00:02:48.170> Anatomy<00:02:49.989> which<00:02:50.989> makes<00:02:51.260> it

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
right to your Anatomy which makes it

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.559 
right to your Anatomy which makes it
really<00:02:51.459> economic<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.980> there<00:02:55.359> that's<00:02:56.359> about

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
really economic so there that's about

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.009 
really economic so there that's about
what<00:02:56.859> best<00:02:57.859> for<00:02:58.040> me<00:02:58.239> however<00:02:59.239> think<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.870> it

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
what best for me however think of it

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.229 
what best for me however think of it
when<00:03:00.709> it's<00:03:01.010> really<00:03:01.220> cold<00:03:01.549> it's<00:03:01.790> better<00:03:02.000> to

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
when it's really cold it's better to

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.229 
when it's really cold it's better to
have<00:03:03.170> quite<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.530> firm<00:03:03.829> mat<00:03:04.129> like<00:03:04.849> if<00:03:05.060> you're

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
have quite a firm mat like if you're

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.030 
have quite a firm mat like if you're
sleeping<00:03:05.569> on<00:03:05.750> ice<00:03:06.260> in<00:03:06.530> Greenland<00:03:06.769> or

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
sleeping on ice in Greenland or

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.750 
sleeping on ice in Greenland or
something<00:03:07.430> like<00:03:07.489> that<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:10.220> goes<00:03:10.459> for<00:03:10.730> the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
something like that that goes for the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.170 
something like that that goes for the
inflation<00:03:11.629> part<00:03:12.049> I<00:03:12.260> show<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.500> here<00:03:13.000> that's<00:03:14.000> an

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
inflation part I show you here that's an

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.250 
inflation part I show you here that's an
added<00:03:14.480> feature<00:03:14.660> you<00:03:15.440> can<00:03:15.680> join<00:03:16.010> two<00:03:16.519> mats

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
added feature you can join two mats

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.960 
added feature you can join two mats
there<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.410> this<00:03:19.150> little<00:03:20.150> strap<00:03:20.389> and<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:22.760> really

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
there is this little strap and it really

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.970 
there is this little strap and it really
hinders<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.750> mats<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.319> slip<00:03:24.620> apart

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
hinders the mats to slip apart

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.470 
hinders the mats to slip apart
especially<00:03:25.220> for<00:03:25.700> couples<00:03:25.880> it's<00:03:26.239> really

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
especially for couples it's really

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.830 
especially for couples it's really
useful<00:03:26.870> we<00:03:27.500> call<00:03:27.769> it<00:03:27.919> the<00:03:28.609> marriage<00:03:28.790> gap<00:03:29.239> so

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
useful we call it the marriage gap so

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.520 
useful we call it the marriage gap so
that<00:03:29.870> there's<00:03:30.590> none<00:03:30.829> of<00:03:30.859> it<00:03:31.220> now<00:03:32.139> it<00:03:33.139> really<00:03:33.470> is

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
that there's none of it now it really is

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.059 
that there's none of it now it really is
nice<00:03:33.769> okay<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.810> inflation<00:03:36.530> now<00:03:36.709> I'll<00:03:36.889> show

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
nice okay so the inflation now I'll show

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.110 
nice okay so the inflation now I'll show
you<00:03:37.099> how<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.489> deflate<00:03:38.090> a<00:03:38.120> net<00:03:39.549> it's<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:40.669> two-step

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
you how to deflate a net it's a two-step

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.370 
you how to deflate a net it's a two-step
process<00:03:41.500> first<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:42.650> loosely<00:03:43.430> lay<00:03:44.180> up<00:03:44.389> just

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
process first you loosely lay up just

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.940 
process first you loosely lay up just
roll<00:03:46.099> the<00:03:46.130> map<00:03:46.489> together<00:03:48.250> like<00:03:49.250> this<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:49.849> then

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
roll the map together like this and then

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.370 
roll the map together like this and then
open<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.099> in<00:03:52.400> deflation<00:03:53.000> valve<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.959> deflate

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
open the in deflation valve the deflate

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.839 
open the in deflation valve the deflate
in<00:03:54.680> place<00:03:54.950> new<00:03:55.220> clothes

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.180 

use<00:03:58.849> your<00:03:59.060> body<00:03:59.300> weight<00:03:59.420> it's<00:03:59.840> really<00:04:00.200> the

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
use your body weight it's really the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.559 
use your body weight it's really the
most<00:04:01.430> easy<00:04:01.870> easiest<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:06.620> now<00:04:07.040> I<00:04:07.849> do<00:04:08.209> it<00:04:08.390> the

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
most easy easiest and now I do it the

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.020 
most easy easiest and now I do it the
second<00:04:08.930> time<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:10.190> can<00:04:10.370> leave<00:04:10.580> this<00:04:10.790> open

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
second time you can leave this open

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.839 
second time you can leave this open
because<00:04:11.569> this<00:04:11.780> is<00:04:12.349> a<00:04:12.590> one-way<00:04:13.220> flap<00:04:13.580> that

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
because this is a one-way flap that

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.050 
because this is a one-way flap that
hinders<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.660> air<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:15.140> be<00:04:15.290> sucked<00:04:15.560> back<00:04:16.060> and

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
hinders the air to be sucked back and

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.250 
hinders the air to be sucked back and
now<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.019> can<00:04:18.320> really<00:04:18.650> go<00:04:19.160> very<00:04:19.430> tight<00:04:20.260> tight

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
now you can really go very tight tight

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.330 
now you can really go very tight tight
as<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:21.590> want<00:04:25.840> it's<00:04:26.840> useful<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.199> use<00:04:27.350> both<00:04:28.130> of
