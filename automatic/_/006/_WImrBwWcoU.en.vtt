just<00:03:02.780> this<00:03:02.959> very<00:03:03.230> orange<00:03:03.829> undertone<00:03:04.430> Brown

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
just this very orange undertone Brown

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.059 
just this very orange undertone Brown
it's<00:03:05.060> still<00:03:05.359> a<00:03:05.389> really<00:03:05.780> nice<00:03:05.959> nudey<00:03:06.680> kind<00:03:06.950> of

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
it's still a really nice nudey kind of

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.710 
it's still a really nice nudey kind of
color<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:07.549> definitely<00:03:08.030> has<00:03:08.209> that<00:03:08.239> orange

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
color but definitely has that orange

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.809 
color but definitely has that orange
undertone<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.350> I<00:03:09.650> really<00:03:09.859> like<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:10.579> one<00:03:10.760> I

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
undertone to it I really like this one I

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.160 
undertone to it I really like this one I
feel<00:03:11.030> like<00:03:11.150> it's<00:03:11.329> definitely<00:03:11.480> my<00:03:11.810> kind<00:03:12.019> of

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
feel like it's definitely my kind of

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.949 
feel like it's definitely my kind of
color<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.920> this<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:13.940> just<00:03:14.120> how<00:03:14.269> it<00:03:14.420> swatches

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
color and this is just how it swatches

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.300 
color and this is just how it swatches
you<00:03:15.079> can<00:03:15.230> see<00:03:15.350> it's<00:03:15.500> quite<00:03:15.709> similar<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.130> the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
you can see it's quite similar to the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.250 
you can see it's quite similar to the
first<00:03:16.549> one<00:03:16.760> just<00:03:16.790> slightly<00:03:17.209> more<00:03:17.359> orange<00:03:17.959> to

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
first one just slightly more orange to

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.580 
first one just slightly more orange to
it

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
it

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.949 
it
this<00:03:19.160> one<00:03:19.340> was<00:03:19.489> number<00:03:19.670> six<00:03:22.480> so<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.510> applied<00:03:23.930> to

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
this one was number six so I applied to

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.809 
this one was number six so I applied to
this<00:03:24.290> without<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.889> lip<00:03:25.069> balm<00:03:25.190> underneath<00:03:25.609> and

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
this without the lip balm underneath and

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.220 
this without the lip balm underneath and
it's<00:03:25.910> definitely<00:03:26.209> slightly<00:03:26.810> more<00:03:26.989> drying

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
it's definitely slightly more drying

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.800 
it's definitely slightly more drying
it's<00:03:27.530> still<00:03:27.769> not<00:03:27.980> like<00:03:28.400> dry<00:03:28.910> dry<00:03:29.269> but<00:03:29.660> it's

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
it's still not like dry dry but it's

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.690 
it's still not like dry dry but it's
just<00:03:30.139> less<00:03:30.470> comfortable<00:03:30.980> than<00:03:31.280> with<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.549> lip

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
just less comfortable than with the lip

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.430 
just less comfortable than with the lip
balm<00:03:31.849> so<00:03:32.359> I<00:03:32.389> definitely<00:03:32.810> recommend<00:03:33.079> putting

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
balm so I definitely recommend putting

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.500 
balm so I definitely recommend putting
the<00:03:33.560> lip<00:03:33.769> balm<00:03:33.920> underneath<00:03:34.090> kind<00:03:35.090> of<00:03:35.180> dabbing

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
the lip balm underneath kind of dabbing

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.150 
the lip balm underneath kind of dabbing
it<00:03:35.630> off<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.019> then<00:03:36.290> going<00:03:36.650> in<00:03:36.769> with<00:03:36.889> the<00:03:37.010> lip

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
it off and then going in with the lip

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.339 
it off and then going in with the lip
pencils<00:03:37.549> so<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.329> next<00:03:38.569> one<00:03:38.720> here<00:03:38.900> is<00:03:38.930> number

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
pencils so the next one here is number

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.789 
pencils so the next one here is number
eight<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.980> this<00:03:40.190> one<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:40.579> very<00:03:40.910> pale<00:03:41.799> Brown

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
eight and this one is a very pale Brown

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.530 
eight and this one is a very pale Brown
I<00:03:43.130> would<00:03:43.370> say<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:43.760> does<00:03:43.970> have<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.239> slight

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
I would say and it does have a slight

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.360 
I would say and it does have a slight
purple<00:03:45.109> undertone<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:45.859> don't<00:03:46.010> know<00:03:46.250> if

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
purple undertone to it I don't know if

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.039 
purple undertone to it I don't know if
it's<00:03:46.489> just<00:03:46.639> me<00:03:46.910> but<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.120> feel<00:03:47.389> like<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:47.569> kind<00:03:47.930> of

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
it's just me but I feel like I kind of

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:48.800 
it's just me but I feel like I kind of
see

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
see

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.720 
see
be<00:03:48.989> kind<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.349> purple<00:03:49.770> but<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.520> definitely

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
be kind of purple but it is definitely

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.180 
be kind of purple but it is definitely
Brown<00:03:51.120> for<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.420> most<00:03:51.630> part<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:52.260> realized<00:03:53.069> I

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
Brown for the most part I realized I

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.949 
Brown for the most part I realized I
have<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.370> lot<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.670> this<00:03:53.940> annuity<00:03:54.209> colors<00:03:54.660> but<00:03:54.900> I

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
have a lot of this annuity colors but I

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.449 
have a lot of this annuity colors but I
guess<00:03:55.140> I<00:03:55.260> just<00:03:55.410> really<00:03:55.709> like<00:03:55.890> matte<00:03:56.220> lip

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
guess I just really like matte lip

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.309 
guess I just really like matte lip
pencils<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.120> nude<00:03:57.390> I<00:03:57.690> feel<00:03:58.080> like<00:03:58.170> they're

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
pencils and nude I feel like they're

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.110 
pencils and nude I feel like they're
really<00:03:58.440> versatile<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.430> who<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.640> love<00:03:59.819> and<00:03:59.970> met

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
really versatile and who to love and met

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.750 
really versatile and who to love and met
nude<00:04:00.560> so<00:04:01.560> that's<00:04:01.739> how<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:01.950> one<00:04:02.190> swatches

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
nude so that's how that one swatches

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.370 
nude so that's how that one swatches
right<00:04:02.970> there<00:04:03.270> it's<00:04:03.510> still<00:04:03.810> in<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.050> brown

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
right there it's still in the brown

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.229 
right there it's still in the brown
category<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.069> would<00:04:05.220> stay<00:04:05.489> but<00:04:05.519> it<00:04:05.790> does<00:04:06.000> have

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
category I would stay but it does have

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.380 
category I would stay but it does have
slight<00:04:06.599> purple<00:04:07.230> grayish<00:04:07.650> undertones<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:09.239> this

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
slight purple grayish undertones so this

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.620 
slight purple grayish undertones so this
one<00:04:09.569> was<00:04:09.720> number<00:04:09.989> eight<00:04:11.420> except<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.510> have

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
one was number eight except I have

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.300 
one was number eight except I have
number<00:04:12.840> sixteen<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.470> this<00:04:13.620> one<00:04:13.800> is<00:04:13.920> more<00:04:14.130> of<00:04:14.160> a

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
number sixteen and this one is more of a

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.759 
number sixteen and this one is more of a
coral<00:04:14.580> undertone<00:04:15.330> pink<00:04:15.780> finds<00:04:16.260> me<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.470> lot<00:04:16.650> of

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
coral undertone pink finds me a lot of

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.069 
coral undertone pink finds me a lot of
summer<00:04:17.070> spread<00:04:17.669> kind<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.120> thing<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.540> is<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> pink

but it definitely has like orange
undertones<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.359> it<00:04:21.479> so<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.139> can<00:04:22.320> see<00:04:22.530> right

really<00:06:39.320> affordable<00:06:39.680> in<00:06:39.980> the<00:06:40.070> nude<00:06:40.280> shades<00:06:40.490> are

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
really affordable in the nude shades are

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.520 
really affordable in the nude shades are
really<00:06:41.090> nice<00:06:41.240> and<00:06:41.480> this<00:06:41.690> purple<00:06:42.080> one<00:06:42.110> as<00:06:42.320> well

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
really nice and this purple one as well

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.110 
really nice and this purple one as well
so<00:06:42.770> basically<00:06:43.100> these<00:06:43.340> five<00:06:43.580> are<00:06:43.760> really<00:06:43.970> nice

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.850 
so basically these five are really nice
except<00:06:44.600> for<00:06:44.780> the<00:06:44.840> orange<00:06:45.140> I<00:06:45.290> would<00:06:45.440> recommend

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
except for the orange I would recommend

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.200 
except for the orange I would recommend
you<00:06:45.920> stay<00:06:46.130> away<00:06:46.340> from<00:06:46.400> the<00:06:46.610> brighter<00:06:46.880> shades

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
you stay away from the brighter shades

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.220 
you stay away from the brighter shades
because<00:06:47.510> those<00:06:47.690> tend<00:06:48.050> to<00:06:48.110> be<00:06:48.200> more<00:06:48.850> separating

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230 
because those tend to be more separating

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.040 
because those tend to be more separating
actually<00:06:51.230> I<00:06:52.480> don't<00:06:53.480> know<00:06:53.720> if<00:06:53.810> you've<00:06:53.930> been

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
actually I don't know if you've been

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.690 
actually I don't know if you've been
shopping<00:06:54.260> them<00:06:54.650> because<00:06:55.010> looking<00:06:55.340> at<00:06:55.460> it<00:06:55.580> now

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
shopping them because looking at it now

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.880 
shopping them because looking at it now
it<00:06:55.940> doesn't<00:06:56.120> look<00:06:56.270> like<00:06:56.660> even<00:06:57.500> one<00:06:57.650> of<00:06:57.680> those

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:57.890 
it doesn't look like even one of those

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.590 
it doesn't look like even one of those
fat<00:06:58.160> shopping<00:06:58.580> nuts<00:06:58.700> would<00:06:58.820> fit<00:06:59.030> on<00:06:59.150> it<00:06:59.300> so<00:06:59.570> I

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600 
fat shopping nuts would fit on it so I

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.220 
fat shopping nuts would fit on it so I
don't<00:06:59.870> know<00:07:01.120> yeah<00:07:02.120> actually<00:07:02.450> I<00:07:02.630> do<00:07:02.750> think<00:07:02.870> of

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.230 
don't know yeah actually I do think of

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.670 
don't know yeah actually I do think of
that<00:07:03.440> can<00:07:03.740> you<00:07:03.860> sharpen<00:07:04.160> them<00:07:04.190> I<00:07:05.320> think<00:07:06.320> maybe

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
that can you sharpen them I think maybe

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.040 
that can you sharpen them I think maybe
you<00:07:06.830> could<00:07:07.010> use<00:07:07.190> one<00:07:07.370> of<00:07:07.400> those<00:07:07.580> NYX<00:07:07.970> jumbo<00:07:08.210> eye

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
you could use one of those NYX jumbo eye

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.570 
you could use one of those NYX jumbo eye
pencil<00:07:09.080> sharpeners<00:07:09.920> and<00:07:09.950> maybe<00:07:10.220> that<00:07:10.430> would

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
pencil sharpeners and maybe that would

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.890 
pencil sharpeners and maybe that would
work<00:07:10.610> but<00:07:11.090> I<00:07:11.270> don't<00:07:11.420> even<00:07:11.510> know<00:07:11.690> if<00:07:11.780> this

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:11.900 
work but I don't even know if this

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.900 
work but I don't even know if this
product<00:07:12.230> inside<00:07:12.710> that<00:07:13.010> it<00:07:13.340> might<00:07:13.520> just<00:07:13.730> be

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910 
product inside that it might just be

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.320 
product inside that it might just be
like<00:07:14.060> that<00:07:14.420> tiny<00:07:14.720> tip<00:07:15.020> in<00:07:15.260> that<00:07:15.860> case<00:07:16.330> there's
