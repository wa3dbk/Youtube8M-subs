 exactly the essencis being established 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.380
 in fact is that although despite 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.820
 two weeks to be enough is just the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.309
 I start the delegate the two weeks is a 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.950
 too little time for the guy to 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.780
 establishing a new city and people 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.000
 currently in the apartment of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.039
 my sister because we can not 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.770
 There's a space in my room because you're there. 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.000
 full of stuff there that already takes to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.469
 explain to you people why not 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.559
 is having the video in the last three days 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.230
 and or more days here I also I'm me 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.820
 readapting to Brazil, she knows that I 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.629
 I 'm back from travel now, I'm in port. 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.369
 joyful 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.310
 takes a while to stabilize until the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.470
 May not short is very different, huh? 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.510
 seeing the whole change I already had 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.090
 more or less in the room ready there already 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.159
 Where to sleep where to eat? 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.369
 my physiological needs 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.170
 but even so I brought many 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.820
 equipment with me now I do not have 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.500
 but just a video game I have three 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.909
 video games and there are many more cables I 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.820
 I have more tripods I have more 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.200
 microphones but headphones and so I had 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.720
 to change my table 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.030
 that same one that you know there I am 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.619
 waiting to come to the new table also has the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.479
 fact that I did not have an illumination 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.729
 very good in my room there a destination 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.950
 very dark environment in which I can not 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.640
 can not work right 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.500
 Off the internet is bullshit o 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.310
 money is already on his new account 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.200
 You'll soon see a video. 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.520
 each of them and unfortunately he 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.649
 got the best internet possible 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.259
 here in porto alegre almost the best 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.869
 possible almost half time so the best 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.610
 theoretically would be 150 né 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.740
 but it's not available it's here too 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.069
 not available being mega 50 then 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.250
 We got the two of us. 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.040
 50 mega of his own and promised 50 mega 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.830
 are 50 mega-bits of download and 5 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.930
 megapixels cloud what is half of what 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.769
 I had in Ireland but it is already 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.650
 thing 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.110
 Brazil is Brazil of something in the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.580
 Brazil has dropped 5 mega of cloud in Brazil already 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.049
 is a reality if perhaps the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.299
 quality of life in Brazil was half 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.190
 from ireland dating too 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.709
 so it's more or less explained to 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.390
 you because I've been so absent in the 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.400
 in recent days the channel also generates 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.870
 can explain the same way not if 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.709
 worry the channel did not die the way 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.870
 some will come back with all the best when 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.610
 you come or sit full second 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.260
 Nanny dude, it's going to look really cool, I love it. 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.299
 you will see a live stream scenario 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.060
 everything else an hour but the subject who 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.989
 He said it was just to enjoy it, to get it. 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.160
 the tram 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.459
 Because we really want to talk. 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.650
 on gta 5 European pc to be 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:08.290
 Thank you for circulating bc left four 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.709
 xbox live but also for those who are not 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.290
 Knowing staff yesterday at e3 was given to 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.750
 news that gt is so it will be 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.900
 released and best released for pc 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.269
 and playstation 4 and xbox when she had 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.400
 a business to relaunch a 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.889
 game is the most celebrated game in 3 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.350
 yes it is a needle most celebrated in 3 and 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:33.700
 I bet I can not even that they do not 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.500
 liked sgarbi so I'm is what 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.440
 The crowd was over, the guard had not 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.750
 how to stay as though I said it 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.850
 about gta5 time and I considered that this 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.040
 and 3 was crap for it was much better 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.690
 who perceives the highlight in the past was 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.000
 the new consoles but until then had not 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.880
 game not now not now was three ago 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.769
 Spanish games or again to you 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.260
 My channel is not the best place to 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.780
 You follow up on it and 13 on multiple channels 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.390
 making much better coverage 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.940
 I do not really care 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.890
 so much to see live I'm content 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.660
 enough to see things more calmly 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.930
 Late but any way we wanted 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.000
 comment a little about what you had in e3 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.890
 main thing for me gta5 no bc you 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.340
 he had no personal idea of ​​the difference 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.540
 will do also did 14 xbox can see 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.700
 by the trailer 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.480
 see this image here I see this 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.730
 comparative image between the gta 5 of the 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.740
 consoles of last generation and current 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.600
 Look at the difference on this simple hill that 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.200
 You see, you already have a whore. 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.150
 difference is much heavier and seems 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.730
 difference the macro but not take 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.870
 fill in fill in a board you go 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.780
 see that the bush will move 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.940
 it's probably the amount of cars 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.320
 look at the scene that looks that scene looks at 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.330
 number of cars 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.580
 also looks at the number of pedestrians 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.400
 that appears in this other scene my movie 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.900
 Imagine that cool is online and you 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.810
 get a car and this car does not 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.000
 repeat for half an hour online that the 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.730
 different are connected is a literate 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.979
 gt online she stops there from cars 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.200
 repeating had a car saw all yes 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.740
 but most likely will not have it 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.450
 now in the new generation because it 's got a lot 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.860
 The more personal memory the game has 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.560
 more memory much more power 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.330
 processing on the newer consoles and 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.280
 that's why it will also be very 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.280
 more to lose is pedestrians and cars 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.110
 yes there is even an option in gta 4 6th 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.120
 resembles density of chaos 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.680
 I did not know that. There's an option in 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.720
 If I'm not mistaken, I do not 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.390
 I know if pedestrians of cars have to 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.210
 see now everything controls the quantity 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.250
 of calcium will have on the street dish power 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.720
 to pick up the third level of 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:46.500
 public to são paulo and são pedro do butiá 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.780
 Even São Paulo is at night and we hope that 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.940
 they make a good fort was yes because 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:56.250
 to 4 was not missed 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.830
 lauro lar o gta 4 was very bad 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.050
 used to beat bad even pcs 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.120
 stops of the season could not run the 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.250
 game at most but i trust rockstar 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.410
 because I think they learn 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.510
 with the mistakes and this we only talk about 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.540
 graphics né 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.880
 the place imagines the carmody molds in the 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.990
 pp won at all times following the 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:21.260
 templates for gta5 they modify via pen 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.790
 driver is an ok go try to unlock it 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.600
 It's no mistake, I have to 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.610
 unlocked or saved mistake I do not know anymore 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.850
 imagine the amount of real estate that goes 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.830
 do the pc do not know if you know the 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.480
 as they do shopping for gta 4 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:41.810
 they put all john moment verb one 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:45.200
 predator harry potter old of all till 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.180
 aa analysis is of the shopping mall and civil 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.400
 furniture and do not want to get put elisa 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.630
 of low interest they made a gps map 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.110
 54 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.610
 that alone is enough look we are 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.770
 fast for us is how we 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.270
 to perceive and with other games is also 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.920
