00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.360
 hey and welcome like this one 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.509
 answer extremely and welcome back 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.980
 to a new video and today there are 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.699
 again something special as it almost 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.900
 It is always a package with us 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.210
 received and in the package is what 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.320
 very special in it and you do that 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.580
 Now it's time to open up 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.949
 would we actually know what 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.660
 he is at least nationalist and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.110
 techno are you not playing what i am 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.450
 want 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.020
 So I also find funny that we 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.420
 have a day 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.270
 We have a few videos in Switzerland 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.320
 turned and wise a colleague was that 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.100
 areal in the comment 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.239
 why did the other one stop tremendously ? 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.590
 task simply old has stopped because 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.800
 I do not mind that Switzerland from 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.800
 starting at extreme leave of course 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.059
 own thinks about guys okay so so 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.600
 what is in there well 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.559
 okay it's two rolls two roll what 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.689
 does that mean 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:14.310
 wow 361 a and 361 bvv and bonus still 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.020
 get a bonus so it acts 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.080
 of course, playmaker 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.030
 missing exactly here the game types once 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.900
 the matschbahn strache 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.119
 that's even very short now 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.860
 we call enough but many thanks 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.770
 again to marcel us the mats 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.720
 he has done enough 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.420
 No, I just have a bad 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.909
 meet as a war so get 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.479
 here and there the galaxy snake 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.740
 she also gets pretty in the format 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.170
 Often I believe to be played in the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.390
 violent because receiver david 2 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.610
 can you join in a lot? 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.860
 for example, crisis plans or something 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.450
 seven are exactly what works 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.490
 very good and then again the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.000
 priestly sunday rollout of 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.730
 Kinopolis just for you for yours 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.729
 I plugged hire but do so gladly 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.010
 children of mine noticed that and 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.840
 the galactic overlord costs that 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.490
 on the priestly seal of 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.020
 Superiority is the one who sees it 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.570
 just completely horny from okay okay 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.370
 then by much to this cool cards 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.440
 how we do it here now 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:33.520
 these two packages on and so again 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.100
 Shortly to the story of Marcel got us on 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.030
 Skype wrote us if he does not want us 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.150
 custom playmates may create and says 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.830
 Clearly and then he gave us some design 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.840
 and we were allowed to choose what we 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.209
 So canceled we asked 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.940
 what we want on it and so and so 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.600
 that's the way I think the six 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.200
 samurai made a game and a perfect 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.810
 had a game 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.640
 that is for me and the sexual morality that 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:07.360
 is this camera 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.920
 Ok, so keep wow cool old what 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.420
 says he still agrees with the hack 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.870
 you should still about it 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.160
 axxo the around 6 samurai everything was up 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.530
 In any case, the debate is the one 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.060
 supple and then you have to stop them 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.340
 still a bit annoying will be 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.530
 stabilize nicely and here below may 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.030
 one does not isolate the cool on boxing 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.290
 extreme logo still had on it 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.510
 So that are now even properly 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.670
 cool and here also these tombstones 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.590
 down here i believe the man titles 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.600
 turned that supple yes to everyone 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.390
 pretty cool out with i think so 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.310
 that kita at the ski saw one of the 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.310
 two ski his tee for a quick 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.530
 my shadow that you see better 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.239
 I do not remember how I got one 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.140
 even in my table folder somewhere 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.140
 that's why 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:05.950
 besides , the micro seems to be bought 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:08.190
 monster know i am a human of 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.190
 subject 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:18.310
 but I had that every few days 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:21.130
 even thinner than the school itself 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.410
 game included extruded and 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.750
 the cool thing is you can also join us 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.300
 he will order things so he will order 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.070
 you also in the design create so me 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.900
 will his youtube link below in 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.460
 grab the description and find it 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.140
 you then also information for example 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.580
 for a price and then take a look at each one 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.820
 fall over there if you are 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.090
 wanted to buy a caste game then ok 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:05:00.190
 the second is also right 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:05:04.390
 cool is then for me also holds very 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:13.990
 well we actually catch we catch 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:16.720
 but we really do not catch one 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.890
 really fat who look at this 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.410
 So people so I think he sees 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.660
 right hammer out here you have the 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:31.210
 commanders then the background of 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:35.890
 neg rovelli just like that and here 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.570
 over there the clairvoyant and it sees 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.000
 just really cool so really 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.040
 thanks again to marcel mimicking 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.640
 works great and down here 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.760
 again the unboxing extreme logo so with 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.730
 the julihoch revolves around somehow 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.790
 We must be fast format 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.560
 I think that's a bit different 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.900
 that bit longer and have that 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.440
 In any case, anyway 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:06.350
 three villas are wonderfully wonderful 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.290
 So are many thanks super super work 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:13.490
 I like it very much 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:15.500
 so if you have your own 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.440
 wanted to print and a description like 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.000
 said okay until the next unboxing 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.560
 then comes right to the new 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.560
 play is a job
