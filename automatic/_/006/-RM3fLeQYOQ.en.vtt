00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
happened he took four instead of five

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.950 
happened he took four instead of five
therefore<00:00:53.610> he<00:00:53.670> didn't<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.059> does<00:00:54.270> establish<00:00:54.480> to

that<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.060> call<00:01:06.270> stride<00:01:06.600> relation<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.770> we're

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that I call stride relation what we're

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.260 
that I call stride relation what we're
really<00:01:08.010> trying<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.760> our<00:01:08.880> riders

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
really trying to do is that our riders

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.020 
really trying to do is that our riders
to<00:01:09.450> feel<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.110> step<00:01:10.439> underneath<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.850> like

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
to feel the step underneath if you like

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.719 
to feel the step underneath if you like
they've<00:01:12.270> got<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.780> react<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> horse

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
they've got to react to what the horse

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640 
they've got to react to what the horse
and<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.939> ponies<00:01:15.299> are<00:01:15.450> doing<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:16.290> they're<00:01:16.530> not

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
and the ponies are doing if they're not

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.410 
and the ponies are doing if they're not
feeling<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.460> stripe<00:01:17.820> pattern<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.270> they're

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
feeling that stripe pattern if they're

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.070 
feeling that stripe pattern if they're
not<00:01:18.540> feeling<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:20.100> step<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.729> their<00:01:21.210> horse<00:01:21.479> is

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
not feeling the step that their horse is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080 
not feeling the step that their horse is
taking<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:22.740> very<00:01:22.950> difficult<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.549> them<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
taking it's very difficult for them to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.080 
taking it's very difficult for them to
make<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.540> link<00:01:24.810> by<00:01:25.740> doing<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.100> they're

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
make that link by doing that they're

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.600 
make that link by doing that they're
able<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.420> straight<00:01:27.600> away<00:01:28.590> feel<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.310> stride

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
able to straight away feel the stride

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.520 
able to straight away feel the stride
feel<00:01:30.360> what's<00:01:30.600> happening<00:01:30.659> underneath<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.470> be

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
feel what's happening underneath and be

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.140 
feel what's happening underneath and be
able<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.680> erect<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.159> reacting<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> right<00:01:32.880> way

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
able to erect it reacting the right way

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.960 
able to erect it reacting the right way
but<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:34.110> importantly<00:01:34.860> they're<00:01:35.369> able<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
but more importantly they're able to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.899 
but more importantly they're able to
start<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.479> do<00:01:37.079> something<00:01:37.470> about<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.850> even<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
start to do something about it even the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.730 
start to do something about it even the
lengthening<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.960> shortening<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.650> we

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
lengthening and the shortening that we

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.060 
lengthening and the shortening that we
saw<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.520> there<00:01:42.680> when<00:01:43.680> you're<00:01:43.829> doing

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
saw going on there when you're doing

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.950 
saw going on there when you're doing
that<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> rider<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.119> orders<00:01:45.420> them<00:01:45.689> gives<00:01:45.899> you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that as a rider it orders them gives you

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960 
that as a rider it orders them gives you
a<00:01:46.020> lot<00:01:46.170> more<00:01:46.229> confidence<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.640> only<00:01:47.670> do

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
a lot more confidence then not only do

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.039 
a lot more confidence then not only do
you<00:01:48.030> know<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.479> you're<00:01:48.659> trying<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.960> achieve

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you know what you're trying to achieve

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.830 
you know what you're trying to achieve
we<00:01:49.860> know<00:01:50.070> how<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> go<00:01:50.850> about<00:01:50.880> doing<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
we know how to go about doing it and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.230 
we know how to go about doing it and
again<00:01:52.409> all<00:01:52.710> these<00:01:53.009> type<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.310> exercises<00:01:53.820> are

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
again all these type of exercises are

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.660 
again all these type of exercises are
empowering<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.350> riders<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
control but also to be able to hit the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.490 
control but also to be able to hit the
targets<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.090> they're<00:02:00.240> aiming<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.020> that
