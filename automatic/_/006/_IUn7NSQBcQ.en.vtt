00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:04.330
 So we 're doing the video here. 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.859
 to give a force to those who buy a 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.500
 of these barracks 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.670
 photo ap for two people or five 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.240
 people 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.250
 it is an interesting step to the beginning 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.730
 it's when you open it first time 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.679
 so you are amazed because 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:30.339
 it really takes time to set up a tent 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:33.040
 here I am rafael but to dismount 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.470
 I've never seen a person succeed so it 's 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.860
 unfortunate video to give a force 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.190
 it comes with an instruction manual 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.910
 then this manual here is done with 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.130
 he 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.960
 Who is not this so he will serve 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:54.600
 For you you can use it to fall higher. 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:59.250
 use it to stay there as you 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.250
 this monte carlo 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.490
 Tokyo 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.270
 us this is it for those who are leaving 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.270
 of a tip how to mount this news
