00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello everyone with you vlad next is this 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.349
 and today we have 4 podcasts and this podcast 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.599
 in honor of the new year we have long thought that 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.809
 give you a new year so that 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.949
 it would be nice for everyone that we have 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.880
 competition and have already been 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.320
 it won't be boring uninteresting and 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.300
 finally we did come up with 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.160
 we asked a lot of people 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.250
 Trial subscribers 2 season so here 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.579
 if this video is 15,000 likes it 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.739
 we will test you the subscribers well 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.899
 how would these huskies show us what 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.850
 a lot of people want to get on these 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.940
 tests that we see for a reason 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.090
 because it's so very difficult there 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.309
 it seems like something simple 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.219
 built a map and everything but agree 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.860
 with people find these people 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.199
 our gladiators then this well it entered into 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.180
 overall it is very difficult so that 15,000 likes 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.280
 and we will immediately start building a map 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.890
 Like set is not limited. 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.210
 they can dial as many as they want 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.860
 Only 15 thousand will be typed and let's start 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.159
 Well, if these 15 thousand will not be typed 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.799
 mean few people need to be tested 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.369
 subscribers, too, and we do not make sense 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.909
 card but for those who do not know what is 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.720
 test subscribers and leave a link in 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.070

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.909
