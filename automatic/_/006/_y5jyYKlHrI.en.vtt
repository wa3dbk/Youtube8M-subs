but<00:02:09.080> if<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:09.229> don't<00:02:09.410> have<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.830> stopwatch

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
but if you don't have that a stopwatch

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.480 
but if you don't have that a stopwatch
works<00:02:10.820> fine<00:02:11.350> now<00:02:12.350> I'm<00:02:12.470> simply<00:02:12.770> listening<00:02:13.340> to

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
works fine now I'm simply listening to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.490 
works fine now I'm simply listening to
fat<00:02:13.940> killer<00:02:14.240> as<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.570> do<00:02:14.630> this<00:02:14.930> demonstration

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
fat killer as I do this demonstration

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.380 
fat killer as I do this demonstration
but<00:02:15.860> as<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.190> go<00:02:16.340> through<00:02:16.670> these<00:02:16.880> sections

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
but as I go through these sections

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.240 
but as I go through these sections
you'll<00:02:17.570> be<00:02:17.690> able<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.900> understand<00:02:18.410> how<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:18.980> do

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
you'll be able to understand how to do

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.130 
you'll be able to understand how to do
interval<00:02:19.730> cardio<00:02:19.910> on<00:02:20.270> your<00:02:20.450> own<00:02:20.600> even<00:02:20.960> if<00:02:21.050> you

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
interval cardio on your own even if you

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.920 
interval cardio on your own even if you
don't<00:02:21.410> have<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.860> fat<00:02:22.100> killer<00:02:22.430> program<00:02:23.330> so

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
don't have the fat killer program so

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.440 
don't have the fat killer program so
what<00:02:24.290> you're<00:02:24.440> looking<00:02:24.560> at<00:02:24.860> here<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.310> I'm<00:02:26.030> going

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
what you're looking at here is I'm going

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.530 
what you're looking at here is I'm going
at<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.840> nice<00:02:27.530> easy<00:02:27.860> place<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.330> how<00:02:29.510> I

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
at a nice easy place so this is how I

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.380 
at a nice easy place so this is how I
begin<00:02:29.900> warming<00:02:30.200> up<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.710> go<00:02:31.220> at<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.790> intensity

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
begin warming up I go at the intensity

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.570 
begin warming up I go at the intensity
of<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.870> equivalent<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.770> what<00:02:34.280> would<00:02:34.400> be<00:02:34.550> a

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
of the equivalent of what would be a

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.000 
of the equivalent of what would be a
walk<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:35.480> I'm<00:02:35.810> not<00:02:35.959> walking<00:02:36.230> obviously<00:02:36.890> I'm

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
walk but I'm not walking obviously I'm

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.160 
walk but I'm not walking obviously I'm
on<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> trampoline<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.150> then<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.660> go<00:02:38.870> into<00:02:39.050> a

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
on a trampoline and then I go into a

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.080 
on a trampoline and then I go into a
fast<00:02:39.590> walk<00:02:39.920> which<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:40.430> can<00:02:40.580> see<00:02:40.730> here<00:02:41.000> I'm

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
fast walk which you can see here I'm

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.420 
fast walk which you can see here I'm
just<00:02:41.120> basically<00:02:41.780> bouncing<00:02:42.530> up<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.800> down<00:02:42.920> to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
just basically bouncing up and down to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.100 
just basically bouncing up and down to
the<00:02:43.550> side<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.060> side<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.480> side<00:02:44.660> inside

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
the side to the side to the side inside

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.070 
the side to the side to the side inside
and<00:02:45.410> then<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.160> go<00:02:46.670> into<00:02:47.090> what<00:02:47.330> I<00:02:47.360> consider<00:02:47.450> a

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
and then I go into what I consider a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.290 
and then I go into what I consider a
light<00:02:48.470> jog<00:02:48.860> which<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.430> nice<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.060> easy

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
light jog which is a nice and easy

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.180 
light jog which is a nice and easy
bounce<00:02:50.690> up<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.080> down<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:51.530> one<00:02:51.709> foot<00:02:51.950> forward

bounce up and down with one foot forward
the<00:02:52.400> other<00:02:52.430> foot<00:02:52.730> back<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.180> then<00:02:53.989> I<00:02:54.350> go<00:02:54.709> into<00:02:55.010> a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
the other foot back and then I go into a

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.590 
the other foot back and then I go into a
very<00:02:56.510> fast<00:02:57.410> jog<00:02:58.220> or<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.670> equivalent<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.510> a

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
very fast jog or the equivalent of a

down in a low but position and I'm
simply<00:03:22.310> shuffling<00:03:23.180> my<00:03:23.420> feet<00:03:23.450> as<00:03:24.049> fast<00:03:24.920> as<00:03:25.220> I

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
simply shuffling my feet as fast as I

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.390 
simply shuffling my feet as fast as I
possibly<00:03:25.910> can<00:03:26.209> now<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.320> know<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:27.739> can't<00:03:28.160> tell

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
possibly can now I know you can't tell

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.030 
possibly can now I know you can't tell
from<00:03:28.549> the<00:03:28.670> video<00:03:28.910> but<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.360> is<00:03:29.420> burning<00:03:30.380> my<00:03:30.739> legs

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
from the video but it is burning my legs

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.370 
from the video but it is burning my legs
right<00:03:31.280> now<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:31.910> have<00:03:32.120> no<00:03:32.150> idea<00:03:32.840> how<00:03:32.989> painful

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
right now you have no idea how painful

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.960 
right now you have no idea how painful
that<00:03:33.410> is

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
that is

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.910 
that is
okay<00:03:34.970> then<00:03:35.510> I<00:03:35.600> go<00:03:35.750> back<00:03:36.049> into<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.410> recovery

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
okay then I go back into the recovery

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.300 
okay then I go back into the recovery
mode

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310
