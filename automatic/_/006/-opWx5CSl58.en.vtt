00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.040 

okay<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:44.949> remember<00:04:45.460> now<00:04:46.240> that<00:04:46.270> I<00:04:46.479> resize<00:04:46.839> over

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
okay I remember now that I resize over

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.659 
okay I remember now that I resize over
here<00:04:48.539> slide<00:04:49.539> it<00:04:49.770> off<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.830> tip<00:04:51.309> and<00:04:51.580> let<00:04:52.449> go

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
here slide it off the tip and let go

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:00.230 
here slide it off the tip and let go
pull<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.789> bottom<00:04:55.649> kind<00:04:56.649> of<00:04:56.889> stuck<00:04:57.339> in<00:04:57.639> there

that's<00:05:01.240> a<00:05:01.300> good<00:05:01.419> I<00:05:01.449> think<00:05:01.539> it's<00:05:01.779> a<00:05:01.869> little<00:05:02.110> nod

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
that's a good I think it's a little nod

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.290 
that's a good I think it's a little nod
to<00:05:02.319> that<00:05:02.529> about<00:05:04.349> like<00:05:05.349> that<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:06.699> bounces

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
to that about like that and it bounces

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:19.079 
to that about like that and it bounces
to<00:05:07.629> see<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:14.729> that<00:05:15.729> is<00:05:16.089> how<00:05:16.389> it<00:05:16.749> looks<00:05:17.969> with<00:05:18.969> the

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:19.089 
to see and that is how it looks with the

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.659 
to see and that is how it looks with the
banks<00:05:19.649> we<00:05:20.649> really<00:05:21.009> like<00:05:21.129> it
