00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
have left it's still very expansive but

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.330 
have left it's still very expansive but
it's<00:03:14.850> becoming<00:03:15.240> fragmented<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:17.160> can

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
it's becoming fragmented and you can

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.830 
it's becoming fragmented and you can

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.090 
his child of course we do but yes
certainly<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:34.020> long<00:03:34.380> term<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.830> would<00:03:34.980> be

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
certainly that long term that would be

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.160 
certainly that long term that would be
something<00:03:35.310> we<00:03:35.490> went<00:03:36.270> what<00:03:36.510> age<00:03:36.660> would<00:03:36.870> he<00:03:37.020> be

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
something we went what age would he be

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.440 
something we went what age would he be
thinking<00:03:37.890> about<00:03:38.190> having<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.730> girlfriend<00:03:38.940> well

thinking about having a girlfriend well

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.050 
thinking about having a girlfriend well
as<00:03:39.660> typical<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.410> nature<00:03:40.709> males<00:03:40.980> typically<00:03:41.340> do

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
as typical of nature males typically do

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.120 
as typical of nature males typically do
that<00:03:42.090> much<00:03:42.450> younger<00:03:42.690> at<00:03:43.470> two<00:03:43.680> years<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:44.010> age

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
that much younger at two years of age

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.699 
that much younger at two years of age
for<00:03:44.580> Jaguar<00:03:44.910> two<00:03:45.240> to<00:03:45.360> three<00:03:45.600> females<00:03:46.410> probably

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
for Jaguar two to three females probably

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.580 
for Jaguar two to three females probably
a<00:03:46.740> little<00:03:46.860> bit<00:03:47.010> older<00:03:47.280> than<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.610> but<00:03:48.590> right

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
a little bit older than that but right

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.590 
a little bit older than that but right
now<00:03:49.740> we're<00:03:49.920> just<00:03:49.950> happy<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.240> them<00:03:51.420> and

now we're just happy to have them and

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.880 
now we're just happy to have them and
want<00:03:52.080> them<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.200> get<00:03:52.380> off<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.680> great<00:03:52.800> start

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
want them to get off to a great start

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.160 
want them to get off to a great start
which<00:03:53.250> he<00:03:53.400> has<00:03:53.550> so<00:03:56.209> well<00:03:57.209> only<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.660> snack<00:03:57.930> on

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
which he has so well only to snack on

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.860 
which he has so well only to snack on
perhaps<00:03:58.410> but<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.520> know<00:03:59.610> actually<00:03:59.940> Cougars<00:04:00.330> do

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
perhaps but you know actually Cougars do

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.480 
perhaps but you know actually Cougars do

fall all the way through South America

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.460 
fall all the way through South America
as<00:04:02.820> well<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.150> they<00:04:03.209> actually<00:04:03.630> share<00:04:03.930> much<00:04:04.350> of

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
as well and they actually share much of

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.140 
as well and they actually share much of
the<00:04:04.530> same<00:04:04.709> habitat<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.400> don't<00:04:05.910> seem<00:04:06.060> to

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
the same habitat and don't seem to

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.060 
the same habitat and don't seem to
bother<00:04:06.330> each<00:04:06.600> other<00:04:06.780> too<00:04:07.320> much<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.740> Cougars

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
bother each other too much the Cougars

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.250 
bother each other too much the Cougars
seem<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.370> take<00:04:08.550> different<00:04:09.120> sized<00:04:09.480> prey<00:04:09.900> than
