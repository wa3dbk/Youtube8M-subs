so<00:00:13.290> wouldn't<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.620> be<00:00:13.679> amazing<00:00:14.639> if<00:00:15.150> our<00:00:15.690> phones

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
so wouldn't it be amazing if our phones

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.210 
so wouldn't it be amazing if our phones
could<00:00:16.199> see<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.470> world<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.890> same<00:00:17.070> way<00:00:17.130> that

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
could see the world in the same way that

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.880 
could see the world in the same way that
we<00:00:17.369> do<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:17.820> we're<00:00:18.720> walking<00:00:19.050> around<00:00:19.170> being<00:00:19.710> able

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
we do as we're walking around being able

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.010 
we do as we're walking around being able
to<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.670> point<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> phone<00:00:21.210> at<00:00:21.359> anything<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
to to point the phone at anything and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.929 
to to point the phone at anything and
then<00:00:22.560> haven't<00:00:22.830> actually<00:00:23.070> recognized<00:00:23.519> images

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
then haven't actually recognized images

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.519 
then haven't actually recognized images
and<00:00:24.060> objects<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> human<00:00:25.019> brain<00:00:25.260> and

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
and objects like the human brain and

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.830 
and objects like the human brain and
then<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.430> able<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.730> pull<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.000> information<00:00:27.150> from

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
then be able to pull in information from

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.900 
then be able to pull in information from
an<00:00:27.960> almost<00:00:28.140> infinite<00:00:28.619> library<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.580> knowledge

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
an almost infinite library of knowledge

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.690 
an almost infinite library of knowledge
and<00:00:30.449> experiences<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.140> ideas<00:00:31.700> well

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
and experiences and ideas well

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.889 
and experiences and ideas well
traditionally<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.239> was<00:00:33.360> seen<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.660> science

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
traditionally that was seen as science

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.540 
traditionally that was seen as science
fiction<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.530> now<00:00:34.710> we've<00:00:34.890> moved<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> world

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
fiction but now we've moved to a world

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.180 
fiction but now we've moved to a world
where<00:00:35.730> actually<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.570> has<00:00:36.719> become<00:00:36.960> possible

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
where actually this has become possible

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.799 
where actually this has become possible
so<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.340> best<00:00:38.489> way<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.730> explaining<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
so the best way of explaining it is to

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.270 
so the best way of explaining it is to
just<00:00:39.989> show<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.170> what<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.950> see<00:00:41.100> over<00:00:41.250> here

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
just show it what you can see over here

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.680 
just show it what you can see over here
is<00:00:41.520> tomorrow<00:00:41.700> who's<00:00:42.059> holding<00:00:42.360> my<00:00:42.480> phone

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
is tomorrow who's holding my phone

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 
is tomorrow who's holding my phone
that's<00:00:42.899> now<00:00:43.020> plugged<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.860> let<00:00:44.670> me<00:00:44.760> start

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
that's now plugged in so let me start

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.670 
that's now plugged in so let me start
with<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.300> what<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
with this what we have here is a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.310 
with this what we have here is a
painting<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.430> great<00:00:47.750> poet<00:00:48.750> Robbie<00:00:49.050> Burns

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
painting of the great poet Robbie Burns

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.830 
painting of the great poet Robbie Burns
and<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.489> normal<00:00:50.610> image<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:51.690> we

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and it's just a normal image but if we

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.450 
and it's just a normal image but if we
now<00:00:51.989> switch<00:00:52.050> inputs<00:00:52.770> over<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> phone

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
now switch inputs over to the phone

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.240 
now switch inputs over to the phone
running<00:00:54.390> our<00:00:54.570> technology<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.070> see

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
running our technology you can see

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
running our technology you can see
effectively<00:00:56.850> what<00:00:56.969> tamiya<00:00:57.239> seeing<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
effectively what tamiya seeing on the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.420 
effectively what tamiya seeing on the
screen<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.379> when<00:00:58.530> she<00:00:58.680> points<00:00:59.070> at<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.280> image

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
screen and when she points at this image

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:15.760 
screen and when she points at this image
something<00:01:00.059> magical<00:01:00.449> happens

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.609 

no<00:01:16.430> matter<00:01:16.969> blink<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:17.659> now<00:01:18.259> what's<00:01:18.469> great

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
no matter blink and now what's great

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.889 
no matter blink and now what's great
about<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:19.100> is<00:01:19.340> there's<00:01:19.789> no<00:01:20.060> trickery<00:01:20.719> here

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
about this is there's no trickery here

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.740 
about this is there's no trickery here
there's<00:01:21.530> no<00:01:21.969> there's<00:01:22.969> nothing<00:01:23.149> done<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:23.659> this

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
there's no there's nothing done to this

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.109 
there's no there's nothing done to this
image<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:24.829> what's<00:01:25.009> great<00:01:25.219> about<00:01:25.250> this<00:01:25.579> is<00:01:25.759> the

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
image and what's great about this is the

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.910 
image and what's great about this is the
technology's<00:01:26.990> actually<00:01:27.259> allowing<00:01:27.469> the<00:01:27.710> phone

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
technology's actually allowing the phone

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.160 
technology's actually allowing the phone
to<00:01:28.250> start<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:28.819> see<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:29.179> understand<00:01:29.630> much<00:01:29.929> like

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
to start to see and understand much like

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.649 
to start to see and understand much like
other<00:01:30.350> human<00:01:30.740> brain<00:01:30.920> does<00:01:31.100> not<00:01:32.090> only<00:01:32.360> that<00:01:32.509> but

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
other human brain does not only that but

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.350 
other human brain does not only that but
as<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:32.869> move<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.229> object<00:01:33.500> around<00:01:34.149> it's<00:01:35.149> gonna

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
as I move the object around it's gonna

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.050 
as I move the object around it's gonna
track<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.659> and<00:01:36.459> overlay<00:01:37.459> that<00:01:37.610> content

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
track it and overlay that content

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.169 
track it and overlay that content
seamlessly<00:01:39.700> again<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.850> thing<00:01:41.030> that's

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
seamlessly again the thing that's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:42.699 
seamlessly again the thing that's
incredible<00:01:41.569> about<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:41.990> is<00:01:42.229> this<00:01:42.439> is<00:01:42.590> how

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
incredible about this is this is how

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.559 
incredible about this is this is how
advanced<00:01:43.039> these<00:01:43.280> devices<00:01:43.640> have<00:01:43.729> become<00:01:44.060> all

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
advanced these devices have become all

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.510 
advanced these devices have become all
the<00:01:44.780> processing<00:01:45.409> to<00:01:45.530> do<00:01:45.709> that<00:01:45.920> was<00:01:46.130> actually

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
the processing to do that was actually

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.690 
the processing to do that was actually
done<00:01:46.670> on<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.819> device<00:01:47.060> itself<00:01:48.369> now<00:01:49.369> this<00:01:49.549> is

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
done on the device itself now this is

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.880 
done on the device itself now this is
applications<00:01:50.270> everywhere<00:01:50.649> whether<00:01:51.649> in

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
applications everywhere whether in

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.190 
applications everywhere whether in
things<00:01:52.189> like<00:01:52.310> art<00:01:53.090> museums<00:01:53.689> like<00:01:53.899> you<00:01:54.020> just

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
things like art museums like you just

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.800 
things like art museums like you just
saw<00:01:54.439> or<00:01:54.890> in<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.340> world<00:01:55.520> of<00:01:55.729> say<00:01:56.000> advertising

we go through the talk so what's great
about<00:02:31.069> this<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:31.940> isn't<00:02:32.090> just<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.720> faster

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
about this is it isn't just a faster

in<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.940> real<00:02:35.090> world<00:02:35.329> but<00:02:36.049> there<00:02:36.170> are<00:02:36.200> times

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
in the real world but there are times

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.620 
in the real world but there are times
when<00:02:36.920> actually<00:02:37.400> using<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:37.880> medium<00:02:38.299> allows

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
got to call it a router so that everyone

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.729 
got to call it a router so that everyone
here<00:02:49.639> understands<00:02:50.060> but<00:02:51.049> nonetheless<00:02:51.230> here<00:02:51.650> is

inside<00:06:39.690> of<00:06:39.840> the<00:06:39.900> engine<00:06:40.170> bay<00:06:40.260> of<00:06:40.380> an<00:06:40.470> old<00:06:40.620> car

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
inside of the engine bay of an old car

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.650 
inside of the engine bay of an old car
and<00:06:41.160> tagged<00:06:41.700> up<00:06:41.850> different<00:06:42.120> components

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
and tagged up different components

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.690 
and tagged up different components
within<00:06:42.900> an<00:06:43.020> engine<00:06:43.320> so<00:06:43.650> that<00:06:43.680> if<00:06:44.040> you're<00:06:44.370> stuck

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
within an engine so that if you're stuck

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
within an engine so that if you're stuck
and<00:06:44.730> you<00:06:44.880> want<00:06:45.000> to<00:06:45.060> find<00:06:45.210> out<00:06:45.360> more<00:06:45.480> you<00:06:45.540> can

point and discover the information we're

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.660 
point and discover the information we're
all<00:06:48.990> very<00:06:49.470> very<00:06:49.620> familiar<00:06:49.830> with<00:06:50.220> the<00:06:50.310> Internet

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
in the last 20 years it's really changed

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.270 
in the last 20 years it's really changed
the<00:06:54.870> way<00:06:54.990> that<00:06:55.110> we<00:06:55.230> live<00:06:55.380> and<00:06:55.470> work<00:06:55.650> and<00:06:55.980> the

the way that we live and work and the

way that we see the world and what's

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.050 
way that we see the world and what's
great<00:06:58.380> is<00:06:58.680> we<00:06:59.190> sort<00:06:59.430> of<00:06:59.460> think<00:06:59.670> this<00:06:59.790> is<00:06:59.910> the

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
great is we sort of think this is the

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.590 
great is we sort of think this is the
next<00:07:00.210> paradigm<00:07:00.750> shift<00:07:01.080> because<00:07:01.590> now<00:07:02.520> we<00:07:03.330> can

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 
next paradigm shift because now we can

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.750 
next paradigm shift because now we can
literally<00:07:04.050> take<00:07:04.380> the<00:07:04.530> content<00:07:04.980> that<00:07:05.100> we<00:07:05.280> share

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:05.760 
literally take the content that we share

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.240

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 
it now it's just going to do a tiny bit

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.650 
it now it's just going to do a tiny bit
of<00:07:19.560> processing<00:07:19.980> to<00:07:20.460> convert<00:07:20.850> that<00:07:21.210> image<00:07:21.630> that

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 
of processing to convert that image that

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.210 
of processing to convert that image that
we<00:07:21.870> just<00:07:22.020> took<00:07:22.230> into<00:07:22.710> a<00:07:22.740> sort<00:07:23.010> of<00:07:23.100> digital

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 
we just took into a sort of digital

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.310 
we just took into a sort of digital
fingerprint<00:07:23.910> and<00:07:24.120> the<00:07:24.570> great<00:07:24.780> thing<00:07:24.990> is<00:07:25.110> if

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:25.320 
fingerprint and the great thing is if

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.570 
fingerprint and the great thing is if
you're<00:07:25.440> a<00:07:25.470> professional<00:07:25.800> users<00:07:26.340> so<00:07:26.490> in

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 
you're a professional users so in

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.370 
you're a professional users so in
newspaper<00:07:27.000> the<00:07:27.630> tools<00:07:27.870> are<00:07:28.020> pretty<00:07:28.140> much

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 
newspaper the tools are pretty much

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.990 
newspaper the tools are pretty much
identical<00:07:28.590> to<00:07:29.100> what<00:07:29.340> we've<00:07:29.460> just<00:07:29.670> used<00:07:29.730> to

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 
identical to what we've just used to

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.550 
identical to what we've just used to
create<00:07:30.300> this

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 
create this

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.800 
create this
straighten<00:07:31.070> the<00:07:31.850> only<00:07:32.090> difference<00:07:32.480> is<00:07:32.630> that

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:32.810 
straighten the only difference is that

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.060 
straighten the only difference is that
you've<00:07:32.930> got<00:07:33.110> the<00:07:33.200> ability<00:07:33.320> to<00:07:33.500> add<00:07:33.650> in<00:07:33.860> links

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.070 
you've got the ability to add in links

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.300 
you've got the ability to add in links
and<00:07:34.340> slightly<00:07:34.520> more<00:07:34.730> content<00:07:35.120> you<00:07:35.690> know<00:07:35.810> ready

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.310 
and slightly more content you know ready

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.480 
and slightly more content you know ready
okay

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:39.650 
so I'm told but ready which means we can

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.409 
so I'm told but ready which means we can
now<00:07:39.740> point<00:07:39.919> at<00:07:40.040> the<00:07:40.160> image<00:07:40.340> and<00:07:40.610> there<00:07:41.330> you

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:41.419 
now point at the image and there you

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:47.559 
now point at the image and there you
will

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:47.569 

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:52.099
