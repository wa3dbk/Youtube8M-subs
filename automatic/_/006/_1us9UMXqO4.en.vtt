00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello everyone today doing a video about 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.710
 how to remake just such a pack 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.379
 make it shorter and change this one 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.070
 upper belt 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.800
 I bought this skirt in the family shop 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.670
 It was cheap and I liked this 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.280
 skirt than what it is made of such 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.150
 easy enough such a fox fabric all 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.730
 as you can see 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.520
 and the first thing I do is I will remove here 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.550
 this belt because it seems to me that he 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.960
 some kind of not stylish 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:42.949
 skirt with him does not look like something neat 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.050
 the new car just spoils the look of the skirt and 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.949
 if I place him here 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.489
 such a belt 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:54.129
 bought it at a clothing store 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:58.610
 he is such an unusual groaning you and 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:01.430
 the reverse country is so simple 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.720
 and look what happened this 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.130
 this pleated 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.470
 this part is where the belt was like 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.220
 you see she has become quite so 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.190
 wide 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.760
 I 'll have to stick it out and here it is 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:20.060
 the lining that was in it so I 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.180
 decided that the distance of the skirt and if not 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.250
 It will be much less than what it is today 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.710
 is a floor skirt 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.619
 but I want to make a skirt like 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.720
 everyday wear that is somewhere up 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.810
 the knee will be the length accordingly i 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.410
 Now I take a centimeter tape and 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.310
 measuring the distance from the waist to the knee 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:45.259
 so ready rule with mourinho now 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.260
 cut and the upper portion of us 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.900
 will no longer 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.140
 lining fabric i also shorten 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.720
 measure the distance from the bottom to the top of this 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 it's about 53 centimeters made 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.110
 shorter lining by 10 centimeters than 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.840
 the main part so but here I am already 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.380
 cut out see lining fabric and she 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.130
 a little less as I said that at 53 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.650
 centimeters the main part that is 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.260
 skirt pleated 63 making shorter 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.020
 In principle, this is the way it should be so that 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.510
 lining fabric does not stand out from under 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.880
 bottom of the main part of the skirt and now I 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.310
 Need to equalize the skirt pleats and 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.480
 lining fabric that is to reduce here 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.660
 this part to this part by 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.120
 pins 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.050
 I secured with pins as you see 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.500
 waist distance 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.670
 the main part and lining fabric 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.100
 we shared it 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.330
 now i'm putting on the lining fabric 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.900
 back the main part of the skirt I take overlock 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.330
 and just line up and so i'm 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.210
 connected already 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.640
 bulk and lining fabric when 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.120
 help overlock of course if at your home 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.970
 there is an overlock then it is much faster he 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.690
 immediately cuts and wraps the edges of the fabric 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.170
 it is very convenient on a sewing machine it 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.650
 will be much longer and take a lot 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.760
 time therefore I advise all the same 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:25.120
 handle whenever possible on overlock 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:29.290
 Now I will connect the belt to our 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.380
 future skirts take a belt and sew on 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.990
 typewriter as it did zakrepku and here 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.080
 This gum in the belt which will 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.360
 connect skirt 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.200
 it is equal to the waist girth and as you see 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.470
 distance 5 uybki much more than 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.740
 need to 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.470
 I take the pins to it again 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.930
 several folds and then crumble 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.440
 goji do and the first thing i did is 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.600
 I turned the skirt future on the wrong side 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.350
 side now i take pins 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:07.120
 and skalyvayu that is reducing the distance in 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:10.010
 Italy in general, I turned out 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.660
 skirt on the wrong side 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.030
 took pins and stabbed a little 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:22.810
 I made a few such tucks 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:27.620
 1 2 3 4 by 4 and here is the main belt-gum 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:31.370
 which I will sew to the main 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.160
 pieces as you understood it will go to 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.160
 stretch that is 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:41.150
 left a distance that is it 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.730
 the distance will be tight here 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.450
 see the gum is pulled i mean i 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.550
 left 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.240
 Here is the distance to 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.510
 sew gum and I wear a skirt will 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.730
 ready as you can see I already removed the pins 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.729
 because I laid the line on 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.759
 sewing machine 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.370
 again, that is, you can not use 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:06.879
 already overlock and just pave the line 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.839
 in order for our advocates who we 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:14.680
 did they held onto sew a belt too 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:18.009
 do not make much effort to take the belt 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.729
 gum it should be on the purl 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:24.509
 to the side 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:28.990
 Like our skirt, we apply a belt and 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:32.770
 skirt fasten take the sewing machine 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:36.279
 set the lock and do not forget when 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.800
 laying stitches tight 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:41.919
 the gum that is thus will be 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.189
 created the effect of folds and after 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.569
 we all finish and turn the skirt on 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:50.379
 front side 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:52.719
 we should end up with this 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.449
 so again I show for those who are not 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:58.509
 figured out how to sew gum that's how you 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.110
 You see, I already made a clip that is 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:04.149
 rezinochka on my back side 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:09.839
 the fabric of the skirt is also on the seamy side 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:13.240
 and now i'm just stretching this gum 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:16.509
 push the pedal and the cars are laying 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.270
 I keep the line, of course, and then 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:20.259
 I get a fold and so completely 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.749
 whole belt 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:25.810
 there are such small stock and 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:29.919
 I've already finished sewing belt pic 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:32.530
 arm so and you can watch here then 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:35.169
 that as I said while sewing, I 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.160
 stretched the gum and it turned out like this 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:41.770
 here are the folds now I will turn the skirt on 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.050
 front side Well, here are the girls that in 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.690
 the result was 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:49.600
 I decided here such times here is such a 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:53.169
 skirts to the knee in general, everything 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.750
 It turned out as I wanted and here 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:57.730
 such a small type of outfit will 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.580
 wear with such a t-shirt but 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.650
 in general, I think it's better here 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.830
 solid things are always combined with 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.400
 what bright and t-shirts or sweaters 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.660
 or 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:13.479
 blouse any buns in general here 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.510
 so that's great I am very pleased that 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:19.389
 I managed to redo such a long 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:22.000
 skirt and sew enough of this 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:25.150
