00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.609
 You will now see instructions for 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.349
 finding objects with pro 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.890
 pointer 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.439
 professional device 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.630
 orienteering adguard using technique 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.849
 shown in this video you will learn 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.960
 save your time when digging 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.510
 valuable objects 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.739
 when you discover an item when 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.080
 metal detector assistance 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.420
 determine its exact position and 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.290
 start digging it out and in all 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.840
 other cases 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.270
 dripping to the depth indicated on the display 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.130
 now you need to use pro pointer 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.480
 which just include but only 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.870
 one button 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.010
 click it and start scanning 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.620
 use the sharp part of the device 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.260
 to divide and treat the soil 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:08.259
 until you hear a constant clear 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:11.299
 a signal like you are finding coins 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:16.329
 clear beep pro pointer 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.329
 increases as the object approaches 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.260
 see how using a tip device 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.550
 we found this coin in the wall 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.710
 dug we use it 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.990
 plastic blade to re 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.619
 check the pit and the ground you 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.619
 dug up 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.800
 not only can you find faster 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.720
 objects 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.210
 but youâ€™ll dig up less pro 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.430
 pointer clearly finds all metal 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.090
 Objects include rings and jewelry 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.090
 products 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.300
 the stronger the beep becomes 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.740
 the closer the device to the target look 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.120
 how quickly we found these ten cents 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.899
 sometimes it happens that the metal detector 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.160
 discovered several objects 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.200
 additional view excavated 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.990
 area helps detect the ring from 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.120
 banks 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.730
 You can not take off the headphones because 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.640
 pro pointer vibrates when detected 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.110
 metal objects 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.470
 know you don't have to worry about 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.470
 interference between pro pointer and 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.470
 metal detector 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.730
 using pro pointer from the city 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.859
 you will save time avoid excess 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.879
 digging and find more valuable 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:47.980
 things for gold diggers this device 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.000
 also useful in that 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.180
 scan 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:01.420
 remnants of sand or stones on the subject not 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:03.579
 found pieces look at this 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.379
 beauty is a beautiful piece of gold 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.639
 hiding in the stones led 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.950
 flashlight in pro pointer 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:15.970
 will help to detect the object and with weak 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.769
 light or dark pro pointer also 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.840
 repels water and it can 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.739
 use in the rain or in wet 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.200
 its grass can be washed under water for 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.060
 extra protection when cleansing you 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.909
 can cover the speaker sound 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.540
 signal thumbs wipe dry 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.540
 cloth 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.709
 This fabric holder is also included in 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.230
 pro pointer kit 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.659
 high quality of this device 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.090
 confirmed by the company of the mountain 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:49.090
 manufacturer of the best in the world 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.090
