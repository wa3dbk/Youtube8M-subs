00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.100
 so hello together in this video 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.120
 announced my personal opinion too 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.370
 the us route 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.960
 I just want to start with that 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.529
 what are the main tasks of that 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.470
 router is the gigabit wlan yes 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.999
 So I personally find gigabit wlan 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.789
 is a great thing 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:30.819
 especially since there are just large amounts of data 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.650
 what he has been able to transmit over the radio 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.760
 so did not go or already went 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.719
 accordingly slow 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.760
 so I have to say that has me 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.890
 base became a new experience 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.420
 procures above all just with the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.890
 transfer rate I had so far 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.570
 no possible technical method too 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.129
 test 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.100
 What I also noticed, though 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.059
 that it takes a little time 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.760
 it still the optimal setting 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.379
 it was found that it was experimenting 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.929
 around a bit speak to set 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.850
 just go somewhere and then try 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.219
 just out or is the calculated 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.290
 wavelength and just touch it afterwards 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.210
 Of course it will not work out, of course 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.280
 everywhere be the case that one to the place 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.040
 finds where you align the router 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.799
 so that the frequency is just enough 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.780
 that he ends up on receiver 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.030
 So just play around a bit 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.860
 I recommend that because of that you can 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.360
 really totally different results 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.479
 just by doing the router times 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.700
 rotates by 90 degrees and 45 degrees turns so 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.740
 that's really amazing that but not 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.869
 explicitly dependent on this good 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.219
 but in general 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.540
 furthermore, I think that's really good 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.300
 at the gross antennas 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.920
 that means you can exchange 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.270
 we saw at the beginning also at 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.490
 man boxing I have the antenna 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.850
 mounted and there is really that way 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.070
 simply the three antenna connections 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.630
 can occupy as you like in principle 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.460
 I have the purpose for me 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.500
 namely in friend a few miles 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.580
 away and we have direct contact 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.290
 actually above the airline 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.440
 speak we can actually directly 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.760
 see and that's why I have with him 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.260
 experiment maybe, too 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.910
 still a video will follow and although have 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.100
 I share right to the gigabit router 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.950
 I connected the antenna 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.600
 aligned with his antenna so 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.220
 that we just have a radio connection 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.480
 could produce 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.280
 and actually with almost full 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.040
 transfer rate 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.330
 and I really have to say that 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.160
 I can not please everyone 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.960
 router itself some fritz boxes can 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.240
 not that although that's the way it is 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.900
 as flagships of the router branche 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.120
 be valid 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.180
 So I really liked that 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.970
 What I also liked was that the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.910
 router has two ports for usb 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.260
 say once usb 3 1 x usb 2 and that 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.900
 has the background that I have one 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.790
 network printer operator no wlan 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.950
 so i actually have the printer 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.540
 USB to any print server 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.580
 I have to do that now 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.680
 just solve it by switching the printer over 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.050
 USB 2 with the brother connector and one 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.430
 usb 3 still falls nor any usb 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.560
 such as connecting usb stick 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.450
 can connect and then as nas what 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.670
 Personally, I found it very simple 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.190
 I am talking about everything 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.380
 I managed with a few clicks 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.930
 although i am now using the facility 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.959
 surface immediately engaged 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.190
 Produce repeater 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.989
 but of course I already have one 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.070
 I do not know what I have after that 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.730
 me of course in the extended 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.620
 I dared to say, "Settings" 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.850
 has just my attitude 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.000
 adjusted accordingly depending on how 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.650
 I needed that very much from that 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.200
 clearly I find the route gui 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.180
 Although here and there one of but then 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.370
 speak one or the other bug speak 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.120
 sometimes English parts in the 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.470
 router green as well as loading bar well 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.170
 You can actually get good loading bars 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.680
 also save because the principle is nothing 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.400
 bring 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.930
 this is just a loading bar of the 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.480
 javascript was written 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.829
 around the user just any graphic 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.239
 to give feedback on how long it is 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.480
 storing these explicit 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.010
 attitude still lasts that is if 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.079
 the good is restarted the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.549
 Ladebalken does not stop and somehow 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.769
 then continue if the router 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.060
 no, it just becomes 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.250
 in principle , the javascript code 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.260
 transferred on his own pc and in the 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.670
 browser then run so that the load 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.280
 both actually always continues 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.409
 always continues to run completely independently 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.720
 of how long does it actually take 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.609
 it just kinda has such a dummy 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.320
 element so that one sees something 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.599
 for me personally is not further 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.460
 Bad, that's why I noticed, but there 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.780
 if you had a countdown on eg 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.039
 that might be possible 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.289
 almost meaningful 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:32.070
 So you can roughly estimate how 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.360
 I really need a long time now 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.669
 I do not what I found so great yes 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.099
 I said in the last video 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.050
 the times when the password of the 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.490
 password directly means that means you can 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.620
 I somehow hook on 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.360
 Now I want to see the password now 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.220
 I want to have that censored 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.840
 this does not work when typing 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.050
 it will display the password immediately 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.080
 I find a bit difficult exactly 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.010
 so that tunnel of ase sda I hide 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.110
 now a picture 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.620
 the tool of asus to deal with the router 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.820
 to connect speak the tool the usual 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.220
 displays networks etc 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.229
 if you have the password and enter 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.449
 It saves it all 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.310
 connect blank text so bring you 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.020
 just saved the text and 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.680
 just not censored that is if 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.669
 I then set my password for example 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.830
 I should have forgotten 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.870
 Just come in and I actually have 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.039
 no possibility to hide that 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.659
 but it just gets straight to me 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.490
 I think that's a bit indicated 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.610
 difficult there just as I said when I 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.370
 connect with him for the first time 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.409
 or at all and I someone next to me 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.080
 He has me watching that I am sitting 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.970
 then every time the ask has to go away too 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.849
 look or otherwise and I think so 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.649
 not quite as optimal now 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.819
 on the other functions, I would like 

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:46.289
 now no longer so enter that 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.240
 I almost everything functions almost everybody 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.099
 router can therefore leading it 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.779
 neat in mind 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.349
 No problems that's how it should be 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:54.599
 his 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.369
 if you still value the design 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:57.869
 actually happy with the router too 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:58.789
 I will personally like that 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:00.599
 very well 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:04.499
 But of course this is just a 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.639
 incidental as a final conclusion if 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:07.379
 I now stand before the decision 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.330
 So I would buy it myself 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:11.309
 I would say router or not 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.539
 I would definitely buy from so 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:17.459
 me from clear purchase recommendation for 172 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.809
 at least the last time I was euro 

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:19.499
 looked the router is not even 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:22.349
 so expensive 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:24.029
 clearly he has no modern one speaks 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.830
 also needs in other route to ins 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:27.179
 internet to come or a modem just 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.009
 to get on the internet 

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:30.990
 I do not think so now 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:34.379
 bad and almost everyone 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.699
 already route home has from therefore could 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:37.649
 one this router then really only as 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:39.050
 modem continue to use and the gigabit 

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:41.279
 router then as an access point 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.389
 if I may have the router allowed 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.979
 In any case, more videos 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.869
 follow such as the video with 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:47.309
 I can do the radio connection as well 

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:48.809
 then respond to your questions 

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:50.699
 I'll really jump those 

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:53.669
 possibility to explain things to you 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:56.099
 As always applies to questions criticism 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.360
 suggestions or something just a 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:00.449
 The comment is written by a procurator 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.949
 container or even facebook that's it 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:04.249
 then so far from me to the next 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:04.249
 Video
