I'd<00:00:03.350> like<00:00:03.620> to<00:00:03.740> take<00:00:03.889> the<00:00:04.010> next<00:00:04.160> few<00:00:04.399> minutes<00:00:04.609> to

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:04.819 
I'd like to take the next few minutes to

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.080 
I'd like to take the next few minutes to
talk<00:00:05.000> about<00:00:05.210> our<00:00:05.599> new<00:00:06.319> little<00:00:06.559> product<00:00:07.069> the<00:00:07.519> AG

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
talk about our new little product the AG

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.070 
talk about our new little product the AG
hpx<00:00:08.990> 170<00:00:09.830> this<00:00:10.760> little<00:00:11.000> camera<00:00:11.240> is<00:00:11.540> just<00:00:11.870> so

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
hpx 170 this little camera is just so

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.720 
hpx 170 this little camera is just so
cool<00:00:12.350> it<00:00:12.620> is<00:00:13.220> a<00:00:13.250> brother<00:00:13.820> to<00:00:14.180> the<00:00:14.510> AG<00:00:15.410> hvx200<00:00:16.219> a

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
cool it is a brother to the AG hvx200 a

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.169 
cool it is a brother to the AG hvx200 a
sharing<00:00:17.599> the<00:00:17.720> same<00:00:17.900> CCD<00:00:18.499> assembly<00:00:19.039> and<00:00:19.249> that

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:20.179 
sharing the same CCD assembly and that

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.599 
sharing the same CCD assembly and that
means<00:00:20.509> it<00:00:20.869> has<00:00:21.079> the<00:00:21.380> same<00:00:21.650> better<00:00:22.220> low-light

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
means it has the same better low-light

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.450 
means it has the same better low-light
capability<00:00:23.539> better<00:00:24.349> signal-to-noise<00:00:24.800> and

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
capability better signal-to-noise and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.319 
capability better signal-to-noise and
better<00:00:25.999> smear<00:00:26.419> control<00:00:26.869> on<00:00:27.169> the<00:00:27.769> CCD<00:00:28.329> beyond

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
better smear control on the CCD beyond

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.139 
better smear control on the CCD beyond
that<00:00:29.599> the<00:00:29.810> camera<00:00:30.169> is<00:00:30.199> smaller<00:00:30.979> how<00:00:31.880> do<00:00:31.939> we<00:00:32.029> do

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
that the camera is smaller how do we do

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.270 
that the camera is smaller how do we do
that<00:00:32.180> will<00:00:32.570> we<00:00:32.840> took<00:00:32.989> out<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.410> DV<00:00:33.739> tape<00:00:33.980> drive

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
that will we took out the DV tape drive

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.970 
that will we took out the DV tape drive
and<00:00:34.579> because<00:00:35.449> of<00:00:35.480> that<00:00:35.690> we<00:00:36.140> were<00:00:36.500> able<00:00:36.620> to<00:00:36.829> add

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
and because of that we were able to add

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.410 
and because of that we were able to add
in<00:00:37.309> an<00:00:37.519> HD<00:00:38.359> SDI<00:00:38.960> output<00:00:39.699> along<00:00:40.699> with<00:00:40.940> that<00:00:41.179> we

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
in an HD SDI output along with that we

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.040 
in an HD SDI output along with that we
put<00:00:41.690> in<00:00:41.840> a<00:00:42.109> 6<00:00:42.590> pin<00:00:42.920> locking<00:00:44.050> firewire

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
put in a 6 pin locking firewire

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.959 
put in a 6 pin locking firewire
connection<00:00:45.320> yes<00:00:45.980> I<00:00:46.129> did<00:00:46.280> say<00:00:46.309> locking

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
connection yes I did say locking

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.389 
connection yes I did say locking
firewire<00:00:47.570> connection<00:00:47.780> along<00:00:48.530> with<00:00:48.829> that<00:00:49.070> we

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
firewire connection along with that we

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.790 
firewire connection along with that we
change<00:00:50.359> the<00:00:50.539> component<00:00:50.989> analog<00:00:51.289> connection

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
change the component analog connection

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.630 
change the component analog connection
to<00:00:52.039> be<00:00:52.519> more<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.030> snap<00:00:53.420> in<00:00:53.719> it<00:00:54.050> seems<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:54.949> lock

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
to be more of a snap in it seems to lock

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.200 
to be more of a snap in it seems to lock
in<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:56.030> lot<00:00:56.210> more<00:00:56.829> firmly<00:00:57.829> than<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.579> previous

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
in a lot more firmly than the previous

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.770 
in a lot more firmly than the previous
hvx200<00:00:59.899> version<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.300> because<00:01:02.300> this<00:01:02.480> is<00:01:02.600> more

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
hvx200 version and because this is more

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.410 
hvx200 version and because this is more
of<00:01:02.809> a<00:01:02.960> p2<00:01:03.589> camera<00:01:04.159> we're<00:01:04.640> now<00:01:04.790> able<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.269> add

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
of a p2 camera we're now able to add

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.260 
of a p2 camera we're now able to add
metadata<00:01:05.960> in<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:06.620> field<00:01:06.920> either<00:01:07.490> before<00:01:08.210> it

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
metadata in the field either before it

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.240 
metadata in the field either before it
gets<00:01:08.420> recorded<00:01:08.750> or<00:01:09.110> after<00:01:09.620> it<00:01:09.710> gets<00:01:09.830> recorded

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
gets recorded or after it gets recorded

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.180 
gets recorded or after it gets recorded
the<00:01:11.120> camera<00:01:11.450> has<00:01:11.480> a<00:01:11.690> built-in<00:01:12.190> waveform

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
the camera has a built-in waveform

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.580 
the camera has a built-in waveform
monitor<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:13.820> vector<00:01:14.420> scope<00:01:14.690> so<00:01:15.260> you're<00:01:15.470> able

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
monitor and vector scope so you're able

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.710 
monitor and vector scope so you're able
to<00:01:15.830> check<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.460> analyze<00:01:16.790> your<00:01:17.000> footage<00:01:17.360> while

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
to check and analyze your footage while

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.540 
to check and analyze your footage while
you're<00:01:17.930> in<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.170> field<00:01:18.440> this<00:01:19.040> is<00:01:19.190> a<00:01:19.220> very<00:01:19.490> good

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
you're in the field this is a very good

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.750 
you're in the field this is a very good
thing<00:01:19.730> and<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:21.170> also<00:01:21.380> has<00:01:21.560> three<00:01:22.370> different

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
thing and it also has three different

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.930 
thing and it also has three different
focus<00:01:23.360> assist<00:01:23.690> functions<00:01:24.290> one<00:01:24.950> is<00:01:25.160> a<00:01:25.190> very

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
focus assist functions one is a very

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.790 
focus assist functions one is a very
quick<00:01:26.330> responsive<00:01:27.580> bar<00:01:28.580> in<00:01:28.940> obtrusive<00:01:29.800> that

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
quick responsive bar in obtrusive that

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.000 
quick responsive bar in obtrusive that
runs<00:01:31.100> in<00:01:31.370> the<00:01:31.820> viewfinder<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.390> it<00:01:33.140> can<00:01:33.710> easily

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
runs in the viewfinder and it can easily

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.370 
runs in the viewfinder and it can easily
help<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:34.460> track<00:01:34.670> your<00:01:34.850> focus<00:01:35.240> range<00:01:35.450> there's

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
help you track your focus range there's

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.820 
help you track your focus range there's
the<00:01:36.620> other<00:01:36.800> 200<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:38.210> focus<00:01:39.110> function<00:01:39.320> which<00:01:39.680> is

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
the other 200 a focus function which is

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.980 
the other 200 a focus function which is
