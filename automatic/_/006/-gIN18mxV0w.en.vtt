00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.280 
but when you take it apart and smell it
it<00:01:55.400> smells<00:01:55.430> like<00:01:55.730> peanut<00:01:56.000> butter<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:56.720> for

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
it smells like peanut butter so for

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.840 
it smells like peanut butter so for
whatever<00:01:57.500> reason<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:58.160> just<00:01:58.190> doesn't<00:01:58.340> smell

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
whatever reason it just doesn't smell

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.470 
whatever reason it just doesn't smell
that<00:01:58.910> good

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
that good

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.150 
that good
let's<00:01:59.900> try<00:02:00.230> one<00:02:00.850> or<00:02:01.850> two<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.650> we'll<00:02:03.650> see<00:02:03.920> what

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
let's try one or two and we'll see what

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.520 
let's try one or two and we'll see what
they<00:02:04.310> taste<00:02:04.610> like<00:02:04.820> I'm<00:02:05.270> really<00:02:05.960> hoping<00:02:06.230> I<00:02:06.350> like

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
they taste like I'm really hoping I like

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:30.510 
they taste like I'm really hoping I like
these<00:02:07.030> here<00:02:08.030> we<00:02:08.149> go<00:02:08.269> down<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.689> hatch

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.470 

there<00:02:31.520> used<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.670> be<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.850> cookie<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.420> they

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
there used to be a cookie and they

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.630 
there used to be a cookie and they
probably<00:02:32.750> still<00:02:33.050> sell<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:34.460> I<00:02:34.550> think

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
probably still sell it and I think

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.090 
probably still sell it and I think
they're<00:02:34.910> called<00:02:35.150> pirate<00:02:35.660> pirate<00:02:36.380> cookies<00:02:36.860> and

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
they're called pirate pirate cookies and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.840 
they're called pirate pirate cookies and
there<00:02:37.250> are<00:02:37.340> peanut<00:02:37.610> butter<00:02:37.790> pirate<00:02:38.120> cookies

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
there are peanut butter pirate cookies

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.070 
there are peanut butter pirate cookies
if<00:02:40.850> you'd<00:02:41.060> give<00:02:41.300> me<00:02:41.330> one<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.780> these<00:02:41.900> that's

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
if you'd give me one of these that's

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.110 
if you'd give me one of these that's
exactly<00:02:42.770> what<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:42.950> thought<00:02:43.190> would<00:02:43.490> think<00:02:43.940> it

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
exactly what I thought would think it

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.300 
exactly what I thought would think it
was<00:02:44.360> although<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.380> pirate<00:02:45.710> cookies<00:02:46.070> are

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
was although the pirate cookies are

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.860 
was although the pirate cookies are
completely<00:02:47.240> different<00:02:47.510> shape<00:02:47.720> and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
completely different shape and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.660 
completely different shape and
everything<00:02:48.260> but<00:02:48.830> if<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:49.010> were<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.160> say<00:02:49.340> Oh<00:02:49.370> try

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
everything but if you were to say Oh try

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.700 
everything but if you were to say Oh try
this<00:02:49.730> cookie<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.360> was<00:02:50.510> blindfolded<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.620> I

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
this cookie and I was blindfolded and I

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.500 
this cookie and I was blindfolded and I
tried<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.520> would<00:02:52.760> taste<00:02:52.940> exactly<00:02:53.150> like

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
tried it it would taste exactly like

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.030 
tried it it would taste exactly like
