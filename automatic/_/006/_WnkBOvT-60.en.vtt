00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.720 

why<00:04:51.140> do<00:04:52.140> they<00:04:52.290> not<00:04:52.470> keep<00:04:52.800> up<00:04:52.950> these<00:04:53.190> old<00:04:53.430> world

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
why do they not keep up these old world

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.670 
why do they not keep up these old world
war<00:04:53.970> two<00:04:54.150> planes<00:04:54.510> I<00:04:54.870> mean<00:04:55.530> they're

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
war two planes I mean they're

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.500 
war two planes I mean they're
essentially<00:04:56.220> there's<00:04:56.640> they're<00:04:56.970> essentially

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
essentially there's they're essentially

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.290 
essentially there's they're essentially
like<00:04:57.690> really<00:04:58.110> heavy<00:04:58.350> truck<00:04:58.770> engines<00:04:59.190> in<00:04:59.400> a

I<00:05:02.610> think<00:05:03.060> Chrysler<00:05:03.510> made<00:05:03.690> most<00:05:03.930> of<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.080> p51

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
I think Chrysler made most of the p51

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.410 
I think Chrysler made most of the p51
engines<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.310> think<00:05:05.520> they're<00:05:05.670> 16<00:05:06.120> cylinders<00:05:07.040> and

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
engines I think they're 16 cylinders and

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.800 
engines I think they're 16 cylinders and
their<00:05:09.420> props<00:05:09.960> their<00:05:10.560> prop<00:05:10.770> driven<00:05:11.010> and<00:05:11.810> that

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
their props their prop driven and that

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.680 
their props their prop driven and that
