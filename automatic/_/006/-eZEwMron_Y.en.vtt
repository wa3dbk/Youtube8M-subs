00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
returns that we recycle internally we

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.150 
returns that we recycle internally we
take<00:00:53.059> those<00:00:53.210> raw<00:00:53.540> materials<00:00:53.920> melt<00:00:54.920> them<00:00:55.129> down

take those raw materials melt them down
with<00:00:55.640> electric<00:00:56.090> melters<00:00:57.160> we<00:00:58.160> take<00:00:58.399> that

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
with electric melters we take that

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.840 
with electric melters we take that
electric<00:00:59.559> melt<00:01:00.559> power<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.850> basically<00:01:02.420> take<00:01:02.720> a

electric melt power and basically take a

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.130 
electric melt power and basically take a
solidified<00:01:04.850> component<00:01:05.390> and<00:01:05.510> make<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:05.900> into<00:01:06.110> a

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
solidified component and make it into a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.149 
solidified component and make it into a
liquid<00:01:06.710> metal<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.840> at<00:01:09.140> that<00:01:09.290> point<00:01:09.590> we

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
liquid metal and and at that point we

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.160 
liquid metal and and at that point we
transfer<00:01:10.640> that<00:01:10.670> metal<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.270> mold<00:01:11.600> lines<00:01:11.840> which

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
transfer that metal to mold lines which

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.520 
transfer that metal to mold lines which
the<00:01:12.470> molds<00:01:13.070> are<00:01:13.159> put<00:01:13.369> together<00:01:13.460> with<00:01:14.229> sand<00:01:15.229> and

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
the molds are put together with sand and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.940 
the molds are put together with sand and
bond<00:01:16.369> that<00:01:16.640> we<00:01:17.320> mined<00:01:18.320> out<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.619> earth<00:01:18.770> and

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
bond that we mined out of the earth and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.850 
bond that we mined out of the earth and
mix<00:01:19.190> with<00:01:19.340> water<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.880> make<00:01:20.270> a<00:01:20.440> precision<00:01:21.440> mold

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
mix with water and make a precision mold

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.920 
mix with water and make a precision mold
we<00:01:22.399> then<00:01:22.580> take<00:01:22.759> that<00:01:22.820> in<00:01:23.180> that<00:01:23.270> mold<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:23.869> we

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
we then take that in that mold and we

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.710 
we then take that in that mold and we
pour<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.289> iron<00:01:24.440> in<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.710> mold<00:01:25.180> from<00:01:26.180> there<00:01:26.450> we

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
pour the iron in the mold from there we

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.850 
pour the iron in the mold from there we
cool<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.770> castings<00:01:28.250> down<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:29.560> process<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
cool the castings down and process the

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.910 
cool the castings down and process the
casting<00:01:31.210> clean<00:01:32.210> off<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:33.440> excess

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
casting clean off the the excess

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.760 
casting clean off the the excess
material<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:35.570> then<00:01:35.810> we<00:01:35.929> ship<00:01:36.140> those<00:01:36.289> castings

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
material and then we ship those castings

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.540 
material and then we ship those castings
off<00:01:36.920> to<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.160> customer

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550
