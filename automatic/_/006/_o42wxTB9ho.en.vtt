00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.700
 dear friends my name is anri not 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.040
 robots and this is a review on Belarusian 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.290
 sausage 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.549
 when can I ask what the Belarusian 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.510
 Sausage is better than ours 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.650
 and just making friends there for us 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.359
 opened in the lakes 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.529
 shop of Belarusian goods may 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.670
 how do i take a look at this process 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.840
 Belarusian sausage 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.529
 sausages I did not come from Belarus I 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.050
 its not the first time I buy 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.620
 because our sausage is principle 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.860
 it is a little old for me 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.809
 really little can clean 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.430
 every court well here here here even 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.950
 if you poke her just trite 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.780
 knife poke here already realizing that she 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.280
 done but there too there of course and 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.329
 aggressive tendons and all that but 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.360
 somehow know refers to only 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.980
 calmer because Belarusian rat they 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.879
 for sure better than our friends sorry 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:08.939
 that I cut like this because 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.700
 hard to cut with one hand though I hold it up 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.170
 light 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:19.740
 just look at these blotches for 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.810
 She is now I have already smelled and already 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.640
 feel already drenched from sorry that i have 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.820
 there is still some kind of sausage now 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.900
 up to something like a control 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.840
 purchases hold but in principle I am very 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.150
 often kiddie i mean i her 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.020
 I criticize by smell and if for example 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.970
 I do not like the food I do not like it for example 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.250
 precisely because of this such top many people 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.350
 how do they do but from this pripyat on 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.290

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.320

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.729
 feeling to them somehow with some kind 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.390
 distrust of this sweaty 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.049
