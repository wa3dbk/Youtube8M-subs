today<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.840> super<00:00:25.320> Fab<00:00:25.619> Lab<00:00:25.699> we're<00:00:26.699> going<00:00:27.119> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
today in super Fab Lab we're going to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.089 
today in super Fab Lab we're going to
figure<00:00:27.599> out<00:00:27.779> another<00:00:27.990> way<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.529> measure

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
figure out another way to measure

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.979 
figure out another way to measure
something<00:00:29.880> big<00:00:30.529> whoa<00:00:32.149> can<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.180> measure<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
something big whoa can we measure the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.119 
something big whoa can we measure the
whole<00:00:34.170> classroom<00:00:34.530> sure<00:00:35.480> but<00:00:36.480> if<00:00:36.899> SIDS<00:00:37.559> ruler

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
whole classroom sure but if SIDS ruler

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.970 
whole classroom sure but if SIDS ruler
is<00:00:38.280> too<00:00:38.579> small<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.989> don't<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> tape

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
is too small and we don't have a tape

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.069 
is too small and we don't have a tape
measure<00:00:41.149> what<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.390> use<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.629> measure<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
measure what can we use to measure the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.440 
measure what can we use to measure the
classroom<00:00:43.350> oh<00:00:45.350> hey<00:00:46.350> hey<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:47.250> big<00:00:47.700> why<00:00:48.210> don't

I was hit my head okay equals um to
Gerald's<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.589> bet<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.430> old

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
Gerald's and I bet that this old

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.260 
Gerald's and I bet that this old
classroom<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.720> ten<00:01:07.200> Gerald's<00:01:07.740> long<00:01:08.270> that's

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
classroom is is ten Gerald's long that's

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
classroom is is ten Gerald's long that's
a<00:01:09.420> really<00:01:09.990> good<00:01:10.290> estimate<00:01:10.590> Gerald<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
a really good estimate Gerald and a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.399 
a really good estimate Gerald and a
really<00:01:12.240> good<00:01:12.450> way<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.720> measure<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.229> classroom

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
really good way to measure the classroom

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.600 
really good way to measure the classroom
yeah<00:01:14.340> yeah<00:01:15.030> yeah<00:01:15.920> sure<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.250> know<00:01:17.369> it's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
yeah yeah yeah sure you know it's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.240 
yeah yeah yeah sure you know it's
actually<00:01:17.820> okay<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.570> use<00:01:18.869> something<00:01:19.140> besides<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
actually okay to use something besides a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.670 
actually okay to use something besides a
ruler<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.880> measure<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.659> mean<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:22.259> could<00:01:22.500> use<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
ruler to measure you mean we could use a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.330 
ruler to measure you mean we could use a
shoe<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.520> measure<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.090> classroom

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
shoe to measure the classroom

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.700 
shoe to measure the classroom
absolutely<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> when<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.869> use<00:01:28.320> something

absolutely and when you use something

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.630 
absolutely and when you use something
besides<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.490> ruler<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.299> called<00:01:31.640> non-standard

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
besides a ruler it's called non-standard

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.580 
besides a ruler it's called non-standard
measurement<00:01:33.079> yes<00:01:34.520> non-standard<00:01:35.520> measurement

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
measurement yes non-standard measurement

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.920 
measurement yes non-standard measurement
very<00:01:37.590> good<00:01:37.950> gerald<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.670> think<00:01:39.329> my<00:01:39.479> work<00:01:39.689> here<00:01:39.900> is

Gerald's well there are some rules when
you<00:01:53.820> use<00:01:54.119> non-standard<00:01:54.420> measurement<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:56.070> can

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
you use non-standard measurement you can

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.700 
you use non-standard measurement you can
only<00:01:56.490> measure<00:01:56.909> with<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.570> kind<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.110> item<00:01:58.469> at<00:01:58.649> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
only measure with one kind of item at a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.330 
only measure with one kind of item at a
time

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340

see<00:02:28.859> I'm<00:02:29.280> measure<00:02:29.760> with<00:02:30.000> me<00:02:30.150> measure<00:02:30.510> with<00:02:30.780> me

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
see I'm measure with me measure with me

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.199 
see I'm measure with me measure with me
okay<00:02:31.560> ah<00:02:31.760> I'll<00:02:32.760> be<00:02:33.120> okay<00:02:34.640> let's<00:02:35.640> do<00:02:35.970> it

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
okay ah I'll be okay let's do it

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.520 
okay ah I'll be okay let's do it
yes<00:02:36.599> haha<00:02:37.849> you're<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.879> scientist<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:40.049> can<00:02:40.260> try

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
yes haha you're a scientist you can try

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.430 
yes haha you're a scientist you can try
this<00:02:40.590> too

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
this too

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.349 
this too
okay<00:02:43.440> let's<00:02:43.829> measure<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.579> classroom<00:02:45.120> using

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
okay let's measure the classroom using

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.080 
okay let's measure the classroom using
non-standard<00:02:46.319> measurement<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:47.760> means

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
non-standard measurement that means

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.849 
non-standard measurement that means
instead<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.720> ruler<00:02:49.079> we'll<00:02:49.409> use<00:02:49.590> something

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
instead of a ruler we'll use something

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.960 
instead of a ruler we'll use something
else<00:02:50.159> in<00:02:50.579> this<00:02:50.849> case<00:02:51.150> we<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.690> use<00:02:51.930> our<00:02:52.230> body

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
else in this case we can use our body

out our classroom is 14 Gerald's lon
oh<00:04:26.310> that's<00:04:26.730> great<00:04:27.210> SID<00:04:28.170> now<00:04:28.650> we<00:04:28.710> know<00:04:28.980> how<00:04:29.250> long

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
oh that's great SID now we know how long

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.530 
oh that's great SID now we know how long
our<00:04:29.760> classroom<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.450> in<00:04:30.810> Gerald's<00:04:32.540> Gabriela

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
our classroom is in Gerald's Gabriela

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.950 
our classroom is in Gerald's Gabriela
how<00:04:34.080> about<00:04:34.260> you<00:04:34.410> our<00:04:34.530> Journal<00:04:34.890> oh<00:04:35.070> okay<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.750> I

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.350 
how about you our Journal oh okay so I
was<00:04:37.320> thinking<00:04:37.740> if<00:04:38.310> we<00:04:38.370> could<00:04:38.700> measure<00:04:38.940> the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
was thinking if we could measure the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.870 
was thinking if we could measure the
classroom<00:04:39.690> in<00:04:40.380> Gerald's<00:04:41.010> we<00:04:41.580> could<00:04:41.730> also

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
classroom in Gerald's we could also

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.830 
classroom in Gerald's we could also
measure<00:04:42.270> our<00:04:42.660> rug<00:04:43.170> in<00:04:43.500> Gerald<00:04:44.070> oh<00:04:44.670> oh<00:04:45.330> I'll<00:04:45.630> go
