00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.119 
more insight so um the first thing that
I<00:00:46.170> noticed<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.039> viewing<00:00:47.250> angle<00:00:47.910> um<00:00:48.090> I

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
I noticed was the viewing angle um I

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.139 
I noticed was the viewing angle um I
normally<00:00:50.129> look<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> phone<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.210> and

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
normally look at the phone like this and

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.369 
normally look at the phone like this and
easy<00:00:54.149> easy<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.930> read<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.870> don't<00:00:58.079> normally

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
easy easy to read but you don't normally

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.340 
easy easy to read but you don't normally
think<00:00:58.980> about<00:00:59.870> looking<00:01:00.870> at<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> phone<00:01:01.109> side

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
think about looking at the phone side

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.930 
think about looking at the phone side
wait<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.800> sideways<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.340> kind<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.699> at<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
wait not sideways but kind of at a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.520 
wait not sideways but kind of at a
different<00:01:03.270> angle<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.290> look<00:01:04.439> at

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
different angle like so if you look at

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.440 
different angle like so if you look at
the<00:01:04.559> phone<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.040> an<00:01:05.580> angle<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> guy<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.299> right

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the phone and an angle the guy on right

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.010 
the phone and an angle the guy on right
now<00:01:06.860> it's<00:01:07.860> still<00:01:08.220> perfectly<00:01:08.610> visible<00:01:09.020> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
now it's still perfectly visible the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.330 
now it's still perfectly visible the
only<00:01:10.200> thing<00:01:10.350> obviously<00:01:10.530> blinding<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
only thing obviously blinding it is a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.020 
only thing obviously blinding it is a
light<00:01:12.030> um<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.950> essentially<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.549> don't<00:01:14.850> lose

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
light um but essentially you don't lose

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.050 
light um but essentially you don't lose
any<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> color<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.700> everything<00:01:17.700> remains

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
any of the color and everything remains

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.359 
any of the color and everything remains
perfectly<00:01:18.390> clear<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.049> visible<00:01:19.170> even<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:20.130> like

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
perfectly clear and visible even at like

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.460 
perfectly clear and visible even at like
a<00:01:20.400> really<00:01:20.610> crazy<00:01:20.880> angle<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.659> 107

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
a really crazy angle like this 107

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.010 
a really crazy angle like this 107
degrees<00:01:22.770> or<00:01:22.950> hundred<00:01:23.189> eighty<00:01:23.340> degrees<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:24.020> I

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
degrees or hundred eighty degrees and I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.929 
degrees or hundred eighty degrees and I
thought<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.259> was<00:01:25.530> really<00:01:26.009> cool<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> mean

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
thought that was really cool so I mean

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.090 
thought that was really cool so I mean
you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.990> don't<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.409> maybe<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.979> few

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you know I don't know if maybe if a few

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.410 
you know I don't know if maybe if a few
people<00:01:29.159> crowded<00:01:29.700> around<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.329> all

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
people crowded around you and they all

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.640 
people crowded around you and they all
want<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.780> what<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.170> your<00:01:31.290> screen

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
want to see what you have in your screen

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.280 
want to see what you have in your screen
like<00:01:32.460> you're<00:01:32.579> playing<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.850> game<00:01:33.060> um<00:01:33.329> they<00:01:34.140> can

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
like you're playing a game um they can

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.100 
like you're playing a game um they can
all<00:01:34.409> see<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.680> because<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.659> looks<00:01:36.659> perfectly

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
all see it because it looks perfectly

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.370 
all see it because it looks perfectly
cool<00:01:37.439> from<00:01:37.740> all<00:01:37.860> sides<00:01:38.100> um<00:01:38.780> so<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.140> know<00:01:40.170> when

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
cool from all sides um so you know when

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.140 
cool from all sides um so you know when
I<00:01:40.409> contrast<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.340> my<00:01:41.610> iphone<00:01:41.970> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
I contrast that with my iphone it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.630 
I contrast that with my iphone it
doesn't<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.020> doesn't<00:01:43.290> do<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.710> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
doesn't like it doesn't do that so it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.219 
doesn't like it doesn't do that so it
looks<00:01:44.820> fine<00:01:44.970> normally<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.079> as

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
looks fine normally like this but as

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.719 
looks fine normally like this but as
soon<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.590> tilt<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> color<00:01:47.369> totally

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
soon as you tilt it the color totally

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.910 
soon as you tilt it the color totally
washes<00:01:48.090> out<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> screen<00:01:49.890> that's

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
washes out and you get a screen that's

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.249 
washes out and you get a screen that's
kind<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.360> definitely<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:52.110> it

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
kind of you you definitely can see it

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.800 
kind of you you definitely can see it
but<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.159> colors<00:01:53.430> aren't<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.600> just

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
but it's the colors aren't there it just

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.410 
but it's the colors aren't there it just
doesn't<00:01:54.990> look<00:01:55.170> as<00:01:55.320> good<00:01:55.470> as<00:01:55.700> when<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> turn<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
doesn't look as good as when you turn a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.990 
doesn't look as good as when you turn a
super<00:01:57.810> amoled<00:01:58.170> screen<00:01:58.469> sideways<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.310> don't

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
super amoled screen sideways I don't

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.859 
super amoled screen sideways I don't
know<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.240> hard<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.990> start<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.590> show<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> know

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
know it's hard to start to show I know

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.440 
know it's hard to start to show I know
so<00:02:03.869> that's<00:02:04.110> one<00:02:04.320> viewing<00:02:04.560> angle<00:02:05.119> number<00:02:06.119> two

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
so that's one viewing angle number two

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.290 
so that's one viewing angle number two
aisles<00:02:07.020> would<00:02:07.229> notice<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> colors

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
aisles would notice that the colors

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.010 
aisles would notice that the colors
look<00:02:08.660> really<00:02:09.080> cool<00:02:09.290> like<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.070> black<00:02:10.400> is<00:02:11.020> it's

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
look really cool like the black is it's

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.050 
look really cool like the black is it's
like<00:02:12.200> really<00:02:12.530> dark<00:02:12.740> blacks<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.400> don't<00:02:13.880> know<00:02:13.940> how

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
like really dark blacks I don't know how

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.360 
like really dark blacks I don't know how
they<00:02:14.210> do<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:15.320> if<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.710> was<00:02:15.860> looking<00:02:16.160> at<00:02:16.250> the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
they do it but if I was looking at the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.180 
they do it but if I was looking at the
phone<00:02:16.900> when<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:17.960> first<00:02:18.140> pick<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.440> up<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.010> if

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
phone when you first pick it up so if

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.110 
phone when you first pick it up so if
you're<00:02:19.280> locked<00:02:19.460> if<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:19.670> put<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.970> lock

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
you're locked if you put on the lock

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.540 
you're locked if you put on the lock
screen<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:21.110> can<00:02:21.230> definitely<00:02:21.800> tell<00:02:22.010> where<00:02:22.430> the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
screen you can definitely tell where the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.730 
screen you can definitely tell where the
screen<00:02:22.820> ends<00:02:23.170> obviously<00:02:24.170> it's<00:02:24.290> right<00:02:24.470> there

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
screen ends obviously it's right there

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.390 
screen ends obviously it's right there
you<00:02:25.160> know<00:02:25.280> around<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> top<00:02:26.000> etc<00:02:27.070> but<00:02:28.070> when

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
you know around to the top etc but when

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.250 
you know around to the top etc but when
you<00:02:28.610> unlock<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:29.630> you're<00:02:29.810> on<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.960> screen

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
you unlock it and you're on a screen

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.710 
you unlock it and you're on a screen
like<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:31.730> can<00:02:31.910> see<00:02:32.270> where<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.600> ends

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
like of this you can see where it ends

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.320 
like of this you can see where it ends
because<00:02:32.990> it's<00:02:33.290> cutting<00:02:33.650> off<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.980> tiles<00:02:34.550> but

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
because it's cutting off the tiles but

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.660 
because it's cutting off the tiles but
if<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.540> scroll<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.020> top<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:37.250> have<00:02:37.400> no

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
if you scroll to the top you have no

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.370 
if you scroll to the top you have no
clue<00:02:38.090> word<00:02:38.300> where<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.720> screen<00:02:39.020> ends<00:02:39.230> because

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
clue word where the screen ends because

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.090 
clue word where the screen ends because
the<00:02:39.680> blacks<00:02:39.920> blend<00:02:40.460> right<00:02:40.820> into<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.390> bezel

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
the blacks blend right into the bezel

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.350 
the blacks blend right into the bezel
unless<00:02:43.100> here<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.640> go<00:02:43.730> unless<00:02:44.060> you're<00:02:44.210> in

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
unless here you go unless you're in

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.480 
unless here you go unless you're in
direct<00:02:44.930> light<00:02:45.470> where<00:02:45.710> you<00:02:45.800> can<00:02:45.920> see<00:02:46.190> where<00:02:46.400> the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
direct light where you can see where the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.640 
direct light where you can see where the
screen<00:02:46.730> starts<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.210> ends<00:02:47.480> like<00:02:47.750> right<00:02:48.230> there

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
screen starts and ends like right there

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.880 
screen starts and ends like right there
but<00:02:49.640> normally<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.270> have<00:02:50.450> no<00:02:50.720> clue<00:02:51.050> I<00:02:51.380> thought

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
but normally you have no clue I thought

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.010 
but normally you have no clue I thought
that<00:02:51.950> was<00:02:52.070> like<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.880> super<00:02:53.210> cool<00:02:53.540> thing<00:02:53.810> where

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
that was like a super cool thing where

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.420 
that was like a super cool thing where
you<00:02:54.230> couldn't<00:02:54.470> even<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:55.010> know<00:02:55.130> everything

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
you couldn't even you know everything

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.340 
you couldn't even you know everything
just<00:02:55.460> kind<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.790> blends<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:56.180> just<00:02:56.390> because<00:02:56.510> the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
just kind of blends in just because the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.720 
just kind of blends in just because the
colors<00:02:57.650> are<00:02:57.680> are<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:58.640> saturated<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.360> so<00:02:59.710> vivid

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
colors are are so saturated and so vivid

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.070 
colors are are so saturated and so vivid
so<00:03:01.730> that's<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.420> other<00:03:02.600> thing<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.840> thought<00:03:02.960> was

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
so that's the other thing I thought was

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.300 
so that's the other thing I thought was
really<00:03:03.230> cool<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.740> two<00:03:03.860> things<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.070> probably

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
really cool the two things that probably

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.970 
really cool the two things that probably
matter<00:03:04.580> most<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:05.960> the<00:03:06.350> people<00:03:06.620> actually

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
matter most to the people actually

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.740 
matter most to the people actually
there's<00:03:07.190> another<00:03:07.250> thing<00:03:07.610> in<00:03:07.970> sunlight<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.510> find

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
there's another thing in sunlight I find

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.940 
there's another thing in sunlight I find
that<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.080> Super<00:03:09.320> AMOLED<00:03:09.350> screen<00:03:09.740> is<00:03:09.830> actually

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
that the Super AMOLED screen is actually

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.170 
that the Super AMOLED screen is actually
easier<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.490> see<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.760> also<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:12.910> apparently<00:03:13.910> it

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
easier to see you also and apparently it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.060 
easier to see you also and apparently it
also<00:03:14.270> uses<00:03:14.510> less<00:03:14.780> power<00:03:14.810> some<00:03:15.709> stuff<00:03:15.860> under

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
also uses less power some stuff under

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.830 
also uses less power some stuff under
the<00:03:16.190> covers<00:03:16.459> that<00:03:16.640> I<00:03:16.880> don't<00:03:17.239> know<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.690> much
