want to look for is a light square
rectangular<00:01:16.000> loom<00:01:16.710> make<00:01:17.710> sure<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:19.570> it's<00:01:19.750> not

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.230 

blocks<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:25.630> like<00:01:25.810> these<00:01:26.020> here<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:28.119> your

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
blocks just like these here what your

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.880 
blocks just like these here what your
occupies<00:01:28.720> a<00:01:29.009> kind<00:01:30.009> of<00:01:30.220> darker<00:01:30.759> color<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.530> here

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
occupies a kind of darker color so here

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:48.680 
occupies a kind of darker color so here
we<00:01:33.040> go<00:01:33.100> such<00:01:33.880> as<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:35.200> block<00:01:35.500> over<00:01:35.830> here

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.680 

and<00:01:49.260> then<00:01:49.440> we<00:01:49.620> just<00:01:49.890> go<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.730> it<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.880> then<00:01:51.240> or

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
and then we just go up to it and then or

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.950 
and then we just go up to it and then or
deck<00:01:51.900> straight<00:01:52.140> down<00:01:52.260> from<00:01:52.410> there<00:01:53.750> is<00:01:54.750> this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
deck straight down from there is this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.270 
deck straight down from there is this
one<00:01:56.510> it's<00:01:57.510> also<00:01:57.870> easier<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:59.580> able<00:01:59.700> to<00:02:00.060> find

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
one it's also easier to be able to find
