00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:11.820
 [music] 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.170
 Hello everyone, we will collect today 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.490
 two rear axle and box 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.160
 three-step up scale gear box 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.820
 well, let's probably start with 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.340
 no box assembly let's go with bridges 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.990
 Damascus and collect later box 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.350
 all components that are actually 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.429
 all metal will go here to our bridges 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.429
 [music] 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:48.160
 So let's start, first we collect one 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.730
 half take the bevel gear on 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.250
 her shaybochku according to the instructions process 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:02.290
 a little dream gryce too x and by the way in 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:04.540
 a set on top, too, put a gripe even 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.280
 I do not know how much to apply because in 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.850
 principle will be leakproof and 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:14.270
 but we will apply as much as possible now 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.650
 collect satellites of them all 3 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.650
 [music] 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:26.930
 set dub well and on top 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.930
 naturally also apply gris 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.460
 from the second half we do everything too 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.460
 the most 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.380
 and now we connect the two halves 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.360
 sealant of course nothing will that is 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.790
 look at the operation as yourself 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:58.590
 will show two strips connect on 3 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:02:02.490
 screw and do not forget about lactation all 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.940
 Our dv is ready to do the build now. 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.940
 axes 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.140
 unfortunately only 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.440
 bushings need to buy bearings 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.440
 separately 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.560
 [music] 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:32.380
 so two axes are ready now you can 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.380
 set them in our differential 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.120
 now we will assemble the body of our bridge again 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.900
 we take tulku 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.900
 and gear 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.920
 [music] 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.920
 and 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.110
 places where sleeves will rotate 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.230
 let's also griss everything 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.230
 instructions 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.499
 [music] 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.030
 installed in the bridge and now the whole gear 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.250
 also grease griss is not really 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.500
 I know how much he needs here all not 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.410
 sealed completely not zaveb but 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.370
 as much as we can and pour in here and 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.920
 accordingly, now we connect two 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:41.850
 halves and fix it on eight 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:45.500
 cogs set the cup cup too 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.500
 here is metal like gears 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.120
 for installation 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.490
 need to take a cog put on him 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.430
 a little bit loctite and which is included too 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.470
 we do not forget the kit thanks to it 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:11.960
 our screw during operation is not 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:16.970
 unscrew all both bridges are ready and now 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:20.500
 can safely do the box this in 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.500
 In principle, all the component boxes 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.919
 [music] 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:40.160
 [music] 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.319
 [music] 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:05:00.760
 so one axis is ready here plastic and 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:03.280
 aluminum gear also places where 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:09.450
 will spin coat with sleeves 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:12.450
 breeze install sleeve in gears and 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.450
 dress up 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:45.090
 [music] 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:49.199
 so the second is also ready here everything is already 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:52.949
 gears plastic no aluminum 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:55.999
 there is no now all this remains for us 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.999
 set to 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:20.490
 [music] 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.490
 and 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.400
 like this it looks like this 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:38.840
 here are our speeds to switch them 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:41.170
 in total there will be 3 now let's do it 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.170
 installing motor stock motor yet 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.170
 540 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:51.010
 [music] 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.190
 not 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:05.990
 now install the pignon and do not forget 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.730
 about the installation of the gap, I leave somewhere 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:11.820
 15-20 percent of the length 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.620
 tine 1 like so well or you can 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.380
 use a piece of paper like i did it in 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.560
 one of the video on the assembly as someone 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.930
 conveniently 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.930
 [music] 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.930

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.710
 and close our box with two 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.540
 plastic covers on both sides and 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:35.440
 fix on the screws 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:37.970
