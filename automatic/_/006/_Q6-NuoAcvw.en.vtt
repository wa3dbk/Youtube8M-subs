which is going to be horrible into a
lots<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.190> blocks<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.250> here<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.399> go<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.730> row<00:00:41.969> of

blocks all these blocks you can see here

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.119 
blocks all these blocks you can see here
can<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.730> used<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.110> issues<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.010> if

for example right click with a chisel
and<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.910> put<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> redneck<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.829> see

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
and we put the redneck here you can see

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.189 
and we put the redneck here you can see
all<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> blocks<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.969> carve<00:00:57.210> into<00:00:57.390> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
all the blocks that we can carve into so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.750 
all the blocks that we can carve into so
if<00:00:58.379> i<00:00:58.469> want<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> car<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.160> the<00:01:01.309> EH<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.340> should

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
if i want a car like the EH one should

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.729 
if i want a car like the EH one should
we<00:01:02.850> go<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> lava<00:01:04.439> flowing

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
we go this one with a lava flowing

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.250 
we go this one with a lava flowing
inside<00:01:05.010> there<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.700> go<00:01:05.850> simple<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:07.080> got

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
inside there we go simple as that we got

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.609 
inside there we go simple as that we got
the<00:01:07.380> block<00:01:08.210> now<00:01:09.210> all<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> these<00:01:09.810> textures<00:01:10.380> are

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the block now all of these textures are

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.240 
the block now all of these textures are
based<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.520> painterly<00:01:12.119> pack<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.040> guy

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
based on the painterly pack so the guy

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.609 
based on the painterly pack so the guy
didn't<00:01:14.520> make<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.939> textures<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:16.020> he<00:01:16.380> made<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
didn't make the textures but he made the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.850 
didn't make the textures but he made the
mod<00:01:16.979> which<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.580> really<00:01:17.970> cool<00:01:18.530> if<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.680> go<00:01:19.799> ahead

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
mod which is really cool if we go ahead

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.320 
mod which is really cool if we go ahead

also<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.239> end<00:02:39.360> days<00:02:39.600> some<00:02:40.410> more<00:02:40.910> blocks<00:02:41.910> to

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
also in the end days some more blocks to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.479 
also in the end days some more blocks to
belong<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.540> limestone<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.260> don't<00:02:44.190> i'm<00:02:44.430> not

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.550 
sure how to get the marble pillar I
think<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.880> can<00:02:48.090> craft<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.840> using<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.260> raw

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
think you can craft it using the raw

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.320 
think you can craft it using the raw
marble<00:02:50.070> let's<00:02:50.489> see<00:02:50.670> her<00:02:52.850> no<00:02:53.850> doesn't<00:02:54.180> look

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
marble let's see her no doesn't look

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.509 
marble let's see her no doesn't look
like<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.720> well<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> think<00:02:55.680> maybe<00:02:56.160> they<00:02:56.370> are

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
like it well I think maybe they are

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.530 
like it well I think maybe they are
generated<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.750> raw<00:02:58.130> hello<00:02:59.299> so<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.420> is

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
generated the raw hello so that is

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.539 
generated the raw hello so that is
basically<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:01.019> essence<00:03:01.320> of<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.560> mod<00:03:01.860> it

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549
