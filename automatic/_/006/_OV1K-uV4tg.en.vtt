mean maybe anyway people never believe
me<00:00:42.090> when<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> tell<00:00:42.420> them<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.809> robotic

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
me when I tell them we have robotic

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.049 
me when I tell them we have robotic
garbage<00:00:43.829> trucks<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.579> we're<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> start

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
garbage trucks so we're going to start

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.660 
garbage trucks so we're going to start
the<00:00:45.180> list<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.829> number<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.640> have

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the list with that number one we have

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.389 
the list with that number one we have
robotic<00:00:48.570> garbage<00:00:48.989> trucks<00:00:49.260> which<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
robotic garbage trucks which is a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.740 
robotic garbage trucks which is a
complete<00:00:50.760> lie<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.660> video

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
complete lie as you can see in the video

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.569 
complete lie as you can see in the video
because<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> trucks<00:00:52.530> are<00:00:52.710> driven<00:00:52.980> by<00:00:53.190> humans

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
because the trucks are driven by humans

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.310 
because the trucks are driven by humans
but<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> only<00:00:54.870> place<00:00:55.110> I've<00:00:55.289> ever

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
but this is the only place I've ever

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
but this is the only place I've ever
lived<00:00:55.559> where<00:00:55.890> all<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> trash<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.430> emptied<00:00:56.730> by

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
lived where all the trash is emptied by

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.389 
lived where all the trash is emptied by
a<00:00:56.850> truck<00:00:57.149> with<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> giant<00:00:58.230> robotic<00:00:58.739> arm<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
a truck with a giant robotic arm on the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.910 
a truck with a giant robotic arm on the
side<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.899> all<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.079> trash<00:01:01.289> cans<00:01:01.530> are<00:01:01.710> leased

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.139 
side of it all the trash cans are leased
from<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> trash<00:01:02.370> company<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.030> have

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
from the trash company and they have

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.880 
from the trash company and they have
this<00:01:03.239> metal<00:01:03.449> bar<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> front<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.170> them<00:01:04.290> that

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
this metal bar on the front of them that

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.280 
this metal bar on the front of them that
helps<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> arm<00:01:05.309> pick<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> cans<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.330> maybe

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
helps the arm pick up the cans and maybe

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.500 
helps the arm pick up the cans and maybe
this<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:07.920> common<00:01:08.130> thing<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
is a very bike friendly town there are

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.219 
is a very bike friendly town there are
bike<00:01:20.640> lanes<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> major<00:01:21.630> streets<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
bike lanes on all the major streets and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.410 
bike lanes on all the major streets and
highways<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.640> see<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.909> all<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> video

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420

I've<00:01:24.540> been<00:01:24.659> playing<00:01:24.900> since<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.259> started<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
I've been playing since this started and

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.399 
I've been playing since this started and
there's<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> lot<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.090> bike<00:01:27.360> activity<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
there's a lot of bike activity here I

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.010 
there's a lot of bike activity here I
know<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.770> isn't<00:01:28.950> unique<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.579> Albany<00:01:29.970> exactly

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
know this isn't unique to Albany exactly

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.080 
know this isn't unique to Albany exactly
it's<00:01:31.380> more<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.680> an<00:01:31.829> Oregon<00:01:32.250> thing<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.729> there's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
it's more of an Oregon thing and there's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.370 
it's more of an Oregon thing and there's
a<00:01:33.150> lot<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.390> larger<00:01:33.720> cities<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.110> are<00:01:34.229> bike

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
a lot of larger cities that are bike

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.440 
a lot of larger cities that are bike
friendly<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> relatively<00:01:36.060> small

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
friendly but this is a relatively small

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.200 
friendly but this is a relatively small
town<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.869> 50,000<00:01:37.590> people<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.040> they<00:01:38.759> seem<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
town of 50,000 people and they seem to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.330 
town of 50,000 people and they seem to
spare<00:01:39.450> no<00:01:39.479> expense<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.380> making<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.130> roads

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
spare no expense on making the roads

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.789 
spare no expense on making the roads
wider<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.270> bikes<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.689> fit<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:42.960> them<00:01:43.110> better<00:01:43.619> I

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
so many churches so this is a nice

so many churches so this is a nice
change<00:02:45.890> number<00:02:46.890> four<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.550> another<00:02:47.760> one

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
change number four this is another one

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.640 
change number four this is another one
that<00:02:47.970> kind<00:02:48.240> of<00:02:48.330> seems<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.020> blow<00:02:49.260> people's

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
that kind of seems to blow people's

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.530 
that kind of seems to blow people's
minds<00:02:49.920> when<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.190> tell<00:02:50.400> them<00:02:50.520> this<00:02:50.700> but<00:02:50.880> it's

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
minds when I tell them this but it's

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.720 
minds when I tell them this but it's
illegal<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.380> pump<00:02:52.620> your<00:02:52.800> own<00:02:52.830> gas<00:02:52.920> in<00:02:53.340> Oregon

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
illegal to pump your own gas in Oregon

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.160 
illegal to pump your own gas in Oregon
and<00:02:53.940> I'm<00:02:54.150> serious<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.660> can<00:02:54.780> actually<00:02:54.930> get

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
and I'm serious you can actually get

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.410 
and I'm serious you can actually get
arrested<00:02:55.440> for<00:02:56.190> pumping<00:02:56.460> your<00:02:56.640> own<00:02:56.730> gas<00:02:56.940> here<00:02:57.240> I

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
arrested for pumping your own gas here I

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.090 
arrested for pumping your own gas here I
think<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.230> only<00:02:58.380> other<00:02:58.440> state<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:58.830> does

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
think the only other state that does

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.610 
think the only other state that does
this<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.400> New<00:02:59.580> Jersey<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.170> assume<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.320> reason

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
this is New Jersey I assume the reason

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.320 
this is New Jersey I assume the reason
for<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.280> tweakers<00:03:02.850> can<00:03:03.120> still

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
for this is so that tweakers can still

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.930 
for this is so that tweakers can still
find<00:03:03.480> work<00:03:03.720> but<00:03:04.650> when<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:04.980> go<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.340> gas

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
find work but when you go to a gas

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.360 
find work but when you go to a gas
station<00:03:06.000> some<00:03:06.870> guy<00:03:06.990> comes<00:03:07.260> out<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.440> takes

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.550 
in town with photocopied lists of all
the<00:03:57.030> homeless<00:03:57.209> facilities<00:03:57.810> in<00:03:57.959> Albany<00:03:58.350> and

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
the homeless facilities in Albany and

town I've ever lived in that has just

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:15.189 
town I've ever lived in that has just
coffee<00:06:13.550> Hut's<00:06:13.909> little<00:06:14.270> shacks<00:06:14.569> that<00:06:15.020> you

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 
coffee Hut's little shacks that you

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.809 
coffee Hut's little shacks that you
drive<00:06:15.500> up<00:06:15.650> and<00:06:15.860> get<00:06:16.129> coffee<00:06:16.339> from<00:06:16.610> them

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:16.819 
drive up and get coffee from them

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.320 
drive up and get coffee from them
everywhere<00:06:17.599> and<00:06:18.550> finally<00:06:19.550> number<00:06:19.819> 10<00:06:20.120> we

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
everywhere and finally number 10 we

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.110 
everywhere and finally number 10 we
don't<00:06:20.509> pay<00:06:20.689> sales<00:06:20.990> tax<00:06:21.319> in<00:06:21.680> Oregon<00:06:22.129> you<00:06:22.339> know

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
don't pay sales tax in Oregon you know

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.550 
don't pay sales tax in Oregon you know
it's<00:06:23.240> another<00:06:23.419> statewide<00:06:23.810> thing<00:06:24.169> so<00:06:24.349> I<00:06:24.379> guess

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
it's another statewide thing so I guess

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.019 
it's another statewide thing so I guess
I<00:06:24.680> should<00:06:24.830> have<00:06:24.919> called<00:06:25.219> this<00:06:25.370> list<00:06:25.639> random

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:26.029 
I should have called this list random

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:27.790 
I should have called this list random
facts<00:06:26.330> about<00:06:26.539> Oregon<00:06:27.169> instead<00:06:27.529> of<00:06:27.620> about

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
facts about Oregon instead of about
