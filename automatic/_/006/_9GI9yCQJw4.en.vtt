 they offer the superior polytechnic school 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.710
 we wanted to make a presentation of

 very important business and it is a great

 who have done a university degree 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.309
 of video game design 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.770
 will be of that sector so big that 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.020
 you still have to leave it and there are still 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.510
 to finish the set will be 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.190
 best prepared in the market for 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.320
 conform the curriculum of this 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.790
 new grade the university has counted 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.820
 with the collaboration of companies 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.699
 Aragonese experts in the field 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.960
 degree has been divided into four modules 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.199
 focused on creative design the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.809
 science engineering technology and even 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.250
 the creation of your own company all the 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.220
 world when we hear about videogames 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.960
 we think of the fifa in the halo games of 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.520
 that type but there is a niche market 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.560
 that to me particularly at the level 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.000
 staff seems super interesting that 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.770
 are the games oriented to another type of 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.299
 market I'm talking from the games 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.909
 that Fernando Alonso can use in 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.530
 simulations in formula1 videogames that 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.689
 use doctors to learn to 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.600
 paste better nurses to treat better 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.159
 patients in the same act has been 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.439
 made delivery of the prizes to the five 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.690
 winners of the second app contest 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.050
 mobile that consisted in devising 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.510
 application for mobile application 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.970
 is on the mobile phone by a 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.940
 gps system you can locate in your 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.650

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.780
 celiac and then if you travel in the case of 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.190
 that you go through the state of Spain 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.260
 you can also find them with greater 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.060

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.920
