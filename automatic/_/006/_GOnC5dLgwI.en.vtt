00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the ledge with so that might have

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.880 
the ledge with so that might have
something<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.270> missed<00:01:27.930> invincible

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
something to do with missed invincible
wavelengths<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.299> that's<00:01:30.689> something

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
wavelengths now I think that's something

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990 
wavelengths now I think that's something
that<00:01:31.170> should<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.439> looked<00:01:31.560> into<00:01:31.740> yeah<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that should be looked into yeah like a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.069 
that should be looked into yeah like a
smash<00:01:33.810> board<00:01:34.110> start<00:01:34.350> about<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.680> anyways<00:01:35.189> oh

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
smash board start about it anyways oh

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.249 
smash board start about it anyways oh
that<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.200> concern<00:01:37.500> DJ<00:01:38.070> DJ<00:01:38.759> taking<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.270> quick

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that one concern DJ DJ taking a quick

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.830 
that one concern DJ DJ taking a quick
lead<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.400> not<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.119> hugely<00:01:42.450> cuz

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
lead right now it's not a hugely cuz

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.780 
lead right now it's not a hugely cuz
Spock's<00:01:43.439> videos<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.130> definitely<00:01:44.460> still

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
Spock's videos but it's definitely still

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.420 
Spock's videos but it's definitely still
a<00:01:44.850> solid<00:01:45.060> lead<00:01:45.270> yeah<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.860> long<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.189> DJ

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
a solid lead yeah and as long as DJ

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.670 
a solid lead yeah and as long as DJ
places<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.030> evasive<00:01:48.420> safe<00:01:48.750> style<00:01:49.049> he<00:01:49.500> can

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
places like evasive safe style he can

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.230 
places like evasive safe style he can
just<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.070> lots<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.430> extra<00:01:50.759> credit<00:01:50.939> while

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
just get lots of extra credit while

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.330 
just get lots of extra credit while
forcing<00:01:51.899> ready<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.320> come<00:01:52.470> Adam<00:01:52.590> right

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
forcing ready to come Adam right

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.520 
forcing ready to come Adam right
so<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.000> think<00:01:54.060> that's<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.929> another

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
so I think that's one of the another

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.039 
so I think that's one of the another
thing<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.859> makes<00:01:56.210> DJ<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.420> good<00:01:57.659> at<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> Fox

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
thing that makes DJ so good at the Fox

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.139 
thing that makes DJ so good at the Fox
they<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:58.320> because<00:01:59.159> he<00:01:59.250> plays<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.700> so<00:01:59.880> safe

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
they do because he plays it so safe

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.849 
they do because he plays it so safe
there's<00:02:00.509> less<00:02:00.750> chance<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.500> hitting<00:02:01.679> them

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
there's less chance of you hitting them

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.349

strange<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:18.220> think<00:03:19.220> he's<00:03:19.519> predicting<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.660> he

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
strange I think he's predicting that he

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.809 
strange I think he's predicting that he
is<00:03:21.050> going<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.260> come<00:03:21.379> at<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:21.890> DJ<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:22.519> just

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
is going to come at it and DJ is just

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.979 
is going to come at it and DJ is just
keeping<00:03:23.599> his<00:03:23.750> distance<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.260> waiting<00:03:24.590> oh<00:03:24.800> no

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
keeping his distance and waiting oh no

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.479 
keeping his distance and waiting oh no
you<00:03:26.989> really<00:03:27.170> need<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:27.440> Edgar<00:03:27.920> idea<00:03:28.160> then<00:03:28.370> you

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
you really need that Edgar idea then you

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.490 
you really need that Edgar idea then you
did<00:03:28.610> oh<00:03:28.790> great<00:03:29.510> shield<00:03:29.810> pressure<00:03:30.019> no<00:03:30.230> pressure

did oh great shield pressure no pressure

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.800 
did oh great shield pressure no pressure
although<00:03:31.129> I<00:03:31.519> think<00:03:31.640> ash<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.330> grabbed<00:03:32.629> would

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.059 
although I think ash I grabbed would
have<00:03:32.900> been<00:03:32.989> more<00:03:33.110> appropriate<00:03:33.319> that<00:03:33.830> point

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
have been more appropriate that point

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.750 
have been more appropriate that point
right<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:36.260> guaranteed<00:03:36.830> i<00:03:37.099> don't<00:03:37.580> know<00:03:37.640> i'm
