it could be part of matrix po if they

00:02:50.740 --> 00:03:01.830 
it could be part of matrix po if they
ever<00:02:50.830> came<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.160> Bollywood<00:03:00.300> was<00:03:01.300> very<00:03:01.510> involved

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
ever came to Bollywood was very involved

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.440 
ever came to Bollywood was very involved
in<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.200> costumes<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.700> course<00:03:03.940> we<00:03:04.060> started

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
in the costumes and of course we started

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.970 
in the costumes and of course we started
off<00:03:04.570> with<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:05.140> idea<00:03:05.260> where<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.800> would<00:03:05.920> be

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
off with the idea where it would be

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.670 
off with the idea where it would be
futuristic<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.850> extremely<00:03:07.209> most<00:03:07.870> space<00:03:08.200> AG

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
futuristic and extremely most space AG

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.470 
futuristic and extremely most space AG
but<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:08.890> think<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.459> know<00:03:09.550> Farah<00:03:09.880> came<00:03:10.240> in<00:03:10.360> and

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
but I think you know Farah came in and

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.030 
but I think you know Farah came in and
she<00:03:10.600> wanted<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:10.990> to<00:03:11.020> be<00:03:11.230> slightly<00:03:11.740> more

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
she wanted it to be slightly more
