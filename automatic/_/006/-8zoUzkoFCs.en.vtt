whatever<00:01:43.079> bubble<00:01:43.770> comes<00:01:44.250> over<00:01:44.490> here<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.820> says

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
whatever bubble comes over here and says

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.510 
whatever bubble comes over here and says
like<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.350> shows<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> grave<00:01:47.040> or<00:01:47.630> explosion<00:01:48.630> or

some<00:01:50.520> weird<00:01:50.970> symbols<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:54.119> think<00:01:54.450> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
some weird symbols and so you think that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.940 
some weird symbols and so you think that
I<00:01:54.630> would<00:01:54.780> tell<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.320> what<00:01:55.560> they<00:01:55.680> were<00:01:55.740> doing

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
but most of the time it just stuffs up

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.310 
but most of the time it just stuffs up
and<00:01:58.710> they<00:01:58.820> take<00:01:59.820> them<00:02:00.030> about<00:02:00.270> 30<00:02:00.719> Ford's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.590 
it's just annoying um that yeah and also
the<00:02:09.539> AI<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:10.140> some<00:02:10.670> superhuman<00:02:11.670> accuracy

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
the AI have some superhuman accuracy

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.150 
the AI have some superhuman accuracy
they<00:02:12.750> don't<00:02:12.960> feel<00:02:13.200> cumin<00:02:13.620> at<00:02:13.740> all<00:02:13.920> I'm

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
they don't feel cumin at all I'm

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.790 
they don't feel cumin at all I'm
basically<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.390> isolate<00:02:15.690> them<00:02:16.410> they'll

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
basically if you isolate them they'll

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.680 
basically if you isolate them they'll
just<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.310> crazy<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.650> just<00:02:20.420> most<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.510> them

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
just do crazy and just most of them

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.000 
just do crazy and just most of them
kill<00:02:21.960> themselves<00:02:22.140> actually<00:02:23.450> but<00:02:24.450> if<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.470> like

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
kill themselves actually but if you like

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.150 
kill themselves actually but if you like
put<00:02:26.310> them<00:02:26.460> like<00:02:26.690> within<00:02:27.690> firing<00:02:28.440> range<00:02:28.680> view

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
put them like within firing range view

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.730 
put them like within firing range view
all<00:02:29.310> freakin<00:02:29.760> fur<00:02:30.720> grenades<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.530> were

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
all freakin fur grenades that you were

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.360 
all freakin fur grenades that you were
the<00:02:32.250> most<00:02:32.430> insane<00:02:33.090> accuracy<00:02:33.900> ever<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.530> this

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
the most insane accuracy ever and this

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.790 
the most insane accuracy ever and this
is<00:02:35.580> really<00:02:35.790> annoying<00:02:36.140> also<00:02:37.140> another<00:02:37.350> flaw<00:02:37.680> in

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
is really annoying also another flaw in

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.550 
is really annoying also another flaw in
the<00:02:37.890> game<00:02:37.920> play<00:02:38.340> was<00:02:38.520> on<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.090> double<00:02:39.270> jump<00:02:39.720> you

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
the game play was on the double jump you

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.730 
the game play was on the double jump you
know<00:02:40.970> at<00:02:41.970> double<00:02:42.600> jumps<00:02:42.900> backwards<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.590> know

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
know at double jumps backwards I know

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.240 
know at double jumps backwards I know
I'm<00:02:44.660> get<00:02:45.660> used<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.350> but<00:02:46.530> it's<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:46.920> random

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
I'm get used to it but it's so random

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.520 
I'm get used to it but it's so random
like<00:02:47.790> why<00:02:48.450> can't<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.840> just<00:02:48.870> double<00:02:49.320> jump

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
like why can't you just double jump

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.930 
like why can't you just double jump

lot of customization options and most

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.120 
lot of customization options and most

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
part it was pretty good it I haven't

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.830

played<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.490> first<00:05:10.699> one<00:05:10.849> but<00:05:11.120> I'd<00:05:11.240> say<00:05:11.479> this<00:05:11.690> is

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
played the first one but I'd say this is

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.040 
played the first one but I'd say this is
probably<00:05:12.110> a<00:05:12.550> big<00:05:13.550> improvement<00:05:13.880> on<00:05:14.240> it<00:05:14.419> I'm<00:05:14.630> not

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
probably a big improvement on it I'm not

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.559 
probably a big improvement on it I'm not
sure<00:05:15.110> why<00:05:15.470> I<00:05:15.500> say<00:05:15.830> that<00:05:16.069> but<00:05:16.430> I'm<00:05:17.150> pretty<00:05:17.419> sure

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
sure why I say that but I'm pretty sure

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.430 
sure why I say that but I'm pretty sure
it<00:05:17.810> would<00:05:18.319> have<00:05:18.409> been<00:05:18.560> I'm<00:05:18.800> but<00:05:19.610> if<00:05:19.819> you<00:05:20.380> are<00:05:21.380> a
