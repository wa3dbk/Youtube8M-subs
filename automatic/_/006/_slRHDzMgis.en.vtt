00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.250
 we have a studio doctor them litvak 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.250
 specialist in laser dentistry 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.200
 hello doctor laser appeared not 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.730
 yesterday 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.630
 60s already sounds interesting 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.270
 of the last century, most recently were already 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.160
 lasers and we already used but only in 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.660
 lately they have really entered 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.960
 Dentistry confidently and today it 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.160
 the area is unthinkable without lasers 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.149
 represents laser dentistry 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.309
 today what we owe to laser laser 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.980
 Dentistry is a dentistry that 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.100
 which use laser instead 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 drills and scalpel 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.270
 it is clear that not everything can be done by laser 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.040
 Well, I think I see here that 90 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.719
 percent of the application procedure 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.350
 Dentistry can be diagnosed then I 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.690
 slightly mistaken the treatment of measles assad 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.489
 which treatment of the wheel is right I 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.170
 I do not really like treatment again because 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.330
 just not really can be treated it needs 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.850
 remove caries but not only diseases 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.069
 weaving result this result is necessary 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.100
 remove it as caries is removed and 

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:17.399
 drill the same thing done by laser 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.170
 a ray but the difference is completely different yes the device 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:26.039
 the car is the same horror simply is not as 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.569
 terrible that puts pressure on the psyche that 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:31.080
 occurs during treatment with 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:33.179
 lasers for josh my radiates second 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.340
 the queue no touch like on 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.979
 distance at a distance and that is it 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.890
 the distance therefore the pain is almost not 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.099
 there is a night I can tell from my 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:48.820
 13 years of experience is about 90 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:52.060
 percent of the procedures on the teeth are not 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.729
 do not need anesthesia and not because 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.409
 binds people to the chair but because 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.540
 they just don't want it they don't 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.100
 feel pain almost does not feel can 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.770
 be some kind of small sensitivity 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.320
 but still people prefer this 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.580
 little sensitivity sometimes 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.610
 in most cases nothing at all 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.870
 felt and than we take anesthesia 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.090
 some kind of little clean 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.330
 vocals are better after all and to resort here 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.709
 closer'a this very gentle technology 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.080
 in principle, she is not only young 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.820
 as you said that the laser and there are 60 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.410
 it's all right but it was 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.510
 laser which acts on soft tissue 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.030
 and we have dentistry and soft and 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.760
 hard fabric to hard fabric lasers 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.230
 there is really already in practice 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.230
 about 15 years old and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.709
 you can not do today, in principle, everything 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.570
 this is allowed to do any bodies 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.239
 health like american where tell 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.830
 they already recognized that all procedures in 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.870
 principle in dentistry you can do 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.269
 laser cat they do not come does not lead 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.650
 to no in a row and they only lead 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.410
 to positive 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.340
 do not save it saves a tooth in essence 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:13.510
 affairs evaporate only certain 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:16.090
 pathological area all theory theory 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.549
 almost everyone knows and can clap 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.680
 read in general a lot of sites and 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.290
 there is only the clinical work 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.690
 that they are laser and superior to all 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.820
 other natural technologies ex i 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.880
 I call them former for me they are far away 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.200
 the former is already proven in thousands of different 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.200
 scientific and clinical 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.959
 tests but let's mean list 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.760
 the most common procedures 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:50.239
 who do lazar whiten teeth 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.920
 bleaching but it said hit strikes 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:57.239
 what else can you remove the stones 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.790
 canal disinfection can be done to the forest 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.890
 root canal is the most important thing 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.000
 speak dough treatment or when we 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.689
 talking endodontics 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.359
 we mean that this channel which we 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:12.120
 must abruptly place which killed 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.040
 sigh today today we can when 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.370
 laser help make give go of 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.720
 inspections honor 97 percent of all 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.530
 micron will not be there and it is quite 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.620
 enough for the treatment of periodontal disease that is 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.020
 do not do the operation can do the operation 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.150
 also reliable but the most important goal and 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.280
 lasers it prevent surgery 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.050
 Nadya prosthetics used 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.240
 the laser today struck the blame for 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.650
 is used 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.419
 that is, the crown itself, it certainly is not 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.550
 done by laser though today they 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.270
 are made in laboratories, too, some 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.900
 laser button devices 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.670
 Of course, the treatment of the tooth itself can 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.750
 also do laser but it is also so 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.670
 hastily how 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.290
 barbashin thank you so much doctor and i 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.920
 I wish all our 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:04.310
 treat your teeth without pain thanks for it 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.500
 we leave on this we talk about 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.120
 panic 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.120
 with him how to get rid of them
