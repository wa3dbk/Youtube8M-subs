00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.620
 bible guy 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.360
 The game is practically having a great 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.430
 sucking with new players 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.960
 You want to be the guy you have to be. 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.649
 ready for everything the game will play in 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.559
 on top of you 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.090
 and then the name of gaia plays a lot more 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.090
 much the same 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.530
 batman arkham came out in batman arkham 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.049
 asylum one of the cool things the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.799
 Theft was batman confrontation against the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.600
 straw man 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.909
 after all, in addition to the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.710
 replay the game was through and the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.810
 the night turns into predator prey 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.150
 in the final confrontation between the two 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.670
 soon goes there and still puts a whore one 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.799
 slut that is where you induced to find 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.229
 that Batman died and will not end 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.490
 there they lie to tighten the niterÃ³i 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.049
 You discover that it was just another 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.240
 the mallandro's catch and that the man 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.229
 The bat was completely out of 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.229
 suffering hallucinations 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.230
 the next game we have it is 10 min 10 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.770
 started last week is the rhyme already 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.660
 had a great goal to have fun 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.030
 complete all the quests much less 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.770
 arrive at level 20 wrong try 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.960
 again everyone passing from the level 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.820
 20 goes to the second phase of the game knows 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.740
 that the great challenge of this is to achieve 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.080
 a roy screen has lots of people who have spent 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.090
 after more than 200 hours and at a 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.800
 least until last week the weapon was 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.590
 practically impossible to disregard 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.479
 very rare even here in the week 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.000
 without telling anyone 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.070
 the show went there and began to sell la mirada 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.780
 only wonder now imagine that you 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.480
 got the gun finally after 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.280
 a lot of trying the week before this is 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.420
 essential five of them in the butt and pull 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.400
 one for each side right 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.990
 What the fuck do you think the people who 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.670
 got the gun that does not know yet that 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.480
 the weapon will be marked as soon as the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.430
 Beijing 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.610
 the next on the franchise list to arrive 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.959
 because I really do not want to 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.130
 being in the middle of these people I got 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.290
 my technique quite easily 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.290
 but anyway it was pure luck 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.160
 closing the list of we have mortal 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.290
 kombat 2 was a shooter game 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.790
 in an extremely funny way there 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.590
 in 1993 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.690
 the game arcade version had a 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.190
 diagnostics screen that will display a 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.530
 information series such as 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.540
 score fights against already control 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.190
 smuc and against the world know the three 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.840
 secret characters of the game that 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.920
 world has discovered a way or 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.500
 another to face 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.269
 in addition the game also had the largest 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.340
 sucking, the number of 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.380
 transformations of a character who 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.239
 It was never included in the robbery but 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.269
 appears on the background of the hawk scenery 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.400
 caught in chains knows who knows what 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.290
 exactly happened a lot of people 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.400
 lost hours and more hours of life and 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.110
 trying to find a way to 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.840
 become the fifth without the least 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.910
 success since it is impossible to know which 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.560
 kind of making people obnoxious 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.549
 to continue playing the game in the 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.549
 we recovered and spent money 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.480
