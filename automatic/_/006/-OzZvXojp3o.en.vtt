00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
if i get in code a spot maybe courtesy

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.840 
if i get in code a spot maybe courtesy
but<00:03:07.660> if<00:03:08.660> i<00:03:08.840> get<00:03:09.230> spot<00:03:09.470> i<00:03:09.500> will<00:03:09.859> play<00:03:10.489> for<00:03:10.549> sure

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
but if i get spot i will play for sure

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.770 
but if i get spot i will play for sure
if<00:03:11.090> i<00:03:11.920> don't<00:03:12.920> get<00:03:13.100> spot<00:03:13.340> i<00:03:13.370> will<00:03:13.730> try<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.569> play

if i don't get spot i will try to play
the<00:03:14.810> qualifiers<00:03:15.410> ok<00:03:16.069> so<00:03:16.519> there's<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.790> chance

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
the qualifiers ok so there's a chance

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.180 
the qualifiers ok so there's a chance
that<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.209> could<00:03:17.329> be<00:03:17.420> invited<00:03:17.840> back<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.950> not

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
that you could be invited back and not

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.940 
that you could be invited back and not
have<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.459> qualify<00:03:19.609> I<00:03:20.109> guess<00:03:21.109> so<00:03:21.319> if<00:03:21.500> they<00:03:21.739> still

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
have to qualify I guess so if they still

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.180 
have to qualify I guess so if they still
got<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.370> exchange<00:03:22.910> program<00:03:23.829> you<00:03:24.829> know<00:03:24.980> if<00:03:25.069> you

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
got the exchange program you know if you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.670 
got the exchange program you know if you
do<00:03:25.370> very<00:03:25.970> well<00:03:26.030> here<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:26.780> believe<00:03:27.200> its<00:03:27.500> top

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.319 
do very well here I believe its top
three<00:03:28.010> if<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:28.519> get<00:03:28.639> top<00:03:28.850> three<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.150> get<00:03:29.269> a

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
three if you get top three you get a

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.720 
three if you get top three you get a
code<00:03:29.540> s<00:03:29.690> spot<00:03:29.930> if<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.530> other<00:03:30.650> guys<00:03:30.829> already

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
code s spot if the other guys already

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.420 
code s spot if the other guys already
