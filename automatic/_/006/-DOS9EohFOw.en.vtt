00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
posted the video about our put in the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.860 
posted the video about our put in the
description<00:03:34.490> what<00:03:35.490> he<00:03:35.580> is<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.000> how<00:03:36.300> cheap<00:03:36.600> is

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
description what he is and how cheap is

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.740 
description what he is and how cheap is
so<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.380> thought<00:03:37.800> I'd<00:03:37.920> go<00:03:38.040> after<00:03:38.100> Brianna<00:03:38.490> and<00:03:39.209> I

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
so I thought I'd go after Brianna and I

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.820 
so I thought I'd go after Brianna and I
managed<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.260> game<00:03:40.560> 4<00:03:42.080> 900<00:03:43.080> cranes<00:03:43.350> which<00:03:43.620> is

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
managed to game 4 900 cranes which is

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.759 
managed to game 4 900 cranes which is
quite<00:03:44.130> expensive<00:03:44.489> but<00:03:44.790> for<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.810> player<00:03:46.590> is

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
quite expensive but for a player is

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.430 
quite expensive but for a player is
standard<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.550> I<00:03:48.360> think<00:03:48.870> he'll<00:03:48.989> fit<00:03:49.140> straight

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
standard and I think he'll fit straight

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.699 
standard and I think he'll fit straight
in<00:03:49.680> it's<00:03:50.340> good<00:03:50.519> in<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.700> air<00:03:50.850> fast<00:03:51.470> good<00:03:52.470> long

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
in it's good in the air fast good long

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.790 
in it's good in the air fast good long
shot<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.780> hopefully<00:03:54.780> he'll<00:03:55.290> be<00:03:55.320> good<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:55.769> the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
shot so hopefully he'll be good in the

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.820 
shot so hopefully he'll be good in the
future

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.950 

also<00:04:00.700> I<00:04:00.880> looked<00:04:01.120> through<00:04:01.360> a<00:04:01.450> few<00:04:01.720> bronze

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
also I looked through a few bronze

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.750 
also I looked through a few bronze
players<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.470> found<00:04:02.650> this<00:04:02.770> player<00:04:03.070> called

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
players and found this player called

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.660 
players and found this player called
Charles<00:04:04.300> it's<00:04:05.170> fast<00:04:05.440> defender<00:04:05.950> so<00:04:06.160> I've<00:04:06.430> not

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
Charles it's fast defender so I've not

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
Charles it's fast defender so I've not
realized<00:04:06.910> I<00:04:07.060> didn't<00:04:07.270> really<00:04:07.390> think<00:04:07.480> that

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
realized I didn't really think that

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.100 
realized I didn't really think that
there'd<00:04:08.470> be<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.590> Barnes<00:04:08.860> played<00:04:09.010> with<00:04:09.220> 74<00:04:09.670> pace

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
who I thought looking at that didn't

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.020 
who I thought looking at that didn't
have<00:04:34.600> very<00:04:34.720> good<00:04:34.810> stats<00:04:35.200> but<00:04:36.100> this<00:04:36.850> is<00:04:37.000> a

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
have very good stats but this is a

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.020 
have very good stats but this is a
lesson<00:04:37.480> learnt<00:04:37.930> well<00:04:38.080> to<00:04:38.260> be<00:04:38.380> honest<00:04:38.560> because

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
lesson learnt well to be honest because

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.530 
lesson learnt well to be honest because
once<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.150> got<00:04:40.240> into<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.570> game<00:04:40.890> he<00:04:41.890> actually

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
once I got into the game he actually

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.360 
once I got into the game he actually
made<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.570> few<00:04:43.810> substitutions<00:04:44.500> and<00:04:45.040> brought

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
made a few substitutions and brought

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.410 
made a few substitutions and brought
rebury<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.830> robin<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.010> another<00:04:48.790> strike<00:04:49.090> run

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
rebury and robin and another strike run

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.850 
rebury and robin and another strike run
while<00:04:50.320> we<00:04:51.250> was<00:04:51.370> playing<00:04:51.700> so<00:04:52.510> I<00:04:52.540> thought<00:04:53.530> that

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
while we was playing so I thought that

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.130 
while we was playing so I thought that
kind<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.400> changed<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:54.880> change<00:04:55.690> what<00:04:55.870> happened

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
kind of changed the change what happened

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.320 
kind of changed the change what happened
there<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:57.190> he<00:04:57.640> got<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.910> first<00:04:58.090> goal

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
there and he got the first goal

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
there and he got the first goal
obviously<00:04:59.190> with<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.360> Robin<00:05:01.360> just<00:05:02.170> kill<00:05:02.320> it

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
obviously with the Robin just kill it

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.720 
obviously with the Robin just kill it
from<00:05:02.590> outside<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.950> box<00:05:03.130> he's<00:05:03.370> basically

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
from outside the box he's basically

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.940 
from outside the box he's basically
going<00:05:03.880> to<00:05:03.940> be<00:05:04.000> at<00:05:04.240> any<00:05:04.390> keeper<00:05:04.800> because<00:05:05.800> my

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
going to be at any keeper because my

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.360 
going to be at any keeper because my
keepers<00:05:06.430> terrible<00:05:07.710> is<00:05:08.710> only<00:05:08.890> six<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.250> eight

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
keepers terrible is only six to eight

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.270 
keepers terrible is only six to eight
and<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:09.790> is<00:05:10.180> gonna<00:05:10.870> swallow<00:05:11.140> easily<00:05:11.560> but

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
and so is gonna swallow easily but

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.180 
and so is gonna swallow easily but
luckily<00:05:12.520> I<00:05:13.560> even<00:05:14.560> with<00:05:14.680> all<00:05:14.830> these<00:05:14.980> great

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
luckily I even with all these great

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.890 
luckily I even with all these great
players<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:15.669> managed<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.150> get<00:05:16.330> any<00:05:16.480> equalizer

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
players I managed to get any equalizer

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.720 
players I managed to get any equalizer
thought<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.680> was<00:05:17.800> going<00:05:17.919> to<00:05:17.980> shoot<00:05:18.130> past<00:05:18.520> it

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.610 
thought I was going to shoot past it
simply<00:05:19.180> that's<00:05:19.810> what<00:05:19.930> I<00:05:19.960> had<00:05:20.050> to<00:05:20.110> do<00:05:20.260> really

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
simply that's what I had to do really

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.590
