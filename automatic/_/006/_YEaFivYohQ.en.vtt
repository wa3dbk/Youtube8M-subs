00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.079
 it is 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:11.109
 hello asks then 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.539
 I could have told you about my presence of experience in 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.630
 physiotherapy at the game i dealt mostly% of courses to rodez saying 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.999
 I took what is minimalist shoes 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.479
 but I think that if we want to change the debate to another level 

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:25.189
 to talk about science 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.279
 and dangerous talk about scientific literature 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.189
 presently elsewhere than any clinical study 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.940
 girlie the heart party the traditional shoe and maya at least good 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.860
 as the minimalist shoes small goal 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.410
 no clinical study in the company of two fat 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.780
 who followed him in time and who after a while to check his 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.380
 injury knowledge the participants' comfort and performance after a 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.740
 time 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.160
 they were some 5000 parks by even annexing taxes 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.210
 but that has no effect patience 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.829
 and there you expose yourself to three little things that are very rigorous 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.340
 from a scientific point of view and that we can debate more than that by the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.150
 after 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.059
 first of all you have to know that the new technologies presented 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.590
 annually by the shoe companies are without any foundation 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.360
 scientist saleh 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.680
 the second thing absorption into the chansonneurs but will diminish in any way the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.430
 stress in the hot seat 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.829
 we are talking about people talking about donation by hiring 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.280
 absorption and integrated integrators in shoes do not 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.600
 not reduce the incidence of injury 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.710
 it does not increase perceived comfort 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.590
 read four good studies on the subject three of the valves that mayenne 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.080
 totaling May 7 subject to military and courts had erupted 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.440
 kim further that when making a choice of a rare chance that wrongly takes for 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.040
 one who is he is too quick to part 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.800
 not changing anything leaving his wounds 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.150
 and even though the numbers is not significant the trend and we have 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.480
 worsened the situation 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.749
 another small point 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.829
 things will be more expensive are not more comfortable they do not diminish 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.700
 the incidence of injuries 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.700
 it's parties it's what literature makes France cause 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.690
 the other thing that literature is a fact that vinci has announced that the 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.879
 song will have side effects 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.629
 we know that they change the natural biomechanics 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.309
 we know that they change the sequences of muscle contractions you run 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.429
 differently and beautiful but what we treat differently 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:22.279
 we also know that the thing is dying - dermato it does not tend me to 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:26.430
 increase what is called the ground impact the vatican must start 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.940
 this is the new trend 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.669
 at the research level for 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.799
 percent because it's a recently published systematic review like 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.189
 return 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.489
 7 Impact Strength Theses Associated with Stressors 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.369
 so I think we showed 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:42.689
 a little video 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.769
 look at how the little cursor flashing red is very fast 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:47.539
 from the beginning 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:51.039
 the reason for this is that this individual attacks talent 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:52.999
 in this way 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.839
 the small red slider the speed at which we live they soar 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:58.389
 and what's called the Vatican was raising one but that was associated with 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.919
 stressors 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:04.480
 if we account for 80% of the costs approaching on coup signed modern course of this 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:05.389
 way 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.430
 if you compare it to a show on 100 to someone running barefoot 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.949
 or can observe that he first attacks the forefoot 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.119
 that the speed of impact force applied 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.939
 and much softer 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:22.559
 80% of the fast costs of the contest like that and if we remove the shoes 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.540
 to someone who has big shows is dying in the space of a few steps 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.339
 for 80% of them 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:31.339
 they exchange their best but that year to run that way 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.139
 we also know that the thing is dying weakened the foot tissue 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.409
 several studies on the subject there are even level deformations before 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.699
 but like the famous hazards the bus 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.239
 we also know that it diminishes balance proprioception 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.239
 and we know that it increases oxygen consumption 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.750
 in short the question is rather why years 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.990
 we will not be able to continue that's the big question 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.910
 it's not between the minima left the big shake but that's why not 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.539
 run barefoot 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.679
 three main factors 

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:05.059
 the cold actually with quebec is several months they are a small 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:06.449
 little complex 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:10.199
 the dangerous surfaces again it's a pure to the tf 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.959
 but these hand seizures and we can get hurt with the surfaces 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.989
 but especially the condescending glances the species assayas 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.609
 back at dinner 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:25.550
 the solution to the nations this re5 the bar near the sensations of the soil 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.029
 who does not interfere with fabien letennier 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:32.009
 which paris 9 years the most minimalist passed but which is very light and 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.479
 which is very flexible we are talking here about luck the minimalist 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.639
 so this is the solution we found with all the problems we have 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:40.580
 obtained 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.349
 but the minimalists for whom 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.729
 certainly for our children who are developing and who are virgins of 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.889
 biomechanical points of view and who have adaptability 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.529
 much higher than we can believe 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:53.529
 certainly also for beginners 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.539
 there is currently no scientific reason to recommend a chance 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.209
 on coupons signed and absorbing in the person who started a program of 

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:04.430
 running 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.300
 you have extra weight 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.009
 you are dangerous for yourself so you need to develop 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.110
 moderation behaviors of a carpet are effective 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.560
 you have to run lighter the best way to learn to 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.659
 to run light is to run barefoot 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.480
 so preferred at least the minimalist shoes 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.490
 many signed shoes 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.089
 you attack talent 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:27.099
 the cause of luck 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.490
 runners who hardly attack a very rare talent to see 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.650
 sessions and proprio talents this exceptional 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.689
 so if that's the cause 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.759
 why continue running with that to clarify for those who attack the 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:39.680
 talent 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.150
 you want to perform there is no reason to run 80% of your volume 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.930
 driving much thing is dying 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.450
 wear minimalist shoes to do the performance and intervals 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.850
 hoped to be as good performance performer 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.990
 40 80% of your workout time is with a shoe that loads your 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.830
 biomechanics 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.750
 short to conclude the promotion and the prescription of shoes technology 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.319
 that the one made by health professionals now by ignorance 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.840
 elsa shares 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.699
 lucky shops 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.340
 park information biased by what they receive their information the 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.650
 most of the time 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.800
 it is done by magazines 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.159
 perfect on 10 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:24.159
 because without advertising of things getting up we can not survive 

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:29.879
 and it's like that everywhere but it's done by the shoe companies by 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.469
 financial interest 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:35.409
 so let's not be over compared to all the marketing that surrounds everything 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:36.089
 it 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:39.860
 and I learn that iraq with the exception of some special cases with 

00:06:39.859 --> 00:06:41.999
 special pathologies 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:46.289
 there is currently no scientific reason to prescribe and to do the 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.289
 promotion of the left to get back together 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.059
 Why j
