00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
else so let's start at the thinking

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.649 
else so let's start at the thinking
about<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:08.670> are<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> cards<00:01:09.090> SP<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.420> mean<00:01:09.570> we

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
about what are the cards SP I mean we

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.120 
about what are the cards SP I mean we
can<00:01:09.780> pretty<00:01:09.810> much<00:01:10.049> guess<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> hidden

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
can pretty much guess what a hidden

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.429 
can pretty much guess what a hidden
arsenal<00:01:11.250> sevens<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.850> because<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.750> duel

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
arsenal sevens can because it's to duel

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.679 
arsenal sevens can because it's to duel
terminal<00:01:13.619> sets<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:14.549> together<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.450> what<00:01:15.600> are

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
terminal sets but together but what are

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.390 
terminal sets but together but what are
these<00:01:15.780> ten<00:01:16.020> cards<00:01:16.229> gonna<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.619> hopefully<00:01:17.250> some

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
these ten cards gonna be hopefully some

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.280 
these ten cards gonna be hopefully some
number<00:01:17.700> cards<00:01:18.090> maybe<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.390> giant<00:01:18.930> grinder<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
number cards maybe a giant grinder I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.530 
number cards maybe a giant grinder I
think<00:01:19.619> that's<00:01:19.770> number<00:01:20.009> 15<00:01:20.490> number<00:01:20.970> 15<00:01:21.150> giant

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
think that's number 15 number 15 giant

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.390 
think that's number 15 number 15 giant
grinder<00:01:21.869> or<00:01:21.900> maybe<00:01:22.740> some<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.979> these<00:01:23.040> cards

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
grinder or maybe some of these cards

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.270 
grinder or maybe some of these cards
