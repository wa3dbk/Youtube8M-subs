00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.590
 What we have set for something is the family . 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.250
 Defender culture has developed this 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.600
 2 We did not do that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.190
 I'm writing to tell you it's better . 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.269
 Tips to give a receipt received this Thing 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:50.320
 Oh, no. Oh, and you have not set one. 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:56.140
 I do not know what to do, 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:59.700
 The environment is created, and when we work on the tip , 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:05.199
 Do we have to think 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:10.360
 Oh, if we give them what we need not to be, they're wrong. 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:13.119
 The tip is that I am now in regulation at this station 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:19.340
 I just did this deal. 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:25.040
 If your opponent does a deal, you should be kind to me more than the standard. 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:31.030
 Off avoid any further inconvenience to my two very henggeo are trying to do something 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.030
 If there's anything I need to do, I'll have to pay more for something. 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:41.290
 But because I do not get the price out of the regulations, it's because this guy did it well. 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.620
 It would have to be TV to pay that price to this person . 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.120
 I went to a bar. 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:52.000
 I have a mistake in it. 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:57.460
 And do not keep drinking. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:04.450
 But naohmyeonseo drinks will also be wrong in obtaining these orders to zoom it t 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:06.460
 Something I olttaeneun coming to this pub aura will also be something different away 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.899
 There will be a reason. 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.970
 By the side 2 If I get a little bit of this 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.970
 I have to do something for him. 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.780
 If you do not hurry, you have to make an effort. 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.550
 On tv 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:32.460
 Oh, where is it ? I go sightseeing, so this is a tip 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.460
 If you tell them that you have to leave 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.680
 I could not bear to come put you out if you learned some basics 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.799
 And 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.590
 I can come and eat. 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.940
 Then everyone else is better, why are you not good 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.750
 I do not have anything to do with me. 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:57.030
 The tip is to give to the person who gives it. 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:59.750
 Well , then, if I let the people of the G-Seven Hotel in front of me 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.390
 It will be in two days 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.460
 Besides that, 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.350
 I was kind or something. I need to carry the bag. 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:14.630
 I gave it to him. 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:17.740
 If you have done that kind of heart, 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.740
 I recommend 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:27.460
 What did you do when your opponent did well and did not pay you ? 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:34.270
 Think about something I have always guilty 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:40.600
 Guilty mind, and then there is a little something I'm going to give this little toad-year-old courtyard 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:42.550
 It happens to my malyijyo this little toad on to something that has been t 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.890
 Something 2 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:53.890
 This is a good 2 minutes *. 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:58.480
 Then I will go on living this life. 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:03.420
 Things should be good malyijyo there is a good result which is not coming 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:11.069
 I do not know, I see losses 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:16.919
 If you go Well, where were those that treat these that something very good Who 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:18.940
 When I came to give you something to do exactly what I had, 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.370
 I will 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.370
 So what I do is get caught 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:30.539
 This is the law of nature . 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:35.759
 Also, do not forget in front of Barranquilla 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:37.949
 I'm the person to do something this place is on the line ah haeteuni this happen to my 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:41.400
 If I wanted to do this 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:47.910
 Come on. This is not a loss to you. 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:50.290
 Energy deseo different sizes if I turn my energy would also rather turn 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:55.660
 Also coming in 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:05:00.960
 Uh , if I had been taught to these people here that I left the phone , 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:07.260
 I'll write it if I want to write something economical. 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:11.790
 Once written elsewhere it will be supplemented with a yo-yo're back 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:17.020
 If you spend money right in the fast pace 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:22.240
 It comes to us as a ship. 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:25.510
 Well, if I did not put this in the right place , 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:31.000
 I can not afford it. 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:36.270
 This one word has released the wrong one will get out well let them come in here. 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.080
 It should not have come malyijyo This is causing a great loss 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:44.819
 Man should be free from hanging. 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:49.589
 That's why I'm studying right and wrong. 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:53.760
 And I will not do what is not done and give strength to my shoulders. 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:58.200
 It gave a tip I have to give and do not pull their doors 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:03.210
 No, you can not give them white. 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:06.120
 My opponent did not try, but once I give it up, I get disgusted. 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:12.900
 Then I will become - 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:14.400
 Liege is trying handeda opponent if I do not pay it, I shrug 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.040
 do 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:24.250
 That two days are not called. 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:30.550
 The child that we are giving and receiving is the energy 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:32.980
 Oh, how we yoge I went along the same passion we solved them very well 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:38.080
 My life is joyful. 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:42.780
 We do good things like this and we live our lives like this. 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.080
 So now, what is in-house and what we are giving and receiving is great 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:49.360
 Important 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:52.410
 2 There is a principle of circulation. 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.410
 Yes, yes.
