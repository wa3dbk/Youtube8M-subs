00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.499 
it's also a straight-up upgrade from the
original<00:01:19.860> bow<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.610> doesn't<00:01:21.000> necessarily<00:01:21.360> make

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
original bow it doesn't necessarily make

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.420 
original bow it doesn't necessarily make
the<00:01:21.659> cut<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.049> terms<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.470> top-tier<00:01:22.950> Malee's

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
the cut in terms of top-tier Malee's

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
the cut in terms of top-tier Malee's
mainly<00:01:23.850> due<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.150> fact<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.689> has<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> low

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
mainly due the fact that it has a low

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.780 
mainly due the fact that it has a low
critical<00:01:25.650> chance<00:01:25.860> rating<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.460> although<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
critical chance rating and although a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.640 
critical chance rating and although a
high<00:01:27.030> impact<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.750> better<00:01:27.990> than<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> highest

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
high impact is better than a highest

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.170 
high impact is better than a highest
slash<00:01:28.860> rating<00:01:29.310> not<00:01:29.700> having<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> lot<00:01:30.150> of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
slash rating not having a lot of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.670 
slash rating not having a lot of
puncture<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.750> make<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:30.990> really<00:01:31.229> difficult<00:01:31.409> to

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
puncture can make it really difficult to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.200 
puncture can make it really difficult to
deal<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:31.950> high-level<00:01:32.280> armored<00:01:32.939> units

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
deal with high-level armored units

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.179 
deal with high-level armored units
especially<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> new<00:01:34.020> t4<00:01:34.560> Keys<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.070> the

especially with a new t4 Keys in the
voids<00:01:40.759> alright<00:01:41.759> guys<00:01:41.939> let's<00:01:42.150> talk<00:01:42.270> about<00:01:42.450> how

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
voids alright guys let's talk about how

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.389 
voids alright guys let's talk about how
to<00:01:42.570> model<00:01:42.840> our<00:01:42.990> bow<00:01:43.259> Prime<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.130> weapon

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
to model our bow Prime and this weapon

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.190 
to model our bow Prime and this weapon
actually<00:01:44.490> came<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.880> two<00:01:45.090> polarities<00:01:45.479> one<00:01:46.110> is

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
actually came with two polarities one is

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870 
actually came with two polarities one is
the<00:01:46.409> D<00:01:46.590> slot<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.009> top<00:01:47.220> left<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:47.759> we

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the D slot in the top left because we

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.490 
the D slot in the top left because we
all<00:01:47.970> know<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> D<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.780> loves<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.170> put<00:01:49.350> this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
all know that D just loves to put this

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.660 
all know that D just loves to put this
polarity<00:01:49.740> slot<00:01:50.070> there<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.430> don't<00:01:50.579> worry

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
polarity slot there but don't worry

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.609 
polarity slot there but don't worry
we'll<00:01:50.970> work<00:01:51.000> through<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.600> then<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> V

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
we'll work through it and then a V

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.620 
we'll work through it and then a V
polarity<00:01:53.070> slot<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> stance

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
polarity slot and then for the stance

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.090 
polarity slot and then for the stance
polarity<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.259> matching<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> flailing

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
polarity it's matching the flailing

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.709 
polarity it's matching the flailing
branch<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.790> mentioned<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.240> gameplay

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
branch like I mentioned in the gameplay

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.170 
branch like I mentioned in the gameplay
so<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.320> mean<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> stances<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.790> more<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
so I mean with the stances is more of a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.550 
so I mean with the stances is more of a
personal<00:02:00.540> preference<00:02:00.750> thing<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.320> actually

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
personal preference thing I actually

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.490 
personal preference thing I actually
like<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> flailing<00:02:02.189> branch<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:03.450> find<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.409> gives

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
like the flailing branch I find it gives

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.800 
like the flailing branch I find it gives
fine<00:02:04.829> dps<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.759> has<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> knock<00:02:06.119> down<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.630> it's

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
fine dps and it has a knock down so it's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.080 
fine dps and it has a knock down so it's
great<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.190> also<00:02:08.340> don't<00:02:08.580> see<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.910> worth

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
great and I also don't see the worth

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.570 
great and I also don't see the worth
informing<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.259> weapon<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.160> clashing

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
informing the weapon for the clashing

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.680 
informing the weapon for the clashing
forest<00:02:12.000> even<00:02:12.180> though<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.540> do<00:02:12.599> an

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
forest even though you can do an

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.880 
forest even though you can do an
unlimited<00:02:12.900> combo<00:02:13.470> with<00:02:13.620> that

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
unlimited combo with that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.770 
unlimited combo with that
which<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> lot<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.400> fun<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.240> foiling<00:02:15.569> branch

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
which is a lot of fun the foiling branch

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.500 
which is a lot of fun the foiling branch
is<00:02:15.960> fine<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:17.160> terms<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.640> raw<00:02:17.940> damage<00:02:18.150> mods

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
is fine in terms of the raw damage mods

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.240 
is fine in terms of the raw damage mods
on<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.110> weapon<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.800> we're<00:02:19.950> gonna<00:02:20.069> be<00:02:20.220> using

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
on the weapon so we're gonna be using

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.400 
on the weapon so we're gonna be using
pressure<00:02:20.790> point<00:02:21.090> 420<00:02:21.690> percentage<00:02:21.990> from<00:02:22.080> melee

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
pressure point 420 percentage from melee

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.860 
pressure point 420 percentage from melee
damage<00:02:22.590> I'm<00:02:23.069> running<00:02:23.610> Fury<00:02:24.209> for<00:02:24.450> extra<00:02:24.660> attack

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
damage I'm running Fury for extra attack

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.780 
damage I'm running Fury for extra attack
speed<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.380> killing<00:02:26.250> blow<00:02:26.400> for<00:02:26.580> extra

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
speed and killing blow for extra

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.100 
speed and killing blow for extra
channeling<00:02:27.180> damage<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.690> I'm<00:02:27.959> actually

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
channeling damage and I'm actually

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.600 
channeling damage and I'm actually
running<00:02:28.410> spoiled<00:02:28.950> strike<00:02:29.130> on<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.340> weapon

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
running spoiled strike on the weapon

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.250 
running spoiled strike on the weapon
because<00:02:29.819> it's<00:02:29.970> viable<00:02:30.450> because<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.020> attack

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
because it's viable because the attack

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.750 
because it's viable because the attack
speed<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.770> good<00:02:32.070> enough<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.490> you're<00:02:32.640> not

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
speed is good enough so you're not

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.300 
speed is good enough so you're not
losing<00:02:33.090> DPS<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.680> you're<00:02:34.770> not<00:02:34.860> being<00:02:35.010> punished

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
losing DPS so you're not being punished

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.770 
losing DPS so you're not being punished
for<00:02:35.340> using<00:02:35.490> this<00:02:35.760> mod<00:02:35.910> like<00:02:36.150> for<00:02:36.300> example<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
for using this mod like for example the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.199 
for using this mod like for example the
Reaper<00:02:37.110> Prime<00:02:37.350> video<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.709> covered<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.880> viable

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
Reaper Prime video I covered is viable

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.520 
Reaper Prime video I covered is viable
on<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:39.660> weapon<00:02:40.020> so<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.110> actually<00:02:40.380> get<00:02:40.500> more

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
on this weapon so you actually get more

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.070 
on this weapon so you actually get more
damage<00:02:41.190> than<00:02:41.760> using<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.239> corrupt<00:02:42.540> charge<00:02:42.810> in

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
damage than using the corrupt charge in

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.050 
damage than using the corrupt charge in
this<00:02:43.200> instance<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.370> other<00:02:44.520> greatly<00:02:44.790> cool

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
this instance and the other greatly cool

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.720 
this instance and the other greatly cool
thing<00:02:45.239> about<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.480> weapon<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.050> has<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
thing about this weapon is it has the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.820 
thing about this weapon is it has the
25%<00:02:47.730> status<00:02:48.510> base<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.350> can<00:02:49.470> use<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
25% status base so you can use the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.640 
25% status base so you can use the
Vergil<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.310> scourge<00:02:50.690> which<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.959> course<00:02:52.230> is

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
Vergil and scourge which of course is

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.380 
Vergil and scourge which of course is
now<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> drop<00:02:53.190> tables<00:02:53.610> like<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.030> also

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
now in the drop tables like I also

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.350 
now in the drop tables like I also
mentioned<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.470> previous<00:02:55.620> video<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.269> you

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
mentioned in a previous video and so you

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.790 
mentioned in a previous video and so you
get<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.570> 60<00:02:57.840> percent<00:02:58.110> extra<00:02:58.230> poison<00:02:58.680> damage

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
get the 60 percent extra poison damage

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.050 
get the 60 percent extra poison damage
and<00:02:59.070> then<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.220> get<00:02:59.340> some<00:02:59.489> status<00:02:59.850> chance

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
and then you get some status chance

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.550 
and then you get some status chance
which<00:03:00.209> pumps<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.570> up<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.750> about<00:03:00.900> 40<00:03:01.200> percent

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
which pumps you up to about 40 percent

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.740 
which pumps you up to about 40 percent
which<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.739> nice<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.850> weapon<00:03:03.180> then<00:03:03.390> after

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
which is nice on the weapon then after

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.790 
which is nice on the weapon then after
that<00:03:03.840> all<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.110> got<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.230> really<00:03:04.470> worried<00:03:04.680> about

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
that all you got a really worried about

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.310 
that all you got a really worried about
is<00:03:05.280> what<00:03:05.910> elements<00:03:06.360> you're<00:03:06.480> using<00:03:06.690> on<00:03:07.110> the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
is what elements you're using on the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.140 
is what elements you're using on the
different<00:03:07.680> factions<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.459> first<00:03:08.670> one<00:03:08.970> is

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
different factions so this first one is

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.420 
different factions so this first one is
for<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.780> Grenier<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.590> what<00:03:10.739> I've<00:03:10.830> first<00:03:11.100> done

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
for the Grenier and what I've first done

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.699 
for the Grenier and what I've first done
is<00:03:11.670> I've<00:03:12.239> actually<00:03:12.450> used<00:03:12.690> Northwind<00:03:13.410> in<00:03:13.590> the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
is I've actually used Northwind in the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.410 
is I've actually used Northwind in the
deep<00:03:13.890> Larry<00:03:14.190> slot<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.730> then<00:03:14.940> Bridgeland

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
deep Larry slot and then Bridgeland

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.090 
deep Larry slot and then Bridgeland
scourge<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.930> will<00:03:16.050> give<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.260> my<00:03:16.410> viral<00:03:16.890> and

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
scourge this will give you my viral and

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.699 
scourge this will give you my viral and
because<00:03:17.730> 40%<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.480> decent<00:03:18.930> enough<00:03:18.959> viral<00:03:19.560> I'll

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
because 40% is decent enough viral I'll

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.170 
because 40% is decent enough viral I'll
actually<00:03:19.829> proc<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.730> know<00:03:20.850> pretty

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
actually proc you know pretty

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.780 
actually proc you know pretty
consistently<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.709> it'll<00:03:23.070> work<00:03:23.310> really<00:03:23.340> well

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
consistently and it'll work really well

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.120 
consistently and it'll work really well
from<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.150> from<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.480> proc<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.709> then<00:03:25.799> after

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
from you from the proc and then after

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.740 
from you from the proc and then after
that<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.430> just<00:03:26.459> build<00:03:26.820> radiation<00:03:27.480> from<00:03:27.600> the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
that you just build radiation from the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.210 
that you just build radiation from the
focus<00:03:28.110> energy<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.620> also<00:03:28.739> get<00:03:28.890> 40<00:03:29.130> percent

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
focus energy you also get 40 percent

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.940 
focus energy you also get 40 percent
extra<00:03:29.519> channeling<00:03:29.910> efficiency<00:03:30.390> with<00:03:30.630> this<00:03:30.950> so

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
extra channeling efficiency with this so

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.770 
extra channeling efficiency with this so
you<00:03:32.010> will<00:03:32.280> be<00:03:32.459> three<00:03:32.790> energy<00:03:33.360> per<00:03:33.510> strike

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
you will be three energy per strike

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.110 
you will be three energy per strike
instead<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.140> five<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:35.700> course<00:03:35.940> with<00:03:36.060> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
instead of five and of course with the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.979 
instead of five and of course with the
molten<00:03:36.269> impact<00:03:36.630> they'll<00:03:36.750> give<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.959> a

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
molten impact they'll give you a

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.140 
molten impact they'll give you a
radiation<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:37.829> good<00:03:38.340> against<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.670> alloyed

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
radiation so good against the alloyed

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.910 
radiation so good against the alloyed
target<00:03:39.570> units<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.170> they<00:03:40.230> want<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.410> proxy<00:03:40.799> get

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
target units and they want to proxy get

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.069 
target units and they want to proxy get
the<00:03:41.010> confusion<00:03:41.549> effect

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
the confusion effect

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.350 
the confusion effect
moving<00:03:43.079> on<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.410> Corpus<00:03:43.890> now<00:03:44.100> so<00:03:44.850> for<00:03:45.030> Corpus

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
moving on to Corpus now so for Corpus

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.970 
moving on to Corpus now so for Corpus
what<00:03:45.510> I've<00:03:45.600> done<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:46.049> kind<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> same<00:03:46.709> thing

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
what I've done is kind of the same thing

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.699 
what I've done is kind of the same thing
but<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.280> course<00:03:47.489> I've<00:03:47.850> made<00:03:48.720> magnetic<00:03:49.260> now<00:03:49.410> so

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
but of course I've made magnetic now so

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.289 
but of course I've made magnetic now so
focus<00:03:50.070> energy<00:03:50.220> plus<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.700> north<00:03:50.880> wind<00:03:51.150> gives

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
focus energy plus the north wind gives

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.759 
focus energy plus the north wind gives
you<00:03:51.390> magnetic<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.019> then<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.470> version<00:03:52.739> of

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
you magnetic and then the version of

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.650 
you magnetic and then the version of
scourge<00:03:53.010> makes<00:03:53.310> up<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.579> toxic<00:03:53.790> damage<00:03:54.239> which

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
scourge makes up the toxic damage which

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.620 
scourge makes up the toxic damage which
is<00:03:54.950> good<00:03:55.950> against<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.400> flush<00:03:57.030> units<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.480> the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
is good against the flush units of the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.449 
is good against the flush units of the
corpus<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.410> goes<00:03:58.530> through<00:03:58.799> shields<00:03:59.280> so

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
corpus and it goes through shields so

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.490 
corpus and it goes through shields so
damage<00:03:59.970> against<00:04:00.150> shield<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.660> this<00:04:00.959> will<00:04:01.140> hit

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
damage against shield and this will hit

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.670 
damage against shield and this will hit
the<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:02.100> health<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.519> fleshy<00:04:02.940> units<00:04:03.680> before

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
the the health of fleshy units before

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.229 
the the health of fleshy units before
the<00:04:04.980> shields<00:04:05.220> are<00:04:05.280> even<00:04:05.459> drop<00:04:05.700> which<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:05.940> nice

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
the shields are even drop which is nice

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.970 
the shields are even drop which is nice
and<00:04:06.450> then<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.140> other<00:04:07.260> thing<00:04:07.440> I've<00:04:07.560> done<00:04:07.680> is<00:04:07.860> I

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
and then the other thing I've done is I

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.640 
and then the other thing I've done is I
put<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.250> smite<00:04:08.640> corpus<00:04:09.239> in<00:04:09.420> here<00:04:09.630> which<00:04:09.870> was

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
put a smite corpus in here which was

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.590 
put a smite corpus in here which was
just<00:04:10.920> enough<00:04:11.250> ma<00:04:11.760> capacity<00:04:12.120> points<00:04:12.329> to<00:04:12.420> fit

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
just enough ma capacity points to fit

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.539 
just enough ma capacity points to fit
this<00:04:12.720> in<00:04:12.989> which<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.590> great

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
this in which is great

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.250 
this in which is great
this<00:04:15.090> wants<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.480> lot<00:04:15.570> however<00:04:15.810> though<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.019> can

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
this wants a lot however though you can

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.229 
this wants a lot however though you can
use<00:04:16.310> if<00:04:17.310> you're<00:04:17.489> finding<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:17.910> you're<00:04:18.030> having

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
use if you're finding that you're having

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.789 
use if you're finding that you're having
bad<00:04:18.600> survivability<00:04:19.109> or<00:04:19.289> something<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.620> could

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
bad survivability or something you could

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.560 
bad survivability or something you could
use<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.039> life<00:04:20.310> strike<00:04:20.579> in<00:04:20.760> here<00:04:20.940> if<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.180> wanted

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
use a life strike in here if you wanted

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.630 
use a life strike in here if you wanted
but<00:04:22.049> if<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.229> just<00:04:22.410> want<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.830> most<00:04:23.039> damage

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
but if you just want the most damage

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.670 
but if you just want the most damage
possible<00:04:24.120> smite<00:04:24.570> corpus<00:04:24.960> is<00:04:25.110> your<00:04:25.320> best<00:04:25.560> bet

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
possible smite corpus is your best bet

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.430 
possible smite corpus is your best bet
in<00:04:26.039> there

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
in there

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.590 
in there
moving<00:04:28.160> on<00:04:28.280> to<00:04:28.460> infested<00:04:29.000> now<00:04:29.120> so<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.450> same

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
moving on to infested now so the same

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.000 
moving on to infested now so the same
kind<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.840> thing<00:04:30.020> is<00:04:30.140> set<00:04:30.350> now<00:04:30.620> what<00:04:30.860> I've<00:04:30.980> done

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
kind of thing is set now what I've done

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.980 
kind of thing is set now what I've done
is<00:04:31.400> because<00:04:31.850> again<00:04:32.030> because<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.570> good<00:04:32.690> status

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
is because again because the good status

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.590 
is because again because the good status
I've<00:04:33.320> built<00:04:33.800> gas<00:04:34.130> electric<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:35.180> when<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.450> gas

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
I've built gas electric so when the gas

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.410 
I've built gas electric so when the gas
procs<00:04:35.990> you'll<00:04:36.530> get<00:04:36.800> an<00:04:37.400> AoE<00:04:37.670> explosion<00:04:38.270> there

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
procs you'll get an AoE explosion there

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.580 
procs you'll get an AoE explosion there
it<00:04:38.510> all<00:04:38.570> suppose<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.840> dot<00:04:39.080> effect<00:04:39.200> on<00:04:39.500> the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
it all suppose a dot effect on the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.410 
it all suppose a dot effect on the
enemies<00:04:39.890> and<00:04:40.100> then<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.640> electric<00:04:41.060> will<00:04:41.210> work

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
enemies and then the electric will work

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.780 
enemies and then the electric will work
as<00:04:41.600> like<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.870> stun<00:04:42.380> effect<00:04:42.560> like<00:04:42.890> a<00:04:42.980> chain<00:04:43.280> kind

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
as like a stun effect like a chain kind

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.250 
as like a stun effect like a chain kind
of<00:04:43.910> stun<00:04:44.120> on<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.270> infested<00:04:44.720> which<00:04:44.870> is<00:04:45.020> good

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
of stun on the infested which is good

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.500 
of stun on the infested which is good
when<00:04:45.620> it<00:04:45.770> procs<00:04:46.040> as<00:04:46.220> well<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.670> then<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.330> same

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
when it procs as well and then the same

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.720 
when it procs as well and then the same
thing<00:04:47.720> I've<00:04:47.840> used<00:04:48.080> a<00:04:48.230> smite<00:04:48.500> effects<00:04:48.830> tested

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
thing I've used a smite effects tested

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.820 
thing I've used a smite effects tested
for<00:04:49.970> kind<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.630> like<00:04:50.720> a<00:04:50.780> top<00:04:50.990> damages<00:04:51.560> most

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
for kind of like a top damages most

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.010 
for kind of like a top damages most
damage<00:04:52.190> as<00:04:52.370> possible<00:04:52.490> I<00:04:53.180> mean<00:04:53.690> after<00:04:53.870> that

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
damage as possible I mean after that

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.260 
damage as possible I mean after that
when<00:04:54.260> we're<00:04:54.410> talking<00:04:54.560> about<00:04:54.830> voids<00:04:55.430> basically

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
when we're talking about voids basically

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.510 
when we're talking about voids basically
the<00:04:56.390> first<00:04:56.600> thing<00:04:56.870> we<00:04:57.020> got<00:04:57.200> to<00:04:57.230> do<00:04:57.470> is<00:04:57.680> a<00:04:58.070> switch

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
the first thing we got to do is a switch

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.160 
the first thing we got to do is a switch
show<00:04:58.730> the<00:04:59.060> molten<00:04:59.450> impact<00:04:59.840> for<00:05:00.670> Northwind<00:05:02.170> we

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
show the molten impact for Northwind we

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.270 
show the molten impact for Northwind we
do<00:05:03.290> a<00:05:03.320> little<00:05:03.470> switch<00:05:03.680> here<00:05:03.920> so<00:05:04.010> this<00:05:04.130> will

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
do a little switch here so this will

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.950 
do a little switch here so this will
give<00:05:04.370> you<00:05:04.460> corrosive<00:05:04.910> cold<00:05:05.150> now<00:05:05.330> so<00:05:05.570> corrosive

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
give you corrosive cold now so corrosive

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.230 
give you corrosive cold now so corrosive
as<00:05:06.050> good<00:05:06.230> against<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.790> Gunners<00:05:07.790> and<00:05:08.030> stuff

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
as good against the Gunners and stuff

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.880 
as good against the Gunners and stuff
and<00:05:08.450> Northwind<00:05:09.410> is<00:05:09.470> good<00:05:09.620> against<00:05:09.800> the

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
and Northwind is good against the

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.770 
and Northwind is good against the
shielded<00:05:10.220> units<00:05:10.490> as<00:05:10.580> well<00:05:10.760> as<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:10.970> Lancers<00:05:11.570> so

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
shielded units as well as the Lancers so

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.780 
shielded units as well as the Lancers so
good<00:05:11.990> all-around<00:05:12.200> damage<00:05:12.860> here<00:05:13.160> and<00:05:13.250> then

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
good all-around damage here and then

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.490 
good all-around damage here and then
again<00:05:14.000> you<00:05:14.330> have<00:05:14.360> the<00:05:14.630> option<00:05:15.020> if<00:05:15.170> you<00:05:15.320> want

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
again you have the option if you want

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.050 
again you have the option if you want
you<00:05:15.710> can<00:05:15.860> run<00:05:16.070> life<00:05:16.550> strike<00:05:16.850> for

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
you can run life strike for

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.420 
you can run life strike for
survivability<00:05:17.540> type<00:05:18.500> of<00:05:18.680> thing<00:05:18.890> you<00:05:19.340> could

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
survivability type of thing you could

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.270 
survivability type of thing you could
also<00:05:19.670> run<00:05:19.970> corrupt<00:05:20.450> charge<00:05:20.720> for<00:05:21.590> more<00:05:21.770> damage

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
also run corrupt charge for more damage

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.360 
also run corrupt charge for more damage
I<00:05:22.430> usually<00:05:23.140> classify<00:05:24.140> this<00:05:24.200> as<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.890> bane<00:05:25.100> mod

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
I usually classify this as the bane mod

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.720 
I usually classify this as the bane mod
for<00:05:25.640> the<00:05:25.730> voids<00:05:26.440> and<00:05:27.440> also<00:05:27.830> if<00:05:28.040> you<00:05:28.160> have<00:05:28.400> a

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
for the voids and also if you have a

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.670 
for the voids and also if you have a
voltage<00:05:29.210> strike<00:05:29.720> which<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.200> didn't<00:05:30.380> including

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
voltage strike which I didn't including

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.260 
voltage strike which I didn't including
the<00:05:30.740> other<00:05:30.860> bills<00:05:31.130> because<00:05:31.520> this<00:05:31.730> mod<00:05:31.910> isn't

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
the other bills because this mod isn't

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.580 
the other bills because this mod isn't
in<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.420> drop<00:05:32.630> tails<00:05:32.840> yet<00:05:33.110> but<00:05:33.260> if<00:05:33.350> you<00:05:33.440> have

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
in the drop tails yet but if you have

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.050 
in the drop tails yet but if you have
this<00:05:33.770> from<00:05:33.950> the<00:05:34.040> event<00:05:34.310> you<00:05:34.400> can<00:05:34.490> also<00:05:34.610> use<00:05:34.880> it

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
this from the event you can also use it

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.090 
this from the event you can also use it
to<00:05:35.090> get<00:05:35.270> more<00:05:35.540> status<00:05:35.990> and<00:05:36.170> it<00:05:36.620> also<00:05:36.830> will<00:05:37.010> help

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
to get more status and it also will help

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.910 
to get more status and it also will help
you<00:05:37.400> with<00:05:37.700> your<00:05:37.870> I<00:05:38.870> also<00:05:39.410> help<00:05:39.620> you<00:05:39.710> with<00:05:39.770> your

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920 
you with your I also help you with your

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.860 
you with your I also help you with your
corrosive<00:05:40.340> damage<00:05:40.370> but<00:05:41.090> if<00:05:41.510> you<00:05:41.600> don't<00:05:41.750> have

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
corrosive damage but if you don't have

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.840 
corrosive damage but if you don't have
that<00:05:42.020> mod<00:05:42.230> again<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.770> probably<00:05:43.190> what<00:05:43.550> I<00:05:43.580> would

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
that mod again you probably what I would

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.550 
that mod again you probably what I would
use<00:05:44.060> if<00:05:44.360> I<00:05:44.450> didn't<00:05:44.630> have<00:05:44.750> that<00:05:44.780> mod<00:05:45.020> as<00:05:45.170> I<00:05:45.290> still

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
use if I didn't have that mod as I still

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.100 
use if I didn't have that mod as I still
would<00:05:45.710> use<00:05:45.920> the<00:05:46.550> Krupp<00:05:47.450> charge<00:05:47.690> there<00:05:47.930> it<00:05:48.020> is

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
would use the Krupp charge there it is

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.870 
would use the Krupp charge there it is
and<00:05:48.800> that's<00:05:49.040> it<00:05:49.190> guys<00:05:49.370> so<00:05:49.550> I<00:05:49.580> hope<00:05:49.670> you<00:05:49.760> liked
