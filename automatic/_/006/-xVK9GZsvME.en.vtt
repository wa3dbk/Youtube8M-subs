00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.260 

in<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.860> cover<00:02:46.069> that<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.340> did<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.849> song<00:02:47.090> I

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
in the cover that I did of the song I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.030 
in the cover that I did of the song I
did<00:02:47.540> not<00:02:47.720> need<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.080> bridge<00:02:48.260> because<00:02:48.860> the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
did not need the bridge because the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.910 
did not need the bridge because the
bridge<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:49.640> kind<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:50.000> bunch<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.300> whoa

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
bridge is just kind of a bunch of whoa

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.250 
bridge is just kind of a bunch of whoa
just<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:52.040> bunch<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.340> O's<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:53.000> whose<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.480> Oz<00:02:53.599> so

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
just a bunch of O's and whose and Oz so

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.110 
just a bunch of O's and whose and Oz so
it<00:02:55.010> doesn't<00:02:55.310> really<00:02:55.370> sound<00:02:55.610> good<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.030> I'll

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
it doesn't really sound good and I'll

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.670 
it doesn't really sound good and I'll
think<00:02:56.300> without<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.569> full<00:02:56.810> band<00:02:56.989> doing<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.470> but

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
think without a full band doing it but

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.070 
think without a full band doing it but
again<00:02:57.920> that's<00:02:58.099> a<00:02:58.370> minor

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
again that's a minor

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.809 
again that's a minor
-<00:03:01.080> game<00:03:01.500> honor
