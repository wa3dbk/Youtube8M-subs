team have got busy again and cut out all

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.450 
team have got busy again and cut out all
the<00:00:14.030> baseboard<00:00:15.030> for<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> fella<00:00:16.020> system<00:00:16.529> just

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
the baseboard for the fella system just

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.580 
the baseboard for the fella system just
using<00:00:17.880> an<00:00:17.970> MDF<00:00:19.039> type<00:00:20.039> wood<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:21.590> have

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
using an MDF type wood and have

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.290 
using an MDF type wood and have
countersunk<00:00:24.170> metal<00:00:25.170> thread<00:00:25.410> screws<00:00:25.939> to<00:00:26.939> hold

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
countersunk metal thread screws to hold

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
countersunk metal thread screws to hold
it<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.310> steel<00:00:29.310> frame<00:00:30.019> it's<00:00:31.019> looking<00:00:31.289> very

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
it to the steel frame it's looking very

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.720 
it to the steel frame it's looking very
good<00:00:31.669> we'll<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:34.110> sand<00:00:34.520> some<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
good we'll just have to sand some of the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.990 
good we'll just have to sand some of the
joins<00:00:36.140> but<00:00:37.140> generally<00:00:38.129> speaking<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.820> all

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
joins but generally speaking it's all

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.780 
joins but generally speaking it's all
come<00:00:39.270> together<00:00:39.480> very<00:00:39.750> nicely<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.579> next

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
come together very nicely so the next

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.660 
come together very nicely so the next
stage<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.200> know<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> pen<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.280> mark

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
stage is to you know the pen and mark

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.139 
stage is to you know the pen and mark
out<00:00:44.910> where<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.350> cut<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.739> grooves

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
out where we going to cut the grooves

00:00:47.149 --> 00:01:07.700 
out where we going to cut the grooves
for<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> various<00:00:48.750> streams<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.410> traffic<00:01:06.710> we

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
for the various streams of traffic we

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.760 
for the various streams of traffic we
had<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.729> clean<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.420> baseboard<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.350> fit

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
had to clean up the baseboard so we fit

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.960 
had to clean up the baseboard so we fit
the<00:01:11.010> rail<00:01:11.820> crossing<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:13.460> we<00:01:14.460> must<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.790> used

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the rail crossing in we must have used

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.240 
the rail crossing in we must have used
pretty<00:01:15.600> strong<00:01:15.930> glue<00:01:16.200> back<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> early

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
pretty strong glue back in the early

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.880 
pretty strong glue back in the early
days<00:01:17.840> because<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.049> took<00:01:19.200> quite<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.500> bit<00:01:19.770> of

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
days because it took quite a bit of

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.950 
days because it took quite a bit of
chiseling<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.970> get<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:23.390> we<00:01:24.390> obviously<00:01:24.540> don't

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
chiseling to get that we obviously don't

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.690 
chiseling to get that we obviously don't
have<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.350> right<00:01:25.530> tools<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> right<00:01:26.220> time

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
have the right tools at the right time

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.649 
have the right tools at the right time
but<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.659> was<00:01:27.780> effective<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:29.210> we've<00:01:30.210> got<00:01:30.450> that

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
but it was effective and we've got that

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.800 
but it was effective and we've got that
area<00:01:30.869> now<00:01:31.200> clear<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.920> we'll<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.759> able<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.150> glue

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
area now clear and we'll be able to glue

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.210 
area now clear and we'll be able to glue
it<00:01:33.960> down<00:01:34.170> later<00:01:35.420> we<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.630> did<00:01:36.840> some<00:01:37.220> flat

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
it down later we just did some flat

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.160 
it down later we just did some flat
tests<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.450> they're<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:39.600> fitted

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
tests to see that they're all fitted

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.999 
tests to see that they're all fitted
which<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.130> does<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.170> we'll<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.560> said<00:01:43.829> in

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
which it does and we'll get that said in

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.649 
which it does and we'll get that said in
soon<00:01:45.110> as<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.700> bit<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.790> distraction

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
soon as a bit of distraction

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.969 
soon as a bit of distraction
we<00:01:48.930> had<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.340> British<00:01:50.360> steel<00:01:51.360> train<00:01:51.780> snake<00:01:52.740> its

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
we had a British steel train snake its

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.749 
we had a British steel train snake its
way<00:01:53.189> round<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.420> layout<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.189> I<00:01:56.189> think<00:01:56.549> there's

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
way round the layout and I think there's

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.840 
way round the layout and I think there's
not<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.149> total<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.890> 14<00:01:58.890> wagons<00:01:59.430> all<00:01:59.670> together

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
not a total of 14 wagons all together

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.719 
not a total of 14 wagons all together
but<00:02:00.409> we<00:02:01.409> didn't<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.740> them<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:02.070> out<00:02:02.280> tonight

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
but we didn't have them all out tonight

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.499 
but we didn't have them all out tonight
that<00:02:03.630> looks<00:02:04.290> most<00:02:04.500> impressive<00:02:05.250> as<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.579> makes

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
that looks most impressive as it makes

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.859 
that looks most impressive as it makes
its<00:02:06.810> way<00:02:06.869> around<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.619> larger<00:02:08.369> layer<00:02:08.869> anyway

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
its way around the larger layer anyway

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.080 
its way around the larger layer anyway
I've<00:02:10.050> back<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.709> fellow<00:02:11.700> car<00:02:11.970> system

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
I've back to the fellow car system

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.490 
I've back to the fellow car system
and<00:02:13.209> we're<00:02:13.660> marking<00:02:14.260> out<00:02:14.500> all<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.700> lines<00:02:15.910> and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and we're marking out all the lines and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.440 
and we're marking out all the lines and
then<00:02:17.500> I'm<00:02:18.040> going<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.459> be<00:02:18.580> working<00:02:18.730> on<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
then I'm going to be working on the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.050 
then I'm going to be working on the
crossover<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.980> getting<00:02:21.280> some<00:02:21.489> filler<00:02:21.790> and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
crossover just getting some filler and

00:02:22.060 --> 00:03:11.510 
crossover just getting some filler and
try<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.510> set<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.870> into<00:02:23.200> place

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.750 

as<00:03:12.520> you<00:03:12.850> probably<00:03:13.300> seen<00:03:13.780> before<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:15.040> my<00:03:15.310> fellow

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
as you probably seen before in my fellow

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.290 
as you probably seen before in my fellow
car<00:03:16.120> series<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:16.960> use<00:03:17.860> my<00:03:18.100> wife's<00:03:18.430> bendable

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
car series I use my wife's bendable

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.670 
car series I use my wife's bendable
curve<00:03:20.230> from<00:03:21.130> her<00:03:21.370> dress<00:03:21.640> making<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:23.530> just

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
curve from her dress making it just

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.550 
curve from her dress making it just
really<00:03:23.890> handy<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.310> get<00:03:24.490> consistent<00:03:24.880> curves

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
really handy to get consistent curves

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.610 
really handy to get consistent curves
saying<00:03:26.560> just<00:03:26.890> bend<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.220> whatever<00:03:28.470> radius<00:03:29.470> you

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
saying just bend it whatever radius you

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.890 
saying just bend it whatever radius you
want<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:30.100> then<00:03:30.820> slide<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:31.300> across<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.780> you

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
want and then slide it across and you

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.800 
want and then slide it across and you
can<00:03:32.080> immediately<00:03:32.590> match<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.660> other

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
can immediately match it on the other

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.080 
can immediately match it on the other
side<00:03:35.170> so<00:03:35.860> quite<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.160> good<00:03:36.400> tool<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.670> have<00:03:37.680> as<00:03:39.090> the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
side so quite a good tool to have as the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.970 
side so quite a good tool to have as the
crossing<00:03:40.330> still<00:03:40.750> has<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.050> have<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.260> cover<00:03:41.710> put

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
crossing still has to have a cover put

the decorative side we are looking at a

the decorative side we are looking at a
couple<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.220> options<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.910> may<00:03:58.120> be<00:03:58.180> just<00:03:58.960> a

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
couple of options that may be just a

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.000 
couple of options that may be just a
plaster<00:03:59.650> bandage<00:04:00.160> type<00:04:00.490> and<00:04:01.390> surface<00:04:02.230> or<00:04:02.770> we

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
plaster bandage type and surface or we

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.310 
plaster bandage type and surface or we
might<00:04:03.190> just<00:04:03.250> use<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.940> fellow<00:04:04.210> stick<00:04:04.840> on<00:04:05.020> road

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
might just use the fellow stick on road

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.430 
might just use the fellow stick on road
surfaces<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:06.280> come<00:04:06.880> with<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.440> crossing

surfaces that come with the crossing

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.190 
surfaces that come with the crossing
kits<00:04:08.740> and<00:04:09.190> we'll<00:04:09.640> just<00:04:10.000> decide<00:04:10.420> later<00:04:10.690> on<00:04:10.990> how

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
kits and we'll just decide later on how

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.130 
kits and we'll just decide later on how
that<00:04:11.410> goes<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:12.180> just<00:04:13.180> using<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.600> speck<00:04:13.870> filler

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
that goes so just using the speck filler

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.280 
that goes so just using the speck filler
as<00:04:14.320> a<00:04:14.350> base<00:04:15.239> just<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.390> get<00:04:16.540> it<00:04:16.660> nice<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:16.870> level

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
as a base just to get it nice and level

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.150 
as a base just to get it nice and level
and<00:04:18.100> then<00:04:18.970> that'll<00:04:19.420> try<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:20.790> by<00:04:21.790> next<00:04:22.210> week

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
and then that'll try and by next week

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.870 
and then that'll try and by next week
we'll<00:04:24.160> have<00:04:24.190> set<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:25.980> we<00:04:26.980> can<00:04:27.130> then<00:04:27.340> just<00:04:27.370> glue

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
we'll have set and we can then just glue

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.510 
we'll have set and we can then just glue
the<00:04:29.670> plastic<00:04:30.670> crossing<00:04:31.270> on<00:04:31.740> in<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.890> more<00:04:33.070> secure

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
the plastic crossing on in a more secure
