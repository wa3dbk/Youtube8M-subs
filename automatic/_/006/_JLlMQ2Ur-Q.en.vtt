00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500
 Hello everyone. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 It is 【God】 thing 【ぇ ど る】. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 I would like to comment on this from "captions" (subtitles) this time as well 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Nice to meet you. 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.400
 This stage is "Action Mode 1" of "Cassandra". 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
 It is important to be careful as it appears everywhere. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 This "enemy of fire" will keep track until you defeat it! 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 Let's handle it properly. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 This "cactus" is hard to avoid plainly. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Don't make a mistake with the "quicksand" ... 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 We do not recommend this method of avoidance as it will hit if it deviates a little. 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 Quickly defeat the "Fire Enemy" and avoid the "Blue Enemy" attack! 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 If it jumps as it is, it will hit the enemy directly ... 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.500
 Abune! 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 It is important to note that there are times when this "sword" does not come out! 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Let's not fail to defeat the "Fire Enemy" here. 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.500
 That's it! Janpu ... 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.500
 Oh oh oh yeah! ? 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200
 ······Hmm? 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 Was it saved ...? 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 Apparently if you touch the “right end” of the screen, it looks like OK w 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 Wait a moment here ... 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.500
 Go! 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.700
 If you defeat him quickly, you will run away! 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Because it is a valuable item Do not forget ... 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.300
 Here, landing on the left side makes it easy to hit jumps. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Wow! ? 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Abune-Temee et al! 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.900
 That is "1up", but because the height of the scaffolding is different, the probability of being able to return here is very low, so I will go through this time. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 In fact w can beat 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500
 It is finally a "boss game"! 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.500
 Dagoba: Cassandra's ACT1 boss dives deepest in mortar-shaped sand dunes 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.500
 This boss attack is a fragment of "nails" and "rocks" from both ends. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Make sure that the “claws” are avoided by the vertical jump at the low point. 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.500
 Avoid 'rock' between 'second' and 'third' from the left. 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.500
 In addition, let's cut the number of times to "three times". 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 ※ If it is late to start cutting, even if it is "3 times", hit a "rock", 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.500
 If it is early to start cutting, it will hit the remaining "nails" 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.500
 The pattern is simple but requires considerable concentration! 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.100
 The last blow is ... 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.100
 I cut at the moment the boss hides! 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Now, "Action Mode 1" of "Cassandra" is clear. 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.500
 Then move on to the "creation mode" of "Cassandra". 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.500
 Thank you for your viewing. Let's look forward to Part 8!
