00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.700 
assuming talking about Lake 16 15 14 ish
and<00:02:08.280> I'm<00:02:08.910> 16<00:02:09.420> right<00:02:09.660> now<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> can't<00:02:10.500> believe

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
and I'm 16 right now so I can't believe

talk<00:02:10.890> about<00:02:11.130> myself<00:02:11.310> now<00:02:11.640> because<00:02:12.210> that's<00:02:12.450> not

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
talk about myself now because that's not

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.960 
talk about myself now because that's not
the<00:02:12.720> past<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.940> yeah<00:02:14.940> anyways<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:16.460> think<00:02:17.460> almost

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
the past so yeah anyways I think almost

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.030 
the past so yeah anyways I think almost
anything<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.600> can<00:02:18.750> think<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.080> can<00:02:19.440> be<00:02:19.590> compiled

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
anything I can think of can be compiled

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.200 
anything I can think of can be compiled
under<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.090> idea<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.570> like<00:02:21.780> don't<00:02:22.230> overanalyze

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
under the idea of like don't overanalyze

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.060 
under the idea of like don't overanalyze
I<00:02:24.210> used<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.690> overanalyze<00:02:25.110> things<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:25.920> gives

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
I used to overanalyze things it gives

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.030 
I used to overanalyze things it gives
nobody's<00:02:26.490> business<00:02:27.200> any<00:02:28.200> little<00:02:28.770> situation

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
nobody's business any little situation

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.850 
nobody's business any little situation
or<00:02:29.640> event<00:02:29.760> or<00:02:30.180> like<00:02:30.540> word<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.350> someone<00:02:31.560> said

or event or like word that someone said

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.680 
or event or like word that someone said
to<00:02:31.890> me<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.310> would<00:02:32.550> over<00:02:32.850> analyze<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.330> think<00:02:33.420> it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
to me I would over analyze and think it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.480 
to me I would over analyze and think it
and<00:02:33.870> just<00:02:34.440> go<00:02:34.620> over<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:34.980> again<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.190> again<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
and just go over it again and again and

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.010 
and just go over it again and again and
again<00:02:35.730> like<00:02:35.970> look<00:02:36.570> at<00:02:36.690> all<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> different

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
again like look at all the different

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.810 
again like look at all the different
options<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.740> what<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.040> could<00:02:38.190> mean<00:02:38.250> and

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
options of what it could mean and

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.230 
options of what it could mean and
consequences<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.780> blah<00:02:40.050> blah<00:02:40.080> blah<00:02:40.350> and

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
consequences and blah blah blah and

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.760 
consequences and blah blah blah and
every<00:02:42.240> little<00:02:42.540> thing<00:02:42.750> ended<00:02:43.110> up<00:02:43.230> being<00:02:43.500> some

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
every little thing ended up being some

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.880 
every little thing ended up being some
big<00:02:44.040> like<00:02:44.460> hulking<00:02:45.240> drama<00:02:45.960> like<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.740> back

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
big like hulking drama like in the back

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.750 
big like hulking drama like in the back
of<00:02:47.070> my<00:02:47.100> head<00:02:47.400> um<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.510> now<00:02:49.500> I'm<00:02:50.010> able<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.580> look

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
of my head um and now I'm able to look

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.590 
of my head um and now I'm able to look
at<00:02:50.910> things<00:02:51.060> more<00:02:51.420> simply<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:53.390> think<00:02:54.390> more

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
at things more simply and I think more

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.390 
at things more simply and I think more
realistically<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.770> just<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:56.070> lot<00:02:56.220> easier

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
realistically and it's just a lot easier

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.030 
realistically and it's just a lot easier
and<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.910> lot<00:02:57.000> happier<00:02:57.480> because<00:02:58.170> generally

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
and it's a lot happier because generally

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.830 
and it's a lot happier because generally
when<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.190> tend<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.550> overanalyze<00:02:59.760> I<00:03:00.360> always<00:03:00.600> come

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
when I tend to overanalyze I always come

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.270 
when I tend to overanalyze I always come
up<00:03:00.870> with<00:03:00.990> all<00:03:01.200> these<00:03:01.320> bags<00:03:01.590> scary

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
up with all these bags scary

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.240 
up with all these bags scary
consequences<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.380> stuff<00:03:04.380> isn't<00:03:04.740> always<00:03:04.920> bad

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
consequences and stuff isn't always bad

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.610 
consequences and stuff isn't always bad
and<00:03:05.520> scary<00:03:05.700> um<00:03:06.300> even<00:03:06.960> it<00:03:07.050> sort<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.320> seems

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
and scary um even it sort of seems

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.270 
and scary um even it sort of seems
shitty<00:03:08.130> at<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.400> time<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:09.510> yeah<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.770> think<00:03:10.950> I

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
shitty at the time so yeah I think I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.500 
shitty at the time so yeah I think I
could<00:03:11.460> have<00:03:11.550> avoided<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.970> lot<00:03:12.000> more<00:03:12.300> like

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
could have avoided a lot more like

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.620 
could have avoided a lot more like
stress<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.700> also<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> bunch<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.030> opportunities

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
stress and also a bunch of opportunities

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.080 
stress and also a bunch of opportunities
just<00:03:15.870> like<00:03:16.050> passed<00:03:16.380> me<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.740> fuck<00:03:17.040> by<00:03:17.280> because

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
just like passed me the fuck by because

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.720 
just like passed me the fuck by because
I<00:03:18.210> was<00:03:18.360> too<00:03:18.480> scared<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.810> take<00:03:19.020> them<00:03:19.490> it's<00:03:20.490> not

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
I was too scared to take them it's not

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.610 
I was too scared to take them it's not
that<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:20.910> was<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.150> lazy<00:03:21.450> although<00:03:22.440> that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
that I was like lazy although that

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.520 
that I was like lazy although that
probably<00:03:22.650> contribute<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.430> little<00:03:23.550> bit<00:03:23.820> but<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.530> I

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
probably contribute a little bit but I I

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.410 
probably contribute a little bit but I I
over<00:03:25.890> analysed<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.490> opportunity<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.360> I

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
over analysed the opportunity and I

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.360 
over analysed the opportunity and I
didn't<00:03:27.660> take<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.990> I<00:03:28.170> really<00:03:28.530> should<00:03:28.740> have<00:03:28.860> so

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
didn't take it I really should have so

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.850 
didn't take it I really should have so
yeah<00:03:30.180> that's<00:03:30.930> really<00:03:31.170> all<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.380> have<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.650> stay

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
yeah that's really all I have to stay

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
Michael and Yami's video because I felt

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.950 
Michael and Yami's video because I felt
like<00:03:49.830> my<00:03:49.890> video<00:03:50.220> was<00:03:50.400> short<00:03:50.640> and

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
like my video was short and

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.060 
like my video was short and
inconsequential<00:03:51.960> so<00:03:52.470> I'm<00:03:52.620> just<00:03:52.770> sort<00:03:53.010> of
