00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.990
 welcome to a small one 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.279
 tutorial and how to get it 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:34.550
 this beautiful technology launcher yes 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.769
 i take it with windows 8 on what was 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.460
 actually should not be a problem because 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:43.670
 that's exactly the same thing 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.769
 windows 7 or windows xp you go so 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.949
 First of all, you need a technical launcher 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:52.550
 Minecraft witch or other mod packs 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.890
 to be able to use 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.940
 as already mentioned it is one 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:05.170
 launcher that looks like that 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.170
 Statik times briefly the 20 register 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:17.159
 but be done right away what was 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.159
 may come up yet 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.829
 yes that's the whole thing 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.140
 I just had a few first 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.319
 so do not pack the three boxes 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.220
 but that's the same as 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:36.490
 the the that that that that and 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.319
 on ethno packs yes could just new hot 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.119
 add packs 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.860
 that would be me but then again 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.250
 do tutorial and that 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.709
 detailed explanation in any case 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:53.799
 are all these are all a mod of 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:55.030
 So at least 20 mods encloses so 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.149
 most of the time I believe something 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.599
 130 or so of the total of 130 mods 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.490
 separate 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:04.360
 yes, in any case show you as you 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.590
 First of all, that technology load stuff 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.410
 gets and with normal internet 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.579
 use explorer or just firefox me 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:21.180
 do my dear firefox then give her 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:21.180
 a technique 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:31.069
 launcher I prescribe myself now 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.480
 pretty much on my husband cable 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.980
 puts everything on the keyboard printer 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.480
 but just written with k 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.950
 then you go here on this page link 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.250
 but is in the description goes 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.040
 just look at it and then you are here 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.180
 then you all see here already here 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.829

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.230

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.870
 but not community technology launcher 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.489
 then there is only construction technology platform and 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.639

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.810
 then you just double- click 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.170

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.040
