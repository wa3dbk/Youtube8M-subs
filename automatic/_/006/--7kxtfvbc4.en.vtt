00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.529
 Everyone should know how to change a car wreck 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.269
 and that's not so hard 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.110
 the corresponding tool window passable HÃ¶ger 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.980
 are standard equipment in every car 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.189
 for changing from summer to winter tires and vice versa 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.690
 can remember the simple rule of enough is enough 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.790
 that is, from October to Easter 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.120
 drive with winter tires 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.040
 and from Easter to October with summer tires 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.920
 a wheel change works and what you have to pay attention to 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.560
 we give them now 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.660
 First secure your car by getting in first gear 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.770
 drive with an automatic then set the selector lever to p 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.860
 there they are then the handbrake on 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.510
 The hubcaps they can usually easily with a screwdriver 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.670
 remove 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 At first you only need to turn the wheel bolts about half a turn 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.870
 c 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.689
 look for a moment 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.359
 at which recording points and Tom phrase attach seven jacks 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.590
 have to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.380
 take care when inserting the jack on appropriate 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.440
 safety instructions 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.640
 the g11 bus on one level 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.950
 stand last surface 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.560
 Avoid gravel or sandy soils you can also use a flat 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.570
 Board keeps 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.670
 Hold the car so far that the wheel is a few inches in the air 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.100
 floats 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.100
 write the bolt abyss it removes the wheel 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.810
 and to unscrew it easier to find in the on-board tool of your car 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.190
 usually a small piece of plastic key 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.280
 with which they quickly and easily emerge the already loosened bolts 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.240
 can 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.329
 otherwise, however, that can also be done with the normal quick key or hand 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.359
 Traders should always be fixed in the same place 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.069
 Therefore they label the rescuers in front of a bearing with chalk on the gum 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.069
 or better with a white man leaning on the rim 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.499
 Crazy from steel to alloy wheels or vice versa, they may need 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.569
 use different kind of bolts 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.759

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.289

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.059
 fasten the bolts for eggs 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.969
 now lock the car in the target area bolt firmly 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:20.990
 But do not overdo it 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.749
 because even winning and felling can be damaged 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.829
 nationwide is therefore a torque wrench 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.279
 Control the wheel bolts for about 50 kilometers and pull them 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:31.879
 if necessary after 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.230

 And do not forget to check the nearest gas station for the air pressure 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.749
