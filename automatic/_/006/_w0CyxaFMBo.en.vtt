three<00:03:58.879> watching<00:03:59.299> it<00:03:59.419> after<00:03:59.720> like<00:03:59.930> guy-wire

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
three watching it after like guy-wire

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.259 
three watching it after like guy-wire
you<00:04:00.530> watched<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.829> like<00:04:00.919> five<00:04:01.129> times<00:04:01.269> I'll

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
you watched it like five times I'll

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.580 
you watched it like five times I'll
probably<00:04:02.480> watch<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:02.959> again<00:04:03.079> because<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.560> was

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
probably watch it again because it was

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.379 
probably watch it again because it was
just<00:04:03.680> so<00:04:04.010> good<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:04.549> nicely<00:04:05.000> done

and<00:04:05.660> now<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:07.430> prints<00:04:07.699> actually<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:08.150> think<00:04:08.510> he

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
and now the prints actually I think he

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.689

cuz<00:04:09.440> if<00:04:09.590> you<00:04:09.620> could<00:04:09.889> tell<00:04:10.099> I<00:04:10.129> think<00:04:10.220> his<00:04:10.489> eyes

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
cuz if you could tell I think his eyes

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.210 
cuz if you could tell I think his eyes
like<00:04:11.060> actually<00:04:11.569> so<00:04:11.780> show<00:04:12.169> some<00:04:12.379> soul<00:04:12.709> into<00:04:13.099> him

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
like actually so show some soul into him

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.039 
like actually so show some soul into him
like<00:04:13.760> he<00:04:13.940> actually<00:04:14.090> system<00:04:14.540> color<00:04:14.780> that's

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
like he actually system color that's

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.020 
like he actually system color that's
time<00:04:15.199> you<00:04:15.260> never<00:04:15.379> had<00:04:15.620> color<00:04:15.859> in<00:04:16.400> his<00:04:16.609> eyes<00:04:16.820> and

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
time you never had color in his eyes and
