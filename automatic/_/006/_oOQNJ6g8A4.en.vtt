00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530

which<00:02:15.709> I'm<00:02:15.860> going<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.430> choose<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.510> let<00:02:17.840> him

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
which I'm going to choose to let him

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.080 
which I'm going to choose to let him
walk<00:02:18.170> free<00:02:18.200> but<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.130> don't<00:02:19.160> agree<00:02:19.580> with<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.910> I

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
walk free but I don't agree with that I

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.090 
walk free but I don't agree with that I
think<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.330> should<00:02:20.420> be<00:02:20.660> destroyed<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:21.950> the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
think you should be destroyed and so the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.560 
think you should be destroyed and so the
game<00:02:22.250> is<00:02:22.280> then<00:02:22.519> going<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.820> do<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:22.970> stops<00:02:23.330> role

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
game is then going to do a stops role

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.780 
game is then going to do a stops role
and<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.320> case<00:02:24.590> they<00:02:25.010> actually<00:02:25.610> wins

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
and in this case they actually wins

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.280 
and in this case they actually wins
today<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.330> he<00:02:26.570> gets<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.900> make<00:02:27.019> whatever

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
today and he gets to make whatever

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
which we call source magic allows us to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.979 
which we call source magic allows us to
manipulate<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.820> elements<00:02:34.940> for<00:02:35.570> instance<00:02:35.600> I

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
manipulate the elements for instance I

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.320 
manipulate the elements for instance I
can<00:02:36.170> make<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.500> ring<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:36.980> everything<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:38.209> is

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
can make it ring and everything that is

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330 
can make it ring and everything that is
wet<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.840> can<00:02:38.930> then<00:02:39.350> turn<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.799> into<00:02:39.980> ice

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
wet I can then turn it into ice

wet I can then turn it into ice
the<00:02:40.910> problem<00:02:41.209> with<00:02:41.299> us<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:41.750> it's<00:02:41.930> very

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
the problem with us is that it's very

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.150 
the problem with us is that it's very
slippery

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
slippery

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.920 
slippery
as<00:02:43.460> you<00:02:43.550> can<00:02:43.670> see<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:44.660> can<00:02:44.840> cause<00:02:45.020> some<00:02:45.230> pain

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930

in<00:02:56.000> its<00:02:56.120> fire<00:02:56.300> most<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.530> what<00:02:57.680> I'm<00:02:57.770> going<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.100> do

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
in its fire most so what I'm going to do

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.030 
in its fire most so what I'm going to do
is<00:02:58.490> I'm<00:02:58.760> going<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.090> summon<00:02:59.660> an<00:02:59.840> ice<00:03:00.350> elemental

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
is I'm going to summon an ice elemental

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.560 
is I'm going to summon an ice elemental
in<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.490> hope<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.670> he's<00:03:01.970> going<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.240> act<00:03:02.420> as<00:03:02.540> a

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
in the hope that he's going to act as a

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.610 
in the hope that he's going to act as a
sponge<00:03:02.900> for<00:03:03.110> me<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:04.400> I'm<00:03:04.610> going<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.240> fire<00:03:06.050> and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
sponge for me and I'm going to fire and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.370 
sponge for me and I'm going to fire and
explosive<00:03:07.400> heroine<00:03:07.940> one<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.270> them<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
explosive heroine one of them and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.380 
explosive heroine one of them and
apparently<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.130> doesn't<00:03:10.490> really<00:03:10.640> do<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.180> lot

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
apparently that doesn't really do a lot

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.570 
apparently that doesn't really do a lot
of<00:03:11.420> damage<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.080> they<00:03:12.350> shot<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:13.010> ice<00:03:13.130> element

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
of damage and they shot the ice element

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.570 
of damage and they shot the ice element
already<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:15.350> they<00:03:15.740> seem<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.040> be<00:03:16.160> very

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
already so they seem to be very

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.430 
already so they seem to be very
resistant<00:03:17.210> to<00:03:17.300> fire<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:17.930> what<00:03:18.080> I'm<00:03:18.200> going<00:03:18.380> to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
resistant to fire so what I'm going to

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.020 
resistant to fire so what I'm going to
do<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:18.680> I'm<00:03:18.800> going<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.040> cast<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.430> fireball<00:03:19.610> but

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
do is I'm going to cast a fireball but

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.730 
do is I'm going to cast a fireball but
I'm<00:03:20.150> going<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.360> aim<00:03:20.600> it's<00:03:20.810> actually<00:03:21.290> at<00:03:21.500> the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
I'm going to aim it's actually at the

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.070 
I'm going to aim it's actually at the
ice<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.280> that's<00:03:23.270> going<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.630> turn<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:23.930> into

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
ice and that's going to turn it into

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.180 
ice and that's going to turn it into
water<00:03:24.550> then<00:03:25.550> I<00:03:25.730> can<00:03:25.940> use<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.420> water<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:27.190> fire

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
water then I can use the water to fire

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.390 
water then I can use the water to fire

with one stone because they're both

with one stone because they're both
electrified<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:34.070> that<00:03:34.190> should<00:03:34.430> give<00:03:34.550> you<00:03:34.670> an

so<00:03:52.490> yeah<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:53.420> idea<00:03:53.540> is<00:03:53.750> also<00:03:53.900> that<00:03:54.170> we're

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
so yeah the idea is also that we're

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.630 
so yeah the idea is also that we're
going<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.560> ship<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:55.190> other<00:03:55.280> truck<00:03:55.490> together

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
going to ship the other truck together

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.150 
going to ship the other truck together
with<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.000> game<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.450> it's<00:03:57.290> actually<00:03:57.709> based<00:03:57.860> on

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
with the game and it's actually based on

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.220 
with the game and it's actually based on
the<00:03:58.370> technology<00:03:59.270> that<00:03:59.300> we've<00:03:59.600> been<00:03:59.750> using<00:03:59.810> to

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
the technology that we've been using to

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.040
