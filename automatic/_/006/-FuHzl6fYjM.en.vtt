okay as I listened to that passage a can

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.120 
okay as I listened to that passage a can

sound<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.790> little<00:03:08.820> loose<00:03:09.240> or<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> little<00:03:09.930> edgy

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
sound a little loose or a little edgy

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:28.950 
sound a little loose or a little edgy
now<00:03:11.520> check<00:03:11.820> it<00:03:11.970> out<00:03:12.150> with<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.780> fret<00:03:13.260> wrap<00:03:13.500> on

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:41.559 

you

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:04:13.569 

you

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.580 

okay<00:04:14.579> so<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.569> can<00:04:15.599> hear<00:04:15.870> from<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.169> second

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
okay so you can hear from the second

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.129 
okay so you can hear from the second
passage<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.459> front<00:04:17.759> rep<00:04:17.970> definitely<00:04:18.630> adds<00:04:18.870> an

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
passage the front rep definitely adds an

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.840 
passage the front rep definitely adds an
amount<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.530> control<00:04:19.859> and<00:04:20.100> tightness<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.759> I

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
amount of control and tightness that I

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.390 
amount of control and tightness that I
think<00:04:21.150> helps<00:04:21.840> things<00:04:22.139> sound<00:04:22.410> more<00:04:22.650> cohesive

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
think helps things sound more cohesive

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.850 
think helps things sound more cohesive
so<00:04:24.000> even<00:04:24.240> when<00:04:24.330> it's<00:04:24.479> not<00:04:24.539> directly<00:04:25.110> muting<00:04:25.710> an

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
so even when it's not directly muting an

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.529 
so even when it's not directly muting an
open<00:04:26.160> string<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.580> can<00:04:26.610> still<00:04:27.030> hear<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.360> feel

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
open string you can still hear and feel

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.350 
open string you can still hear and feel
it<00:04:27.720> working<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.259> tighten<00:04:28.590> things<00:04:28.740> up<00:04:29.240> when<00:04:30.240> you

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
it working to tighten things up when you

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.240 
it working to tighten things up when you
play<00:04:30.570> live<00:04:30.780> using<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.259> fret<00:04:31.530> wrap<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:32.099> can
