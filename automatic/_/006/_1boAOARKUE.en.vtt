00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.700
 and what happens very good and good kids 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.930
 I bring you something original different to 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.910
 channel or something that is not so 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.950
 used and good for the most 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.350
 old ones that you follow me and give time 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.509
 cons you will remember once 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.519
 I had the fantastic idea to start what 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.080
 that it would be a video game club that is 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.820
 a whole club because they were not basically 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.249
 to compete in different games 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.289
 different categories and different things 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.210
 not what I know for example 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.730
 how can you be a fanatic that you have to 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.340
 put this words that are in 9 is a 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.260
 club of banks and books but good 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.910
 of the differences obviously this 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.620
 project started very well with a lot of people 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.600
 that was encouraged to ping ping but not 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.670
 the same thing always happens with a project of 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.790
 this when people are not engaged in 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.260
 time is fine when there is no light 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.270
 commitment when there is lack of time 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.550
 it is falling little by little and in the end 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.440
 because that was nothing and it was like 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.330
 time I'm still not going over the truth 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.770
 Well, I'm not going to get into the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.310
 same story to return to stay 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.630
 apply so it's going to happen to me 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.830
 fantastic idea to do something else 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.830
 small is worth many people 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.020
 Every day, almost hey, I do not know what we can do to you 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.999
 add to play with you from such a thing 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.750
 I do not understand why if I'm terrible 

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:17.299
 but good I in an act of facebook 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.250
 that's not because I'm inventing one thing and it's 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.670
 I'm going to create a piggy bank where you can 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.990
 enter all your money and put 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.609
 more money or be millions and millions of 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.280
 euros will be able to play with me is not coña 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.229
 I invented what the public would be 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.060
 political is worth good again with the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.219
 cross point or not a competitive team of 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.319
 the vouchers here you see that I have different 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.299
 equipment is worth with friends with acquaintances 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.159
 etcetera etcetera and I have one that is 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.819
 empty go the points of the goal the 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.770
 ol bikes and there is cash point 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.049
 green means that I am a fucking not 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.060
 I'm a fucking and this cash is going to be 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.649
 very big then what is this 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.819
 basically good because it's to play with 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.549
 with people who are interested 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.409
 enormously it is a kind of team 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.629
 competitive as soon as we're going to play 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.129
 run that is and the whole subject and how far 

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:03.220
 we can get to that yes always with good 

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:06.470
 roll no radios 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.820
 because if not then it is worth this 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.679
 simply the requirements basically 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.280
 They are very simple 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.439
 strange is simply to be silver 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.959
 europe up basically so that all 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:20.540
 we were at the same level 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.030
 I really want to be if I will play all the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.189
 games and I can play for that is going to be 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.689
 of more than 55 members because the best 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.579
 Well, I can not for whatever reason 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.430
 the time code that I'm left over but 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.620
 I will be there as a manager 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.060
 of players and simply the 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.730
 advisory requirements to have silver 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.370
 defeat one up is to be of 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.560
 europe from the west then for now 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.959
 because I do not have an account or account at the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.030
 30 or anything in our servers does not 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.480
 I have an account for the loss but 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.400
 there is the most severe filth and nothing 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.439
 just that and very important from 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.180
 add measure the whole topic because as 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.859
