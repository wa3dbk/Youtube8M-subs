00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.510
 fundamental 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.490
 what is the university of the company for 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.620
 excellence is the university of 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.450

 is the ipade is the best school of 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.909
 Latin America business and I think something 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.770
 that has characterized us 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.950
 of all the universities will be the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.140

 economy and by education secretariat 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.819
 public especially the way in which 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.140
 we have been addressing all the 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.540

 counters where we are influencing 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.650
 directly in that aspect to the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.799
 university because it already has a whole 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.530
 structure has precisely the center 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.440
 Pan-American business and spark as

 business there are very capable teachers who 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.740
 they are also very successful professionals and 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.230
 they always treat you like you 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.840
 and you're leaving a very big teaching 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.790
 I liked the training from the beginning 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.640
 apart from the academic that is 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.190
 personally so personal relationship 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.780
 between the student's university 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.580
 I think it's that apart from a 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.760
 academic formation you nothing a 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.470
 very good personal training of a 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.050
 decision to choose what it was that you 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.540
 teach business values ​​not just 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.020
 be a businessman, if they teach you ethics and 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.080
 values within a company here is 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.790
 they give a formation in values 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.040
 a humanistic formation that is part 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.350
 essential of the university from its
