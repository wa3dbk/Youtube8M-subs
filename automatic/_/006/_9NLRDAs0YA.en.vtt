00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
of people ask me about the randomization

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.870 
of people ask me about the randomization
in<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> diablo<00:00:16.859> 3<00:00:17.039> beta<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.789> the

game in general I took some time going
through<00:00:20.160> multiple<00:00:20.340> playthroughs<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.270> get<00:00:21.390> you

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
through multiple playthroughs to get you

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.450 
through multiple playthroughs to get you
different<00:00:21.900> overlays<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.710> maps<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.279> we

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
different overlays of the maps as we

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.490

are randomized events you can encounter
different<00:00:49.590> types<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.070> dungeons<00:00:50.520> as<00:00:50.700> well<00:00:51.210> as

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
different types of dungeons as well as

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.420 
different types of dungeons as well as
different<00:00:51.660> types<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.020> groups<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.559> NPCs<00:00:53.219> you

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
different types of groups of NPCs you

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.459 
different types of groups of NPCs you
can<00:00:53.550> also<00:00:53.699> see<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.390> based<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:55.050> looking<00:00:55.350> at

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
can also see here based on looking at

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.959 
can also see here based on looking at
these<00:00:55.559> different<00:00:55.949> maps<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> terrain<00:00:56.699> is

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
these different maps that the terrain is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.279 
these different maps that the terrain is
slightly<00:00:57.239> different<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:57.930> are<00:00:57.989> different

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
slightly different there are different

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.860 
slightly different there are different
basically<00:00:58.649> mounds<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.340> areas<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.210> obstruction

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
basically mounds or areas of obstruction

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840 
basically mounds or areas of obstruction
and<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.440> means<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.070> different<00:01:02.489> general

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and that means just a different general

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.280 
and that means just a different general
terrain<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.600> well<00:01:05.630> now<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.900> work<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.229> way

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
terrain as well now as you work your way

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.380 
terrain as well now as you work your way
down<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.830> cathedral<00:01:08.220> level<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.210> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
down to cathedral level one this is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.480 
down to cathedral level one this is
where<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.720> real<00:01:10.020> randomization<00:01:11.010> starts<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
where the real randomization starts to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.100 
where the real randomization starts to
take<00:01:11.670> place<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.600> within<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
take place it really is within the

take place it really is within the
dungeons<00:01:13.320> where<00:01:13.770> we're<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
dungeons where we're going to see the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.310 
dungeons where we're going to see the
heaviest<00:01:14.820> amount<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.180> randomization<00:01:15.509> you're

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
heaviest amount of randomization you're

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
heaviest amount of randomization you're
going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.590> recognize<00:01:16.860> pockets<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.970> areas<00:01:18.390> that

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
going to recognize pockets of areas that

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.929 
going to recognize pockets of areas that
are<00:01:18.659> more<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.110> less<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> same<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.100> spread<00:01:20.820> out

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
are more or less the same but spread out

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.910 
are more or less the same but spread out
differently<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.810> that's<00:01:22.470> where<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
differently and that's where the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.800 
differently and that's where the
randomization<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.790> game<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.540> takes

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
randomization of this game really takes

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.600 
randomization of this game really takes
place<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> dungeons<00:01:26.070> there<00:01:26.430> going

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
place it's in the dungeons there going

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.850 
place it's in the dungeons there going
to<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.700> these<00:01:26.939> kind<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.270> set<00:01:27.570> areas<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.710> can

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
to be these kind of set areas as you can

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.109 
to be these kind of set areas as you can
see<00:01:29.040> there's<00:01:29.280> all<00:01:29.460> these<00:01:29.549> sectioned<00:01:30.000> off

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
see there's all these sectioned off

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.210 
see there's all these sectioned off
areas<00:01:30.659> if<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.350> envision<00:01:31.680> them<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.130> just

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
areas if you can envision them as just

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.609 
areas if you can envision them as just
being<00:01:32.549> kind<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.790> put<00:01:33.150> into<00:01:33.299> place<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.590> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
being kind of put into place just like a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
being kind of put into place just like a
puzzle<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:35.880> throughout<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.780> will

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
puzzle and then throughout that will

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.450 
puzzle and then throughout that will
deal<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.259> randomized<00:01:37.829> rooms<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.400> different

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
deal with randomized rooms and different

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.800 
deal with randomized rooms and different
monsters<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.180> those<00:01:39.270> rooms<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.750> everything

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
monsters in those rooms and everything

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.320

like<00:01:40.229> that

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.969 

once<00:01:47.330> you've<00:01:47.479> rescued<00:01:47.930> Deckard<00:01:48.350> Cain<00:01:48.619> and

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
help to the blacksmith you then work

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.969 
help to the blacksmith you then work
your<00:01:50.720> way<00:01:50.780> out<00:01:51.049> through<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.350> weeping<00:01:51.740> hollow

several<00:03:34.590> different<00:03:35.040> pieces<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.670> then

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
several different pieces and then

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.699
