like that and then you have a little

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.970 
like that and then you have a little
gyoza<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.760> then<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.910> can<00:02:37.060> set<00:02:37.300> them<00:02:37.980> press

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
gyoza and then you can set them press

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.009 
gyoza and then you can set them press
them<00:02:39.160> a<00:02:39.220> little<00:02:39.489> bit<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:40.510> give<00:02:40.660> them<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> little
