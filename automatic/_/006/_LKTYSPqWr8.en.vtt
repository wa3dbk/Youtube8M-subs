00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 It interfered but I have an idea. 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.910
 there with my time machine back to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.210
 passed to destroy those androids 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.889
 before they are finally awakened 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.740
 we now know where the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.240
 duct laboratory understands I think 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.789
 It would be great 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.350
 I hope a little at first you said that 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.470
 this time machine was not 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.599
 improved right bit too spoke 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.400
 that to recharge her energy is 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.390
 It takes a lot of time and costs a lot 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.040
 work is not so think only you travel 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.390
 to the past but can you come back 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.320
 for the future 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.989
 I do not know what the base is and I want it 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.059
 ask a few questions for example if 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.590
 exchanges have gone to the past and 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.289
 androids that now caused the greatest 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.210
 bustle in the cities what will happen 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.829
 with Android and now will they 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.780
 to vanish 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.629
 You must worry about your studies. 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.870
 who understood even I had 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.820
 forgotten by johann is right if I 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.830
 back to the past destroy the androids 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.590
 before they lose the future of the world 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.030
 is safe but how in this world doctor 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.680
 mark gero has already made the androids 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.369
 the situation will not change. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.400
 anything 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.930
 Hey, what do you mean, he's good? 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.930
 I think a little 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.850
 for example I brought some medicine from 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.030
 future and so it can overcome the disease 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.490
 and save yourself but in my world of the future 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.200
 he will not revive because he died of a 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.200
 heart disease in the past 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.170
 an what I'm trying to get is that 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.630
 there is a future in which you have saved 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.850
 and one in which he is dead 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.770
 changing only a detail of the past are 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.380
 existing different future this was 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.930
 let me see if I understand then I follow 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.610
 To Destroy Today's Androids 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.229
 This means that in their world they 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.530
 will continue to exist because they are 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:59.150
 times in different worlds exactly 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.670
 then one thing transposes that 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.869
 Come here, what is your goal? 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.590
 if your world will not have any 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.590
 positive change 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:19.180
 My mother told me, my mother told me. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.490
 who was dissatisfied with androids 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.740
 destroyed everything and wanted to destroy 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.280
 the evil ones to have a happy future without 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.280
 concerns 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.990
 but the greatest interest of all this was 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.570
 find out what their weakness is 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.340
 while they were fighting with goku case 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.650
 if it were not possible we could take 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.730
 pro future in this time machine for 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.730
 he defeats them there
