00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.349
 So what is an ethology course and why it's an internship 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.349
 of ethological education 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.359
 the goal of an ecological education course 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.050
 and better control your horse and improve safety 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.470
 in the carpet and cache valls 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.809
 we all had to face difficulties one day or another 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.020
 the horse does not know what is asked for example 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.550
 and the origin of its difficulties and often a question of ignorance 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.550
 to solve his difficulties 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.850
 you must get to know the nature of the horse 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.650
 to know how to react with him 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.930
 and to gain his trust and respect 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.720
 all without violence 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.190
 but the tension 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.050
 do not wait for a miracle recipe in this area it does not exist 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.770
 indeed each horse is different 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.200
 the control of the shawl depends above all on your savoir-Ãªtre 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.810
 that is to say, of your confidence in yourself 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.360
 your ability to assert yourself 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 of your patience especially 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.210
 an ethology education course is usually held in several 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.000
 group days 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.170
 participants come only with their own horse 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170
 oulou a horse on the spot to follow the course 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.610
 a first theoretical part allows you to discover the nature of the horse 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.790
 as well as approaches to the fundamental concepts of education 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.810
 then you put all this into practice 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.079
 by exercises in contrast or career you are in this 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.100
 situation with the chabab 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.580
 after an educational and theological course 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.320
 you still have work to do with a horse 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.850
 but persevering 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.010
 you will solve most of the problems that riders encounter 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.630
 For example 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.330
 a horse grazing 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.630
 a horse that shoots or that embark 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.040
 a horse that jostles you a horse tic 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.599
 these fees for a nothing 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.629
 exceeded will accept 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.839
 you have to know that the nature and behavior of the horse 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.889
 unfortunately are not taught in the classical courses of the stations 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:23.509
 therefore the riders acted without respecting the nature of the horse and they 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:27.059
 do not always get those who want the horse without violence 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:31.429
 some sometimes serious accidents could be avoided if the 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:35.169
 riders act according to the nature of the horse still need it 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.789
 studied 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:41.349
 it is therefore very useful to follow an ethological education course before 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.949
 to learn how to ride a horse 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:47.059
 the shooting riders also benefited from such an internship 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.409
 to solve the difficulties they encounter with the horse 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.319
 Finally, the riding instructors will discover the essential 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.529
 to be more effective as part of their delivery in teaching 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:00.939
 horse riding 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.939
 and their students will finally understand the why of how 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.529
 So are you now convinced of the interest of taking an internship? 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:10.359
 of ethological education of the horse 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.579

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.349
