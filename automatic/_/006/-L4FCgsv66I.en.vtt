00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.780 
so look at some of the ports along here
over<00:03:22.900> here<00:03:23.050> we've<00:03:23.260> got<00:03:23.310> USB<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.489> guess<00:03:24.670> you

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
over here we've got USB I guess you

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.930 
over here we've got USB I guess you
probably<00:03:24.819> can't<00:03:25.330> see<00:03:25.420> that<00:03:25.569> so<00:03:25.900> novel<00:03:26.110> USB<00:03:26.950> now

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
probably can't see that so novel USB now

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.120 
probably can't see that so novel USB now
this<00:03:28.120> isn't<00:03:28.390> this<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.900> DisplayPort<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:30.010> is

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
this isn't this is DisplayPort this is

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.390 
this isn't this is DisplayPort this is

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
combined us being eSATA this is Ethernet

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.100

and<00:03:33.670> this<00:03:33.819> is<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.000> combined<00:03:34.360> microphone<00:03:34.840> and

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
and this is a combined microphone and

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.050 
and this is a combined microphone and
headphone<00:03:35.860> jack<00:03:36.069> I<00:03:36.160> wasn't<00:03:36.430> so<00:03:36.610> excited<00:03:37.000> about

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
headphone jack I wasn't so excited about

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.059 
headphone jack I wasn't so excited about
this<00:03:37.390> but<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:37.840> was<00:03:38.140> just<00:03:38.350> like<00:03:38.530> whatever<00:03:38.739> it's

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
this but I was just like whatever it's

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.750 
this but I was just like whatever it's
not<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.250> big<00:03:39.370> deal

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
not a big deal

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.910 
not a big deal

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.350 
dock this under here is supposed to be
like<00:04:22.810> everything<00:04:23.669> over<00:04:24.669> here<00:04:24.910> this<00:04:25.150> looks

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
like everything over here this looks

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.580 
like everything over here this looks
like<00:04:26.250> Rams<00:04:27.250> RAM<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.450> then<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.810> wireless<00:04:29.320> card

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
like Rams RAM and then the wireless card

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.469 
like Rams RAM and then the wireless card
is<00:04:29.740> probably<00:04:29.919> this<00:04:30.280> look<00:04:30.880> what's<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.150> battery

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
is probably this look what's a battery
