find<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.590> anymore<00:02:33.800> because<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.870> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
find it anymore because the the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.840 
find it anymore because the the

developer has put it out of the market

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.030 
developer has put it out of the market
because<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.810> made<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.200> system's<00:02:39.620> really

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
because the it made the system's really

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.400 
because the it made the system's really
a<00:02:40.070> little<00:02:40.549> bit<00:02:40.640> slow<00:02:40.880> but<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.690> could<00:02:41.900> show<00:02:42.380> you

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
a little bit slow but I could show you

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.259 
a little bit slow but I could show you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
honeycomb at least my system it works

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.810 
honeycomb at least my system it works
really<00:02:52.280> well<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:53.870> could<00:02:54.739> show<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.280> here<00:02:55.610> if

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
really well and I could show you here if

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.470 
really well and I could show you here if
I<00:02:55.970> go<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.420> mario<00:02:56.720> kart<00:02:56.959> here<00:02:57.549> it<00:02:58.549> works<00:02:59.120> and

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
I go to the mario kart here it works and

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.800 
I go to the mario kart here it works and
a<00:02:59.660> little<00:02:59.989> little<00:03:00.470> bit<00:03:00.739> better<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.549> can<00:03:02.060> just

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
a little little bit better I can just

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.990 
a little little bit better I can just
load<00:03:03.140> also

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.340 

I<00:03:06.060> just<00:03:07.010> going<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.190> load<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.670> course<00:03:09.350> mario

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
I just going to load of course mario

I just going to load of course mario
kart<00:03:10.590> coasted<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:14.760> compare<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.660> what<00:03:16.320> we

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
kart coasted to to compare and what we

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.050 
kart coasted to to compare and what we
can<00:03:16.470> see<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.310> was<00:03:17.550> so<00:03:19.400> maybe<00:03:20.400> needs<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.910> little

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
can see is I was so maybe needs a little

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.110 
can see is I was so maybe needs a little
bit<00:03:21.240> time<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:22.650> load<00:03:22.860> but<00:03:23.280> when<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.580> says<00:03:23.790> float

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
bit time to load but when it says float

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.080 
bit time to load but when it says float
and<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:25.350> can<00:03:25.590> do<00:03:26.010> anything<00:03:26.310> good<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.820> want

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
and you can do anything good you want

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.060 
and you can do anything good you want
and<00:03:27.360> as<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.080> can<00:03:28.230> see<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.560> much<00:03:28.830> more

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
and as you can see it's much more

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.210 
and as you can see it's much more
responsive<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.990> also<00:03:30.990> yeah<00:03:31.500> I'm<00:03:31.680> socketed

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
responsive and also yeah I'm socketed

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.050 
responsive and also yeah I'm socketed
now<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:33.060> it's<00:03:33.510> also<00:03:33.720> really<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.880> really<00:03:35.880> good

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060
