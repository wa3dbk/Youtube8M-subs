 very well that character and it is also 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.470
 one of those who were most favorites of mine 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.290
 that next to another one that was like Freddy 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.820
 little krueger and another one that was that was 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.220
 as a kind of prisoner who attacked 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.140
 with the ball I do not know if you will remember but 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.270
 well other than that has there is a 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.680
 spiderman and a couple of frames that 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.840
 they really have called me quite the 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.610
 attention one is goku that I love the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.190
 dragon ball series I'm quite a fan 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.500
 is there as goku in the second phase if you 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.570
 you really remember very well it comes out only the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.190
 but it 's great 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.710
 very good as you can see more or 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.620
 less and good has another box also 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.450
 here of supermario with that typical suit 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.190
 that allowed him how to fly and take 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.490
 balls if you remember now you will see 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.440
 a bit better 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.880
 and it's like it's a little piece of 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.850
 screen of the game boy I remember 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.830
 play those little things in the gamecube and 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.870
 those little things on consoles and more 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.690
 old and good to finish has 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.990
 little things you already do that we have seen 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.320
 more like a cursor a hand pulling out the 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.840
 finger that's there very well also a 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.290
 dislike also has a hand out there 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.820
 of rock and roll and what else has another 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.170
 that is a fist I think I'm going to approach a 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.590
 little bit more so you can see it a bit 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.540
 best 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.549
 there you see how they all look more or 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.350
 less and good the truth is that it has 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.910
 really liked this chapter of 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.850
 pixelar the truth that has a server 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.070
 quite interesting enough of pixelar 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.180
 a little treat to talk to legend and 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.530
