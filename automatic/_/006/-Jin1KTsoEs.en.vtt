okay so to start this tutorial you're
going<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:34.090> need<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.689> cut<00:02:35.019> piece

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
going to need a cut piece

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.479 
going to need a cut piece
fabric<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.150> 21<00:02:36.750> by<00:02:36.989> 21<00:02:37.590> inches<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:38.340> way<00:02:38.459> I

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
fabric that is 21 by 21 inches the way I

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.190 
fabric that is 21 by 21 inches the way I
figured<00:02:38.970> out<00:02:39.090> my<00:02:39.269> measurement<00:02:39.720> was<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.170> I

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
figured out my measurement was that I

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.559 
figured out my measurement was that I
folded<00:02:40.769> my<00:02:40.890> fabric<00:02:41.340> into<00:02:41.700> half<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.330> then<00:02:42.540> I

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
folded my fabric into half and then I

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.990 
folded my fabric into half and then I
took<00:02:42.750> out<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> top<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.920> was<00:02:44.099> not<00:02:44.310> too<00:02:44.519> loose<00:02:44.760> or

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
took out a top that was not too loose or

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.850 
took out a top that was not too loose or
too<00:02:45.030> tight<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:46.140> fits<00:02:46.349> me<00:02:46.530> well<00:02:46.709> enough

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
too tight and that fits me well enough

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.550 
too tight and that fits me well enough
and<00:02:47.190> then<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.480> placed<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.080> top<00:02:49.409> of

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
and then so I just placed it on top of

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.559 
and then so I just placed it on top of
the<00:02:49.650> folded<00:02:50.010> fabric<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:50.879> from<00:02:51.360> there<00:02:51.540> I

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
the folded fabric like so from there I

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.199 
the folded fabric like so from there I
was<00:02:51.870> able<00:02:52.079> to<00:02:52.230> determine<00:02:52.470> how<00:02:53.069> wide<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.400> need<00:02:54.060> my

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
was able to determine how wide I need my

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.539 
was able to determine how wide I need my
fabric<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:55.769> was<00:02:56.010> what<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.250> came<00:02:56.370> up

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
fabric and so this was what I came up

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.420 
fabric and so this was what I came up
with<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.780> right<00:02:57.959> here<00:02:58.019> is<00:02:58.500> an<00:02:58.709> example<00:02:59.040> on

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
with so this right here is an example on

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.839 
with so this right here is an example on
what<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.760> did<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:01.040> after<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.069> figured<00:03:02.579> out<00:03:02.670> my

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
what I did and after I figured out my

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.420 
what I did and after I figured out my
measurement<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.599> have<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.140> folded<00:03:04.500> again<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.129> lay

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
measurement I have it folded again I lay

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.000 
measurement I have it folded again I lay
my<00:03:05.640> top<00:03:05.879> out<00:03:06.120> with<00:03:06.629> my<00:03:06.810> sharpie<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.440> took<00:03:07.709> that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
my top out with my sharpie I took that

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.220 
my top out with my sharpie I took that
and<00:03:08.280> traced<00:03:08.670> along<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.090> armhole<00:03:09.930> and

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
and traced along the armhole and

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.410 
and traced along the armhole and
neckline<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:11.129> give<00:03:11.370> myself<00:03:11.579> some<00:03:11.940> sort<00:03:12.359> of

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
neckline to give myself some sort of

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.069 
neckline to give myself some sort of
reference

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
reference

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.110 
reference
once<00:03:13.650> you're<00:03:13.829> done<00:03:13.980> tracing<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.700> should<00:03:14.879> have

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
once you're done tracing you should have

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.839 
once you're done tracing you should have
something<00:03:15.599> like<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:17.310> once<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.640> finish

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
something like this so once you finish

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.420 
something like this so once you finish
tracing<00:03:18.450> out<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.049> armhole<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.010> neckline

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
tracing out the armhole in the neckline

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.449 
tracing out the armhole in the neckline
take<00:03:21.209> out<00:03:21.450> some<00:03:21.840> pins<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.409> pin<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.069> fabric

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
take out some pins and pin the fabric

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.690 
take out some pins and pin the fabric
together<00:03:23.640> like<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.859> okay<00:03:25.859> so<00:03:25.920> after<00:03:26.370> you

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
together like so okay so after you

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.309 
together like so okay so after you
finish<00:03:26.879> pinning<00:03:27.299> what<00:03:27.780> you're<00:03:27.930> going<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.170> do

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
finish pinning what you're going to do

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.190 
finish pinning what you're going to do
next<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.859> cut<00:03:29.250> about<00:03:29.579> half<00:03:30.120> an<00:03:30.359> inch<00:03:30.659> away<00:03:30.900> from

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
next is cut about half an inch away from

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.339 
next is cut about half an inch away from
the<00:03:31.920> trace<00:03:32.220> line<00:03:32.519> I<00:03:32.760> forgot<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.540> cut<00:03:33.750> half<00:03:34.170> an

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
the trace line I forgot to cut half an

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.710 
the trace line I forgot to cut half an
inch<00:03:34.500> away<00:03:34.709> from<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.280> edge<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.269> tracing

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
inch away from the edge of the tracing

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.809 
inch away from the edge of the tracing
line<00:03:36.750> but<00:03:37.319> I<00:03:37.349> highly<00:03:37.650> suggest<00:03:37.950> for<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.640> do

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
line but I highly suggest for you to do

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.300 
line but I highly suggest for you to do
so<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:39.599> make<00:03:39.870> sure<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.349> give<00:03:40.620> half<00:03:41.010> an<00:03:41.160> inch

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
so so make sure you give half an inch

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.250 
so so make sure you give half an inch
between<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:42.030> tracing<00:03:42.480> lines<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.049> just

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
between the tracing lines that you just

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.830 
between the tracing lines that you just
drew<00:03:43.560> out<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.130> from<00:03:45.090> where<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.569> will<00:03:45.720> be

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
drew out and from where you will be

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.940 
drew out and from where you will be
cutting<00:03:47.359> so<00:03:48.359> right<00:03:48.569> here<00:03:48.959> what<00:03:49.230> I'm<00:03:49.380> doing<00:03:49.739> is

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
cutting so right here what I'm doing is

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.670 
cutting so right here what I'm doing is
cutting<00:03:50.280> out<00:03:50.519> little<00:03:50.940> triangles<00:03:51.329> just<00:03:51.989> little

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
cutting out little triangles just little

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.220 
cutting out little triangles just little
tiny<00:03:52.950> small<00:03:53.180> triangles<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.389> is<00:03:54.510> less<00:03:54.780> than<00:03:54.810> a

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
tiny small triangles that is less than a

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.099 
tiny small triangles that is less than a
half<00:03:55.709> inch<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.579> that<00:03:56.760> way<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:56.970> can<00:03:57.269> fold<00:03:57.810> down

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
half inch so that way I can fold down

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.770 
half inch so that way I can fold down
the<00:03:58.139> curved<00:03:58.590> line<00:03:58.919> so<00:03:59.519> as<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.879> see<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.299> am<00:04:00.510> only

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
the curved line so as you see I am only

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.430 
the curved line so as you see I am only
doing<00:04:01.079> this<00:04:01.349> along<00:04:01.889> the<00:04:02.099> curved<00:04:02.400> line<00:04:03.440> now

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
doing this along the curved line now

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.800 
doing this along the curved line now
it's<00:04:04.650> time<00:04:04.889> to<00:04:04.919> press<00:04:05.310> down<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.549> raw<00:04:05.910> edges<00:04:06.209> so

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
it's time to press down the raw edges so

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.559 
it's time to press down the raw edges so
along<00:04:07.470> every<00:04:07.889> cut<00:04:08.160> line<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.849> just<00:04:08.879> made

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
along every cut line that you just made

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.629 
along every cut line that you just made
what<00:04:10.199> you're<00:04:10.319> going<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.590> do<00:04:10.799> is<00:04:10.980> fold<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.430> down

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
what you're going to do is fold it down

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.839 
what you're going to do is fold it down
half<00:04:12.120> an<00:04:12.329> inch<00:04:12.540> into<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.709> wrong<00:04:13.889> side<00:04:14.220> just

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
half an inch into the wrong side just

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.620 
half an inch into the wrong side just
like<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.629> press<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.560> with<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.709> hot<00:04:17.010> iron<00:04:17.630> so
