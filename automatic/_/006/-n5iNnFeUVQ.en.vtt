to<00:02:30.410> do<00:02:30.530> is<00:02:30.650> run<00:02:30.859> a<00:02:30.890> hop<00:02:31.100> across<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:39.620> one<00:02:39.799> up

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
to do is run a hop across that one up

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.479 
to do is run a hop across that one up
over<00:02:40.069> there
