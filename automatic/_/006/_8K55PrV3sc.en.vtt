00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.240
 michal about us how realistic it is 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.080
 what do you think will really be 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.389
 quadrilateral level negotiations 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.690
 the ruling authority in the negotiations a 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.000
 Ukrainian crisis at the moment 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.949
 little is said about it and even if they 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.199
 there will be a task will change the main 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.340
 situations 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.430
 The Ukrainian government is confident in 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.019
 military solution to the conflict in the east with 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.099
 we can assume that they are decisions 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.829
 by definition alone because 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.000
 Ukrainian government mainly 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.829
 insolvent you have no financial 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.600
 guidance tools short or even 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.290
 long fuss in the east of his 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.329
 country 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.910
 against Russian separatists or 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.160
 separatists which russia is close to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.379
 sunshine. 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.600
 no financially no military opportunity 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.460
 if all the same way they go then in any 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.840
 the case must be someone together 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.940
 Europeans are not very happy to work 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.770
 events and this is understandable than 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.710
 this crisis will last longer 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.260
 the greater the danger of escalation 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.150
 escalation also suggest that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.439
 would have been contacts between ukrainian 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.460
 government and government 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.189
 washington and also that 500 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.810
 mercenaries organizations black photos which 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.970
 Now another name has become known 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.119
 because of the mercenaries sent to iraq and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.890
 about 500 people in Ukraine is 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.960
 means that not only Russians are fighting on 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.159
 side of the separatists but also mercenaries 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.380
 government side 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.790
 it's dangerous and the development is not good 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.509
 development is absolutely clear that escalation is not 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.460
 excluded 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.369
 I this conflict can get out from under 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.110
 control when codec cone if Russian 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.610
 or the Ukrainian side itself is all 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.500
 make an ear or 6 seconds and ends sex 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.869
 that means and what you state and 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.509
 the alienation of european european politicians 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:00.780
 from American politicians have a friend with 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:02.610
 a friend does not advise bought me such 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.009
 the feeling that the Europeans are slowly 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.680
 begins to understand their interests us on 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.680
 Ukraine is not necessarily the same as the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.460
 bought especially strained relations 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.890
 Russia brings seriously economically 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.900
 lead in a hurry only economic 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.390
 the turnover between germany and russia is not 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.500
 the latter themselves have decreased by half 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.500
 last year's teaching 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.990
 it's about 40 billion euros 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.430
 discs 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.740
 if you look at the Americans then they 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.260
 Traditionally few Russian employees in 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.590
 trade of approximately 8 billion 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.790
 dollars a year then leaves 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.410
 it becomes absolutely clear that 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.780
 Germany and other European countries 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.490
 suffered greatly and the economy of this 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.170
 not at all glad of such was the key at the end 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.840
 ends most of the economic 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.540
 Europeans help Ukraine and this 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.270
 help as you can see this barrel without sleep because 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.220
 there is no control what 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.290
 happens with this money in any 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.110
 case there is no shortage of money to lead 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.910
 war while the government in ivy 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.280
 stopped all payments for her 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.920
 population in the east of the country and it is very 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.840
 bad situation and generally politics 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.150
 focused on common sense should not 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.550
 only speak directly to Moscow but also directly 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.260
 speak with the government in Kiev to 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.390
 they returned to the negotiating table and not 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.370
 put everything on a military solution to the conflict 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.680
 military way can not be solved 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.239
 conflict in the east of Ukraine and it is impossible 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.100
 forget that Ukraine is a country which 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.230
 directed as a side of russia up as 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.420
 Europe's side of Ukraine then connecting from 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:42.480
 states can't want one side 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:44.750
 military method remove all reasonable 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.519
 criticized towards the policy of Russia 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.530
 what are the chances of a European 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.090
 politicians influenced by good words 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.830
 sides of ukraine and kiev 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.170
 This is especially tried periodically 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.799
 germany's foreign minister they 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.549
 tried and accepted were sanctions about it 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.549
 you already said 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.840
 what is the opportunity to influence 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:11.120
 I think that's what it will be later on 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.769
 depend on whether the European Union is ready 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.660
 and the german government speak with 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.660
 American friends directly and 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.919
 say that we were not elected so that we 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.810
 allowed the outbreak of war in the center of Europe 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.800
 which will happen far from the borders 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.570
 America and right in our neighborhood what 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.790
 we put on a policy that tries 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.560
 find a middle ground which with all 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.290
 criticized towards Russia without a doubt 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.840
 there is a lot to criticize yet 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.610
 trying to find a balance and especially 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.650
 confront developments on 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.940
 Ukraine which sometimes acquires 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.940
 striking trend 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.800
 I want to remind of the speech of the master 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.780
 student who is here berlin recently 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.460
 explained that Ukraine as Germany salt 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.830
 in the victims of soviet aggression during 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.690
 World War II and how I think it is 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.169
 dangerous and deliberate falsification 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.820
 stories 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.190
 and I really hope that the government 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.680
 Germany will be able to find clear words in 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.600
 government address and wine so friend oh 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.240
 friend and about each other is not worth talking 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.310
 that the story does not need to distort and know 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.139
 a sense of peace today and hope it 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.419
 opinion can be used in Berlin 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.639
 Brussels that of course with Kiev and 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.729
 should work closely but not any 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.729
 at the cost of
