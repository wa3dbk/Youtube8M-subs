00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.479 
while he's astral again that's it it
won't<00:04:18.750> actually<00:04:18.900> hit<00:04:19.170> him<00:04:19.290> but<00:04:19.530> if<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.340> were

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
won't actually hit him but if it were

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.750 
won't actually hit him but if it were
the<00:04:20.610> case<00:04:20.640> it's<00:04:21.450> not<00:04:21.690> alone<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.800> tried<00:04:23.520> to

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
the case it's not alone and I tried to

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.300 
the case it's not alone and I tried to
cover<00:04:23.970> every<00:04:24.690> weird<00:04:25.260> interaction<00:04:25.950> but<00:04:26.160> of

cover every weird interaction but of

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.770 
cover every weird interaction but of
course<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.580> probably<00:04:26.820> didn't<00:04:27.210> get<00:04:27.300> him<00:04:27.450> also

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780
