tonight I thought the try a new one and
you<00:00:54.719> breathe<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:54.989> chocolate<00:00:55.620> fatali<00:00:56.539> now<00:00:57.539> I'm

you breathe the chocolate fatali now I'm

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.889

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the fatale you have an hour was the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.000 
the fatale you have an hour was the
highest<00:01:06.030> kind<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.990> scale<00:01:07.200> rating<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.799> that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
highest kind of scale rating of that

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.500
