00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 and now all guys to killer game pro and 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.480
 this is not a gameplay but it's the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.670
 my clan's reputations of course 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.620
 many people but many people 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.019
 they asked me and here they are guys 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.000
 here are the reputations are not going to 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.920
 be as easy as an ascend and two 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.930
 Sometimes now they are going to be very, very, very 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.460
 difficult these reputations not so 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.289
 difficult so that none can enter 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.750
 Of course they are the right people 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.240
 to be able to enter since this is one of 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.189
 the clans that I love clear by 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.560
 Of course we are one more than a clan 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.329
 we are a family then that's why 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.309
 We are going to take great care of the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.239
 people who are going to enter and I know that a 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.860
 wheels are going to give more of themselves but 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.930
 watts is that it does not fulfill some things 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.629
 Etc. Do not worry if you do not comply 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.840
 some things and the joke is that 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.280
 they fulfill some things and well rather 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.469
 exist I know what happens some things that we 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.539
 we take so private we go 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.680
 to evaluate firstly why then 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.289
 Well the joke, not since you guys 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.500
 learn but that's why they do not go 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.820
 to discourage or maybe we do not say is 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.859
 what a dawn it is that it is more injustice 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.030
 for some and other things nothing and so on 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.799
 that is why we are going to judge 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.060
 personally among several people of 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.460
 clan that are now yes that the most 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.930
 in our plan and then well let's 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.430
 start by telling them what the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.079
 requirements and unequally new 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.090
 news right now they go before and 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.340
 more news of what we are going to do ok 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.439
 due to the inconveniences of mayco already 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.189
 They know they have handled me I will not be 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.229
 so present in the clan wars of mike no 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.789
 I'm saying that I'm not going to play anymore 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.500
 main club but in the clan wars ok yo ya 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.899
 I will not be in the languages and shall leave 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.390
 leaders that good if they enter the clan by 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.649
 Of course you will know who they are but 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.190
 good is something that I wanted to comment 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.170
 of course and we will we will start 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.479
 do we are going to do something special I'm going 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.310
 to do I am going to divide into three in three 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.950
 steps what would be rather not three 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.740
 steps of 3 we're going to let's divide in 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:59.030
 three things not softball main coop 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.460
 and lol or go out by legends ok if we go to 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.439
 lilian live or legends and it's going to be done 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.700
 something competitive you're not talking to 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.229
 for fun ok 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.000
 wang also for fun of course 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.000
 ok let's go first 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.990
 reputations for everything for everything to have 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.510
 more than 15 years 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.250
 If you are not 15 years old, have a mind 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.840
 mature we do not want now yes that 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.540
 nonsense because it has happened that 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.760
 we have very mature people the very 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.070
 mature who are now us is 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.920
 reproaching everything and they tell us hackers and 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.680
 they tell us that we are the worst and we 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.900
 they start insulting and that is the point 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.310
 then for that reason zero tolerance to 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.010
 insults 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.590
 etcetera ok guys we here not 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.450
 we tolerate insults we do not give you swear words 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.100
 we do not try anything to comply with orders 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.290
 of course, you guys always have to 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.150
 do that either from your superior either 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.810
 some leader and sub leader etc etc. 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.970
 and have you s3 of course for all that 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.040
 be this is for all 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.160
 ok a good mood of course to know 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.510
 Working in a team is very important 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.530
 to fall well as we are more than a 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.260
 clan we are a family 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.140
 ok okay now let's go those are so what 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.240
 global not the global requirements 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.950
 and obviously when you enter you are going to know 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.600
 a little bit more of things of course 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.920
 if you get to enter of course 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.080
 I wish all success to all 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.060
 you of course then we go in 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:30.160
 the requirements for softball and mainquÃ© ok 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.480
 would be low or 1000 do you want more than 2,000 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.510
 low ok 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.910
 hits to the nexus 800 hits to the nexus today 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.380
 so you can at least 500 not 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.910
 let's be so exaggerated I know that no 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.620
 let's be so exaggerated here because 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.780
 there are many people who say is that 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.790
 I know you have in mind that these are 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.130
 the latest easy reputations the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.750
 following regulations are going to be a lot 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.220
 more difficult and I clarify that they will be 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.769
 from five thousand up then then 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.319
 well I know that nothing else chopped minerals 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:00.790
 more than 1500 or have the money in 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.890
 softball or would it be the the kit the kit 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.519
 scouts would also be in my opinion 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.410
 ok it would be for the this blow this blows 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.410
 annex of course if you have more status 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.360
 low and large and low strata we will see 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.799
 its gameplay of course then not 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.640
 worry if you do not meet the 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.609
 state 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.229
 I know that some people do not have the 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.810
 current states now I say 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.370
 all and then now they are good or 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.770
 they are good at lengths to build 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.440
 you know 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.720
 or whatever it is that works as a team 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.300
 that more than anything in fact there are people 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.770
 good many many clans are governed 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.990
 so that if you do not know how to do this 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.639
 you do not go in like this it 's easy not the work of 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.229
 team if a person knows something that you 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.699
 you can not do that it can already be a 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.530
 teamwork because now that 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.210
 we complement each other then why 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.729
 same feelings not worry the 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.949
 studs right here let's see how they are 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.889
 also send your request and good 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:55.229
 then low with arcs and more 100 casualties 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.330
 with minimum arc is going up minimum and 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.699
 preferably more preference to 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.169
 of premium account do not worry about that 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.940
 write I have premium account they are not going to 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.400
 let enter I do not know what not no no 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.560
 greater preference because we play 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.400
 within other servers that are 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.400
 premium 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.449
 then that is why we ask that 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.830
 also why can you follow us 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.150
 more than anything and that because yesterday 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.099
 people that also clan that are not 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.409
 I do not reward and well they are made 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.969
 difficult to follow then then good 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.740
 let's see now towards the software 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.090
 junos software those of mycube much 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.759
 You will see that I wish you lots of good luck 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.430
 luck obviously without hacks without hacks 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.050
 of course guys that's all zero 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.330
 tolerable ok 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.970
 but let's go to the base states of the 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.720
 forgiveness is going to be competitive the matter 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.919
 then let's see this is going to be very 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.020
 general because it will be competitive the 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:46.020
 affair behind we go level 30 or higher 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.090
 in lol handle three roles perfectly 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.000
 and with at least four characters per 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.199
 each role ok for other games 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.490
 soon we will give more 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.039
 explanations since we play others 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.560
 games and then I will tell you how it goes 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:01.620
 to be the matter 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.630
 for tdt reputations 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.820
 let's see, wait for me, let me check 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:10.050
 this because here I have it aimed for 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:13.680
 recruitment is from mycube would be good 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.850
 They are going to leave here the the good ones 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.770

 It fits everything I'll put it there in my 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.120
 facebook and then there are going to be 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.350
 all reputations here you will have 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.360
 what to send messages et cetera et cetera 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.580

 welcome here with this strong hug 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.940
 can you really embrace them if 

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.590
 I know they are new but they have 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.820
 worried because you are and everything else 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.050
