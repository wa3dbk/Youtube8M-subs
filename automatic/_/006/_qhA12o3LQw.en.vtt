00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.350
 we are organizing the open doors for 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.480
 future students or volunteers for 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.690
 enroll in our training 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.400
 so yes this morning we were trying to 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.619
 to be able to discover our our 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.539
 school to all who want him they 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.890
 pass the contest or not we tried 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.109
 to trace the entire training 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.890
 organization of life training 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.140
 student 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.810
 a smiling welcome and a beautiful 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.910
 already in the words 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.800
 3rd year student of the Institute of 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.050
 nursing education had 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.600
 prepared an original course for 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.690
 inform the many visitors 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.219
 during the open days a 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.899
 book is directly attached to the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.200
 hospital center of saint die of 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.360
 Vosges 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.850
 they prepare each year a 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.250
 quarantine professionals a 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.739
 human-scale workforce that guarantees 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.320
 monitoring and quality of training 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.109
 this size does that it favors a 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.609
 accompaniment of proximity so of our 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.250
 students by the team of trainers 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.870
 that he knows all well and then the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.480
 advantage is that we have 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.610
 a home institution that is 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.470
 the hospital center of saint die 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.030
 link between the training institute in 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.700
 nursing at the hospital center 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.159
 he is strong and he is more than legal 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.619
 which means 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.469
 here depends on the madam hospital center 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.530
 godel who is his director work in 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.670
 proximity with me but in the same 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.950
 time it's a little institute 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.909
 particular we do not care at 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.929
 the training institute in care 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.670
 nursing 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.159
 we learn to do what is when 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.299
 even very particular he report they 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.709
 are also important because 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.810
 the hospital is an internship place 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.479
 privileged for the institute 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.310
 also a place where we are formed on 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.520
 learns his trade and then we interact 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.349
 with already the patients and where one becomes 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.879
 a health professional and one 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.009
 also interacts with his future 

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:55.619
 colleagues with the medical corps and that 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.479
 we position ourselves professionally who 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.090
 can pass the student contest 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.560
 in their bachelor's year or 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.299
 carers helpers 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.099
 medico-psychological it's really 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.099
 very varied the competition is hard 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.599
 then the studies last how many 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.000
 time then studies last three years 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.859
 since 2009 they are registered so in 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.140
 the master's degree system 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.489
 since at the end of the training the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.829
 students not only have a degree 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.290
 state but also a degree license 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.280
 who will allow them since it's 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.230
 new for now but in 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.730
 the future of being able to continue in 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.340
 graduate studies at Master's level in 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.480
 doctorate level a confit snow turnip I 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.629
 see him 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.519
 in acute geriatrics first pee in a 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.470
 time when I will be more comfortable this 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.760
 would be a liberal with regard to 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.379
 nurse anesthetists and a 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.420
 nurse who is born specialty 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.420
 additional that requires two years 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.830
 of full-time studies and that brings him to 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.920
 work either in the blocks 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.019
 operative but also less well known in 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.599
 resuscitation as a senior in 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.459
 general of other nurses and also in 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.890
 regarding the services of smur 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.690
 samu emergencies since it's a 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.269
 specialty that takes you directly to 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.650
 these at his services the infusion for 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.049
 pass the therapies 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.900
 monitoring of vital parameters 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.470
 there is the time at sea saturation 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.209
 oxygen saturation 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.459
 then we represented 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.829
 the psychiatric nurse the nurse 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.819
 military humanitarian nurse 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.890
 the school nurse 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.470
 the liberal nurse who is accessible 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.000
 after a few years of experience we have 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.560
 also explained to people the different 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.870
 study opportunities that are 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.489
 possible to resume after the 10th 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.310
 so all that is human beings 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.040
 doctorate then we moved on 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.690
 specialties or that are accessible 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.639
 after a return to school so 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.730
 nurse anesthetists nurses from 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:47.190
 operating room nurse pediatric nurse 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.720
 frames and we ended up with a scene that 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.150
 puts in who represents the nurse 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.380
 firefighters the emergency nurse and 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.890
 I hope to have a 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.150
 a fairly ambitious career alive 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.500
 to be able to discover several trades because 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.340
 it is true that our profession offers a 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.600
 rather wide diversity a panel of 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.210
 Professions which may exercise various 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.490
 whether liberal it is 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.680
 the humanitarian nurse the nurse in 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.050
 hospital environment in extra hospital 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.050
 so it's true we have a large panel 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.420
 of trades very important to us 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.850
 since this is our main mission 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.830
 it is that our training build 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.230
 future nursing professionals and 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.480
 the whole team is particularly 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.220
 attached always reminded the values 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.680
 professionals recalled the framework 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.420
 professional to guide students 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.920
 so that they adopt 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.290
 professional behaviors that are 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.000
 satisfactory for their future lives 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.220
 professional and above all I forget 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.690
 not for the care of patients 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.690
 which is for us priority
