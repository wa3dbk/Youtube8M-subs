00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.609
 good day my name is per z I am 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.800
 chef in the restauration julius 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.409
 Kost and I show you one today 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.599
 Fried fish calf's back in the fall 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.800
 the back is already cleaned if you 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.970
 they should pay attention to that 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.680
 that see the front in silver cottage 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.820
 and superfluous fat already removed 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.300
 is like here in about and then yes 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.160
 actually we ready to cook 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.380
 halve it again or a bit 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.420
 further back that we speak so to speak 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.970
 separate thin pieces from larger pieces 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.350
 since she can garden in different ways 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.350
 when you are ready 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.140
 because we spice it with salt 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.659
 and pepper 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.360
 then I have a spice mixture 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.869
 this consists of juniper compliment 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:47.250
 cloves logo is attached by it 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:50.400
 Something for that will be in the hot oil 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.369
 from all sides and are in the middle 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.369
 celebrated among friends 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.210
 Cylinder from all sides seared in 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.560
 the preheated oven 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.090
 I would not recommend that 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.630
 small push in the what 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:34.330
 sirloin to take along on 1 9 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.970
 that has the advantage that we then of 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.680
 gets heat evenly on all sides 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.800
 to put in the hot pan 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.570
 would heat up more of it down 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.520
 get and unevenly fans against 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:50.160
 and then comes the preheated 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.160
 oven and 50 degrees 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.820
 except in the oven after six minutes 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.800
 depending on how the pieces are you have to 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.590
 stop in between times always look like 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.680
 it is from then on temperature for it 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.120
 It is also advisable to go for too 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.090
 can buy home may thermometer with 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.810
 which one goes into the flesh and then stop 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.080
 a very precise one can measure temperature 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.590
 can and really 50 degrees it is 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.700
 actually optimal temperature then 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:36.160
 I would recommend the heat at home 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:40.330
 only the best of the alcohol 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.959
 Since this keeps the temperature in the oven 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.600
 which you did make it the door 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.800
 easily fold that oven then 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.480
 one gets a temperature between 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.640
 50 and 70 degrees is still in peace 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.670
 life can rest and can only 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.410
 move on can lay something here with us 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.900
 in the so-called old already suffering 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.640
 she always runs between 44 and 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.770
 50 and 60 degrees 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.960
 and there it can be completely calm and 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.960
 rest until you need something 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:25.720
 under two minutes 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:29.200
 and should be as far 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.200
 can do 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.620
 solid wonder area 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.740
 at the start 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:51.990
 Now we turn our guys to back 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.990
 with our side dishes - training 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.360
 the cabbage clooneys 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:17.710
 the step from the world yes I bet 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.060
 you a new image bones and these 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.550
 then like a normal them with 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:28.240
 vegetables and red wine and all the trimmings 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.760
 heard for at home I recommend it 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.650
 use the roast of delete that 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.780
 with a bit of red wine from have 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.350
 maybe something else in the well 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.620
 assorted food distribution is a 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.240
 Wildfang pull it all up 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.110
 End with a bit of a colorful bunch 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.970
 then they have a nice one too 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:58.060
 not that I like to do one more 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.320
 small chills around the whole 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.430
 loosen up 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.830
 that's what the team looks at and theirs 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.840
 Home could be synonymous for quite 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.530
 normal milk foam take for the decoration 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.460
 we have a few more chunks 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:18.340
 cut from black nuts and 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:23.170
 another small helix 2 with one 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:25.150
 bring flowers that's that's what ever 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.230
 much in our garden grows as taking 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.730
 we do that for the gbr and then we would 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.409
 that done now finished 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.580
 our hours 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:36.580
