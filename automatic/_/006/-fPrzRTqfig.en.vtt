I'm going to do a collection of similar
stone<00:00:02.730> houses<00:00:02.970> today<00:00:03.570> and<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:04.620> be<00:00:04.650> honest<00:00:04.980> it's

this<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.839> absolutely<00:00:06.839> my<00:00:07.020> favorite<00:00:07.230> way<00:00:07.529> of

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
this is absolutely my favorite way of

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.799 
this is absolutely my favorite way of
arranging<00:00:07.890> flowers<00:00:08.420> partly<00:00:09.420> because<00:00:09.570> it

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
arranging flowers partly because it

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.350 
arranging flowers partly because it
takes<00:00:10.139> such<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> short<00:00:11.219> amount<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.820> time<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.090> mean

Constance Brian it's really interesting

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.860 
Constance Brian it's really interesting
so<00:00:50.910> I've<00:00:51.000> never<00:00:51.149> read<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.420> before<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.840> I

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
so I've never read it before and I

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.959 
so I've never read it before and I
didn't<00:00:52.140> really<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:53.370> she<00:00:53.610> liked<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
didn't really know what she liked and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.119 
didn't really know what she liked and
didn't<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.600> actually<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.469> much<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.980> what

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
didn't like but actually so much of what

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.610 
didn't like but actually so much of what
she<00:00:56.160> likes<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.300> which<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.809> which<00:00:58.590> is

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
she likes I like to which is which is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.310 
she likes I like to which is which is
nice<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.449> easy<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.750> think<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.140> I've

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
nice and so it's easy to think that I've

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.630 
nice and so it's easy to think that I've
kind<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.620> been<00:01:01.739> influenced<00:01:02.190> by<00:01:02.280> her<00:01:02.489> but

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
kind of been influenced by her but

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.700 
kind of been influenced by her but
actually<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.180> don't<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.600> about<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.140> but

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
actually I don't know about it but but

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.380 
actually I don't know about it but but
it's<00:01:04.920> nice<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.400> agree<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
it's nice that we agree and one of the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's nice that we agree and one of the
things<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.810> she<00:01:07.020> says<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.010> rather<00:01:08.310> than

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
things that she says is that rather than

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.020 
things that she says is that rather than
scattering<00:01:09.390> small<00:01:09.869> things<00:01:10.640> right<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.880> way

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
scattering small things right the way

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.210 
scattering small things right the way
round<00:01:12.390> room<00:01:12.960> lots<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.439> different<00:01:13.830> rather<00:01:13.950> sort

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
of fussy arrangements it's much better

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.200

a little enlarge with these and just one

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.500 
a little enlarge with these and just one
tools<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> stone

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
tools in the stone

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.240 
tools in the stone
and<00:01:46.600> then<00:01:46.810> just<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.290> little<00:01:47.320> really<00:01:47.830> delicate

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
and then just a little really delicate

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.400 
and then just a little really delicate
things<00:01:48.490> keep<00:01:48.760> going<00:01:49.030> there<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.510> then<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.260> think

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
things keep going there and then I think

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.320 
things keep going there and then I think
I<00:01:50.740> really<00:01:51.370> love<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.760> green<00:01:52.410> and<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:54.520> think<00:01:55.060> I'm

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
I really love the green and I think I'm

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.750 
I really love the green and I think I'm
probably<00:01:55.600> going<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.080> go<00:01:56.260> the<00:01:56.860> blue<00:01:57.130> because

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
probably going to go the blue because

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.610 
probably going to go the blue because
it's<00:01:57.940> just<00:01:58.150> a<00:01:58.300> safe<00:01:58.540> beautiful<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.200> cobalt

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
it's just a safe beautiful that cobalt

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:12.150 
it's just a safe beautiful that cobalt
blue<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.400> then<00:02:01.440> maybe<00:02:09.930> because<00:02:10.930> it<00:02:11.080> gives<00:02:11.920> me

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
blue and then maybe because it gives me

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.980 
blue and then maybe because it gives me
it's<00:02:12.340> really<00:02:12.700> nice<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.030> contrasts<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:13.930> you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
it's really nice and contrasts so you

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.430 
it's really nice and contrasts so you
just<00:02:14.170> sort<00:02:14.320> of<00:02:14.410> fiddle<00:02:14.980> about<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.250> bit<00:02:15.580> I<00:02:16.440> mean

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
just sort of fiddle about a bit I mean

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.650 
just sort of fiddle about a bit I mean
in<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.800> more<00:02:17.980> autumnal<00:02:18.520> range<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.090> colors<00:02:19.420> I

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
in the more autumnal range of colors I

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.230 
in the more autumnal range of colors I
would<00:02:20.020> I<00:02:20.350> would<00:02:20.500> definitely<00:02:20.920> get<00:02:21.760> more<00:02:22.060> in

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
would I would definitely get more in

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.600 
would I would definitely get more in
that<00:02:22.420> range<00:02:22.750> because<00:02:23.320> it's<00:02:23.770> spring<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.490> know

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
that range because it's spring you know

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.980 
that range because it's spring you know
I<00:02:24.640> feel<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:25.060> want<00:02:25.240> kind<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.510> quite<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.690> little

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
I feel you want kind of quite a little

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.290 
I feel you want kind of quite a little
bright<00:02:26.350> sharpness<00:02:27.070> so<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:27.790> think<00:02:27.910> that's<00:02:28.150> night

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
bright sharpness so I think that's night

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.990 
bright sharpness so I think that's night
I<00:02:28.510> might<00:02:28.990> add<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.350> purple<00:02:30.160> later<00:02:30.340> or<00:02:30.670> another

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
I might add a purple later or another

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.640 
I might add a purple later or another
one<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.330> Blues<00:02:31.540> but<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.320> now<00:02:32.470> I'm<00:02:32.560> just

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.340 
one of the Blues but so now I'm just
going<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.860> go<00:02:33.010> into<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.340> government<00:02:33.730> and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
going to go into the government and

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.350 
going to go into the government and
complexities<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.710> want<00:02:36.250> Benigni<00:02:36.550> so

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
complexities and just want Benigni so

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.480 
complexities and just want Benigni so
I've<00:02:37.750> just<00:02:38.230> been<00:02:38.440> into<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> garden<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.400> I

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
I've just been into the garden and I

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.070 
I've just been into the garden and I
picked<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:41.520> selection<00:02:42.520> of<00:02:42.880> really<00:02:43.690> beautiful

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
picked a selection of really beautiful

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.980 
picked a selection of really beautiful
spring<00:02:44.770> things<00:02:45.070> with<00:02:45.580> her<00:02:45.730> with<00:02:46.480> centers<00:02:46.960> a

spring things with her with centers a

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.540 
spring things with her with centers a
bit<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.320> theme<00:02:47.560> first<00:02:48.190> thing<00:02:48.310> I'm<00:02:48.430> gonna

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
bit of a theme first thing I'm gonna

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.690 
bit of a theme first thing I'm gonna
start<00:02:48.940> with<00:02:49.150> is<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.570> euphorbia<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.860> this<00:02:51.580> is

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
start with is the euphorbia and this is

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.130 
start with is the euphorbia and this is
going<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.940> go<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.120> my<00:02:52.150> tall<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.630> us<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.990> that's

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
going to go in my tall of us and that's

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.870 
going to go in my tall of us and that's
the<00:02:53.320> fact<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.650> right<00:02:53.950> sort<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.370> proportion

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
the fact that right sort of proportion

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.350 
the fact that right sort of proportion
for<00:02:55.030> this

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
for this

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.960 
for this
I<00:02:55.390> don't<00:02:55.990> want<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.200> right<00:02:56.410> up<00:02:56.650> here<00:02:57.070> because<00:02:57.700> it

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
I don't want it right up here because it

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.270 
I don't want it right up here because it
would<00:02:58.090> then<00:02:58.240> be<00:02:58.270> too<00:02:58.690> away<00:02:59.380> from<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.830> rest<00:03:00.040> of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
would then be too away from the rest of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.340 
would then be too away from the rest of
the<00:03:00.400> flowers<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.000> table<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:01.959> that

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
the flowers on the table so that that

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.199 
the flowers on the table so that that
sort<00:03:02.620> of<00:03:02.680> height<00:03:03.100> is<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.670> correct

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
sort of height is is correct

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.760 
sort of height is is correct
and<00:03:04.300> I've<00:03:04.450> stripped<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.900> leaves<00:03:05.080> quite

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
and I've stripped the leaves quite

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.520 
and I've stripped the leaves quite
carefully<00:03:06.430> because<00:03:07.239> I'm<00:03:07.390> allergic<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.200> him<00:03:08.380> so

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
carefully because I'm allergic to him so

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.650 
carefully because I'm allergic to him so
I<00:03:08.560> use<00:03:08.739> gloves<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.220> do<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.520> cereal<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.570> a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
I use gloves to do that cereal is a

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.090 
I use gloves to do that cereal is a
really<00:03:11.200> important<00:03:11.650> technique<00:03:11.980> with

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
really important technique with

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.310 
really important technique with
euphorbias<00:03:12.610> because<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.940> seals<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.570> SAP<00:03:13.870> into

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
euphorbias because it seals the SAP into

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.830 
euphorbias because it seals the SAP into
the<00:03:14.440> stem<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:15.430> poly<00:03:15.760> axis<00:03:16.090> will<00:03:16.270> last<00:03:16.480> just<00:03:16.690> a

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
the stem the poly axis will last just a

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.270 
the stem the poly axis will last just a
little<00:03:17.320> bit<00:03:17.440> longer<00:03:17.620> if<00:03:17.890> I

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
little bit longer if I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.190 
little bit longer if I
mr.<00:03:18.640> minister<00:03:18.970> just<00:03:19.180> bunch<00:03:19.810> them<00:03:19.930> together

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
mr. minister just bunch them together

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.660 
mr. minister just bunch them together
and<00:03:20.920> put<00:03:20.980> them<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.400> boiling<00:03:21.520> water

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
and put them in the boiling water

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:52.350 
and put them in the boiling water
because<00:03:22.180> they<00:03:50.070> borrow<00:03:51.070> from<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.670> Syrian<00:03:52.150> so<00:03:52.330> I

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
because they borrow from the Syrian so I

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.220 
because they borrow from the Syrian so I
haven't<00:03:52.510> bother<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:53.019> see<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:55.750> doesn't<00:03:56.050> it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
haven't bother to see that it doesn't it

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.390 
haven't bother to see that it doesn't it

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
her just to make sure I don't pick that

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.240 
her just to make sure I don't pick that
very<00:04:10.900> often<00:04:11.019> so<00:04:11.290> I'm<00:04:11.350> not<00:04:11.470> absolutely<00:04:11.709> sure

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
very often so I'm not absolutely sure

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.710 
very often so I'm not absolutely sure
whether<00:04:12.550> it<00:04:12.730> would<00:04:12.880> or<00:04:12.910> wouldn't<00:04:13.180> ask<00:04:13.420> but<00:04:13.540> it

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
whether it would or wouldn't ask but it

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.020 
whether it would or wouldn't ask but it
doesn't<00:04:13.959> do<00:04:14.050> anything<00:04:14.260> any<00:04:15.069> harm<00:04:15.340> searing<00:04:15.910> it

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
doesn't do anything any harm searing it

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.240 
doesn't do anything any harm searing it
and<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:16.900> does<00:04:17.079> lots<00:04:17.260> of<00:04:17.410> things<00:04:17.620> lots<00:04:17.829> of<00:04:18.010> good

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
and it does lots of things lots of good

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.789 
and it does lots of things lots of good
and<00:04:18.700> again<00:04:19.090> definitely<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.600> Daphne<00:04:20.079> is<00:04:20.470> worth

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
and again definitely the Daphne is worth

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.770 
and again definitely the Daphne is worth
searing<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:21.760> I'm<00:04:21.850> going<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.030> put<00:04:22.210> that<00:04:22.360> in

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.980 

because<00:04:25.780> it's<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.229> woody<00:04:26.500> stem<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.190> Daphne<00:04:27.990> I

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
because it's a woody stem the Daphne I

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.219 
because it's a woody stem the Daphne I
search<00:04:29.680> for<00:04:29.710> slightly<00:04:30.220> longer<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.900> see

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
search for slightly longer you you see

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.130 
search for slightly longer you you see
her<00:04:32.350> using<00:04:33.130> two<00:04:33.520> rules<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.270> first<00:04:34.300> rule<00:04:34.930> is

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
her using two rules the first rule is

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.620 
her using two rules the first rule is
the<00:04:35.440> longer<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.340> stem<00:04:36.789> the<00:04:37.000> more<00:04:37.180> you<00:04:37.360> sear

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
the longer the stem the more you sear

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.900 
the longer the stem the more you sear
has<00:04:37.930> caught<00:04:38.140> us<00:04:38.320> all<00:04:38.470> common<00:04:38.800> sense<00:04:39.070> but<00:04:39.760> the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
has caught us all common sense but the

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.040 
has caught us all common sense but the
second<00:04:40.300> is<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:41.340> woody<00:04:42.340> of<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.700> stem<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.840> long

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
second is the woody of the stem the long

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.920 
second is the woody of the stem the long
uses<00:04:44.500> so<00:04:44.850> proportional<00:04:45.850> to<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.090> height<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:46.810> if

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
uses so proportional to the height so if

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.650 
uses so proportional to the height so if
I'm<00:04:47.140> searing<00:04:47.950> you<00:04:48.490> know<00:04:48.610> that<00:04:48.850> much<00:04:49.300> ice

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
I'm searing you know that much ice

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.440 
I'm searing you know that much ice
irritants<00:04:50.289> so<00:04:50.530> I<00:04:50.560> said<00:04:50.800> quite<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.039> section<00:04:51.610> of

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
irritants so I said quite a section of

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.590 
irritants so I said quite a section of
it<00:04:52.660> and<00:04:52.960> if<00:04:53.440> I'm<00:04:53.919> saying<00:04:54.340> woody<00:04:54.700> stem<00:04:55.060> I<00:04:55.300> give

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
it and if I'm saying woody stem I give

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.230 
it and if I'm saying woody stem I give
it<00:04:55.720> 30<00:04:56.140> to<00:04:56.410> 40<00:04:56.740> seconds<00:04:57.160> if<00:04:57.700> I'm<00:04:58.000> seeing

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
it 30 to 40 seconds if I'm seeing

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.260 
it 30 to 40 seconds if I'm seeing
something<00:04:58.600> like<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:58.870> Bluebell<00:05:00.030> which<00:05:01.030> are

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
something like a Bluebell which are

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.640 
something like a Bluebell which are
about<00:05:01.419> to<00:05:01.539> come<00:05:01.690> into<00:05:01.810> flower<00:05:02.080> now<00:05:02.350> which<00:05:02.530> is

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
about to come into flower now which is

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.240 
about to come into flower now which is
very<00:05:02.860> soft<00:05:03.160> I<00:05:03.490> only<00:05:03.610> sit<00:05:03.880> for<00:05:04.150> 10<00:05:04.479> seconds<00:05:04.930> so

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
very soft I only sit for 10 seconds so

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.340 
very soft I only sit for 10 seconds so
how<00:05:06.250> much<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:07.180> see<00:05:07.450> its<00:05:07.720> proportional<00:05:08.200> to<00:05:08.260> the

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
how much you see its proportional to the

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.750 
how much you see its proportional to the
height<00:05:08.500> and<00:05:08.710> how<00:05:08.860> long<00:05:09.190> you<00:05:09.430> serious

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
height and how long you serious

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.130 
height and how long you serious
proportional<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.419> the<00:05:10.510> texture<00:05:10.990> of<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.169> stem

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.510 

just<00:05:17.140> strip<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.530> finish<00:05:17.919> off<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.520> wallflower

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.350 

and<00:05:22.120> then<00:05:22.300> again<00:05:22.539> I<00:05:22.599> always<00:05:22.870> say<00:05:23.199> wolf<00:05:23.470> Louis

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
and then again I always say wolf Louis

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.860 
and then again I always say wolf Louis
makes<00:05:25.360> them<00:05:25.539> last<00:05:25.750> a<00:05:25.960> little<00:05:26.139> bit<00:05:26.259> longer<00:05:26.520> and

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
makes them last a little bit longer and

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.499 
makes them last a little bit longer and
how<00:05:28.870> sarin<00:05:29.470> works<00:05:30.400> is<00:05:32.130> doing<00:05:33.130> two<00:05:33.400> things<00:05:33.699> one

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
how sarin works is doing two things one

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.409 
how sarin works is doing two things one
it<00:05:34.660> increases<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:36.370> surface<00:05:36.639> area<00:05:36.940> for<00:05:37.090> water

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
it increases the surface area for water

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.710 
it increases the surface area for water
absorption<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:39.090> basically<00:05:40.090> by<00:05:40.360> sort<00:05:40.690> of

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
absorption and basically by sort of

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.290 
absorption and basically by sort of
partially<00:05:41.319> destroying<00:05:41.800> me<00:05:42.039> outer<00:05:42.580> cell<00:05:43.000> walls

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
partially destroying me outer cell walls

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.629 
partially destroying me outer cell walls
it<00:05:44.289> allows<00:05:45.250> water<00:05:45.940> to<00:05:46.150> be<00:05:46.599> absorbed<00:05:47.190> over<00:05:48.190> the

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
it allows water to be absorbed over the

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.400 
it allows water to be absorbed over the
section<00:05:49.030> that<00:05:49.210> you've<00:05:49.360> seen<00:05:49.599> more<00:05:49.870> freely

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
section that you've seen more freely

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.899 
section that you've seen more freely
than<00:05:50.440> if<00:05:50.979> you<00:05:51.099> haven't<00:05:51.400> see<00:05:51.639> it<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:54.520> other

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909 
than if you haven't see it and the other

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.760 
than if you haven't see it and the other
thing<00:05:55.150> is<00:05:55.270> it<00:05:55.389> dislodges<00:05:55.780> that<00:05:56.169> air<00:05:56.380> bubble

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
thing is it dislodges that air bubble

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.890 
thing is it dislodges that air bubble
and<00:05:56.949> when<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.490> or<00:05:57.880> the<00:05:58.090> air<00:05:58.240> bubbles<00:05:58.630> when<00:05:58.780> you

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
and when you or the air bubbles when you

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.210 
and when you or the air bubbles when you
see<00:05:59.080> them<00:05:59.259> you'll<00:05:59.440> see<00:05:59.470> it<00:05:59.680> bubbling

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
see them you'll see it bubbling

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.540 
see them you'll see it bubbling
underneath<00:06:00.669> the<00:06:00.849> water<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:01.419> that<00:06:02.139> again

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
underneath the water and that again

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:12.659 
underneath the water and that again
allows<00:06:03.550> for<00:06:03.940> better<00:06:04.120> water<00:06:04.389> absorption<00:06:11.669> the

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
allows for better water absorption the

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.279 
allows for better water absorption the
other<00:06:12.789> great<00:06:12.970> thing<00:06:13.150> about<00:06:13.180> the<00:06:13.449> tres<00:06:13.780> do<00:06:14.229> you

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
other great thing about the tres do you

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:15.719 
other great thing about the tres do you
know<00:06:14.470> I've<00:06:14.560> been<00:06:14.650> spilling<00:06:15.130> water<00:06:15.250> like

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
know I've been spilling water like

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.320 
know I've been spilling water like
tomorrow<00:06:16.509> doesn't<00:06:17.520> matter<00:06:18.520> you<00:06:18.970> know<00:06:19.150> as<00:06:19.210> long

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
tomorrow doesn't matter you know as long

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.370 
tomorrow doesn't matter you know as long
as<00:06:19.389> I<00:06:19.599> dry<00:06:20.409> the<00:06:20.470> bottom<00:06:20.919> of<00:06:21.039> the<00:06:21.220> container<00:06:21.669> I

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
as I dry the bottom of the container I

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.230 
as I dry the bottom of the container I
don't<00:06:23.380> have<00:06:23.470> to<00:06:23.590> worry<00:06:23.740> about<00:06:23.770> the<00:06:24.009> furniture

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
don't have to worry about the furniture

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.040 
don't have to worry about the furniture
which<00:06:25.240> which<00:06:25.990> is<00:06:26.020> an<00:06:26.289> added<00:06:26.500> bonus<00:06:27.810> so<00:06:28.810> just

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
which which is an added bonus so just

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.480 
which which is an added bonus so just
see<00:06:29.349> those<00:06:30.150> and<00:06:31.199> you'll<00:06:32.199> see<00:06:32.530> that<00:06:32.860> on<00:06:33.219> the

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
see those and you'll see that on the

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.749 
see those and you'll see that on the
whole<00:06:33.759> I'm<00:06:34.240> not<00:06:34.750> mixing<00:06:35.259> things<00:06:35.590> so<00:06:36.580> this<00:06:36.699> is

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 
whole I'm not mixing things so this is

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.240 
whole I'm not mixing things so this is
not<00:06:37.030> about<00:06:37.210> arranging<00:06:38.169> within<00:06:38.469> averse<00:06:38.770> it's

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
not about arranging within averse it's

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.360 
not about arranging within averse it's
about<00:06:39.580> arranging<00:06:40.590> between<00:06:41.590> the<00:06:41.830> verses<00:06:42.340> that

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
about arranging between the verses that

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:50.510 
about arranging between the verses that
are<00:06:42.699> shorter<00:06:43.360> and<00:06:48.210> then<00:06:49.210> finally<00:06:49.719> for<00:06:49.990> a<00:06:50.050> real

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
are shorter and then finally for a real

00:06:50.520 --> 00:07:05.689 
are shorter and then finally for a real
zap<00:06:51.520> a<00:06:51.759> very<00:06:52.180> very<00:06:52.449> strong<00:06:52.750> color

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:14.309 

yeah<00:07:06.699> that's<00:07:07.410> probably<00:07:08.410> out<00:07:08.680> this<00:07:08.979> donkey<00:07:13.319> and

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 
yeah that's probably out this donkey and

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:17.610 
yeah that's probably out this donkey and
again<00:07:14.590> soft<00:07:14.919> stamp<00:07:15.340> so<00:07:15.639> just<00:07:16.080> ten<00:07:17.080> seconds<00:07:17.470> in

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
again soft stamp so just ten seconds in

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.950 
again soft stamp so just ten seconds in
the<00:07:17.710> water<00:07:20.970> mix<00:07:21.970> now<00:07:22.180> I<00:07:22.389> don't<00:07:22.449> particularly

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
the water mix now I don't particularly

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.559 
the water mix now I don't particularly
like<00:07:23.199> that<00:07:23.470> color<00:07:23.740> with<00:07:24.009> the<00:07:24.130> pink<00:07:24.479> so<00:07:25.479> I'm

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:25.569 
like that color with the pink so I'm

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:26.999 
like that color with the pink so I'm
actually<00:07:25.750> gonna<00:07:25.990> shift<00:07:26.319> it<00:07:26.500> around<00:07:26.590> a<00:07:26.919> little

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:27.009 
actually gonna shift it around a little

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:33.270 
actually gonna shift it around a little
bit<00:07:28.020> that's<00:07:29.020> more<00:07:29.650> centrally<00:07:31.440> there's<00:07:32.440> in

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 
bit that's more centrally there's in

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.850 
bit that's more centrally there's in
between<00:07:33.870> so<00:07:34.870> I've<00:07:34.930> just<00:07:34.960> got<00:07:35.229> a<00:07:35.319> little<00:07:35.650> bit<00:07:35.770> of

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
between so I've just got a little bit of

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.150 
between so I've just got a little bit of
acid<00:07:36.069> green<00:07:36.460> there<00:07:36.789> and<00:07:37.120> then<00:07:37.900> these<00:07:38.139> can<00:07:38.470> Liam

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.160 
acid green there and then these can Liam

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.490 
acid green there and then these can Liam
definitely<00:07:39.669> can<00:07:39.820> come<00:07:40.030> over<00:07:40.150> near<00:07:40.479> there<00:07:40.750> pass

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:41.500 
definitely can come over near there pass

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.080 
definitely can come over near there pass
it<00:07:41.680> in<00:07:41.830> room<00:07:42.009> that<00:07:42.160> works<00:07:42.370> better<00:07:42.639> I<00:07:42.820> think<00:07:42.880> so

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.090 
it in room that works better I think so

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.210 
it in room that works better I think so
you<00:07:43.240> can<00:07:43.300> just<00:07:43.539> shift<00:07:43.750> things<00:07:43.990> around<00:07:44.220> a

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:45.220 
you can just shift things around a

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.420 
you can just shift things around a
little<00:07:45.250> bit<00:07:46.380> you<00:07:47.380> are<00:07:47.410> and<00:07:47.830> the<00:07:48.009> good<00:07:48.220> thing

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.430 
little bit you are and the good thing

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.650 
little bit you are and the good thing
about<00:07:48.460> this<00:07:48.900> is<00:07:50.009> generally<00:07:51.180> that<00:07:52.180> will<00:07:52.360> last

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:52.660 
about this is generally that will last

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.870 
about this is generally that will last
at<00:07:52.990> least<00:07:53.020> a<00:07:53.320> week<00:07:53.530> if<00:07:53.770> not<00:07:53.949> ten<00:07:54.190> days<00:07:54.430> when<00:07:54.789> the

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:54.880 
at least a week if not ten days when the

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.710 
at least a week if not ten days when the
thing<00:07:55.090> said<00:07:55.620> I'll<00:07:56.620> top<00:07:56.860> up<00:07:57.039> the<00:07:57.190> water<00:07:57.720> every

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 
thing said I'll top up the water every

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.610 
thing said I'll top up the water every
three<00:07:58.900> or<00:07:58.930> four<00:07:59.020> days

00:07:59.610 --> 00:07:59.620 
three or four days

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:11.679 
three or four days
and<00:07:59.740> that's<00:07:59.919> it

00:08:11.679 --> 00:08:11.689
