six gigs around like you know 975 seem

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.380 
six gigs around like you know 975 seem
to<00:01:10.119> see<00:01:10.299> it<00:01:10.360> in<00:01:10.509> there<00:01:10.720> a<00:01:10.750> couple<00:01:10.990> days

should be pretty cool it's gonna be

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.710 
should be pretty cool it's gonna be
orange<00:01:20.159> coolant<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.820> there<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.330> yeah

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
orange coolant in there so yeah

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.550 
orange coolant in there so yeah
everything<00:01:22.470> i<00:01:24.110> dominate<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.170> airflow

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
everything i dominate your airflow

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.850 
everything i dominate your airflow
family<00:01:26.430> makes<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.820> look<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.060> lot<00:01:27.210> better<00:01:27.860> okay

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
family makes it look a lot better okay

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370 
family makes it look a lot better okay
so<00:01:29.010> it<00:01:29.340> looks<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.550> at<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> window<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.380> let's

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
so it looks like at the window on let's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.530 
so it looks like at the window on let's
just<00:01:31.590> um<00:01:32.900> us<00:01:33.900> jump<00:01:34.680> up<00:01:34.830> PS<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.910> sue<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
just um us jump up PS you and sue the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.610 
just um us jump up PS you and sue the
capital<00:01:37.050> of<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.290> world

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.470 

well<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.430> can't<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.970> very<00:01:45.030> well<00:01:45.270> because

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
well you can't see it very well because

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.810 
well you can't see it very well because
it's<00:01:45.720> pretty<00:01:45.960> light<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.440> room<00:01:46.470> but

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
it's pretty light in the room but

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.800 
it's pretty light in the room but
anyways<00:01:47.820> carbs<00:01:48.510> are<00:01:48.660> hidden<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:50.810> behind

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
anyways carbs are hidden in there behind

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.330 
anyways carbs are hidden in there behind
the<00:01:52.020> nether<00:01:52.230> read<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.770> looks<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.010> lot<00:01:53.130> better

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the nether read it looks a lot better

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.120 
the nether read it looks a lot better
than<00:01:53.610> our<00:01:53.820> clip<00:01:55.910> anyways<00:01:56.910> that's<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.240> system

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
than our clip anyways that's the system

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.710 
than our clip anyways that's the system
with<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.160> west<00:01:59.400> wind<00:01:59.550> up<00:01:59.820> window<00:02:00.120> on<00:02:00.270> let's<00:02:00.630> take

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
with a west wind up window on let's take

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.020 
with a west wind up window on let's take
a<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:00.900> bit<00:02:01.020> level<00:02:01.320> ok<00:02:02.190> now<00:02:02.430> we're<00:02:02.490> level

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
a little bit level ok now we're level

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.030 
a little bit level ok now we're level
what<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.330> pc<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.170> what<00:02:04.440> kind<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.740> looks<00:02:04.950> like

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
what the pc is what kind of looks like

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.780 
what the pc is what kind of looks like
my<00:02:05.850> view<00:02:06.420> when<00:02:06.660> i'm<00:02:06.780> sitting<00:02:06.990> at<00:02:07.170> my<00:02:07.320> chair

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.880 

this<00:02:13.329> is<00:02:13.420> one<00:02:13.540> nice-looking<00:02:13.840> computers<00:02:14.680> that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
this is one nice-looking computers that

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:23.809 
this is one nice-looking computers that
are<00:02:14.950> built

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.040 

looks<00:02:24.390> pretty<00:02:24.629> good

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
looks pretty good

looks pretty good
Stepan<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.860> CPU<00:02:27.340> in<00:02:27.490> there<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.820> couv<00:02:28.060> it

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
Stepan the CPU in there in the couv it

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.100 
Stepan the CPU in there in the couv it
to<00:02:28.420> being<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:29.370> will<00:02:30.370> be<00:02:30.490> done<00:02:30.960> let's<00:02:31.960> take<00:02:32.080> a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
to being it will be done let's take a

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.010 
to being it will be done let's take a
look<00:02:32.290> at<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.440> back<00:02:33.510> okay<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:34.570> this<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
look at the back okay so this is the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.490 
look at the back okay so this is the
back<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> case<00:02:35.830> just<00:02:37.050> rooted<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.170> fan

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
back of the case just rooted the fan

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.950 
back of the case just rooted the fan
cables<00:02:39.450> down<00:02:40.450> here<00:02:40.900> because<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:42.720> bands<00:02:43.720> on

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
cables down here because of the bands on

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.180 
cables down here because of the bands on
top<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.290> radiator<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.750> I've<00:02:47.620> got<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.980> root

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
top the radiator and I've got to root

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.100 
top the radiator and I've got to root
them<00:02:48.400> we<00:02:48.610> got<00:02:48.760> kale<00:02:49.090> man<00:02:49.330> in<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.750> little

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
them we got kale man in that a little

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.300 
them we got kale man in that a little
bit<00:02:50.290> it's<00:02:50.560> not<00:02:50.710> too<00:02:50.890> bad<00:02:51.130> though<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:54.130> back

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
bit it's not too bad though but the back

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.950 
bit it's not too bad though but the back
of<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.550> motherboard<00:02:54.910> trade<00:02:55.240> and<00:02:55.510> paint<00:02:55.810> it

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
of the motherboard trade and paint it

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:03.060 
of the motherboard trade and paint it
but<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.180> the<00:03:01.380> fat<00:03:02.380> controller<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:03.010> I

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
but this is the fat controller that I

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.260 
but this is the fat controller that I
have<00:03:03.340> bought<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:05.070> about<00:03:06.070> 847<00:03:06.910> here

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
have bought so it's about 847 here

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.950 
have bought so it's about 847 here
