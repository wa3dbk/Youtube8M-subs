00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
rounds in each mug this will still not

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.840 
rounds in each mug this will still not
beat<00:00:34.780> three<00:00:35.440> plus<00:00:35.680> weapons<00:00:36.010> like<00:00:36.220> the<00:00:36.400> m16

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
beat three plus weapons like the m16

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.840 
beat three plus weapons like the m16
three<00:00:37.000> plus<00:00:37.210> with<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.780> 30<00:00:38.110> rounds<00:00:38.410> purim<00:00:38.850> from

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
three plus with the 30 rounds purim from

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.969 
three plus with the 30 rounds purim from
the<00:00:40.000> nuts<00:00:40.180> 3<00:00:40.449> plus<00:00:40.659> weapons<00:00:40.989> it<00:00:41.379> is<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:41.830> best

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:41.979 
the nuts 3 plus weapons it is the best

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:46.290 
the nuts 3 plus weapons it is the best
will<00:00:42.430> be<00:00:42.670> built<00:00:43.479> them<00:00:43.629> out<00:00:44.879> however<00:00:45.879> what

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
will be built them out however what

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.680 
will be built them out however what
really<00:00:46.659> makes<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:47.019> me<00:00:47.290> worry<00:00:47.470> is<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.159> recoil

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
really makes the me worry is the recoil

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.170 
really makes the me worry is the recoil
this<00:00:49.690> gun<00:00:50.019> got<00:00:50.199> a<00:00:50.229> lower<00:00:50.470> recoil<00:00:50.680> than<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.400> l85

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
this gun got a lower recoil than the l85

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.149 
this gun got a lower recoil than the l85
and<00:00:52.360> you<00:00:52.420> will<00:00:52.540> probably<00:00:52.900> not<00:00:53.500> agree<00:00:53.860> with<00:00:53.890> me

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
and you will probably not agree with me

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.500 
and you will probably not agree with me
because<00:00:54.729> this<00:00:56.519> gun<00:00:57.519> got<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.790> high<00:00:58.120> rate<00:00:58.360> of<00:00:58.390> fire

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
because this gun got a high rate of fire

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.229 
because this gun got a high rate of fire
which<00:00:59.260> makes<00:00:59.530> the<00:01:00.100> recoil<00:01:00.430> harder<00:01:00.940> to<00:01:01.059> handle

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
which makes the recoil harder to handle

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.760 
which makes the recoil harder to handle
than<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:01.750> l85<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:04.420> assault<00:01:05.170> rifle<00:01:05.560> got<00:01:05.740> a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
than the l85 this assault rifle got a

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.340 
than the l85 this assault rifle got a
got<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.100> right<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.369> fire<00:01:06.610> at<00:01:06.880> 600<00:01:07.840> rounds<00:01:08.140> per

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
got a right to fire at 600 rounds per

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.490 
got a right to fire at 600 rounds per
minute<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.790> for<00:01:09.970> me<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.240> feels<00:01:10.479> like<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:11.170> is

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
minute but for me it feels like it is

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.290 
minute but for me it feels like it is
firing<00:01:11.799> faster<00:01:12.430> than<00:01:12.580> 600<00:01:13.300> but<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.740> server

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
firing faster than 600 but the server

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.880 
firing faster than 600 but the server
comparison<00:01:16.300> tool<00:01:16.510> is<00:01:16.690> saying<00:01:17.170> it<00:01:17.470> that's<00:01:17.710> the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
comparison tool is saying it that's the

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.010 
comparison tool is saying it that's the
signal<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.460> gun<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:18.700> firing<00:01:19.030> 600<00:01:19.690> rounds<00:01:19.870> per

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
signal this gun is firing 600 rounds per

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.470 
signal this gun is firing 600 rounds per
minute<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:22.030> l85<00:01:22.900> in<00:01:23.170> comparison<00:01:24.010> got<00:01:24.250> a<00:01:25.320> 450

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
minute the l85 in comparison got a 450

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.940 
minute the l85 in comparison got a 450
but<00:01:28.480> that<00:01:29.260> were<00:01:29.470> was<00:01:29.920> enough<00:01:30.190> about<00:01:30.610> recoil

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
but that were was enough about recoil

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.880 
but that were was enough about recoil
the<00:01:32.950> bullet<00:01:33.280> velocity<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:34.600> this<00:01:34.810> gun<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:35.230> also

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
the bullet velocity on this gun is also

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the bullet velocity on this gun is also
the<00:01:36.130> same<00:01:36.370> as<00:01:36.640> on<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.320> l85<00:01:38.320> which<00:01:39.280> means<00:01:39.520> it

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
the same as on the l85 which means it

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.780 
the same as on the l85 which means it
will<00:01:40.090> be<00:01:40.240> a<00:01:40.360> cure<00:01:40.690> over<00:01:41.230> range<00:01:41.830> just<00:01:42.370> like<00:01:42.640> the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
will be a cure over range just like the

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.770 
will be a cure over range just like the
l85<00:01:43.510> with<00:01:44.260> a<00:01:44.290> bulk<00:01:44.530> velocity<00:01:44.710> at<00:01:46.440> 675<00:01:47.670> m/s<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
l85 with a bulk velocity at 675 m/s the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.740 
l85 with a bulk velocity at 675 m/s the
damage<00:01:50.230> is<00:01:50.500> maybe<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:51.220> bit<00:01:51.880> time<00:01:52.090> may<00:01:52.360> be<00:01:52.390> too

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
damage is maybe a bit time may be too

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.300 
damage is maybe a bit time may be too
high<00:01:52.960> in<00:01:53.680> close<00:01:53.980> quarters<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.670> will<00:01:54.850> damage

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
high in close quarters it will damage

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.180 
high in close quarters it will damage
3228<00:01:57.310> hit<00:01:57.760> points<00:01:58.290> which<00:01:59.290> is<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.620> same<00:01:59.860> as<00:02:00.130> the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
3228 hit points which is the same as the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.780 
3228 hit points which is the same as the
AEK<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:02.350> get<00:02:02.590> gun<00:02:03.040> got<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.400> got<00:02:03.550> a<00:02:03.580> very

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
AEK and this get gun got it got a very

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.990 
AEK and this get gun got it got a very
good<00:02:04.000> range<00:02:04.270> I'm<00:02:04.840> afraid<00:02:05.500> that<00:02:05.680> in<00:02:06.370> this<00:02:06.729> could

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
good range I'm afraid that in this could

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.529 
good range I'm afraid that in this could
be<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.390> new<00:02:07.600> la<00:02:07.870> da<00:02:08.229> five<00:02:08.619> but<00:02:09.009> I'm<00:02:09.099> not<00:02:09.250> sure

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
be the new la da five but I'm not sure

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.080 
be the new la da five but I'm not sure
for<00:02:10.539> these<00:02:10.780> stats<00:02:11.080> will<00:02:11.730> for<00:02:12.730> with<00:02:12.909> these

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
for these stats will for with these

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.390 
for these stats will for with these
stats<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.110> began<00:02:14.500> got<00:02:14.739> now<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.250> will

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
stats that I began got now it will

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.929 
stats that I began got now it will
probably<00:02:15.700> be<00:02:16.000> some<00:02:16.980> overpowered<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.099> guess<00:02:18.280> I'm

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
probably be some overpowered I guess I'm

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.120 
probably be some overpowered I guess I'm
a<00:02:19.359> bit<00:02:19.540> worried<00:02:19.780> as<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:20.049> said<00:02:20.290> because

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
a bit worried as I said because

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.060 
a bit worried as I said because
it<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.670> also<00:02:21.910> damaging<00:02:22.480> high<00:02:23.230> over<00:02:23.620> long<00:02:23.800> range

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
it is also damaging high over long range

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.360 
it is also damaging high over long range
of<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.180> long<00:02:25.360> range<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.840> will<00:02:25.990> damage<00:02:26.140> from<00:02:26.650> 21

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
of a long range it will damage from 21

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.930 
of a long range it will damage from 21
to<00:02:27.610> 25<00:02:28.390> hit<00:02:28.690> points<00:02:29.340> which<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.490> my<00:02:30.610> point<00:02:30.820> of

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
to 25 hit points which in my point of

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.040 
to 25 hit points which in my point of
view<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.660> bit<00:02:31.900> too<00:02:32.170> much<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:33.720> hope<00:02:34.720> they<00:02:34.930> will

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
view is a bit too much I hope they will

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.160 
view is a bit too much I hope they will
love<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.980> recoil<00:02:36.400> or<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.790> damage<00:02:37.120> or<00:02:37.330> if

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
love the recoil or the damage or if

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.900 
love the recoil or the damage or if
they're<00:02:38.500> not<00:02:38.650> going<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.920> know<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.160> there<00:02:39.700> I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
they're not going to know that there I

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.820 
they're not going to know that there I
hope<00:02:40.210> they<00:02:40.480> will<00:02:40.630> make<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.960> possible<00:02:41.140> to

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
hope they will make it possible to

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.190 
hope they will make it possible to
pre-buy<00:02:42.520> this<00:02:42.760> gun<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.500> pecheneg

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
pre-buy this gun like the pecheneg

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.340 
pre-buy this gun like the pecheneg
however<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.620> only<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.950> PT<00:02:48.400> test<00:02:48.670> server

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
however this is only the PT test server

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.130 
however this is only the PT test server
much<00:02:50.350> can<00:02:50.590> be<00:02:50.650> changed<00:02:51.240> for<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:52.270> release<00:02:52.630> and

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
much can be changed for the release and

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.960 
much can be changed for the release and
I<00:02:53.650> hope<00:02:54.720> something<00:02:55.720> will<00:02:55.930> be<00:02:56.050> changed<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
I hope something will be changed and the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.300 
I hope something will be changed and the
iron<00:02:58.180> sights<00:02:58.600> it's<00:02:58.960> not<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.650> best<00:02:59.800> i<00:03:00.250> have

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
iron sights it's not the best i have

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.910 
iron sights it's not the best i have
seen<00:03:00.580> but<00:03:01.330> i<00:03:01.360> guess<00:03:01.690> it<00:03:02.080> will<00:03:02.290> work<00:03:02.500> fine<00:03:02.710> with

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
seen but i guess it will work fine with

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.090 
seen but i guess it will work fine with
all<00:03:03.040> kind<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.490> holographic<00:03:03.970> sights<00:03:05.100> the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
all kind of holographic sights the

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.640 
all kind of holographic sights the
reloading<00:03:06.610> time<00:03:06.640> is<00:03:07.060> very<00:03:07.630> slow<00:03:07.900> even<00:03:08.230> slower

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
reloading time is very slow even slower

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.370 
reloading time is very slow even slower
than<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:08.920> l85<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:10.270> got<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> reloading<00:03:10.990> time<00:03:11.080> at

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
than the l85 it got a reloading time at

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
than the l85 it got a reloading time at
five<00:03:12.100> seconds<00:03:12.730> which<00:03:13.570> is<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:14.020> slowest

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
five seconds which is the slowest

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.460 
five seconds which is the slowest
reloading<00:03:15.400> assault<00:03:15.760> rifle<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:20.170> was<00:03:20.320> all

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
reloading assault rifle and that was all

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:37.080 
reloading assault rifle and that was all
that<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.650> got<00:03:20.800> for<00:03:20.950> today<00:03:21.100> guys<00:03:21.400> hope

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.660
