a<00:00:20.250> patent-pending<00:00:20.840> process<00:00:21.840> where<00:00:22.380> we

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
a patent-pending process where we

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.349 
a patent-pending process where we
actually<00:00:22.619> weld<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.430> fabric<00:00:23.820> together<00:00:23.970> as

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
actually weld the fabric together as

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.179 
actually weld the fabric together as
opposed<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.779> sewing<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.859> what's<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
advantage but when you weld fabric

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.259

punching a whole bunch of holes in it

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.549 
punching a whole bunch of holes in it
then<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.780> tape<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> make<00:00:34.440> it
