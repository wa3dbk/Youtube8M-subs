the pioneering studies from 2005 where
they<00:00:35.879> were<00:00:35.970> using<00:00:36.210> fMRI<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.290> look<00:00:37.530> at<00:00:37.710> how<00:00:38.160> does

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
they were using fMRI to look at how does

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.490 
they were using fMRI to look at how does
the<00:00:38.460> brain<00:00:38.670> change<00:00:39.150> over<00:00:39.449> time<00:00:39.690> as<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.260> result

of developing automaticity with math
facts<00:00:42.720> because<00:00:43.199> we<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.470> these<00:00:43.559> things

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
facts because we have all these things

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.020 
facts because we have all these things
like<00:00:43.860> working<00:00:44.160> memory<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.519> all<00:00:44.580> these<00:00:44.699> ideas

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
like working memory and all these ideas

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.310 
like working memory and all these ideas
but<00:00:45.150> like<00:00:45.269> what's<00:00:45.449> actually<00:00:45.629> happening<00:00:46.110> in

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
but like what's actually happening in

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.020 
but like what's actually happening in
terms<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.710> functional<00:00:47.100> specialization<00:00:47.610> of

terms of functional specialization of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.210 
terms of functional specialization of
your<00:00:48.150> brain<00:00:48.390> turns<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.350> quite<00:00:49.589> a<00:00:49.620> bit<00:00:49.710> okay

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
your brain turns out quite a bit okay

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.280 
your brain turns out quite a bit okay
now<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> original<00:00:51.330> graphic<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
now this is the original graphic that

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.140 
now this is the original graphic that
they<00:00:52.409> had<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.710> Journal<00:00:53.190> article<00:00:53.280> whether

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
they had in that Journal article whether

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.219 
they had in that Journal article whether
you<00:00:54.269> know<00:00:54.360> they're<00:00:54.479> labeling<00:00:54.809> all<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.049> brain

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
you know they're labeling all the brain

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:56.899 
you know they're labeling all the brain
regions<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.830> you'll<00:00:55.949> if<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.549> sort<00:00:56.790> of

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
regions and you'll if you can sort of

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.320 
regions and you'll if you can sort of
see<00:00:57.150> some<00:00:57.720> of<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:57.960> regions<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.500> blue<00:00:58.860> and

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
see some of the regions are blue and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.910 
see some of the regions are blue and
some<00:01:00.330> of<00:01:00.449> them<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:00.720> color-coded<00:01:01.379> more<00:01:01.799> like

an orange e red okay that's a very

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.939 
an orange e red okay that's a very
salient<00:01:03.809> difference<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.769> they<00:01:04.890> were

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
salient difference what they were

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.000 
salient difference what they were
looking<00:01:05.339> at<00:01:05.430> were<00:01:05.970> kids<00:01:06.420> who<00:01:06.900> had<00:01:07.229> over<00:01:07.770> time

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
looking at were kids who had over time

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.340 
looking at were kids who had over time
had<00:01:08.580> developed<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.299> certain<00:01:09.450> level<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.080> fluency

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
had developed a certain level of fluency

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.870 
had developed a certain level of fluency
and<00:01:10.590> those<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.040> did<00:01:11.190> not<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.580> we're<00:01:11.670> still

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and those that did not that we're still

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
and those that did not that we're still
using<00:01:12.060> conscious<00:01:12.780> effort<00:01:13.170> full<00:01:13.350> methods<00:01:13.799> for

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
using conscious effort full methods for

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.679 
using conscious effort full methods for
getting<00:01:14.070> math<00:01:14.310> effects<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.729> they<00:01:15.119> give<00:01:15.420> them

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
getting math effects and they give them

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.289 
getting math effects and they give them
tasks<00:01:16.470> involving<00:01:16.920> math<00:01:17.070> packs<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:18.180> they

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
tasks involving math packs and then they

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.760 
tasks involving math packs and then they
scan<00:01:18.510> their<00:01:18.689> brains<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.650> they're

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
scan their brains and what they're

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.320 
scan their brains and what they're
trying<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.190> is<00:01:20.310> look<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> average<00:01:21.120> of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
trying to do is look at the average of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.300 
trying to do is look at the average of
brain<00:01:21.570> activations<00:01:22.260> and<00:01:22.440> figure<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.710> what's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
brain activations and figure out what's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.070 
brain activations and figure out what's
different<00:01:23.580> between<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.150> kid<00:01:24.450> who's<00:01:24.630> using<00:01:24.990> an

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
different between a kid who's using an

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080 
different between a kid who's using an
effortful<00:01:25.470> method<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.010> a<00:01:26.340> kid<00:01:26.520> who<00:01:26.550> has<00:01:26.850> that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
effortful method and a kid who has that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
effortful method and a kid who has that
fluency<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.020> what<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> did<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> make<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.830> a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
fluency so what I did to make it a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.740 
fluency so what I did to make it a
little<00:01:29.010> bit<00:01:29.190> easier<00:01:29.550> for<00:01:29.580> us<00:01:29.850> non<00:01:30.510> cognitive

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
little bit easier for us non cognitive

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.810 
little bit easier for us non cognitive
scientists<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.410> I<00:01:31.770> pulled<00:01:32.130> out<00:01:32.370> some<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
scientists is I pulled out some of the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.120 
scientists is I pulled out some of the
colors<00:01:33.150> okay<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.960> now<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.200> you're<00:01:34.650> seeing<00:01:34.920> is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
colors okay so now all you're seeing is

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.360 
colors okay so now all you're seeing is
the<00:01:35.700> blue<00:01:35.910> okay<00:01:36.510> these<00:01:36.930> are<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.230> kids<00:01:37.680> who<00:01:38.220> are

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
the blue okay these are the kids who are

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.640 
the blue okay these are the kids who are
using<00:01:38.670> effortful<00:01:39.360> methods<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.260> takeaway

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
using effortful methods and the takeaway

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.560 
using effortful methods and the takeaway
here<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> cross-sections

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
here is that in all the cross-sections

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.970 
here is that in all the cross-sections
there's<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.810> lot<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.200> brain<00:01:43.410> that's<00:01:43.620> lit<00:01:43.860> up

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
there's a lot of the brain that's lit up

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.310 
there's a lot of the brain that's lit up
especially<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.090> prefrontal<00:01:45.330> cortex<00:01:45.390> so

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
especially in the prefrontal cortex so

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.770 
especially in the prefrontal cortex so
they're<00:01:46.650> using<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.159> lot<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.270> kinds<00:01:48.690> of

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
they're using a lot of the kinds of

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.030 
they're using a lot of the kinds of
parts<00:01:49.080> of<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.260> brain<00:01:49.440> that<00:01:49.590> we'd<00:01:49.740> actually

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
parts of the brain that we'd actually

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.010 
parts of the brain that we'd actually
want<00:01:50.190> them<00:01:50.370> using<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> more<00:01:51.750> advanced

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
want them using for the more advanced

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.480 
want them using for the more advanced
procedure<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.800> you're<00:01:52.980> trying<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.310> teach

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
procedure that you're trying to teach

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.620 
procedure that you're trying to teach
them<00:01:53.580> like<00:01:53.760> adding<00:01:54.060> fractions<00:01:54.240> with<00:01:54.600> unlike

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
them like adding fractions with unlike

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.760 
them like adding fractions with unlike
denominators<00:01:55.880> okay<00:01:57.409> once<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.530> kid<00:01:58.680> has

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
denominators okay once a kid has

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.480 
denominators okay once a kid has
developed<00:01:59.190> automaticity<00:02:00.920> that's<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.280> part

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
developed automaticity that's the part

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.530 
developed automaticity that's the part
they're<00:02:02.640> using<00:02:02.909> more<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> back<00:02:03.330> of<00:02:03.450> thing

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
they're using more the back of thing

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.640 
they're using more the back of thing
because<00:02:03.750> they're<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.020> retrieving<00:02:04.380> facts

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
because they're just retrieving facts

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.710 
because they're just retrieving facts
from<00:02:04.800> memory<00:02:05.159> now<00:02:06.030> we're<00:02:06.330> of<00:02:06.420> course<00:02:06.540> are

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
from memory now we're of course are

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.270 
from memory now we're of course are
educators<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.380> want<00:02:07.560> kids<00:02:07.800> using<00:02:08.129> their

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
educators we want kids using their

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.339 
educators we want kids using their
brains<00:02:08.489> we<00:02:09.420> want<00:02:09.599> them<00:02:09.720> using<00:02:09.989> their<00:02:10.110> brains

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
brains we want them using their brains

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.809 
brains we want them using their brains
on<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.649> right<00:02:10.800> things<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.220> our<00:02:11.310> classroom<00:02:11.730> at

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
on the right things in our classroom at

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.759 
on the right things in our classroom at
the<00:02:11.909> time<00:02:12.120> at<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.750> certain<00:02:13.080> point<00:02:13.200> sure<00:02:13.530> they're

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
the time at a certain point sure they're

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.220 
the time at a certain point sure they're
learning<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.400> math<00:02:14.580> facts<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.390> very<00:02:15.989> soon

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
learning the math facts but very soon

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.869 
learning the math facts but very soon
thereafter<00:02:16.409> that<00:02:16.590> we<00:02:16.799> want<00:02:17.010> them<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.220> utilize

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
thereafter that we want them to utilize

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.520 
thereafter that we want them to utilize
the<00:02:18.180> math<00:02:18.360> effect<00:02:18.599> when<00:02:19.080> they're<00:02:19.260> adding

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the math effect when they're adding

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.410 
the math effect when they're adding
fractions<00:02:19.709> with<00:02:20.069> unlike<00:02:20.099> denominators

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
fractions with unlike denominators

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.580 
fractions with unlike denominators
something<00:02:21.420> like<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.170> see<00:02:22.470> how

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
something like that so you can see how

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.170 
something like that so you can see how
when<00:02:22.799> you've<00:02:22.920> got<00:02:23.099> this<00:02:23.250> very<00:02:23.340> precious

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
when you've got this very precious

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.420 
when you've got this very precious
finite<00:02:24.630> resource<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.470> your<00:02:25.890> brain<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.160> sort

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
finite resource and your brain is sort

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.080 
finite resource and your brain is sort
of<00:02:26.459> lit<00:02:26.640> up<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.910> Christmas<00:02:27.390> tree

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
of lit up like a Christmas tree

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.420 
of lit up like a Christmas tree
with<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.300> math<00:02:28.540> back<00:02:28.810> part<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.430> what's

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
with the math back part of it what's

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.160 
with the math back part of it what's
left<00:02:30.640> for<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.360> thing<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.660> you're<00:02:31.810> trying<00:02:32.019> to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
left for the thing that you're trying to

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.509 
left for the thing that you're trying to
teach<00:02:32.349> okay<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.720> men<00:02:35.560> on<00:02:35.709> in<00:02:35.920> 2010<00:02:36.310> he<00:02:36.400> was

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
teach okay and so men on in 2010 he was

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.309 
teach okay and so men on in 2010 he was
actually<00:02:36.670> one<00:02:36.849> of<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.060> people<00:02:37.750> who<00:02:37.870> was<00:02:38.019> part

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
actually one of the people who was part

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.190 
actually one of the people who was part
of<00:02:38.349> that<00:02:38.410> 2005<00:02:39.040> study<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:40.060> know<00:02:40.180> with<00:02:40.420> to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
of that 2005 study you know with to

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.420 
of that 2005 study you know with to
summarize<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.709> text<00:02:41.980> up<00:02:42.069> there<00:02:42.099> what<00:02:42.310> they're

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
summarize the text up there what they're

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.030 
summarize the text up there what they're
basically<00:02:42.700> saying<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.239> if<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:44.410> prefrontal

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
basically saying is if the prefrontal

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.550 
basically saying is if the prefrontal
cortex<00:02:45.099> is<00:02:45.700> loaded<00:02:46.209> with<00:02:46.720> just<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.110> process

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
cortex is loaded with just the process

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.320 
cortex is loaded with just the process
of<00:02:47.680> coming<00:02:47.830> up<00:02:47.980> with<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.129> math<00:02:48.370> facts<00:02:48.849> there's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
of coming up with the math facts there's

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.940 
of coming up with the math facts there's
a<00:02:49.420> problem<00:02:49.959> there's<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.170> computational<00:02:50.769> load

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
a problem there's a computational load

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.710 
a problem there's a computational load
there<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:51.549> what<00:02:51.670> we<00:02:51.790> have<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.150> do<00:02:52.299> is<00:02:52.510> figure

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
there so what we have to do is figure

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.630 
there so what we have to do is figure
out<00:02:52.840> teaching<00:02:53.379> strategies<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.310> as<00:02:54.430> quickly

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
out teaching strategies that as quickly

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.490 
out teaching strategies that as quickly
as<00:02:54.819> possible<00:02:54.849> through<00:02:55.480> efficient<00:02:56.170> repeated

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
as possible through efficient repeated

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.020 
as possible through efficient repeated
practice<00:02:56.709> get<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.310> back<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.790> it's<00:02:57.879> being

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
practice get it back so that it's being

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.430 
practice get it back so that it's being
retrieved<00:02:58.330> from<00:02:58.510> long<00:02:58.750> term<00:02:58.989> memories<00:02:59.290> they

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
retrieved from long term memories they

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.750 
retrieved from long term memories they
basically<00:02:59.799> look<00:02:59.950> at<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.099> brain<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.610> this<00:03:00.700> is

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
basically look at the brain and this is

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.250 
basically look at the brain and this is
gonna<00:03:00.880> be<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.030> simplification<00:03:01.299> it's<00:03:02.019> like<00:03:02.230> a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
gonna be a simplification it's like a

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.930 
gonna be a simplification it's like a
couple<00:03:02.530> of<00:03:02.560> boxes<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.190> functional<00:03:03.610> parts

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
couple of boxes and functional parts

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.640 
couple of boxes and functional parts
right<00:03:04.150> where<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.569> have<00:03:04.720> fact<00:03:04.989> retrieval<00:03:05.560> you

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
right where you have fact retrieval you

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.229 
right where you have fact retrieval you
have<00:03:05.769> executive<00:03:06.040> control<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.209> have

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
have executive control and you have

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.210 
have executive control and you have
computation<00:03:08.079> and<00:03:08.170> working<00:03:08.440> memory<00:03:08.620> over<00:03:08.950> here

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
computation and working memory over here

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.280 
computation and working memory over here
and<00:03:09.370> if<00:03:09.730> these<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:09.970> executive<00:03:10.660> control<00:03:10.840> and

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
and if these the executive control and
