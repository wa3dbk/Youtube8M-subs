on that which I'll link to above but

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.920 
on that which I'll link to above but
basically<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.549> takes<00:01:17.670> my<00:01:17.880> live<00:01:18.090> cable<00:01:18.360> legally

devices can get access to it and once

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.760 
devices can get access to it and once
you<00:01:22.950> install<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.880> HD<00:01:24.210> homerun<00:01:24.420> app<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.590> live

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
you install the HD homerun app the live

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.800 
you install the HD homerun app the live
channels<00:01:26.220> app<00:01:26.400> becomes<00:01:26.790> active<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.600> works

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
channels app becomes active and it works

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.300 
channels app becomes active and it works
kind<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.409> would<00:01:28.500> expect<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.009> it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
kind of like you would expect it to it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.460 
kind of like you would expect it to it
tunes<00:01:29.610> live<00:01:29.880> television<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.720> still<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> little

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
tunes live television I still a little

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.410 
tunes live television I still a little
bit<00:01:31.650> buggy<00:01:31.979> at<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> moment<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.240> big

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
bit buggy at the moment but the big

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.810 
bit buggy at the moment but the big
difference<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> they<00:01:34.470> now<00:01:34.650> support

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
difference is is that they now support

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.520 
difference is is that they now support
mpeg-2<00:01:35.820> hardware<00:01:36.270> decoding<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.229> device

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
mpeg-2 hardware decoding on the device

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.620 
mpeg-2 hardware decoding on the device
so<00:01:37.860> before<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.520> couldn't<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.210> tune<00:01:39.450> my

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
so before I couldn't really tune my

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.390 
so before I couldn't really tune my
cable<00:01:40.020> system<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.530> well<00:01:40.860> because<00:01:41.280> of

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
cable system all that well because of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520 
cable system all that well because of
that<00:01:41.430> issue<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.509> now<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.229> what's<00:01:43.350> neat

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
that issue but now I can and what's neat

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.230 
that issue but now I can and what's neat
about<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.640> looks<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
about it is that it looks at all the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.460 
about it is that it looks at all the
last<00:01:45.420> couple<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.869> channels<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.350> was

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
last couple of channels that I was

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.530 
last couple of channels that I was
looking<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.610> tells<00:01:47.970> me<00:01:48.119> what's<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
looking at and tells me what's on that

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.060 
looking at and tells me what's on that
channel<00:01:48.960> right<00:01:49.259> now<00:01:49.290> which<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.770> thought<00:01:49.920> was

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
channel right now which I thought was

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.130 
channel right now which I thought was
really<00:01:50.130> neat<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.880> very<00:01:51.030> easily<00:01:51.270> see

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
really neat so I can very easily see

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.020 
really neat so I can very easily see
what's<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.920> also<00:01:53.040> get<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> full<00:01:53.579> program

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
what's on I can also get a full program

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
what's on I can also get a full program
guide<00:01:54.299> too<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.840> wish<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.439> go<00:01:55.619> over<00:01:55.649> to

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
guide too if I wish so I can go over to

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
guide too if I wish so I can go over to
the<00:01:56.040> program<00:01:56.369> guide<00:01:56.610> here<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.360> guess<00:01:57.509> what

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the program guide here and I guess what

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.760 
the program guide here and I guess what
they're<00:01:57.689> going<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:58.079> doing<00:01:58.229> soon<00:01:58.560> is

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
they're going to be doing soon is

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.550 
they're going to be doing soon is
integrating<00:01:59.430> not<00:02:00.090> only<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.930> stuff<00:02:01.170> off<00:02:01.380> my

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
integrating not only this stuff off my

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.800 
integrating not only this stuff off my
cable<00:02:01.770> system<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.640> things<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.659> might

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
cable system but things that you might

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.600 
cable system but things that you might
be<00:02:03.869> able<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.320> get<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.770> some<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.250> these<00:02:05.310> live

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
be able to get on some of these live

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.280 
be able to get on some of these live
streaming<00:02:06.030> services<00:02:06.509> too<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:06.899> there's<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> lot

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
streaming services too so there's a lot

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.749 
streaming services too so there's a lot
of<00:02:07.320> cool<00:02:07.770> stuff<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.129> might<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.459> coming<00:02:08.729> down

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
of cool stuff that might be coming down

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.309 
of cool stuff that might be coming down
the<00:02:09.000> pike<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.569> finally<00:02:09.959> works

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
the pike here and this finally works

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.199 
the pike here and this finally works
which<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.800> something<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.489> didn't<00:02:11.790> really<00:02:11.940> do

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
which is something it didn't really do

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.440 
which is something it didn't really do
before<00:02:12.629> which<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.959> was<00:02:13.080> very

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
before which I was very

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.930 
before which I was very
happy<00:02:13.690> with<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.170> also<00:02:14.319> will<00:02:14.560> let<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:14.770> TV<00:02:15.760> show

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
happy with it also will let that TV show

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.580 
happy with it also will let that TV show
kind<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.209> run<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.629> background<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:17.410> the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
kind of run in the background of the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.839 
kind of run in the background of the
menu<00:02:17.860> system<00:02:18.069> here<00:02:18.400> while<00:02:18.550> you're<00:02:18.700> just

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
menu system here while you're just

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.640 
menu system here while you're just
navigating<00:02:19.629> around<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.110> system<00:02:20.470> which<00:02:20.620> is

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
navigating around the system which is

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.830 
navigating around the system which is
pretty<00:02:21.459> cool<00:02:21.760> too<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.300> was<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.420> nice<00:02:22.599> new

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
pretty cool too so that was a nice new

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.509 
pretty cool too so that was a nice new
change<00:02:23.140> there<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.920> last<00:02:24.099> thing<00:02:24.340> that's

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
change there the last thing that's

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.369 
change there the last thing that's
pretty<00:02:24.730> major<00:02:24.940> is<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.660> can<00:02:25.840> now<00:02:26.019> use

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
pretty major is that you can now use

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.380 
pretty major is that you can now use
external<00:02:27.220> storage<00:02:27.550> on<00:02:27.879> here<00:02:28.150> which<00:02:28.300> you

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
external storage on here which you

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.000 
external storage on here which you
couldn't<00:02:28.629> really<00:02:28.810> do<00:02:29.050> before<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.769> if<00:02:29.830> you<00:02:29.890> go

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
couldn't really do before so if you go

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.589 
couldn't really do before so if you go
into<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.310> settings<00:02:30.489> screen<00:02:31.060> here<00:02:31.420> I'm<00:02:31.510> gonna

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
into the settings screen here I'm gonna

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.320 
into the settings screen here I'm gonna
take<00:02:31.810> out<00:02:32.440> this<00:02:32.739> USB<00:02:33.280> stick<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.940> plug<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.209> into

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
take out this USB stick and plug it into

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.780 
take out this USB stick and plug it into
this<00:02:34.569> hub<00:02:34.780> this<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:34.959> an<00:02:35.140> Ethernet<00:02:35.620> USB<00:02:36.220> hubs

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
this hub this is an Ethernet USB hubs

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.830 
this hub this is an Ethernet USB hubs
hopefully<00:02:37.030> I'm<00:02:37.120> not<00:02:37.150> going<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.390> draw<00:02:37.540> too<00:02:37.720> much

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
hopefully I'm not going to draw too much

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.839 
hopefully I'm not going to draw too much
power<00:02:38.080> out<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:39.130> was<00:02:39.549> able<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.760> get

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
power out of it but I was able to get

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.160 
power out of it but I was able to get
eastern<00:02:40.150> networking<00:02:40.569> -<00:02:40.660> were<00:02:40.720> here<00:02:40.840> -<00:02:41.019> which

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
eastern networking - were here - which

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.360 
eastern networking - were here - which
has<00:02:41.319> been<00:02:41.349> great<00:02:41.620> especially<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:42.160> doing

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
has been great especially for doing

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.960 
has been great especially for doing
mpeg-2<00:02:43.090> cable<00:02:44.019> broadcasting<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.370> now<00:02:45.670> we<00:02:45.730> have

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
mpeg-2 cable broadcasting so now we have

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.089 
mpeg-2 cable broadcasting so now we have
plugged<00:02:46.299> this<00:02:46.480> 16<00:02:46.870> gigabyte<00:02:47.319> memory<00:02:47.620> stick<00:02:47.920> in

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
plugged this 16 gigabyte memory stick in

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.710 
plugged this 16 gigabyte memory stick in
we're<00:02:48.280> gonna<00:02:48.370> see<00:02:48.610> if<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.819> is<00:02:48.970> available<00:02:49.150> on

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
we're gonna see if it is available on

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.270 
we're gonna see if it is available on
here<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:50.170> there<00:02:50.590> we<00:02:50.709> go<00:02:50.830> we've<00:02:50.980> got<00:02:51.160> the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
here and there we go we've got the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.610 
here and there we go we've got the
Kingston<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:51.849> can<00:02:52.000> then<00:02:52.150> tap<00:02:52.390> on<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:53.049> I

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
Kingston I can then tap on that and I

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.830 
Kingston I can then tap on that and I
can<00:02:53.829> go<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.130> format<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.640> as<00:02:54.880> device<00:02:55.360> storage

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
can go and format it as device storage

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.080 
can go and format it as device storage
so<00:02:55.959> what<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.349> going<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.650> do<00:02:56.860> is<00:02:57.489> encrypt

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
so what this is going to do is encrypt

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.400 
so what this is going to do is encrypt
it<00:02:58.239> so<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.510> can<00:02:58.599> only<00:02:58.720> work<00:02:59.170> with<00:02:59.200> this

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
it so it can only work with this

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.500 
it so it can only work with this
particular<00:02:59.739> Nexus<00:03:00.340> player<00:03:00.489> but<00:03:00.970> when<00:03:01.360> it's

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
particular Nexus player but when it's

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.000 
particular Nexus player but when it's
done<00:03:01.750> I'm<00:03:01.930> gonna<00:03:02.049> go<00:03:02.200> ahead<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.560> select<00:03:02.739> this

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
done I'm gonna go ahead and select this

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.580 
done I'm gonna go ahead and select this
now<00:03:03.250> when<00:03:03.970> it's<00:03:04.120> done<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.630> should<00:03:04.930> be<00:03:05.079> able<00:03:05.349> to

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
now when it's done I should be able to

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.940 
now when it's done I should be able to
use<00:03:06.190> this<00:03:06.519> as<00:03:07.170> storage<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.319> addition<00:03:08.769> to

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
use this as storage in addition to

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.530 
use this as storage in addition to
what's<00:03:09.160> on<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.579> device<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.120> we're<00:03:10.209> gonna<00:03:10.299> let

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
what's on the device so we're gonna let

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.569 
what's on the device so we're gonna let
this<00:03:10.690> format<00:03:11.200> here<00:03:11.440> for<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.709> second<00:03:12.099> and<00:03:12.160> then

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
this format here for a second and then

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.309 
this format here for a second and then
come<00:03:12.790> back<00:03:12.819> when<00:03:13.180> it's<00:03:13.360> done<00:03:13.540> all<00:03:14.079> right<00:03:14.200> we

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
come back when it's done all right we

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.990 
come back when it's done all right we
are<00:03:14.349> done<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.099> warning<00:03:15.579> me<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:15.730> this

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
are done and it is warning me that this

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.970 
are done and it is warning me that this
device<00:03:16.360> appears<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:17.049> be<00:03:17.170> slow<00:03:17.590> but<00:03:17.829> that's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
device appears to be slow but that's

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.440 
device appears to be slow but that's
okay<00:03:18.250> we're<00:03:18.430> just<00:03:18.459> doing<00:03:18.639> this<00:03:18.850> for<00:03:19.120> testing

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
okay we're just doing this for testing

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.750 
okay we're just doing this for testing
purposes<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.590> now<00:03:20.739> we'll<00:03:20.920> see<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.130> we<00:03:21.519> have

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
purposes and now we'll see that we have

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.940 
purposes and now we'll see that we have
some<00:03:22.510> available<00:03:22.989> space<00:03:23.290> on<00:03:23.500> here<00:03:23.799> so<00:03:23.889> I'm

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
some available space on here so I'm

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.650 
some available space on here so I'm
gonna<00:03:24.040> back<00:03:24.310> out<00:03:24.639> of<00:03:24.670> here<00:03:24.970> for<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.209> second<00:03:25.630> and

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
gonna back out of here for a second and

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.210 
gonna back out of here for a second and
I<00:03:25.780> think<00:03:26.049> what<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.200> should<00:03:26.260> be<00:03:26.530> able<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.769> do<00:03:26.980> now

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
I think what I should be able to do now

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.449 
I think what I should be able to do now
is<00:03:27.880> go<00:03:28.060> over<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.389> my<00:03:28.600> apps<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.190> actually<00:03:30.190> move

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
is go over to my apps and actually move

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.099 
is go over to my apps and actually move
something<00:03:30.940> over<00:03:31.329> there<00:03:31.569> so<00:03:31.720> let's<00:03:31.900> take

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
something over there so let's take

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.410 
something over there so let's take
something<00:03:32.410> like<00:03:32.680> Hulu<00:03:33.220> Plus<00:03:33.400> here<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.120> see

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
something like Hulu Plus here and see

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.879 
something like Hulu Plus here and see
what<00:03:34.630> we<00:03:34.720> might<00:03:34.840> be<00:03:34.989> able<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.139> do<00:03:35.350> with<00:03:35.500> this<00:03:35.680> so

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
what we might be able to do with this so

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.539 
what we might be able to do with this so
I<00:03:35.920> can<00:03:36.250> go<00:03:37.120> over<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.750> storage<00:03:38.350> use<00:03:38.680> perhaps<00:03:38.980> and

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
I can go over to storage use perhaps and

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.090 
I can go over to storage use perhaps and
maybe<00:03:40.510> move<00:03:40.780> this<00:03:41.109> over<00:03:41.319> there<00:03:41.739> we<00:03:41.799> go<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.040> I

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
maybe move this over there we go so I

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.620 
maybe move this over there we go so I
can<00:03:42.220> select<00:03:42.340> Kingston<00:03:42.880> storage<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:43.420> now<00:03:43.510> it's

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
can select Kingston storage and now it's

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.620 
can select Kingston storage and now it's
going<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:43.900> move<00:03:44.109> that<00:03:44.319> app<00:03:44.590> over<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.970> this

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
going to move that app over to this

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.180 
going to move that app over to this
memory<00:03:46.900> stick<00:03:47.290> on<00:03:47.440> here<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:47.680> should<00:03:47.799> note<00:03:48.160> that

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
memory stick on here I should note that

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.120 
memory stick on here I should note that
I<00:03:48.400> am<00:03:48.489> connecting<00:03:49.120> this<00:03:49.329> with<00:03:50.019> an<00:03:50.170> OTG<00:03:50.620> cable

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
I am connecting this with an OTG cable

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.650 
I am connecting this with an OTG cable
so<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.489> have<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:51.760> plugged<00:03:52.000> into<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.329> microUSB

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
so I have it plugged into the microUSB

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.110 
so I have it plugged into the microUSB
port<00:03:53.350> on<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.829> Nexus<00:03:54.190> player<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.670> then<00:03:55.000> I've

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
port on the Nexus player and then I've

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.180 
port on the Nexus player and then I've
got<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.480> little<00:03:55.690> USB<00:03:56.200> Ethernet<00:03:56.769> hub<00:03:56.950> here

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
got the little USB Ethernet hub here

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.800 
got the little USB Ethernet hub here
connected<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.730> that<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.239> would<00:03:58.599> suggest

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
connected to that I would suggest

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.500 
connected to that I would suggest
probably<00:03:59.590> for<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.799> best<00:04:00.040> solution<00:04:00.639> would<00:04:01.329> be

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
probably for the best solution would be

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.839 
probably for the best solution would be
to<00:04:01.660> get<00:04:01.900> like<00:04:02.139> a<00:04:02.170> powered<00:04:02.739> USB<00:04:02.769> hub<00:04:03.609> and<00:04:03.639> then

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
to get like a powered USB hub and then

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.940 
to get like a powered USB hub and then
plug<00:04:04.150> in<00:04:04.389> like<00:04:04.599> an<00:04:04.720> external<00:04:05.230> hard<00:04:05.470> drive<00:04:05.530> into

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
plug in like an external hard drive into

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.920 
plug in like an external hard drive into
that<00:04:06.099> and<00:04:07.000> what<00:04:07.120> that<00:04:07.269> will<00:04:07.329> do<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.540> give<00:04:07.780> you<00:04:07.900> a

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
that and what that will do is give you a

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.690 
that and what that will do is give you a
lot<00:04:08.260> more<00:04:08.290> available<00:04:08.920> storage<00:04:09.190> which<00:04:09.489> really

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
lot more available storage which really

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.550 
lot more available storage which really
makes<00:04:09.970> this<00:04:10.120> more<00:04:10.359> much<00:04:10.720> more<00:04:10.900> useful<00:04:11.139> as<00:04:11.530> a

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
makes this more much more useful as a

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.220 
makes this more much more useful as a
gaming<00:04:12.010> device<00:04:12.160> because<00:04:12.910> you'll<00:04:13.090> have<00:04:13.239> plenty

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
gaming device because you'll have plenty

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.140 
gaming device because you'll have plenty
of<00:04:14.500> space<00:04:14.829> now<00:04:15.099> to<00:04:15.190> install<00:04:15.700> things<00:04:15.940> and

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
of space now to install things and

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.580 
of space now to install things and
actually<00:04:16.239> be<00:04:16.479> able<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.750> use<00:04:16.959> them<00:04:17.169> so<00:04:17.320> this<00:04:17.410> is

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
actually be able to use them so this is

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.990 
actually be able to use them so this is
great<00:04:17.889> now<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.250> we<00:04:18.310> can<00:04:18.489> do<00:04:18.609> this<00:04:18.760> I<00:04:18.880> would

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
great now that we can do this I would

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.849 
great now that we can do this I would
imagine<00:04:19.209> this<00:04:19.450> will<00:04:19.570> probably<00:04:19.750> carry<00:04:20.440> over

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
imagine this will probably carry over

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.370 
imagine this will probably carry over
into<00:04:21.039> other<00:04:21.370> Android<00:04:21.970> devices<00:04:22.180> too<00:04:23.020> but<00:04:23.260> now

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
into other Android devices too but now

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.589 
into other Android devices too but now
we<00:04:23.440> can<00:04:23.650> open<00:04:23.770> up<00:04:23.979> Hulu<00:04:24.310> Plus<00:04:24.460> running<00:04:25.240> off<00:04:25.570> of

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
we can open up Hulu Plus running off of

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.170 
we can open up Hulu Plus running off of
that<00:04:25.900> memory<00:04:26.229> stick<00:04:26.530> now<00:04:26.710> verse

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
that memory stick now verse

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.460 
that memory stick now verse
having<00:04:27.479> to<00:04:27.600> rely<00:04:27.870> on<00:04:27.900> just<00:04:28.080> what<00:04:28.380> was

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
having to rely on just what was

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.020 
having to rely on just what was
available<00:04:28.710> on<00:04:28.979> the<00:04:29.039> internal<00:04:29.580> storage<00:04:29.940> and

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
available on the internal storage and

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.999 
available on the internal storage and
that<00:04:30.180> was<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.330> significant<00:04:31.110> limitation<00:04:31.229> of

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
that was a significant limitation of

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:33.920 
that was a significant limitation of
prior<00:04:32.580> versions<00:04:33.090> of<00:04:33.270> Android<00:04:33.690> or<00:04:33.750> at<00:04:33.810> least

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
prior versions of Android or at least

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.570 
prior versions of Android or at least
the<00:04:34.080> lollipop<00:04:34.710> version<00:04:34.919> I<00:04:35.190> think<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.430> one

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
the lollipop version I think the one

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.950 
the lollipop version I think the one
before<00:04:35.759> that<00:04:35.970> was<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.389> you<00:04:36.479> really<00:04:36.690> couldn't

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
before that was that you really couldn't

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.990 
before that was that you really couldn't
do<00:04:37.139> anything<00:04:37.350> all<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.770> useful<00:04:38.039> off<00:04:38.759> the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
do anything all that useful off the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.300 
do anything all that useful off the
external<00:04:39.449> storage<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:40.020> now<00:04:40.289> we<00:04:40.350> can<00:04:41.009> although

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
external storage and now we can although

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.650 
external storage and now we can although
I<00:04:41.370> got<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.580> pay<00:04:41.729> eight<00:04:41.850> bucks<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:42.180> month<00:04:42.210> for<00:04:42.449> the

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
I got to pay eight bucks a month for the

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.900 
I got to pay eight bucks a month for the
the<00:04:42.990> service<00:04:43.350> here<00:04:43.590> so<00:04:43.830> those<00:04:44.460> are<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.699> three

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
the service here so those are the three

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.150 
the service here so those are the three
big<00:04:45.150> features<00:04:45.570> that<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:45.810> saw<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.770> MPEG

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
big features that I saw the MPEG

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.550 
big features that I saw the MPEG
hardware<00:04:47.580> decoding<00:04:48.030> which<00:04:48.539> is<00:04:48.690> now<00:04:48.900> really

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
hardware decoding which is now really

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.779 
hardware decoding which is now really
going<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.800> make<00:04:50.009> this<00:04:50.160> useful<00:04:50.400> as<00:04:50.759> a

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
going to make this useful as a

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.850 
going to make this useful as a
television<00:04:51.180> tuner<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:52.320> fact<00:04:52.530> that<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:52.710> can

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
television tuner the fact that you can

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.439 
television tuner the fact that you can
use<00:04:52.979> bluetooth<00:04:53.400> headphones<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.150> the

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
use bluetooth headphones and the

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.230 
use bluetooth headphones and the
external<00:04:54.780> storage<00:04:55.229> also<00:04:55.889> really<00:04:56.699> adds<00:04:56.910> a

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
external storage also really adds a

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.029 
external storage also really adds a
tremendous<00:04:57.840> amount<00:04:58.020> of<00:04:58.169> functionality<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:59.009> a

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
tremendous amount of functionality to a

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.279 
tremendous amount of functionality to a
device<00:04:59.460> that<00:04:59.789> well<00:05:00.210> very<00:05:00.449> nice<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.080> polished

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
device that well very nice and polished

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.320 
device that well very nice and polished
really<00:05:01.860> didn't<00:05:02.130> feel<00:05:02.250> like<00:05:02.430> it<00:05:02.490> was<00:05:02.639> doing

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
really didn't feel like it was doing

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.390 
really didn't feel like it was doing
everything<00:05:03.750> it<00:05:03.870> could<00:05:04.080> do<00:05:04.349> now<00:05:05.009> it's<00:05:05.190> a<00:05:05.280> lot

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
everything it could do now it's a lot

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.010 
everything it could do now it's a lot
closer<00:05:05.729> to<00:05:06.030> that<00:05:06.210> so<00:05:06.360> I'll<00:05:06.419> put<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.599> link<00:05:06.840> below

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
closer to that so I'll put a link below

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.409 
closer to that so I'll put a link below
as<00:05:07.289> to<00:05:07.380> how<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.560> can<00:05:07.979> go<00:05:08.610> out<00:05:08.729> and<00:05:08.880> grab<00:05:09.120> this

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
as to how you can go out and grab this

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.020 
as to how you can go out and grab this
and<00:05:09.690> install<00:05:10.169> it<00:05:10.410> it's<00:05:10.860> it's<00:05:11.220> not<00:05:11.370> too<00:05:11.610> hard<00:05:11.910> it

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
and install it it's it's not too hard it

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.219 
and install it it's it's not too hard it
really<00:05:12.240> shouldn't<00:05:12.449> you<00:05:12.660> shouldn't<00:05:12.900> feel<00:05:13.020> like

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
really shouldn't you shouldn't feel like

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.290 
really shouldn't you shouldn't feel like
oh<00:05:13.349> my<00:05:13.500> gosh<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.800> can't<00:05:13.979> do<00:05:14.099> it<00:05:14.190> it's<00:05:14.460> really<00:05:14.550> not

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
oh my gosh I can't do it it's really not

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.060 
oh my gosh I can't do it it's really not
a<00:05:15.360> very<00:05:15.449> difficult<00:05:15.840> process<00:05:16.320> to<00:05:16.530> go<00:05:16.770> through

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
a very difficult process to go through

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.980 
a very difficult process to go through
and<00:05:17.340> once<00:05:17.580> its<00:05:17.729> installed<00:05:17.820> it's<00:05:18.720> going<00:05:18.780> to

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
and once its installed it's going to

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.749 
and once its installed it's going to
become<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.229> much<00:05:19.560> more<00:05:19.800> useful<00:05:20.009> device<00:05:20.550> and

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
become a much more useful device and

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.400 
become a much more useful device and
this<00:05:20.849> is<00:05:20.970> LAN<00:05:21.120> siphon<00:05:21.599> with<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:21.900> Nexus<00:05:22.380> player

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
this is LAN siphon with the Nexus player

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:30.530 
this is LAN siphon with the Nexus player
one<00:05:22.919> more<00:05:23.070> time<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.550> thanks<00:05:24.030> for<00:05:24.120> watching
