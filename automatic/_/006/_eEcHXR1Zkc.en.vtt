00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.710
 how to turn on and configure what is to go 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.629
 and inside our iphone phone yo 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.849
 in this case I have a iphone 5 phone 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:15.209
 with the operating system version ios 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.250
 is 7 as many of you know siri 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.800
 it helps us technically 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.439
 questions of anything and obviously 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
 get a more or less answer 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.460
 I want to give an example and especially 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.160
 for those people who do not know 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.599
 exactly how does it work 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.150
 regularly we have to do is 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.270
 press and hold the home key on the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.160
 part of below and wait for us 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.430
 make a sound for immediately 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.650
 start talking I'm going to keep oppressed 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.790
 the home key 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.790
 how is the weather 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.309
 well here I am asking you in 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.680
 English because I have configured what 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.440
 that is my sir and at this moment for the 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.059
 English language although my phone does 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.420
 I have in Spanish but then you 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.440
 I want to show you exactly how 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.170
 turn it on and move these settings 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.060
 in the event that it is necessary I will 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.270
 press the home key to exit 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.340
 again he always tries to locate the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.080
 configuration icon exactly as you see it 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.539
 at the bottom in the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.119
 phone settings we are going to 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.130
 enter the general tab within 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.860
 general we will find what is the 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.409
 say tab and by clicking on the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.179
 tell tab and we at first 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.179
 instance we will have the possibility 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.159
 to turn it off or turn it on if you give yourself 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.740
 account at this moment I have it 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.220
 turned on that's why you see a color 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.319
 as green if I move that control towards 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.720
 the left would automatically be 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.909
 paying and having it off I do not 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.530
 would have the ability to move any 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.360
 of its configurations in the part of 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.280
 down 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.110
 in the bottom part having what 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.450
 on we will find in first 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.790
 place what is the language if you give yourself 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.270
 I had my phone in Spanish 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.240
 more however if I had it in what 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.910
 is the English language if I enter this 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.690
 tab I can locate the language of 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.830
 my preference then take what 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.090
 let's say mexico and immediately after 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.459
 go back to the previous tab 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.770
 technically up to this point we 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.380
 we have already selected the language of siri 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.950
 and you're ready to technically 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.750
 Let's start asking in Spanish now 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.630
 in the next answer option 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.820
 spoken if you realize 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.830
 find the option of always that 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.380
 means that at any time you 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.020
 can you activate siri or maybe you could 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.840
 select only when you had 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.480
 a hands- free device we 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.300
 we come back in the bottom part continues 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.700
 my data information within the 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.160
 what is my data are you going to find a 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.990
 list of what your contacts are 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.270
 currently you have on your phone 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.430
 how can you tell if you are 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.950
 taking my own information because I 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.870
 I'm the owner of the phone in that option 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.790
 I recommend that you leave it as it is 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.860
 found there and then in the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.590
 part of below you will find elevate 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.990
 to speak that means when 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.820
 you hit what is the phone in the 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.490
 ear you can technically activate 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.860
 siri that way by default it 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.530
 finds off this is technically 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.110
 a personal taste I always leave it 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.180
 deactivated because I like it more like 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.550
 press the button quoted from home to 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.190
 technically activate it and good up 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.410
 this point we have already turned on and 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.630
 configured what is to go and in our 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.110
 own language the only thing that remains for you is 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.770
 start asking him questions 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.570
 I'm going to leave here 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.570
 if you love me 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.489
 but sometimes answer some 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.739
 weird mean things but well 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.660
 get to play with citi and then good to 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.540
 see what you answer I want to mention you 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.910
 something very important before finishing 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.640
 this video if we come to what 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.580
 is again the configuration we enter 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.550
 back to what is general and we 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.220
 we come to siri we are going to notice a great 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.350
 difference with respect to the language that you 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.300
 choose I do not know if you were an observer 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.669
 at the beginning of this tutorial but I 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.100
 I initially had the English language in 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.930
 where I put an option more than me 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.840
 I remove when I select the language 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.190
 Spanish let me return it to English for 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.490
 that you notice what I am mentioning 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.380
 I'll go back if you notice in 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.660
 some other languages ​​may give you the 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.300
 possibility of changing the gender of the 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.610
 voice in this case in the English language by 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.360
 Default is a woman if I enter 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.080
 that section 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.450
 I could change it to man then you 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.540
 technically if you have that possibility 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.360
 to choose the genre you can select 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.939

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.129
