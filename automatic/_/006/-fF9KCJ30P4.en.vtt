00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.129
 [music] 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.200
 in this video we will tell you how 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.969
 self-diagnose suspension 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.320
 and understand what details need 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.780
 repair or replace 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.900
 first we need a garage with a pit 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.760
 lift or flyover goal get 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.760
 opportunity to inspect the car below 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.000
 it would also be nice to acquire 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.330
 gloves and montazhki they us 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.670
 will be required 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.770
 normal phenomenon for such year he 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.150
 decided to come to us if you're in 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.880
 see your car for the first time 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.559
 this perspective do not be alarmed at seeming 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.960
 device suspension complexity 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.680
 it consists of typical elements let's 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.900
 consider each of them separately and 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.920
 so ball bearings are used in points 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.440
 mobile t-shaped connections 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.019
 salenbloki gum insert it into 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.789
 vibration damping bolting 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.629
 and noise anthers and such rubber covers 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.629
 closing some nodes from 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.310
 penetration of water and dirt 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.080
 rubber ring glands which 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.780
 set to hold nodes 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.229
 oil in the place where they go 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.330
 rotating shaft and 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.860
 or moving parts spring bearings 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.299
 shock strut general then probably 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.149
 all inspection procedures are standard and 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.679
 simple we took turns to start 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.929
 we carry out a visual inspection 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.240
 left and right parts of the suspension are assembled 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.549
 symmetrically so comparing them you 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.280
 can see if all the parts and fasteners 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.240
 items in place in this case 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.960
 lacks 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.119
 single item such content if 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.899
 something missing then moving on 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.220
 such a car is very dangerous here 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:54.460
 see that there is not enough nut 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.670
 which attracts further to -12 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.009
 Here we see that the locking exit from 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.810
 second you need to shake the posted wheels 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.330
 in vertical and horizontal 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.040
 planes 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.619
 no knocks and backlash should be 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.180
 [music] 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.690
 if they are present then required 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.390
 repairs 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.090
 now firmly take the wheel with both hands 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.970
 and gently turning at the same time 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.530
 shaking slightly so we check on 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.950
 wear wheel bearing 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.940
 in this case, killing tired bearings 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.040
 no how 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.500
 it will be felt 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.660
 corny hand function if there is even 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.180
 minute play or rotation occurs 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.190
 with wedged bearing needs 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.760
 replacing now go to inspect the anthers 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.340
 all of which we find they must be whole and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.590
 elastic if you see on the rubber 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.770
 cracks or tears then such a boot 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.400
 needs to be replaced as soon as possible 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.200
 wires 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.270
 damage and anthers that threatens the speedy 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.180
 failure 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:08.060
 roller clutch device. simpler 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.270
 saying russian grenade 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.160
 at the same time we check brake hoses 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.680
 no cracks allowed in 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.900
 otherwise, urgent replacement of the brake 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.670
 sloppiness do not forgive now we take in 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.310
 hands harvested crowbar or assembler 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.730
 go check the ball bearings a little bit 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.950
 theories 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.490
 The working part of the ball consists of a body 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.440
 finger and plastic liners in process 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.890
 work wear it is plastic 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.170
 liner 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.740
 your task using multidirectional 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.700
 efforts to understand there is wear or not 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.180
 checked 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.920
 also night 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:51.700
 Dasha will strengthen there should not be any 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.200
 so no jolts if you feel that 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.840
 ball backlash 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.030
 to replace if you got a small 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.980
 ball connections such as such 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.069
 it is enough to understand their wear 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.530
 just move the hoist with your fingers in 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.599
 Ideally, the move should be very different if 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.219
 loose or feel free play then 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:14.500
 better to replace our next object 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.900
 close attention silent blocks 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.720
 if they are not ok then these are the ones 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.199
 knocks on suspension integrity pilot 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.220
 stabilizer and characteristic incremental 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:29.430
 see that 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.550
 installment since rubber has a property 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.560
 get started 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.560
 and from here 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.450
 check and just enough first 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.870
 inspect visually for cracks 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.550
 and their impulse should not be 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.410
 then insert montazhku in the compound and 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.040
 gently trying to push 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:54.720
 silent block new salute evil 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.090
 It's quite difficult to hit here. 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.990
 respectively 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.020
 trail great effort 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.020
 but 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:06.529
 to replace you saren blog 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:08.210
 now assess the condition of the glands they 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:10.520
 are installed in the main units 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.569
 car for example box engines 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.219
 gear reducer 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.620
 or steering rack and is responsible for 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.879
 retention of lubricating oils in places 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.029
 rotating output 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:22.460
 or moving parts if you see traces 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:27.789
 Oil leak from oil seal assembly needed 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.789
 change faces obvious fun talk to 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.759
 engine timidly 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:36.050
 in this case the epiploon proceeds simply 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.190
 view from 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.270
 clear path 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.380
 butter also 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.380
 old man's back 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.659
 and finally 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.449
 inspect strut and 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:56.009
 the springs of a man must be whole and 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.650
 equal in the number of turns 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.259
 left and right and racks should have 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.419
 solid anthers and has no trace drip 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.490
 and the mother if the condition causes 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.259
 suspicions you can be tested in 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.599
 car service on a specialized stand 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.759
 either show the car to a qualified person 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.770
 mechanics who can accurately determine 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.590
 needs this node to be replaced or repaired 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.180
 or not remember that worn rack 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.650
 can cause a serious accident 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.780
 during sharp maneuvering 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.830
 or attempts to brake on uneven 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.789
 the road and finally, as a private 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:33.129
 come look 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:35.039
 I recommend once a year before winter 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:36.759
 the winter begins to prepare and 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.860
 respectively before summer 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:42.399
 holiday resorts start at someone 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.800
 driving away I think they are not 

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:45.509
 great money 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.440
 and the time we spent 100 you will 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:51.300
 sure about the car so look our 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.690
 channel subscribe see you in 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.690
