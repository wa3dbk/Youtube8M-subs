00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.070
 in Youtube 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.920
 on facebook and 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.030
 and every time while more and more and 6 to 12 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.450
 meters and I like children very much 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.840

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.840
 good 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.229
 when the music is heard 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.229
 and I've done it 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.210
 has made a teaspoon of flour plus 8 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.150
 the onions well poached I made a 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.490
 teaspoon of flour 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.400
 in fact the prawns on the drug and the 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.030
 clams and peas 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.390
 and I miss the 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.030
 the spotting of 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.220
 what am I going to do to make parsley and 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.810
 we throw it to 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.810
 and we fight in the sauce 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:04.800
 a Band 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.800
 but also frasquita 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:15.910
 I do not know I do not know 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.910
 since only pea 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.840
 then they could fry this plate 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.310
 on the page 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.300
 this broth gives you a mosquito mojito 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.560
 and now he threw the macho with a 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:10.880
 little bit of water now those machado del 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.790
 parsley and the garlic there 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.670
 to give him 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.830
 the taste of green sauce a little of itself 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.450
 with a little water now I have 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.110
 made here above in the box of the 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.830
 earthen 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.830
 Quick 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.160
 a little like that to the fire 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.560
 but that the casserole heats up and 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.590
 they start with carville that gives 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.540
 gushes 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.580
 Y 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.180
 and now I'm putting the adornment with 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:53.169
 some chemists some red peppers 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.800
 and it's done and see you later 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:57.849
 is treated 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.849
 the angler's delight 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:18.389
 and he advised them to do it with a note 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:21.580
 pure truth implies you ladies and brothers 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:24.759
 but depending on what you're going to lose and 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:28.539
 until losing it in a small couple and 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:31.750
 a 666 hunt a wiggle in the fire 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:34.529
 and it is and I hope that you like that you enter 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.389
 many who tell me the recipe 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:38.879
 If you liked it, it's very cool. 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:42.119
 Exquisite taste with clams 

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:46.019
 prawns and the monkfish that is so rich and 

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:48.269
 It's very easy to do and 

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:52.579
 nothing I hope you like it very much and even 

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:52.579
 the next dish with a little kiss
