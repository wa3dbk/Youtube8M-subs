i'll hit at the top of the notes just a
little<00:02:38.470> bit<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:40.000> bring<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.299> bridge<00:02:40.599> forward

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
little bit to bring that bridge forward

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.099 
little bit to bring that bridge forward
yeah<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.160> looks<00:02:42.340> pretty<00:02:42.519> good<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.959> was
