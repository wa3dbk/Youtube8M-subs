00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
steps so let's just start from step

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.090 
steps so let's just start from step
number<00:00:34.059> one<00:00:34.449> it's<00:00:35.230> gonna<00:00:35.470> include<00:00:35.860> these

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
number one it's gonna include these

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.010 
number one it's gonna include these
flowers<00:00:36.610> that<00:00:36.790> I<00:00:36.820> picked<00:00:37.059> up<00:00:37.149> at<00:00:37.300> Michaels<00:00:37.720> and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
flowers that I picked up at Michaels and

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.080 
flowers that I picked up at Michaels and
it<00:00:38.110> just<00:00:38.320> so<00:00:38.470> happens<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:39.010> ones<00:00:39.190> that<00:00:39.460> I<00:00:39.610> got

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
it just so happens the ones that I got

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.490 
it just so happens the ones that I got
here<00:00:40.660> they<00:00:41.260> trim<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.770> bottom<00:00:42.070> of<00:00:42.219> these<00:00:42.399> and

okay so the first thing we're gonna do
is<00:04:02.000> glue<00:04:02.510> this<00:04:03.320> down<00:04:03.680> here<00:04:04.340> these<00:04:04.970> are<00:04:05.030> the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
is glue this down here these are the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.360 
is glue this down here these are the
utters<00:04:05.600> or<00:04:06.020> not<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.320> other<00:04:06.440> letters<00:04:07.010> but<00:04:07.250> the

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
legs put them right there

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.200 
legs put them right there
and<00:04:20.959> this<00:04:21.739> paper<00:04:22.010> is<00:04:22.670> just<00:04:22.850> gonna<00:04:23.000> make<00:04:23.150> sure

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
and this paper is just gonna make sure

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.390 
and this paper is just gonna make sure
it's<00:04:23.510> going<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.020> right<00:04:24.170> way<00:04:24.230> so<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:25.070> flowers

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
it's going the right way so the flowers

it's going the right way so the flowers
go<00:04:25.639> up<00:04:25.790> this<00:04:26.000> way<00:04:26.270> just<00:04:27.230> kind<00:04:27.440> of<00:04:27.470> do<00:04:27.590> it<00:04:27.620> like

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
go up this way just kind of do it like

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.470 
go up this way just kind of do it like
that<00:04:27.980> to<00:04:28.190> make<00:04:28.280> sure<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:28.520> am<00:04:28.940> doing<00:04:28.970> this

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
that to make sure I am doing this

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.290 
that to make sure I am doing this
correctly<00:04:29.830> so<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:30.889> have<00:04:31.070> two<00:04:31.310> extra<00:04:31.910> sticky

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
strips on each side of this and then I'm

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.850 
strips on each side of this and then I'm
also<00:04:35.210> going<00:04:35.480> to<00:04:35.540> run<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:35.960> over<00:04:36.110> it<00:04:36.410> with<00:04:36.620> the

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
also going to run it over it with the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.170 
also going to run it over it with the
HCP<00:04:37.370> tape<00:04:37.940> gun<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:39.220> then<00:04:40.220> what<00:04:40.550> I'm<00:04:40.669> gonna<00:04:40.820> do

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
HCP tape gun and then what I'm gonna do
