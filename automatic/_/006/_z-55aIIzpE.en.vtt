my priority list then the I mean this is
pretty<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:02.939> number<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.329> probably

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
pretty this is like number one probably

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.539 
pretty this is like number one probably
ready<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:03.930> me<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.920> when<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> 3d

ready for me but when you have a 3d

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.910 
ready for me but when you have a 3d
printer<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.000> works<00:02:06.530> they<00:02:07.530> kind<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.860> just

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
printer that works they kind of just

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.710 
printer that works they kind of just
want<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.220> work<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> one<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.910> works<00:02:09.119> and

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
you can you know make a little bit of

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.910 
you can you know make a little bit of
progress<00:02:16.930> here<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.440> there<00:02:17.530> but<00:02:17.560> it's<00:02:17.890> not

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
progress here and there but it's not

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.220 
progress here and there but it's not
your<00:02:18.099> number<00:02:18.159> one<00:02:18.489> it's<00:02:19.330> it's<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.989> major

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
your number one it's it's like a major

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.170 
your number one it's it's like a major
distraction<00:02:20.650> having<00:02:21.069> a<00:02:21.129> 3d<00:02:21.340> printer<00:02:21.489> because

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
distraction having a 3d printer because

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.430 
distraction having a 3d printer because
you<00:02:22.390> can<00:02:22.510> just<00:02:22.540> sit<00:02:22.810> here<00:02:22.900> all<00:02:22.959> day<00:02:23.049> and<00:02:23.319> watch

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
you can just sit here all day and watch

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.199 
you can just sit here all day and watch
it<00:02:23.620> work<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:25.540> right<00:02:25.720> now<00:02:25.870> I'm<00:02:25.989> making<00:02:27.150> see<00:02:28.150> if

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
it work then right now I'm making see if

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.460 
it work then right now I'm making see if
it<00:02:28.299> is<00:02:31.319> these<00:02:32.319> are<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.500> bearings<00:02:32.890> by<00:02:33.040> Emmitt

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
it is these are the bearings by Emmitt

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.360 
it is these are the bearings by Emmitt
so<00:02:35.470> as<00:02:35.530> opposed<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:35.769> being<00:02:35.890> supposed<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.310> be

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
so as opposed to being supposed to be

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.750 
so as opposed to being supposed to be
interlocking<00:02:36.910> bearings<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:39.519> prints

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
interlocking bearings so it just prints

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.030 
interlocking bearings so it just prints
up<00:02:39.910> automatically<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.810> creates<00:02:41.079> I<00:02:41.349> think

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
up automatically and it creates I think

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.100 
up automatically and it creates I think
that's<00:02:42.129> in<00:02:42.310> m3<00:02:43.920> maybe<00:02:44.920> in<00:02:45.040> five<00:02:45.599> hex<00:02:46.599> nut<00:02:46.840> and

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
that's in m3 maybe in five hex nut and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.289 
that's in m3 maybe in five hex nut and
then<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.190> becomes<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.549> bearing<00:02:48.849> on<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.030> outside

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
then it becomes a bearing on the outside

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.610 
then it becomes a bearing on the outside
so<00:02:49.450> those<00:02:49.599> things<00:02:49.810> should<00:02:49.959> break<00:02:50.170> away<00:02:50.319> and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
so those things should break away and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.830 
so those things should break away and
you<00:02:50.920> can<00:02:51.069> adjust<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.120> customizer<00:02:52.599> on

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
you can adjust it and the customizer on

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.349 
you can adjust it and the customizer on
Thingiverse<00:02:53.790> again<00:02:54.790> that's<00:02:54.970> all<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.090> got<00:02:55.209> for

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
Thingiverse again that's all I got for

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.190 
Thingiverse again that's all I got for
this<00:02:55.450> week<00:02:55.799> thought<00:02:56.799> you<00:02:56.890> guys<00:02:56.950> later
