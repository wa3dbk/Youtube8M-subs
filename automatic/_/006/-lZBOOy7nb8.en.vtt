00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.960
 so I'm going to explain to you today 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.240
 the green harvest 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.809
 the green trailer one is forced to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.809
 the end when we have too many reasons for 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.470
 to know if we have too much grapes we have to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:24.810
 make them calculations to the city we're going 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:30.449
 the two a moment each 20 count the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:35.219
 clusters that assures guy st after you 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.190
 go count the name of grape that 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.000
 ensures a cluster 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:45.570
 you all know how to count until saint 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.270
 Paul then once we told that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.989
 after I will do my little calculations and 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.600
 then I would tell you to cut a 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.559
 or two clusters plots for maybe 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:04.019
 3 but it will be according to my calculations and then 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.479
 to find out if the grain var migros or 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.140
 well he'll stay small I'll take 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.650
 a knife 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.540
 I'm going to show you I'm going to cut a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:20.580
 grape in two and if the grape eyeliner to 4 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.540
 glitch well it's going to come big but if 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.020
 an act 2 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.540
 but he will stay smaller then 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.299
 after broken calculation or know how much 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.430
 more or less the grapes how much he 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.509
 going to come 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.829
 ok but that's not paying you this is the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.570
 case since atypical stalemate 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.750
 yeah it's me it's simple you can 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.759
 confirm it's too hard for the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.180
 when you will be a big sister and 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.689
 make no troubles okay then we 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.689
 will go to the mine 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.710
 while driving the ducati bar 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.069
 for the ride starts here then you 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:15.050
 look at some clusters 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:15.050
 this grab graph 4.9 5.6 g 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.980
 that's it, but here you are counting 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.850
 3 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:15.560
 Yes 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:19.879
 it may be these 89 70 72 73 74 75 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:25.959
 76 77 79 80 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.959
 you are almost right we have 80 g 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.180
 if we divide by ten it's still 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.180
 serious by stump here fucking departure 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.780
 10.6 and not divide that makes 8 clusters 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:43.370
 waiting i 'll give you to each 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.720
 of bunches of bunches mean what is 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.590
 what it is but after that we can 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.980
 call it what a big bunch we are 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.269
 Okay 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.690
 and then that's what this rajevac graph 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:12.380
 so I find you between ben that's it 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:17.359
 you count as enron offers a big 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:23.709
 mean now we will see if they 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.709
 are we still here 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:45.750
 a surgical operation the way to 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:53.100
 better in london to the exact a4 well there 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:58.460
 nador from the bank this one coming here 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:14.180
 to agreements increasing their learning 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:18.229
 go ahead take it to the village in nahr 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:22.080
 ben haddou will come here 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:25.860
 okay and then there is one on it 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.650
 if distant lattois a judge yves aubin 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:33.199
 migros will not stay very small but he 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:36.260
 will stay average but here it is another 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:45.870
 then the a1 here yes okay 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:48.330
 2 we agree troy bell in ac3 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.610
 this one is a trial that will grow 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:59.639
 but he will not come big boos he'll 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:06:08.639
 stay average then 85 grains to 2 g and 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:11.430
 half do it like that on 1.28 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.909
 the vine it is necessary to make two grams of 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.580
 fat by cep of bunches here there are near 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:22.000
 from the beach 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:24.900
 so yeah so be careful you do not have to 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.670
 remove big as big tits 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.840
 yeah it was called a fat is ok 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.610
 vernay did you put it on the ground a 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.370
 stock Exchange 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.990
 we leave it here after tomorrow here bardet 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.580
 does two big you do average or 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:51.700
 small average is from the cut 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:54.850
 and that's how she is tiny 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.890
 you can count a little crazy we're going 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.830
 almost 3 serious this one is beautiful 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:05.910
 yeah yeah you can it's if it's not 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:05.910
 cut a roof of the building 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:15.870
 so you understand everything 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.870
 what did you learn then 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:28.210
 kg something reza just at 125 kg 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.210
 here is the square meter 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:36.479
 what did you have to do yeah 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:39.419
 but before cutting the grapes what is 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:41.759
 we had to hurt and coop 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:47.429
 when it is severe and of learn to 

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:50.219
 county what after cut the clusters 

00:07:47.429 --> 00:07:54.589
 here are bars 

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:54.589
 that's three things learned things 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:08:02.749
 well no more and 14 

00:07:57.029 --> 00:08:02.749
 yeah thank you thank you
