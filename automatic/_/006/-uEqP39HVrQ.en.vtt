00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.670
 hour and next 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.839
 rotadi to go to another topic that 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.069
 we had promised and it has to do with 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.389
 a last minute information that 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.370
 we were commenting with dinner drifting 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.040
 our international editor regarding 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.260

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.830

 from islamabad airport in pakistan 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.470
 for bad weather as reported by 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.199
 pakistani chain geo tv 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.329
 I will portray the information of the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.500
 europapress agency that says that the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.670
 airplane is from the company 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.090
 red that performed the flight number 42 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.280
 13 and it came from karachi and it crashed 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:51.420
 just before landing at the base of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.510
 chaklala this happened at 18 40 of the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.780
 evening - local time - to the rescue team 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.770
 that are in the area that is one of the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.200
 images that arrives so far through 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.839
 of internet fernando severino our 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.090
 editor reported us at the beginning of his 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.950
 comment a couple of minutes ago of 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.570
 this situation that I understand fernando to 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.300
 the view already published in several agencies 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.950
 with a clear urgent character, it is necessary to 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.350
 you have to be attentive there like you 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.680
 explained at the time of landing 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.750
 there was then the east shock this 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.400
 accident you have to see what are the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.800
 results of people who were going to 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.630
 board and that obviously generates again 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.670
 the questions regarding the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.890
 what are the true causes can 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.840
 have atmospheric causes cause thematic 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.650
 because of the bad weather then you have to see 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.820
 there 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.509
 how is news in development 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.430
 we will keep attentive very to is very close 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.229
 always said something very relevant and is 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.850
 that at the time of the 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.229
 accident that was not in full flight but 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.300
 that the time to land that to you 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.759
 has given some signal that could 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.290
 there have been less fewer causalities or 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.940
 less death but that obviously that's 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.560
 will know to the extent that the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.710
 research and the operations of 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.090
 rescue go away 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.470
 performing in that place only to 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.330
 finish but I wanted to make you a 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.160
 brief comment from france that we that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.690
 I remain whole that it is urgent that there 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.970
 data that talk about elections 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.830
 this Sunday there will be 25% 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.020
 abstentions or speaking according to 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.060
 polls and 10 percent undecided 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.670
 and this because those who saying to 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.290
 obviously relativize any survey 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.750
 survey that comes out before the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.730
 elections just today when the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.140
 last day of official campaigns in 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.660
 that country and where the president nicolas 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.790
 sarkozy for example anise to make your 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.610
 last political rally there prior to this 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.140
 Sunday the second round will be then 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.580
 at the beginning of May and also 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.280
 we will continue to pay attention to this import 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.750
 well and also how partners react 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.840
 historical of France as for example 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.780
 Germany that already talk about a kind of 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.970
 just like the merco was if they speak now 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.810
 of merco land in a play on words 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.060
 eventually consoles that can be 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.270
 it can be 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.800
 next president and then thanks for 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.940
 come to the table fernando any 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.400
 novelty and particularly attentive 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.300
