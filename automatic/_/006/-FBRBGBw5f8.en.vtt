00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
 Hello and welcome to a new hits the risks so stepped into play 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.830
 we both cases are currently building so is 30 for the moment 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.249
 the right all hurt 1 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.759
 and yes, as you obviously see we have 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.449
 Date 12 and 14 may not be this Enes version 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.710
 Witness the two French women 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.359
 Forte is the ship soon bumps 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.899
 Block of flats makes sure we can become characters here 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.850
 with different professional I show my best the shore 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.950
 Warrior's gross margin plus time and black magician 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.510
 I'll read the four and already it will work in Absurdistan's group 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.130
 effektivster 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.060
 even for the attack 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.210
 l 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.640
 and magic aggression fit today and so on 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.230
 Sprinter illusory the trend to find the name I'm damn uncreative 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.030
 I have only a flat simyo rehearsed today because of the slippery dollar 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.020
 have earned a look 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.020
 Of course, 7 in any case 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
 a favorite coffee a missed one 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.310
 Weiger was 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.270
 Only his captivating Heller excerpts do not really captivate the content 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.010
 but brought helpers 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.070
 Loans or guarantees to the very hitworthy described 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.070
 therein 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.920
 and therefore Contador 1 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 so they lie there doing 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.920
 4 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.020
 and the different clubs fantasy new character me 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.479
 then this gap happens szo 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.570
 you want damn important 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.150
 a good 30 scores to patting Texas will not saturate your team toth from bends 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.060
 but read what the characters say that I read very well Simpsons 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.430
 Perhaps percent of happiness means they are fast way you can not tell them 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.570
 read 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.519
 That's why she just wants to go ahead 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.540
 so there is not this problem and we ab hold a list already listed 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.540
 see you soon 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.219
 good and the Wars of the Team Trophy they are equal on the world map yet 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.379
 before Adam page is not actually quoted 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.839
 and since the castle of Cornelia I now equip myself a bit 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.019
 yes the clinic ethanol 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.699
 Nobody can wear Alan and Jake 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.779
 This can be seen by the sign that the left ones are the same, it means 3 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.539
 Source is bear but is remains the same from St 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.620
 they are urgently released at Penny and can watch videos say 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.620
 the attack very 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.179
 goes up 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:52.659
 and the gait remains the same 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.319
 so that you also have a paper sheet if have as a team liked it 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:00.000
 just here 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.389
 Princes there 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.329
 Bench top for how and with what the best 9 and 09 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:09.839
 19 remaining player hit rate 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.049
 Symbolism still a bit armor 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:20.579
 not sit the 7 for the warrior ONZ so here 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.229
 But we are also in Prechtal to the other things 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.229
 I'm sure 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.889
 and for the two profiteers still nothing 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:33.180
 at least autumn 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.860
 Siemens had to get used to that by pushing up the power 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.680
 the state is right 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.680
 Percent St 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.300
 the citizenship in the old store a lot 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.129
 Well 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.129
 the thing could sell it in the feud 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:55.800
 Pauli 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.120
 Thiel still 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.689
 which is known to be the currency 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:06.069
 yes it was but I'm not finished here I custom until the fall lifted 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:07.860
 Farmer 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.749
 Cottbus really should have been down 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:14.189
 run no 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.099
 yes I want to run 6 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.960
 in the 2nd 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.210
 in the time Moscow residing much time changes later spoke year 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.020
 In Thuringia, the five languages ​​are poor English playable by the 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.039
 language 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.740
 Actually this can be very difficult it will not go for the intention 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.710
 so it can go Kuntner 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.650
 I prefer to speak German 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.650
 At the same time, they like these processes 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.029
 they bite circle 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.699
 if you have not noticed before, the figure can move 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.770
 to be able to equip is wear 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.210
 So in that respect the world is small 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.389
 Eisel Vital in variety 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.869
 Here you can see the level value of Bellevue moving in 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:03.990
 but there is 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.719
 ass who wants 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:08.039
 I believe it does what he wants 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:13.419
 and at each level I can with 3x also in the possession example's tried and tested 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.749
 and 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:17.279
 for example 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.889
 and then we will be the time numerous again only two in Belek with 3 3 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.029
 and so on 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.459
 So one thing remains for him on the track but the technology is very important 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.610
 Back then knew yes 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.610
 Protest groups important witness for the beginning 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.990
 Kunsthalle offering ability or surfaces and dead 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.770
 the compulsory military service 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.220
 the next return flies too much raging meetings are the kids the 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.400
 Use software because I am here 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.029
 and easy too 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:49.660
 died last cares 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.660
 Picture black with him so fire is logical 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:55.919
 Pliezhausen to the inner ear 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.499
 are the right off speed and title race start sent percent 

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:02.279
 not overpriced 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:04.430
 SOA the fictitious names 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.580
 83 suspicion 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.040
 no suspicion and drank he buys how two ran the thing 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.879
 I suffered since he played Fantasy 1 far away 

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:17.299
 Oh God, let me pass by an animal 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.839
 so fourth was Felix Petersen 

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:25.839
 the scene is celebrating but 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:28.969
 2 Bush ins 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:31.969
 the Behringer I 50 in the game 

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:36.779
 Ronan last I have always done everything 

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:39.829
 but it took a whole three minutes last say who one of these 

00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:41.469
 wake up the Baster 

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:44.469
 why is that why you come straight to the castle 

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:48.229
 only the texts on Tuesday announced 

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:53.009
 Travelers, it is true that they own the crystals Oh, yes 

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:56.559
 I am not very good at making the different voices because of that are not all 

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:57.830
 some say 

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.939
 So not so, but blue and then the lease 

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.939
 as it all remains 

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:06.559
 Producer is all
