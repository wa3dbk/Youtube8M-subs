started right in the front and talking
about<00:00:23.320> the<00:00:23.500> tires<00:00:23.740> this<00:00:24.369> year

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
about the tires this year

about the tires this year
Pirelli<00:00:25.270> tires

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.980 

and<00:00:32.950> obviously<00:00:33.610> our<00:00:33.670> job<00:00:34.060> is<00:00:34.270> to<00:00:34.450> get<00:00:34.630> used<00:00:34.840> to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
and obviously our job is to get used to

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.780 
and obviously our job is to get used to
those<00:00:35.200> tires<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:35.650> change<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.310> car<00:00:36.490> in<00:00:36.640> terms

those tires and change the car in terms

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.000 
those tires and change the car in terms
of<00:00:36.940> its<00:00:37.090> character<00:00:37.630> and<00:00:37.900> adapted<00:00:38.350> to<00:00:38.740> the<00:00:38.830> tire

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
of its character and adapted to the tire

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.830 
of its character and adapted to the tire
character<00:00:39.550> that<00:00:39.760> obviously<00:00:40.480> they're

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
character that obviously they're

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.020 
character that obviously they're
different<00:00:41.020> to<00:00:41.350> what<00:00:41.500> we<00:00:41.530> used<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:41.920> we<00:00:42.700> go<00:00:42.850> back

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
different to what we used to we go back

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.210 
different to what we used to we go back
a<00:00:43.420> little<00:00:43.540> bit<00:00:43.660> further<00:00:43.870> to<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.890> middle<00:00:45.130> of

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
wheel and on the steering wheel we have

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:49.920 
wheel and on the steering wheel we have
a<00:00:48.970> nice<00:00:49.239> surprise

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
a nice surprise

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.660 
a nice surprise
and<00:00:50.230> we're<00:00:50.350> talking<00:00:50.650> of<00:00:50.739> this<00:00:50.920> boost<00:00:51.370> button

it's<00:00:57.360> called<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:57.870> curse<00:00:58.050> system<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.860> that<00:00:59.040> is

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
it's called the curse system and that is

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.549 
it's called the curse system and that is
an<00:00:59.370> energy<00:00:59.760> saving<00:01:00.239> system<00:01:00.450> due<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.290> break

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
an energy saving system due to the break

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.610 
an energy saving system due to the break

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
effort that you put you may reuse on

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.180 
effort that you put you may reuse on

let me go further through all the news

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.060 
let me go further through all the news

that the car anyway has and I come to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.010 
that the car anyway has and I come to
that<00:01:25.190> later<00:01:25.340> we<00:01:26.090> go<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.480> rear<00:01:26.690> wing<00:01:26.840> and

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
that later we go to the rear wing and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.350 
that later we go to the rear wing and
the<00:01:27.080> rear<00:01:27.260> wing<00:01:27.440> is<00:01:27.620> a<00:01:27.650> new<00:01:28.100> innovation<00:01:28.520> done

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
the rear wing is a new innovation done

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.300 
the rear wing is a new innovation done
by<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.570> FAA<00:01:29.960> in<00:01:30.410> order<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:30.860> improve

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
by the FAA in order to improve

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.760 
by the FAA in order to improve

overtaking because overtaking Formula
one<00:01:33.890> has<00:01:34.100> not<00:01:34.340> been<00:01:35.260> very<00:01:36.260> often<00:01:36.620> recently<00:01:37.100> and

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
one has not been very often recently and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.470 
one has not been very often recently and
due<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:39.560> rear<00:01:39.710> wing<00:01:39.890> we<00:01:40.310> can<00:01:40.910> adjust<00:01:41.270> this

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
due to the rear wing we can adjust this

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.980 
due to the rear wing we can adjust this
only<00:01:42.320> in<00:01:42.680> certain<00:01:42.890> moments<00:01:43.460> in<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.670> race<00:01:43.990> not

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
only in certain moments in the race not

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.710 
only in certain moments in the race not
all<00:01:45.230> time<00:01:45.500> obviously<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:46.670> only<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.390> car<00:01:47.570> is

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
all time obviously and only the car is

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.920 
all time obviously and only the car is
behind<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:49.130> make<00:01:49.280> an<00:01:49.460> overtaking<00:01:50.000> maneuver<00:01:50.480> it

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
behind to make an overtaking maneuver it

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.840 
behind to make an overtaking maneuver it
may<00:01:51.170> allow<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.710> come<00:01:52.130> close<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.640> car

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
may allow you to come close to the car

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.110 
may allow you to come close to the car
it's<00:01:53.150> not<00:01:53.420> guaranteed<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:54.380> will<00:01:54.410> overtake

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.219 

and<00:02:02.120> that<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.420> something<00:02:02.660> that<00:02:02.840> need<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.200> be

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
and that is something that need to be

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.200 
and that is something that need to be
maybe<00:02:03.530> fine-tuned<00:02:04.100> together<00:02:04.580> with<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.910> FAA

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
maybe fine-tuned together with the FAA

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.560 
maybe fine-tuned together with the FAA
but<00:02:05.840> for<00:02:06.770> me<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:07.100> very<00:02:07.190> interesting<00:02:07.570> innovation

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
but for me a very interesting innovation

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.440 
but for me a very interesting innovation
in<00:02:08.990> order<00:02:09.170> maybe<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.160> improve<00:02:10.520> overtaking<00:02:11.300> in

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
in order maybe to improve overtaking in

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.260 
in order maybe to improve overtaking in
future<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.590> see<00:02:12.800> they<00:02:13.220> can<00:02:13.460> move<00:02:13.670> like<00:02:14.030> this

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
future you see they can move like this

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.180 
future you see they can move like this
and<00:02:14.570> it's<00:02:14.780> pretty<00:02:15.050> safe<00:02:15.290> because<00:02:15.680> as<00:02:15.890> soon<00:02:16.040> as

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
and it's pretty safe because as soon as

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.370 
and it's pretty safe because as soon as
you<00:02:16.280> let<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.550> button<00:02:16.820> go<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.570> aerodynamic

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
you let the button go the aerodynamic

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.800 
you let the button go the aerodynamic
pressure<00:02:18.620> will<00:02:19.160> always<00:02:19.640> push<00:02:19.940> down<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.600> rear

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
pressure will always push down the rear

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.650 
pressure will always push down the rear
wing<00:02:20.989> so<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.530> will<00:02:21.770> never<00:02:22.010> end<00:02:22.310> up<00:02:22.489> with<00:02:23.180> stuck

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
wing so you will never end up with stuck

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.510 
wing so you will never end up with stuck
rear<00:02:23.930> wing<00:02:24.110> that's<00:02:24.320> impossible<00:02:24.650> unless<00:02:25.100> you

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
rear wing that's impossible unless you

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.600 
rear wing that's impossible unless you
choose<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.000> nevertheless<00:02:26.989> we<00:02:27.709> have<00:02:27.739> lots<00:02:28.489> of

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
choose so nevertheless we have lots of

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.880 
choose so nevertheless we have lots of
