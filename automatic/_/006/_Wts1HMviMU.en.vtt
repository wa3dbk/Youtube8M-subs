00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
are total so a couple strategies that

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.389 
are total so a couple strategies that
I'll<00:00:48.949> point<00:00:49.250> out<00:00:49.399> right<00:00:49.609> away<00:00:49.730> um<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:51.399> easiest

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
I'll point out right away um the easiest

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.950 
I'll point out right away um the easiest
way<00:00:52.609> to<00:00:52.670> get<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.030> three<00:00:53.269> glyphs<00:00:53.539> is<00:00:53.750> just

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
way to get the three glyphs is just

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.770 
way to get the three glyphs is just
string<00:00:54.500> together<00:00:54.710> long<00:00:55.190> combos<00:00:55.820> of<00:00:56.500> hits

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
string together long combos of hits

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.529 
string together long combos of hits
early<00:00:59.780> in<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.050> game<00:01:01.239> most<00:01:02.239> of<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:02.420> enemies

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
early in the game most of the enemies

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.800 
early in the game most of the enemies
that<00:01:02.809> you<00:01:02.929> fight<00:01:03.170> are<00:01:03.469> pretty<00:01:04.040> simple<00:01:04.810> this

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
that you fight are pretty simple this

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.490 
that you fight are pretty simple this
first<00:01:06.230> group<00:01:06.620> of<00:01:06.800> soldiers<00:01:07.160> I<00:01:07.460> have<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.700> fight

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
first group of soldiers I have to fight

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.160 
first group of soldiers I have to fight

helmets<00:01:12.680> or<00:01:12.800> anything<00:01:13.040> like<00:01:13.070> that<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:14.560> pretty

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
helmets or anything like that so pretty

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.790 
helmets or anything like that so pretty
much<00:01:15.800> every<00:01:16.280> shot<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:16.700> you<00:01:17.000> throw<00:01:17.240> at<00:01:17.360> them

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.590 

they<00:01:21.800> can't<00:01:22.160> block<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:22.940> it<00:01:23.060> makes<00:01:23.210> getting

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
they can't block so it makes getting

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.250 
they can't block so it makes getting
really<00:01:24.170> long<00:01:24.380> combos<00:01:26.140> really<00:01:27.140> easy<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.530> do

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
really long combos really easy to do

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.980 
really long combos really easy to do
um<00:01:30.260> getting<00:01:31.100> hit<00:01:31.460> by<00:01:31.700> one<00:01:32.180> of<00:01:32.240> them<00:01:32.420> ends<00:01:32.720> your

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
um getting hit by one of them ends your

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.140 
um getting hit by one of them ends your
combo<00:01:34.870> and<00:01:36.040> waiting<00:01:37.040> too<00:01:37.190> long<00:01:37.220> between

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.280 

hitting<00:01:41.150> them<00:01:41.390> will<00:01:41.960> lose<00:01:42.380> your<00:01:42.560> combo<00:01:44.290> one

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290

game<00:01:47.690> is<00:01:48.880> in<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.060> middle<00:01:50.330> of<00:01:50.479> a<00:01:50.600> long<00:01:50.780> string

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
game is in the middle of a long string

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.160 
game is in the middle of a long string
yeah<00:01:52.369> that's<00:01:52.729> 23<00:01:53.420> down<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.720> corner<00:01:53.930> that's

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
are just stuck with some lame cheap ass

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.100 
are just stuck with some lame cheap ass
or<00:02:28.100> they<00:02:28.310> picked<00:02:28.580> up<00:02:28.700> off<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.970> ground<00:02:29.860> so

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
or they picked up off the ground so

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.500 
or they picked up off the ground so
you<00:02:31.560> can't<00:02:31.830> use<00:02:32.010> any<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.460> speed<00:02:32.880> stances

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
you can't use any of the speed stances

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.730 
you can't use any of the speed stances
or<00:02:33.690> power<00:02:33.900> stance<00:02:34.290> or<00:02:37.190> anything<00:02:38.190> like<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.340> so

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
or power stance or anything like that so

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.350 
or power stance or anything like that so
it's<00:02:40.740> all<00:02:40.860> pretty<00:02:41.010> much<00:02:41.100> button<00:02:41.940> mashing<00:02:42.120> at

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
it's all pretty much button mashing at

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.750 
it's all pretty much button mashing at
this<00:02:42.540> point<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.140> think<00:02:43.710> you<00:02:44.040> can<00:02:44.220> counter<00:02:44.610> their

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
this point I think you can counter their

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.630 
this point I think you can counter their
attacks<00:02:45.060> by<00:02:45.270> pressing<00:02:45.600> wise<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:47.280> counter<00:02:47.550> an

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
attacks by pressing wise to counter an

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.370 
attacks by pressing wise to counter an
