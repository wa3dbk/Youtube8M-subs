initially he said when you right-click a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.670 
initially he said when you right-click a
skeleton<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.719> charcoal<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.469> see<00:00:49.649> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
skeleton with charcoal as you see a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.709 
skeleton with charcoal as you see a
mandatory<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.610> will<00:00:50.910> turn<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.210> into<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.449> wither

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.470 
mandatory it will turn it into a wither
skeleton<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.340> first<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:54.120> thought<00:00:54.149> those

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
skeleton now at first we thought those

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.330 
skeleton now at first we thought those
good<00:00:54.750> idea<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.140> then<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.410> decided<00:00:55.680> no<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.070> that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
good idea but then we decided no it that

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.010 
good idea but then we decided no it that
has<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> little<00:00:57.000> overpowered<00:00:57.690> because<00:00:57.930> you

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
has a little overpowered because you

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.200 
has a little overpowered because you
just<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.590> know<00:00:58.680> right<00:00:58.980> click<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.340> assuming<00:01:00.120> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
just you know right click it assuming of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.479 
just you know right click it assuming of
course<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.539> could<00:01:00.859> somehow<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
course you could somehow get to a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.579 
course you could somehow get to a
skeleton's<00:01:03.120> melee<00:01:03.570> range<00:01:04.019> without<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.470> know

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
skeleton's melee range without you know

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.020 
skeleton's melee range without you know
having<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.040> arrows<00:01:05.280> always<00:01:05.580> knocking<00:01:05.790> back

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
having the arrows always knocking back

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.090 
having the arrows always knocking back
but<00:01:06.689> besides<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.320> decided<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> change<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
but besides that we decided to change it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.770 
but besides that we decided to change it
a<00:01:08.189> bit<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.549> actually<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.630> when

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
a bit and actually have it when

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.560 
a bit and actually have it when
skeletons<00:01:10.530> die<00:01:10.710> from<00:01:11.010> lava<00:01:11.880> or<00:01:12.150> from<00:01:12.390> fire

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
skeletons die from lava or from fire

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.179 
skeletons die from lava or from fire
damage<00:01:12.960> they<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> fifteen<00:01:13.979> percent

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
damage they have a fifteen percent

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.190 
damage they have a fifteen percent
chance<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.700> becoming<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.210> wither<00:01:15.450> skeleton<00:01:15.960> so

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
chance of becoming a wither skeleton so

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.429 
chance of becoming a wither skeleton so
if<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.320> go<00:01:16.439> over<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> where<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.280> made<00:01:17.640> a

if we go over here to where I made a

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.690 
if we go over here to where I made a
somewhat<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.619> malformed<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.340> not<00:01:20.490> really

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700

somewhat of a malformed it's not really
too<00:01:21.600> great<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.380> has<00:01:22.530> some<00:01:22.740> skeleton

faster when I killed one of wither

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.390 
faster when I killed one of wither
skeletons<00:02:33.359> they<00:02:33.599> still<00:02:33.900> dropped<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.400> regular

will wither skeleton items and this is

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.770 
will wither skeleton items and this is
not<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.099> good<00:02:38.310> idea<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.269> definitely<00:02:39.629> not<00:02:39.659> a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
not a good idea this is definitely not a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.890 
not a good idea this is definitely not a
good<00:02:39.989> idea<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.290> have<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.469> nighttime<00:02:41.840> there<00:02:42.840> we

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
good idea to have a nighttime there we

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.780 
good idea to have a nighttime there we
go<00:02:42.959> crap<00:02:43.560> i<00:02:43.680> lost<00:02:43.859> all<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.069> wither<00:02:44.280> skeletons

but<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.720> could<00:02:45.900> take<00:02:46.260> my<00:02:46.379> word<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:46.859> it<00:02:46.889> that

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
but you could take my word for it that

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.640 
but you could take my word for it that
the<00:02:48.269> wither<00:02:48.450> skeletons<00:02:48.959> would<00:02:49.109> drop<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.500> know

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
the wither skeletons would drop you know

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.199 
the wither skeletons would drop you know
so<00:02:49.919> the<00:02:50.250> same<00:02:50.459> stuff<00:02:50.730> asked<00:02:51.090> whether

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
so the same stuff asked whether

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.240 
so the same stuff asked whether
skeletons<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.959> nether<00:02:52.169> and<00:02:52.439> this<00:02:53.069> makes

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
skeletons in the nether and this makes

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.039 
skeletons in the nether and this makes
it<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.459> cool<00:02:53.669> way<00:02:53.819> if<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.060> want<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.419> you<00:02:54.930> know

it a cool way if you want to you know

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.220 
it a cool way if you want to you know

make a form of wither skeletons in the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.990 
make a form of wither skeletons in the
overworld<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.489> don't<00:02:59.639> really<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.939> to

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
overworld and you don't really have to

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.209 
overworld and you don't really have to
go<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.329> nether<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:01.200> get<00:03:01.349> you<00:03:01.680> know<00:03:01.769> have<00:03:02.189> a

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 
go to the nether you get you know have a

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.039 
go to the nether you get you know have a
malformed<00:03:02.849> like<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.209> have<00:03:03.419> skeletons<00:03:03.870> fall

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
malformed like this have skeletons fall

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.929 
malformed like this have skeletons fall
down<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.530> then<00:03:05.099> just<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:05.549> way<00:03:05.760> of

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
down and then just have a way of

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.809 
down and then just have a way of
collecting<00:03:06.230> cold<00:03:07.230> bones<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.159> eventually

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
collecting cold bones and eventually

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.879 
collecting cold bones and eventually
wither<00:03:09.030> skeleton<00:03:09.689> skulls<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.500> that's<00:03:10.680> pretty

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
wither skeleton skulls so that's pretty

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.289 
wither skeleton skulls so that's pretty
