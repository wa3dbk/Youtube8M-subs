00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.789
 whipped a packet of bacon with 100 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.829

 stay the same and please with the salt 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.480
 Be careful because the bacon is already 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.129
 very very salty from home and 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.140
 that's why it's just a bit 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.289
 be careful first you cut the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.469
 basin small and roast team in one 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.569
 pan beautiful creepy brown on the must 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.629
 really nice to be crispy with that 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.280
 Sauce really nice after ham smells 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.219
 and of course it tastes and that it does 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.140
 here, of course, the lord of 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.909
 prevailing taste in these in 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.130
 this delicious sauce I had like 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.960
 Spaghetti left in parallel 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.030
 Now you should cook spaghetti with it 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.670
 It finished at the same time after ten minutes 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.250
 is the egg yolk in a small bowl 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.000
 cream salt and pepper with each other 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.770
 mix 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.570
 I took two yolks because of me 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.280
 Today, the only one eaten this sauce 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.770
 the others had something else 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.899
 sunday food leftovers that mingled her 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.659
 just with a whisk in one 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.729
 small bowl and then I put that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.159
 Stand aside and wait for my ham 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.439
 bacon or bacon really nice scary 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.200
 has become brown that takes so to the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.450
 56 minutes I call it full 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.670
 because of that, if it's like that, roll on my pan 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.250
 really nicely sizzling like you are 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.140
 See this, then you're done 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.229
 can reduce the heat now or 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.909
 completely switch off because the whole may 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.619
 then not boil otherwise you increase 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.219
 the egg yolk and then it does not look anymore 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.840
 beautiful 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.329
 I think it is a bit with me 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.250
 but today it tastes just as good 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.720
 just does not look so pretty anymore 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.820
 but I had to quickly become one 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.140
 children's race because 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.340
 fell down and screamed while 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.090
 I cooked there I already had 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.800
 always go 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.480
 so sorry if it is not quite so pretty 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.940
 looks like it is a bit silly 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.890
 creamy with cream if you all that 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.170
 a bit tough mega want or have one 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.150
 bit more supple then you trade 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.760
 simply cream against cream fraiche 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.430
 or replace half of it, so take it 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.080
 half cream and the other half even 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.720
 cream fraiche then it will all be 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.700
 a little more voluminous and a bit creamier 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.040
 but i just like cream with it 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.080
 dearest then you give this his 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.910
 simply mix in the pan with the 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.650
 basin and then you can go into it 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.570
 either panning her spaghetti or 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.340
 I've just done up about it because 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.230
 As I said today, it just has to be awesome 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.940
 go fast because the little one then 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.470
 I started crying and I did not have that 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.120
 more time to film 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.890
 I hope you are not mine for that 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.020
 bad but it tasted delicious 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.790
 and especially if you noodles or 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.460
 Spaghetti or some kind of 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.260
 noodles left over, this sauce is suitable 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.240
 really great because it is totally 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.610
 fast and with so few ingredients 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.170
 they just come out that it really is 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.670
 is made super fast 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.530
 Now I hope you have it a bit 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.580
 I like it reasonably well 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.100

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.780
