kind of my version this as you see was
my<00:00:17.490> first<00:00:17.849> hobby-grade<00:00:18.119> or<00:00:18.599> see<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.230> couple

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:19.769 
my first hobby-grade or see a couple

my first hobby-grade or see a couple
years<00:00:19.920> back<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.539> it<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:23.420> painted<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.570> with

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
years back and it I painted it with

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.720 
years back and it I painted it with
paint<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:25.890> wasn't<00:00:26.039> meant<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.339> RC

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
paint that really wasn't meant for RC

paint that really wasn't meant for RC
cars<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.390> ran<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.929> clear<00:00:28.140> body<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.560> didn't

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
cars I ran it with a clear body I didn't

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.360 
cars I ran it with a clear body I didn't
take<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:30.199> protective<00:00:31.199> layer<00:00:31.380> off<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:32.070> just

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
take the protective layer off it's just

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.440 
take the protective layer off it's just
just<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.520> driving<00:00:35.700> kind<00:00:36.150> of<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> bachelor

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
just for driving kind of a bachelor

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.890 
just for driving kind of a bachelor
vehicle<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:38.190> got<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.820> f-150<00:00:39.120> body<00:00:39.480> didn't<00:00:39.840> do

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
vehicle so got the f-150 body didn't do

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.240 
vehicle so got the f-150 body didn't do
much<00:00:40.020> something<00:00:40.380> anything<00:00:40.650> special<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.100> that

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
much something anything special to that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.120 
much something anything special to that
what<00:00:41.880> really<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.210> awesome<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.720> that<00:00:43.130> the

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
what really is awesome is that the

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.020 
what really is awesome is that the
chassis<00:00:44.430> itself<00:00:45.320> it's<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> tio2<00:00:46.830> T<00:00:47.580> remake

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
chassis itself it's the tio2 T remake

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.940 
chassis itself it's the tio2 T remake
and<00:00:51.590> it's<00:00:52.590> basic<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:54.420> standard<00:00:55.230> early

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
and it's basic it's your standard early

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.590 
and it's basic it's your standard early
to<00:00:56.160> late<00:00:56.310> 90s<00:00:57.890> bashing<00:00:58.890> chassis<00:00:59.580> some<00:00:59.820> Tamiya

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
to late 90s bashing chassis some Tamiya

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.480 
to late 90s bashing chassis some Tamiya
advertised<00:01:01.110> it<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.380> a<00:01:01.440> racing<00:01:01.890> chassis<00:01:02.100> but

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
advertised it as a racing chassis but

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.859 
advertised it as a racing chassis but
definitely<00:01:03.390> not<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.379> any<00:01:04.559> respect

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
definitely not not in any respect

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.370 
definitely not not in any respect
athol<00:01:07.820> every<00:01:08.820> once<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.179> a<00:01:09.299> while<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.509> put<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
athol every once in a while I put a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.319 
athol every once in a while I put a
slight<00:01:10.799> modification<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.609> to<00:01:11.759> this<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.179> I

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
slight modification on to this and I

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.160 
slight modification on to this and I
that<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> back<00:01:13.679> suspension<00:01:14.520> kept<00:01:15.170> collapsing

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
that the back suspension kept collapsing

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.440 
that the back suspension kept collapsing
so<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.409> put<00:01:16.649> these<00:01:16.799> actually<00:01:17.789> since<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.240> buggy

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
so I put these actually since the buggy

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.679 
so I put these actually since the buggy
Springs<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:18.899> slightly<00:01:19.170> longer<00:01:19.409> versus<00:01:20.399> the

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
Springs are slightly longer versus the

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.160 
Springs are slightly longer versus the
Tamiya<00:01:21.689> Springs

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
Tamiya Springs

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.859 
Tamiya Springs
I<00:01:22.259> put<00:01:22.530> C's<00:01:22.740> team<00:01:23.249> associated<00:01:23.630> twin<00:01:24.630> buggy

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
I put C's team associated twin buggy

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.959 
I put C's team associated twin buggy
spring<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.530> gonna<00:01:25.649> put<00:01:25.890> them<00:01:26.039> on<00:01:26.189> my<00:01:26.429> TTL

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
spring so it's gonna put them on my TTL

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:32.569 
spring so it's gonna put them on my TTL
to<00:01:26.999> be<00:01:27.420> chassis<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:27.990> side<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.219> to<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:31.579> they

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
to be chassis but side not to and they

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.919 
to be chassis but side not to and they
didn't<00:01:32.789> really<00:01:32.969> fit<00:01:33.179> too<00:01:33.299> well<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.539> GPM

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
didn't really fit too well the GPM

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.149 
didn't really fit too well the GPM
shocks<00:01:34.200> anyway<00:01:36.469> that's<00:01:37.469> one<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.859> the<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.130> I

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
shocks anyway that's one of the and I

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.999 
shocks anyway that's one of the and I
have<00:01:38.340> team<00:01:38.999> associated<00:01:39.319> 500<00:01:40.319> weight<00:01:40.439> oil<00:01:40.649> in

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
have team associated 500 weight oil in

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.760 
have team associated 500 weight oil in
there<00:01:41.429> to<00:01:41.460> also<00:01:41.909> because<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> pistons<00:01:43.380> are

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
there to also because the pistons are

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.059 
there to also because the pistons are
just<00:01:44.189> oil<00:01:44.969> passes<00:01:45.810> through<00:01:46.020> them<00:01:46.139> really

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
just oil passes through them really

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.809 
just oil passes through them really
really<00:01:47.460> easily<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:51.299> tires<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.200> same

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
really easily the tires have the same

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.989 
really easily the tires have the same
diameter<00:01:54.799> that<00:01:55.799> I've<00:01:55.859> said<00:01:56.039> that<00:01:56.069> the<00:01:56.340> wheels

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
diameter that I've said that the wheels

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:59.870 
diameter that I've said that the wheels
have<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.450> same<00:01:57.630> diameter<00:01:57.959> and<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.340> tires<00:01:59.609> are

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
have the same diameter and the tires are

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.940 
have the same diameter and the tires are
that<00:02:00.569> the<00:02:00.689> stock<00:02:00.899> tires<00:02:01.139> are<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.619> big<00:02:01.829> around

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that the stock tires are that big around

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.539 
that the stock tires are that big around
but<00:02:02.789> I<00:02:03.049> Mountain<00:02:04.049> these<00:02:04.170> ones<00:02:04.380> from<00:02:04.649> ACC<00:02:05.039> o1

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
but I Mountain these ones from ACC o1

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.949 
but I Mountain these ones from ACC o1
land<00:02:06.119> free<00:02:06.420> dirt<00:02:06.569> rest

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
land free dirt rest

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.830 
land free dirt rest
yeah<00:02:07.079> actually<00:02:07.380> swapped<00:02:07.889> the<00:02:08.220> tires<00:02:08.460> out<00:02:08.850> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
yeah actually swapped the tires out and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.760 
yeah actually swapped the tires out and
I<00:02:09.930> did<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.920> diameter<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.460> this

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
I did that because the diameter of this

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.650 
I did that because the diameter of this
about<00:02:12.550> this<00:02:12.700> big<00:02:12.880> mean<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.210> just<00:02:13.300> makes<00:02:13.510> the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
about this big mean it just makes the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.690 
about this big mean it just makes the
center<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.020> gravity<00:02:14.320> so<00:02:14.350> high<00:02:14.710> that<00:02:14.740> when<00:02:15.580> you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
center of gravity so high that when you

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.060 
center of gravity so high that when you
drive<00:02:16.000> over<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.330> rough<00:02:16.510> trend<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.410> just<00:02:17.710> it's

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
drive over a rough trend and just it's

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.860 
drive over a rough trend and just it's
you<00:02:18.250> know<00:02:18.370> hard<00:02:18.460> left<00:02:18.730> or<00:02:18.880> right<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.480> flips

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
you know hard left or right it flips

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.620 
you know hard left or right it flips

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
body posts and stuff and I'll go over

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.520 
body posts and stuff and I'll go over
that<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.060> couple<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.480> seconds<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:25.990> so<00:02:26.500> I

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
that and a couple of seconds and so I

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.900 
that and a couple of seconds and so I
just<00:02:26.680> swap<00:02:26.890> out<00:02:27.070> tires<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.550> gave<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.790> other

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
just swap out tires it gave the other

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.420 
just swap out tires it gave the other
one<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.210> little<00:02:28.270> bit<00:02:28.630> more<00:02:29.190> ride<00:02:30.190> height<00:02:30.400> and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
one a little bit more ride height and

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.040 
one a little bit more ride height and
this<00:02:30.730> one<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:30.940> little<00:02:31.120> bit<00:02:31.360> lower<00:02:31.690> center<00:02:31.990> of

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
this one a little bit lower center of

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.480 
this one a little bit lower center of
gravity<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.590> really<00:02:32.770> helps<00:02:33.100> but<00:02:33.280> the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
gravity and that really helps but the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.120 
gravity and that really helps but the
traction<00:02:34.300> sucks<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.140> bad<00:02:35.410> just<00:02:35.620> slides<00:02:35.920> all

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
traction sucks so bad just slides all

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.930 
traction sucks so bad just slides all
over<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.400> place<00:02:36.520> in<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.760> can

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
over the place in this is the the it can

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.700 
over the place in this is the the it can
only<00:02:40.000> fit<00:02:40.150> this<00:02:40.570> size<00:02:40.900> wheel<00:02:41.260> on<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.590> nothing

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
only fit this size wheel on it nothing

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.750 
only fit this size wheel on it nothing
else<00:02:41.920> otherwise<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:43.600> goes<00:02:43.810> beyond<00:02:44.610> what<00:02:45.610> can

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
else otherwise it goes beyond what can

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
to the handling part of this and sink

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.760 
to the handling part of this and sink
handles<00:04:41.180> like<00:04:41.330> nothing<00:04:41.630> else<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:41.930> took<00:04:42.500> it<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.740> a

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
handles like nothing else I took it to a

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.300 
handles like nothing else I took it to a
the<00:04:43.130> RC<00:04:43.400> Trek<00:04:43.670> in<00:04:45.310> forgot<00:04:46.310> where<00:04:48.310> NorCal

hobbies<00:04:49.640> is<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:50.060> place<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.810> I<00:04:52.600> turned<00:04:53.600> a

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
hobbies is the place and I turned a

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.590 
hobbies is the place and I turned a
couple<00:04:53.960> laps<00:04:54.110> instantly<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.390> drive

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
couple laps instantly the the drive

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.270 
couple laps instantly the the drive
shafts<00:04:56.990> right<00:04:57.140> there<00:04:57.320> popped<00:04:57.560> out<00:04:57.740> and<00:04:58.010> that

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
shafts right there popped out and that

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.070 
shafts right there popped out and that
usually<00:04:58.580> never<00:04:58.730> happens<00:04:58.850> that's<00:04:59.750> because

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
usually never happens that's because

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.130 
usually never happens that's because
these<00:05:00.470> two<00:05:00.530> screws<00:05:01.130> here<00:05:01.160> and<00:05:01.850> here<00:05:02.090> pop<00:05:02.900> down

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
these two screws here and here pop down

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.070 
these two screws here and here pop down
and<00:05:03.730> then<00:05:04.730> that<00:05:04.940> left<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.360> whole<00:05:05.600> rear

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
and then that left the whole rear

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.020 
and then that left the whole rear
differential<00:05:06.560> swaying<00:05:07.370> all<00:05:07.520> over<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.850> place

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
differential swaying all over the place

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.270

putting<00:05:08.600> it<00:05:08.750> to<00:05:08.870> wheel<00:05:09.050> drive<00:05:09.230> then<00:05:09.890> the<00:05:10.070> gears

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
putting it to wheel drive then the gears

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.220 
putting it to wheel drive then the gears
stripped<00:05:10.610> after<00:05:11.180> I<00:05:11.240> put<00:05:11.450> after<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:11.870> found<00:05:12.110> the

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
stripped after I put after I found the

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.360 
stripped after I put after I found the
drive<00:05:12.470> shaft<00:05:12.740> on<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:13.010> track<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:13.520> then<00:05:15.370> it

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
drive shaft on the track and then it

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.070 
drive shaft on the track and then it
just<00:05:16.580> had<00:05:16.790> a<00:05:16.820> bunch<00:05:17.300> of<00:05:17.420> problems<00:05:17.570> this<00:05:17.900> is

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
just had a bunch of problems this is

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.990 
just had a bunch of problems this is
more<00:05:18.290> of<00:05:18.380> just<00:05:18.410> a<00:05:18.620> badger<00:05:18.950> vehicle<00:05:19.310> I<00:05:19.490> would

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
more of just a badger vehicle I would

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.550 
more of just a badger vehicle I would
recommend<00:05:20.420> not<00:05:20.480> putting<00:05:20.690> them<00:05:21.140> a<00:05:21.350> brushless

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
recommend not putting them a brushless

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.190 
recommend not putting them a brushless
motor<00:05:21.860> now<00:05:22.100> I<00:05:22.130> recommend<00:05:22.580> using<00:05:22.850> either

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
motor now I recommend using either

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.380 
motor now I recommend using either
sport-tuned<00:05:24.200> or<00:05:24.500> a<00:05:24.560> GT<00:05:25.250> tune<00:05:25.490> from<00:05:25.730> Tamiya<00:05:26.120> if

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
sport-tuned or a GT tune from Tamiya if

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.940 
sport-tuned or a GT tune from Tamiya if
you<00:05:26.630> like<00:05:26.840> that<00:05:26.990> kind<00:05:27.140> of<00:05:27.170> power<00:05:27.350> maybe<00:05:27.620> an<00:05:27.800> arm

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
you like that kind of power maybe an arm

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.700 
you like that kind of power maybe an arm
of<00:05:28.160> 15<00:05:28.520> turn<00:05:28.700> but<00:05:28.910> nothing<00:05:29.180> special<00:05:29.710> that
