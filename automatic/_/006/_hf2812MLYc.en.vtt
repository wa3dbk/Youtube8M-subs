00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.500
 i 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.610
 know something that happened that was 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.369
 circulating with great force in the networks 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.560
 social you imagine if you are to I do not know 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:21.250
 how many 700 meters of height and 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.080
 suddenly you look down and that happens not 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.820
 case I would take the post I did not see it 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.640
 running that would be a jump this 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.240
 it happened on some glass balconies of the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.920
 willis tower in chicago were people 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.090
 look at that is the view a view 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.129
 spectacular they say that you believe in there 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.559
 you can see chicago like nobody can 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.510
 see and these people felt it like no one else 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.150
 You can feel why this layer broke 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.549
 the owners of this tower are saying 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.220
 how good they really apologize to 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.750
 people but it's a first layer by 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.670
 more that that layer had been broken 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.739
 under three more layers then never 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.909
 they ran danger these people what yes 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:01.449
 a scare that I flat out to God that did not happen 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:03.610
 to older but what they say suddenly 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.700
 there are four layers that transparent glass 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.130
 that they have that was the first 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.050
 four layers more then they do not know 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.150
 they scared but nothing happened 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:18.100
 many people who may be afraid of 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.140
 the heights I do not know you carlos that 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.670
 Alejandra if they are afraid of heights 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.190
 but who dare to be there 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.810
 imagine Alejandro Sunday in Chicago 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:34.240
 I did not either and he told me that you never had 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:40.420
 youtube in chicago but I had like 15 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:43.420
 years because it is something that has to be done 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.850
 but good at that time one is 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.890
 dare and do not be scared and good did not happen 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.720
 when you see it and you are in the news and 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.370
 renews the enabled client not you 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.770
 I can assure you that he is not going to ride there 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.750
 what happens that surely for naive not 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.850
 does certain things I for example and this 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.070
 seen this news you know it would be 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.880
 interesting today put a camera to see 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.890
 how many to see people cheered up as 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.420
 but more than an hour assured that angel 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.890
 than ever because the forecasts are 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.890
 they take not good so fast
