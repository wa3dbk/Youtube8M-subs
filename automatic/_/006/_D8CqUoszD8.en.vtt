00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
first step we're going to do is get our

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.319 
first step we're going to do is get our
psps<00:01:57.290> what<00:01:58.219> I<00:01:58.399> didn't<00:01:58.670> want<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:58.880> do<00:01:59.000> with<00:01:59.180> our

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
psps what I didn't want to do with our

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.800 
psps what I didn't want to do with our
psps<00:01:59.630> is<00:02:00.170> go<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.439> format<00:02:01.310> memory<00:02:01.909> stick<00:02:02.180> now

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
psps is go to format memory stick now

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.370 
psps is go to format memory stick now
make<00:02:03.289> sure<00:02:03.320> before<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:04.039> do<00:02:04.310> this<00:02:04.520> step<00:02:04.759> you

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
you should see a bunch of folders now

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.500 
you should see a bunch of folders now
you<00:02:32.740> don't<00:02:33.040> have<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.460> do<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:33.730> step<00:02:33.940> but<00:02:34.360> it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
you don't have to do this step but it

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.450 
you don't have to do this step but it
helps<00:02:36.540> take<00:02:37.540> across<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.230> delete<00:02:38.800> every

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
helps take across and delete every
