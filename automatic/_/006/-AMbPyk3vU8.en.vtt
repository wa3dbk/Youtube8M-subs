through his midscale control extend into
the<00:01:37.140> crown<00:01:37.409> region<00:01:38.030> given<00:01:39.030> jim's<00:01:39.920> density<00:01:40.920> of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the crown region given jim's density of

here his diner region and his

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.500 
here his diner region and his
flexibility<00:01:45.240> were<00:01:45.479> estimating

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
flexibility were estimating

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.850 
flexibility were estimating
we'll<00:01:46.660> get<00:01:46.870> at<00:01:47.470> least<00:01:48.630> 3,500<00:01:49.630> follicular<00:01:50.440> unit

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
we'll get at least 3,500 follicular unit

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.400 
we'll get at least 3,500 follicular unit
graphs<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:52.210> above<00:01:52.570> but<00:01:53.020> what<00:01:53.140> I'll<00:01:53.230> do<00:01:53.350> is

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
graphs and above but what I'll do is

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.070 
graphs and above but what I'll do is
I'll<00:01:53.530> just<00:01:53.680> might<00:01:53.860> get<00:01:54.070> some<00:01:54.220> anatomical

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
I'll just might get some anatomical

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.270 
I'll just might get some anatomical
points<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:56.320> then<00:01:56.500> I'll<00:01:56.650> show<00:01:56.680> you<00:01:56.980> where

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
points and then I'll show you where

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.070 
points and then I'll show you where
those<00:01:57.460> are<00:01:57.730> and<00:01:57.970> then<00:01:58.090> we<00:01:58.180> just<00:01:58.210> sort<00:01:58.540> of<00:01:58.570> from

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
those are and then we just sort of from

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.980 
those are and then we just sort of from
there<00:01:59.350> I'll<00:01:59.740> show<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.130> those<00:02:00.400> points

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
there I'll show you those points

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.110 
there I'll show you those points
starting<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.320> death<00:02:03.190> in<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.430> little<00:02:03.700> bit<00:02:03.820> so<00:02:03.970> we

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
starting to death in a little bit so we

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.240 
starting to death in a little bit so we
just<00:02:04.240> won't<00:02:04.360> put<00:02:04.540> a<00:02:04.600> few<00:02:04.870> if<00:02:05.230> you<00:02:05.500> there<00:02:06.040> to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
just won't put a few if you there to

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.380 
just won't put a few if you there to
strengthen<00:02:06.640> those<00:02:06.760> reports<00:02:07.210> are<00:02:07.270> not

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
strengthen those reports are not

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.250 
strengthen those reports are not
changing<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.890> shape<00:02:09.490> or<00:02:09.869> or<00:02:10.869> anything<00:02:11.200> like

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
changing the shape or or anything like

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.800 
changing the shape or or anything like
that<00:02:11.350> just<00:02:11.910> reinforcing<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.970> little<00:02:13.270> bit<00:02:13.390> we

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
that just reinforcing a little bit we

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.960 
that just reinforcing a little bit we
started<00:02:14.230> about<00:02:14.560> eight<00:02:15.460> o'clock<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:15.880> morning

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
started about eight o'clock this morning

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.730 
started about eight o'clock this morning
so<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.900> little<00:02:16.990> bit<00:02:17.080> over<00:02:17.350> seven<00:02:17.650> hours

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
so it's a little bit over seven hours

feeling now taking a good way we're
aiming<00:02:22.630> for<00:02:22.810> set<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.170> four<00:02:23.290> thousand<00:02:23.710> grass<00:02:23.890> so

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
aiming for set of four thousand grass so

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.250 
aiming for set of four thousand grass so
will<00:02:24.250> probably<00:02:24.510> continue<00:02:25.510> on<00:02:25.990> for<00:02:26.200> another

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
will probably continue on for another

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.230 
will probably continue on for another
three<00:02:26.710> or<00:02:26.740> three<00:02:27.190> hours<00:02:27.220> or<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:27.790> there's<00:02:28.120> no

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
three or three hours or so there's no

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.390 
three or three hours or so there's no
