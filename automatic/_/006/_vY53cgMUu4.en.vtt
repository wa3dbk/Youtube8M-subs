 just it'll be based on 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.320
 learning the gdp of the country that are 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.109

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.930

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.359
 equal to games as much for the tower on 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.359
 I want good viewing no more 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.410
 gaza 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.580
 elliott montell wade today we get 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.309
 found for the first episode of the kit 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.470
 for how good this ppp or how 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.510
 start the pp on minecraft so then 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.410
 I did some small exercises that 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.050
 I will introduce you 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.750
 how are they sent back then it's 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.410
 for this first video is going 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.820
 simply look at 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.890
 displacements because I think that 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.890
 it's still a pretty good thing 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.680
 important of the country on man works was 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.280
 I do not want to pass Bac 2 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.310
 poppins 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.510
 there we think to be good a little 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.850
 is in beautiful angels put you 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.190
 in the instruction 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.850
 so here firstly I have two little ones 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.770
 lot stuff 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.710
 I 'm happy because they make 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.649
 shit the mobs I 'm recovering very badly 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.600
 because it is necessary that you take 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.250
 damage wait i will show so 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.420
 you put in zero mode 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.670
 by the way quickly so that I you 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.710
 say show the coordinates of 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.080
 exercises to what in fact I got one 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.910
 little moved to the spawn so in this past 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.940
 by that a flood kept well chipped 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:55.800
 so otc - 733 minus 765 this is then 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.020
 so this exercise is a 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.880
 sault exercise so an exercise all 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.440
 just you to make some small 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.670
 jobs by sawing not to die so here is 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.090
 I like leaves as you can see 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.009
 my heart that's what I can not 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.670
 jump 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.670
 I will take 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.680
 yen amid So here you all here 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.560
 the text takes the ten cases of fall 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.790
 the damage of September so here you are 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.879
 can do like that where there are the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.640
 wagons like that so here I am you 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.409
 advise to do these cures to try 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.319
 this moment that you always arrive 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.360
 pay more expensive genres passed to 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.140
 second 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.100
 when you see that 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.410
 simply you will see it if several 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.190
 Once this is me I'm very very 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.570
 loud and I would put you a video at 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.250
 from now on you will see that I 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.080
 remains without problem from 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.330
 now play after what it puts you 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.380
 because as you'll see it's a 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:06.470
 super heroes there so I show you 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:08.300
 extract ruiz here I am so I have you 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.090
 spent the little excerpt I had 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.260
 save beforehand 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.150
 so I took milk and apples 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.280
 rotten 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.870
 apples to regenerate me and you 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.209
 leashes that I advise to do it's 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.980
 to remove the effects as a protection from 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.299
 these are so then we'll go to 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.939
 second exercise which exercise zig zag 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.049
 we are not strong here so basically because 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.950
 what you need to do is that you 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.140
 must pass like that you have to pass 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.359
 like that without taking diktats here 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.859
 so I got it so it seems so without 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.269
 take dikes forever and 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.640
 do it faster or if it turns out 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.480
 easy to stay supported 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.650
 at 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.650
 the possible yet 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.730
 like that here she finally stay to support 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.459
 the style touch like that but let's talk 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.050
 also to do that and then as if 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.670
 when you have succeeded 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.359
 by ibou sow 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.150
 exercise for the skin I'm going to put 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.760
 a small passage is that it will 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.999
 hold both when you have diet 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:15.879
 Ben Ali 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:17.979
 I pass you the passage so friends 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.530
 here I am, it's the little excerpt 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.900
 very fast so now we'll go 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.639
 down to level 2 it's exactly the same 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.620
 thing except that 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.689
 suddenly it's more berries RHODES 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.060
 which is also game so it's 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.860
 a little more difficult 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.749
 so frankly if you arrive it's 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.639
 michael because I confess that 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:37.810
 I have trouble getting arrivals if I 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.550
 spends time that looks behind m 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.199
 frankly I really have trouble with it 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.490
 to arrive to listen to you we will go from 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.779
 blow to the third exercise that is 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.930
 the final exercise for this first 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:52.300
 episode so who was it's gone 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.960
 so this is the exercise what is the 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.180
 goal is to do that and to fall into 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.919
 the hole because that got me to which I 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.909
 I'm done so it's still 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:06.789
 important i find out know john sargent 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:09.159
 like that so I 'm going to tell you this 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.050
 that I got weak basically out 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.259
 like that 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.259
 Shanghai Fashion 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.870
 this is how it's good 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.000
 am going to put a small percent extract 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:30.760
 as you will arrive what it will give 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:33.510
 So here I would immediately the 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.090
 end of this video of this first episode 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.550
 suddenly how well members on the 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.750
 pp on minecraft so I do not know 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.390
 yet how am I going to name this 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.940
 series maybe it'll take a kid 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.710
 So here I hope that it 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.090
 you will like that it will be useful to you because 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.070
 that frankly my first goal is 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.290
 all the same you are managing that 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.330
 you get to pay for those who 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.190
 do not get to baby yet here and 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.050
 then frankly do not hesitate to let go 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.790
 a green thumb or red-mouthed or 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.530
 slice mans to criticize if you have 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.710

 where to give me advice that would be 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.990
