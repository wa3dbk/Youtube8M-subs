00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
here at Dobek performance we have been

here at Dobek performance we have been
using<00:00:06.330> load<00:00:06.569> based<00:00:06.960> technology<00:00:07.679> for<00:00:08.069> years

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340

using load based technology for years
now<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.690> surprising<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.410> us<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.800> Dynojet

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
now it is surprising to us that Dynojet

now it is surprising to us that Dynojet
and<00:00:11.460> others<00:00:12.150> are<00:00:12.450> still<00:00:12.720> confused<00:00:13.260> with<00:00:13.470> how

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
and others are still confused with how

this<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.890> possible<00:00:14.630> they<00:00:15.630> explain<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.080> their

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
this is possible they explain to their

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.019 
this is possible they explain to their
potential<00:00:16.769> customers<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.579> we<00:00:17.669> must<00:00:17.849> be
