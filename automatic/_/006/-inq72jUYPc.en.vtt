00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.340
 crazy helicopters dancing do 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.410
 maneuvers in the rhythm of music 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.710
 The spectacular sport is in cuiabá in the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.750
 national meeting of modeling exist 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.620
 models of various sizes 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 the electric motor of the combustion engine 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.420
 nitromethane is the fuel and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.650
 maneuvers of these helicopters usually 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.650
 be nervous 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.030
 it's harder to get to the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.310
 tatá square and the normal rounded to 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.500
 he's cool, but he's cute, even he 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.509
 stand still and square in the air 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.450
 so it looks like it's parked and it goes 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:19.039
 come year before riding a model is 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.299
 need to go through a simulator they 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.850
 assembled here in Cuiabá. 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.640
 a simulator that the adriano throw stone 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.899
 will help when sitting with water in the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.789
 I think I'm going to build a 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.770
 Helicopter quickly control 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.420
 exactly the same as used to control 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.490
 a model how does it work 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.450
 you actually have four 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.899
 helicopter 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.080
 you have in your left hand you climb 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.940
 or down and command of the cause turn 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.649
 of his right hand was a snack 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.260
 on the royal scale was conquered 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.050
 back to the right with promptness 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.390
 I think the destruction of the 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.390
 habitats terror alert 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.230
 despite the excellent teacher my flights 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.690
 it takes a few seconds to control the 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.420
 helicopter is very difficult 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.470
 domingos iglesias has passed through the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.560
 simulator 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.270
 now starts taking off really with 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.120
 very careful 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.030
 in the beginning the goal is simple nothing 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.709
 radical maneuvers of the ranking by 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.810
 while out here in Cuiabá has 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.330
 competition and in rare format in Brazil 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.340
 more common in the United States each 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.480
 pilot prepared a soundtrack of 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.340
 four minutes 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.100
 they will introduce themselves to make maneuvers 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.720
 with helicopters in the rhythm of music 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.900
 who will choose the winner of this 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.410
 competition is the world champion of l 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.170
 modeling it zebu is american works 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.270
 for a manufacturer of models l is pilot 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.410
 company is testing pilot 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.890
 professional 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.520
 idol of those in love with this sport 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.560
 alan is a very strong in the world by 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.420
 that it was he who revolutionized 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.459
 acrobatics was the one who created the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.760
 part of the acrobatics was that it perfected 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.069
 the acrobatics 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:15.129
 his arrest is huge helicopter track 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:17.379
 ground passes to 0 and pulls his flight is 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.510
 The speed of maneuvers is very strong. 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.909
 The range of maneuver is very large. 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.670
 big he can get out of a maneuver 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.400
 already amended the other is with the speed 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.930
 too big or too cold then meat 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:36.220
 he gets completely connected he's poor 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:38.970
 she needs it inside she says that to be 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.400
 a good pilot you just need to train 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.950
 practice who has their own ideas and chan 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.180
 then with the four-time world champion in 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.359
 role of judge 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:54.030
 the competition gets two strong 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.030
 competitors made beautiful presentations 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.550
 but it was time for the fight 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:24.630
 by title 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:28.110
 the helicopters fell but hit 20 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.790
 seconds abuse an abuse depending on 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.330
 model can mean a great deal of 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:37.200
 The cost of the model costs between two thousand 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.990
 and six thousand reais out of control 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.750
 the way was open for adriano grandson 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.030
 said in são paulo one of the best 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.390
 helimodelists from brazil 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.640
 we are always searching for or doing 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.830
 more synchronized with the musician 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.010
 always trying to interleave a flight 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:00.390
 aggressive with stealing a ballet cbat the 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:03.030
 people called and Adrian gets the 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.030
 title in cuiabá is his 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.490
 you have to leave everything everything aside 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.410
 Just to think of the helicopter to you and 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.120
 He plays with me talking to my 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.120
 helper is the dog 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.300
 ae
