 and armenia and azerbaijan and georgia now 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.009
 are considering this issue in Kazakhstan 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.510

 traumatic weapons committed about 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.760
 800 crimes and only 47 pistols 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.710
 more than one third were registered 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.960
 all gunshot violations of the law 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.850
 accounted for precisely travmatiku and in 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.620
 Astana and Almaty this more almost 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.620
 half showing what 's increasing 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.660

 numbers are effectively counted by the police 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.210
 another point of view is 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.159
 armed with 16 core omsa for stores 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.229
 the alleged ban is a small problem 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.330
 90 percent of businessmen’s revenue 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.820
 makes up hunting and sporting guns 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.619
 which costs much more expensive 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.840
 more important that the law-abiding part 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.830
 population will be without effective

 free citizens had the right to defend themselves 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.000
 by weapon 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.220
 even if these amendments are accepted 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.049
 gas weapons will remain permitted 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.720
 stun guns fend off in the interior 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.979
 both sides agree on one thing 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.869
 idle but you can not expert 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.000
 only offers to change the age limit 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.320

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.040
 Kazakhstanis for obvious reasons 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:04.619
 divided into two camps format 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.439
 post-Soviet countries are not developing 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.319
 doing and even chef developing a country like 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.390

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.140
 firearms can use 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.190
 appear traumatic gun 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.610
 such a protection as well in the long run and 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.129
 here broke into the house well, there sticking after drinking 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.800
 how to stop a person two billion 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.629
 tenge is planned to spend on you here 36 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.819
 thousand registered pistols 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.860
 the rest will be easy and deal with 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.170
 imposition of an administrative penalty 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.720
 by the way fine the interior ministry also offers y 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.989
 great at any weapon equal what any 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.670
 medals there are two sides dangerous and 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.620
 safe meaning this weapon can 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.440
 used and as a means of self-defense 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.629
 and as a means of attack from one side 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.640
 ban on the sale of trauma individuals and 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.860
 of course can lead to a decrease 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.390
 quantities injuries especially when 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.580
 weapons are not quite people 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.379
 adequate or intoxicated 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.060
 although if you continue to follow the same 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.099
 logic, then you need to prohibit the sale 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.230
 baseball bats and wrenches 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.030
 large size and even kitchen knives

 Ministry of the Interior judging by 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.830
 trying to find a middle ground 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.349
 whether it is found achieved will show 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.739
 Parliament time and decisions and leadership 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.920
