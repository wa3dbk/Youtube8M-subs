00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to just rub together until I get a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.430 
to just rub together until I get a
crumble<00:01:26.939> mix

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.140 

now<00:01:30.440> you've<00:01:30.950> seen<00:01:31.159> I've<00:01:31.310> got<00:01:31.490> Demerara<00:01:32.000> sugar

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
now you've seen I've got Demerara sugar

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.120 
now you've seen I've got Demerara sugar
here<00:01:32.659> which<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.260> sort<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.740> heavily

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
here which is the sort of heavily

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.969 
here which is the sort of heavily
granulated<00:01:35.000> sugar<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.990> I<00:01:36.140> think<00:01:36.680> that's<00:01:36.830> the

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
granulated sugar and I think that's the

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.480 
granulated sugar and I think that's the
only<00:01:37.190> sugar<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.820> use<00:01:38.090> for<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.900> crumble<00:01:39.800> because

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
only sugar to use for a crumble because

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.330 
only sugar to use for a crumble because
you<00:01:40.640> get<00:01:40.760> a<00:01:40.790> really<00:01:41.150> crunchy<00:01:41.600> mix<00:01:42.220> they<00:01:43.220> also

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
you get a really crunchy mix they also

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.690 
you get a really crunchy mix they also
recommend<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:45.140> add<00:01:45.290> oats<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.580> this

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
recommend that you add oats to this

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.270 
recommend that you add oats to this
recipe<00:01:47.330> but<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.259> didn't<00:01:48.530> have<00:01:48.680> any<00:01:48.830> knocking

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
around in my store cupboard so we can't

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.450 
around in my store cupboard so we can't
do<00:01:51.830> them<00:01:52.570> now<00:01:53.570> that's<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.650> crumble<00:01:55.009> mix<00:01:55.220> and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
to add that the ever so slightly stewed

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.759 
to add that the ever so slightly stewed
apple<00:02:26.209> now<00:02:26.450> as<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.720> say<00:02:26.930> if<00:02:27.050> they're<00:02:27.230> not<00:02:27.380> cooked

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
apple now as I say if they're not cooked

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.530 
apple now as I say if they're not cooked
this<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.550> going<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.760> be<00:02:28.880> in<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.060> oven<00:02:29.180> for

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
this is going to be in the oven for

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.860 
this is going to be in the oven for
15-20<00:02:29.959> minutes<00:02:30.709> anyway<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.300> crumble<00:02:32.720> goes

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
15-20 minutes anyway so the crumble goes

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.990 
15-20 minutes anyway so the crumble goes
nice<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.140> crispy<00:02:33.739> on<00:02:33.860> top<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.730> doesn't

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
nice and crispy on top so it doesn't

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.940 
nice and crispy on top so it doesn't
actually<00:02:35.090> matter<00:02:35.540> because<00:02:36.500> they'll<00:02:36.680> cook

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
actually matter because they'll cook

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.370 
actually matter because they'll cook
anywhere<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.610> just<00:02:37.670> depends<00:02:38.269> on<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.600> level<00:02:39.290> of

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
anywhere it just depends on the level of

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.560 
anywhere it just depends on the level of
consistency<00:02:39.769> that<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.549> like<00:02:40.580> your<00:02:40.940> apples<00:02:41.420> I
