the<00:04:20.729> second<00:04:21.090> fix<00:04:21.329> on<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:22.079> these<00:04:22.229> both<00:04:22.560> work

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.280 
the second fix on and these both work
and<00:04:23.210> usually<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.450> use<00:04:24.599> them<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.140> conjunction<00:04:25.710> if

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
and usually I use them in conjunction if

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.550 
and usually I use them in conjunction if

finally load up league of legends and

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.270 
finally load up league of legends and
that<00:05:45.400> should<00:05:45.730> fix<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.330> problem<00:05:46.720> arm<00:05:47.280> these

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
that should fix the problem arm these

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.000 
that should fix the problem arm these
are<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.610> main<00:05:48.850> fixes<00:05:49.360> I<00:05:49.570> usually<00:05:50.230> do<00:05:50.590> both<00:05:50.980> of

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
are the main fixes I usually do both of

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.350 
are the main fixes I usually do both of
them<00:05:51.280> at<00:05:51.520> the<00:05:51.580> same<00:05:51.670> time<00:05:52.120> um<00:05:53.490> so<00:05:54.490> I<00:05:54.820> would<00:05:55.120> just

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
them at the same time um so I would just

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.900 
them at the same time um so I would just
after<00:05:55.960> I<00:05:56.020> click<00:05:56.230> login<00:05:56.530> I<00:05:56.920> would<00:05:57.160> wait<00:05:57.640> until

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
after I click login I would wait until

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.510 
after I click login I would wait until
it<00:05:58.270> shows<00:05:58.660> up<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.050> I'm<00:05:59.860> while<00:06:00.340> I'm<00:06:00.400> waiting

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
it shows up and I'm while I'm waiting

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.520 
it shows up and I'm while I'm waiting
I'll<00:06:00.910> just<00:06:01.390> left<00:06:01.720> click<00:06:01.900> and<00:06:01.960> right<00:06:02.230> click<00:06:02.350> the

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
I'll just left click and right click the

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.770 
I'll just left click and right click the
middle<00:06:02.770> of<00:06:02.830> the<00:06:02.920> screen<00:06:03.100> until<00:06:03.400> all<00:06:04.120> my<00:06:04.570> see

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
middle of the screen until all my see

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.380 
middle of the screen until all my see
this<00:06:04.960> world<00:06:05.170> icon<00:06:05.550> most<00:06:06.550> of<00:06:06.700> the<00:06:06.760> time<00:06:06.970> I<00:06:07.180> need

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
this world icon most of the time I need

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.990 
this world icon most of the time I need
both<00:06:07.750> of<00:06:07.780> these<00:06:07.960> fixes<00:06:08.560> because<00:06:09.250> one<00:06:09.700> of<00:06:09.730> them

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
both of these fixes because one of them

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.750 
both of these fixes because one of them
if<00:06:10.570> I<00:06:11.200> just<00:06:11.380> do<00:06:11.590> one<00:06:11.830> of<00:06:11.860> them<00:06:12.100> I<00:06:12.340> won't<00:06:12.550> see

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
if I just do one of them I won't see

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.750 
if I just do one of them I won't see
it'll<00:06:13.000> slowly<00:06:13.330> white<00:06:13.750> icon<00:06:14.260> that<00:06:14.650> pretty<00:06:15.610> much

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
it'll slowly white icon that pretty much

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.780 
it'll slowly white icon that pretty much
tells<00:06:16.000> you<00:06:16.150> it's<00:06:16.330> loading<00:06:17.040> and<00:06:18.040> then<00:06:18.610> from

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
tells you it's loading and then from

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.430 
tells you it's loading and then from
there<00:06:18.880> it<00:06:19.570> would<00:06:19.720> just<00:06:19.840> be<00:06:20.020> a<00:06:20.050> straight<00:06:20.410> up

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
there it would just be a straight up

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.580 
there it would just be a straight up
black<00:06:20.740> screen<00:06:21.480> so<00:06:22.480> i<00:06:22.750> usually<00:06:23.050> do<00:06:23.320> both<00:06:23.560> of

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
black screen so i usually do both of

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.100 
black screen so i usually do both of
these<00:06:23.830> are<00:06:24.220> fixes<00:06:25.120> at<00:06:25.300> the<00:06:25.450> same<00:06:25.660> time<00:06:25.900> in

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
these are fixes at the same time in

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.460 
these are fixes at the same time in
conjunction<00:06:26.560> and<00:06:26.890> it<00:06:27.520> usually<00:06:27.670> works<00:06:28.090> almost

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
conjunction and it usually works almost
