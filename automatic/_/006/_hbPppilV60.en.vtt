00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
my associations with port over the years

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.120 
my associations with port over the years
and<00:03:13.870> when<00:03:14.319> they<00:03:14.410> couldn't<00:03:14.709> see<00:03:14.830> their<00:03:15.010> way

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
and when they couldn't see their way

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.180 
and when they couldn't see their way
clear<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.730> continue<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.680> Mazda<00:03:17.680> wanted<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.160> I

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
clear to continue and Mazda wanted to I

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.250 
clear to continue and Mazda wanted to I
was<00:03:18.459> naturally<00:03:19.060> delighted<00:03:19.570> because<00:03:20.110> I<00:03:20.200> think

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
was naturally delighted because I think

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.960 
was naturally delighted because I think
it<00:03:20.440> would<00:03:20.590> have<00:03:20.680> meant<00:03:20.830> stopping<00:03:21.580> racing

that our Moffitt racing is not a figment

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.120 
that our Moffitt racing is not a figment
of<00:05:22.690> someone's<00:05:23.230> imagination

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.850 

of<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:26.940> opinion<00:05:27.420> that<00:05:27.450> because<00:05:28.020> Florida<00:05:28.350> left

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
of the opinion that because Florida left

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.130 
of the opinion that because Florida left
that<00:05:29.250> we<00:05:29.880> were<00:05:30.000> gonna<00:05:30.120> crumble<00:05:30.450> up<00:05:30.720> in<00:05:30.840> a<00:05:30.930> heap
