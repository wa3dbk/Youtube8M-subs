to stay cashed up at times probably

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.350 
to stay cashed up at times probably
mostly<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.240> was<00:01:43.399> purchasing<00:01:44.399> all<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
mostly because I was purchasing all the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.139 
mostly because I was purchasing all the
materials<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.049> smithing<00:01:46.880> just<00:01:47.880> because<00:01:48.030> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
materials for smithing just because it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.899 
materials for smithing just because it
was<00:01:48.270> quicker<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.720> way<00:01:49.250> but<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.729> was

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
was quicker that way but if I was

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.149 
was quicker that way but if I was
strapped<00:01:51.149> for<00:01:51.270> cash<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.840> found<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.829> just

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
strapped for cash I found that just

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.370 
strapped for cash I found that just
writing<00:01:53.700> some

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
writing some

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.880 
writing some
hideaways<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.520> camps<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.150> whatnot<00:01:57.510> and

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
hideaways and camps and whatnot and

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.430 
hideaways and camps and whatnot and
looting<00:01:58.890> absolutely<00:01:59.400> everything<00:02:00.260> gave<00:02:01.260> me

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
looting absolutely everything gave me

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.150 
looting absolutely everything gave me
enough<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:02.420> continue<00:02:03.420> my<00:02:03.720> smithing<00:02:04.170> which<00:02:05.010> was

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
enough to continue my smithing which was

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.670 
enough to continue my smithing which was
good<00:02:06.080> all<00:02:07.080> right<00:02:07.340> now<00:02:08.509> let's<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.750> watch<00:02:10.050> I

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.500 

gotta<00:02:13.680> say<00:02:13.890> I'm<00:02:14.070> glad<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.850> went<00:02:15.150> nord<00:02:17.510> because

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
gotta say I'm glad I went nord because

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.440 
gotta say I'm glad I went nord because
of<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.810> particular<00:02:19.230> fight<00:02:20.150> otherwise<00:02:21.150> it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
of this particular fight otherwise it

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.030 
of this particular fight otherwise it
probably<00:02:21.480> would<00:02:21.959> have<00:02:22.050> decimated<00:02:22.709> me

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
probably would have decimated me

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.430 
probably would have decimated me
I<00:02:24.800> went<00:02:25.800> mostly<00:02:26.010> into<00:02:26.490> stamina<00:02:30.200> mainly<00:02:31.200> so

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
I went mostly into stamina mainly so

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.840 
I went mostly into stamina mainly so
that<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.650> could<00:02:31.830> run<00:02:32.040> for<00:02:32.280> longer<00:02:32.459> because<00:02:32.760> I

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
that I could run for longer because I

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.050 
that I could run for longer because I
anticipated<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.750> having<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.650> her<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:35.550> run<00:02:35.760> quite

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
anticipated I having to her to run quite

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.600 
anticipated I having to her to run quite
a<00:02:36.120> bit<00:02:36.360> with<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.630> bill<00:02:37.250> but<00:02:38.250> also<00:02:38.370> because

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
a bit with this bill but also because

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.449 
a bit with this bill but also because
the<00:02:38.730> carry<00:02:38.970> capacity<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.810> was<00:02:39.959> nice<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.459> went

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
the carry capacity that was nice I went

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.030 
the carry capacity that was nice I went
I<00:02:41.850> put<00:02:42.209> 50<00:02:42.360> points<00:02:42.959> into<00:02:44.750> health<00:02:45.830> just<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.010> I

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
I put 50 points into health just so I
