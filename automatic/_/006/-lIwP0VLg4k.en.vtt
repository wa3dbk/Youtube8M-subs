 games that can be frightening and 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.630
 They can even leave you traumatized with 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.279
 which you can even contact or see 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.839
 things out of this world or the 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.269
 next that will make us live 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.890
 unique paranormal experiences fits 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.779
 mention that the ritual or game in 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.539
 question could be false and in any case 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.669
 you want to do it let me tell you you 're 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.470
 on your own I do not take responsibility 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.780
 for collateral damage or effects 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.030
 secondary that can happen I alone what 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.149
 I share without saying more let's start 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.149
 with 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.600
 the elevator game first to be able 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.000
 make this game you will need what 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.430
 next a building of minimum 10 floors 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.289
 and obviously an elevator once you have 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.289
 all this you must know what is this 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.210
 game the intention of this game is that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.699
 the elevator takes you to an alternate world 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.890
 who say they have played it successfully 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.899
 they say that the elevator doors are 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.899
 opened to infinite corridors with lights 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.909
 rare to the distance or to a version 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.039
 alternative of the same building but 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.259
 completely dark and with sounds 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.320
 strangers approaching suddenly the 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.880
 distance even one reported that his 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.399
 video camera and his cell phone not 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.380
 they worked in that place and absolutely 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.810
 everyone advises them to explore those 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.369
 alternative realities either at 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.080
 that you can find in them or 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.970
 because you might get lost and not 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.850
 again find the way back to 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.860
 your dimension and if you are going to play it is very 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.319
 important that you write down and continue to 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.929
 step the next take the elevator in the 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.330
 floor 1 presses the fourth floor button 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.340
 and once the device takes you there 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.570
 descends back but this time to the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.210
 2nd floor 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.880
 when you get to the 2nd floor, press 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.790
 the button on the sixth floor and when you get 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.240
 there it goes back to the 2nd floor and when 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.560
 you are there press the button on the 10th floor 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.350
 and when you're on the tenth floor 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.450
 press the button on the fifth floor in 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.400
 this point to the 1st floor back by the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.530
 elevator but if in the place of that the 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.690
 device decides to take you on its own 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.480
 10th floor get ready because that wants 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.550
 say that you did everything right when 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.770
 the doors of the tenth floor open 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.750
 you will be in the same building or that 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.090
 it seems as the door opened to a 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.250
 hallway that you have not seen is in fact 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.709
 a hallway from another dimension 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.110
 some are quiet and dark others 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.880
 they are almost identical but with some 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.709
 very remarkable differences 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.739
 even some are totally 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.600
 different and tenebrous and others say 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.150
 that the latent danger is felt in the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.280
 body decide to explore see or hear 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.560
 what can happen there or flat 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.420
 return immediately to your dimension 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.550
 keep in mind that you must do it from the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.860
 same elevator where you started this 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.690
 game and to go back you must repeat 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.360
 exactly the same operation 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.490
 starting from the first floor only that 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.920
 at the end instead of taking you to the 10th floor 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.860
 the device will leave you on the 1st floor then 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.990
 of the whole journey and I reiterate if you want 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.030
 do this ritual you're on your own 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.680
 I am not responsible for your death or 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.190
 any type of injury that can 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.360
 suffer to play it I just share it 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.220
 well this has been today's video 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.020
 I hope you liked it or so 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.880
 unless it made them have a good time 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.840
 without more to say see you in the 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.590
