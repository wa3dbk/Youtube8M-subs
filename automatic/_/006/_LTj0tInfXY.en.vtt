00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:08.380
 hello everyone I 'm g www and I'm going to 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:12.610
 teach how to make a metal texture a 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:16.679
 material as if it were metallized to 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.679
 do the intro that you will see below 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.369
 good is good after the anxiety of 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.470
 do in the next tutorial but as 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.079
 you will see for those who do not know they will need 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.110
 do in a metallic texture for 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:35.350
 do the cube if you want to make the quota 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.230
 of another color of blue or what 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.409
 You can go through this video and see 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.940
 the next but I recommend you 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.379
 see this video for those who want 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.930
 make this metal bucket and good 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.510
 let's start first of all we do not make a 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.339
 new material but we 're going to file 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.680
 shader and we go to the first one that puts 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.750
 bungee agree that this will not come out 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.830
 It has nothing metal but we do good 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.239
 double click and in diffuse here the first one is 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.269
 of gold the color of the surface we are going to 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:10.230
 double click on it and in the three fields 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:16.770
 that rgb in the red we put 49 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:18.030
 in it we also put 49 and in 49 of 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.630
 so that we will have one color 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.290
 grayish pulling towards black on a gray 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.880
 strong here let's leave it in internal 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.880
 As it is, we do not change it 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.350
 in surface lighting the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.040
 we leave 60% 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.350
 agree to speculate speculate one 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.590
 let's go to color the color we leave 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.330
 white we leave this as it is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.030
 forgiveness in speculating or you do not have to 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.159
 to touch the specular one is to speculate 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.270
 two instead of putting 20 percent the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.119
 only change you will have to make is 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.470
 put 50 percent here and the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.990
 decay put one hundred percent are the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.710
 only changes that have to be made 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.420
 in speculate three we are going to 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.670
 choose a grayish color with a gray 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.569
 actions is already 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:16.700
 here we are going to put him 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:19.310
 50% to 85 here we go already and is 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.160
 of speculators does not need to change 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.690
 almost nothing we remove transparency 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.130
 as we see is beginning to be a 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.320
 pretty metallic color and in reflection 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.000
 we are going to go to that the intensity 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.730
 let's put 15% 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.570
 we're going to put 80 percent here 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:45.130
 in decay instead of 75 you can 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.260
 leave 70 percent and here we are going to 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.629
 put one hundred percent 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.519
 everything is fine, as you can see 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.890
 being already quite metallic just 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.129
 there is one thing some may be that 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.040
 go out to spoil like to me now others 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:03.579
 you will come out to ruin you click on 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.530
 and the popcorn and we're going here first of 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.459
 everything in projection we put auto auto 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.530
 planar in reduced we put 45 is the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:17.750
 way we stay 55 55 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:21.370
 in roughness we put 75% and in these 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.840
 fields we put 100% 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.900
 here 90% 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.640
 90% and 100% 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.560
 and we give it here in the popcorn 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.879
 speculated on speculate 2 as you will see 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.879
 we have been left with enough materials 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.800
 I'm going to make some changes in 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:43.260
 the background temptation I'm going to put 200 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.180
 to see if not so much not to 150 you are doing 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.390
 variations until you see that way I 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.750
 like me a metallic color what 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.950
 it happens that 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.629
 and now we go to the cube 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.660
 we see a cube for example and we put it 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.819
 the metal color we will see that we do not have left 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.069
 metal so entirely agree we have left 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:05.630
 now we have to serve metal but we do not know 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:07.310
 see as it came out in the video for that 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.000
 this does not need you to do this anymore 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.840
 we will do it in the 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.480
 in doing the intro we go here for 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.090
 example let's create another light the 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.579
 we put forward and as we will see and we 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.919
 there is a mechanized texture according 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.289
 well this has been all well a tutorial 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.930
 cortito I hope you liked it 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.189
 vote i like favorites subscribe if 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.819
 you want and until next time 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.819
 goodbye
