00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
hey guys so I was writing the Rocky

hey guys so I was writing the Rocky
Mountain<00:00:18.210> element<00:00:18.660> 950<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.550> 29er

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
Mountain element 950 this is the 29er

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.330 
Mountain element 950 this is the 29er
version<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.510> element<00:00:21.900> 50<00:00:22.230> never<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
version of the element 50 never in the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.279 
version of the element 50 never in the
29<00:00:23.699> out<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.910> 4<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.359> was<00:00:24.570> very<00:00:24.779> surprised<00:00:25.140> when

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
29 out of 4 so I was very surprised when

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.439 
29 out of 4 so I was very surprised when
I<00:00:25.320> got<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.619> rolled<00:00:26.010> really<00:00:26.550> smooth<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
I got on it rolled really smooth a

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.269 
I got on it rolled really smooth a
little<00:00:28.380> bit<00:00:28.470> shaky<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.830> front<00:00:29.099> end<00:00:29.220> so

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
little bit shaky in the front end so

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.250 
little bit shaky in the front end so
steering<00:00:29.760> wasn't<00:00:30.449> quite<00:00:30.660> what<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.869> was<00:00:30.960> used<00:00:31.170> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
steering wasn't quite what I was used to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.979 
steering wasn't quite what I was used to
I<00:00:31.349> ride<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.369> layer<00:00:32.550> 70<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> little

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
I ride this layer 70 so it's a little

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.740 
I ride this layer 70 so it's a little
bit<00:00:34.200> wobbly<00:00:34.620> ER<00:00:34.860> than<00:00:35.070> my<00:00:35.190> bike<00:00:35.450> but<00:00:36.450> overall

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
bit wobbly ER than my bike but overall

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.750 
bit wobbly ER than my bike but overall
climbed<00:00:37.320> really<00:00:37.620> well<00:00:37.770> went<00:00:38.250> down

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
climbed really well went down

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.959 
climbed really well went down
relatively<00:00:39.450> okay<00:00:40.460> biggest<00:00:41.460> thing<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> me<00:00:41.760> was

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
relatively okay biggest thing to me was

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.160 
relatively okay biggest thing to me was
that<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.120> was<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.300> lot<00:00:42.420> higher<00:00:42.750> off<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.020> ground

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that I was a lot higher off the ground

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.830 
that I was a lot higher off the ground
so<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> felt<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> little<00:00:43.890> bit<00:00:44.070> more<00:00:44.250> unstable<00:00:44.850> but

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
so I felt a little bit more unstable but

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.479 
so I felt a little bit more unstable but
overall<00:00:46.079> was<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> really<00:00:46.649> neat<00:00:46.829> by<00:00:46.980> Dryden<00:00:47.280> I

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
overall was a really neat by Dryden I

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:56.140 
overall was a really neat by Dryden I
actually<00:00:47.910> thoroughly<00:00:48.570> enjoyed<00:00:48.809> it

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.050

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
29er of the day I can see the appeal to

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.770 
29er of the day I can see the appeal to
it<00:01:06.770> not<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:07.979> all<00:01:08.160> as<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> freeride<00:01:09.210> ish<00:01:09.420> kind<00:01:09.690> of

the tires on the ground go fast don't
take<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> lot<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.210> chances<00:01:18.380> technically<00:01:20.000> but

inch travel bike feels a lot more cross

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.710 
inch travel bike feels a lot more cross
country<00:01:53.729> ish<00:01:54.060> than<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:56.490> element<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.479> was

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
country ish than the element that was

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.900 
country ish than the element that was
the<00:01:57.840> 26<00:01:58.229> inch<00:01:58.380> wheels<00:01:58.440> element<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> 26<00:01:59.759> inch

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
the 26 inch wheels element to 26 inch

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.279 
the 26 inch wheels element to 26 inch
wheels<00:01:59.970> I'd<00:02:00.270> point<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.569> down<00:02:00.810> all<00:02:00.959> day<00:02:01.080> long

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
wheels I'd point that down all day long

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.949 
wheels I'd point that down all day long
this<00:02:01.709> not<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.819> much<00:02:03.440> but<00:02:04.440> as<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> 29er<00:02:05.130> good<00:02:05.399> bike

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
this not so much but as a 29er good bike

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.889 
this not so much but as a 29er good bike
just<00:02:06.959> I<00:02:07.080> think<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.349> market<00:02:07.709> for<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.190> bike<00:02:08.399> is

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
just I think the market for this bike is

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:20.740 
just I think the market for this bike is
small

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.539 

this<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.900> rocky<00:02:22.079> no<00:02:22.290> l/min<00:02:22.739> 950<00:02:23.340> in<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:24.359> 20.5

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
this is rocky no l/min 950 in a 20.5

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.259 
this is rocky no l/min 950 in a 20.5
feels<00:02:26.549> really<00:02:26.849> long<00:02:27.180> again<00:02:27.599> its<00:02:28.219> 29er<00:02:29.219> so<00:02:29.579> it's

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
feels really long again its 29er so it's

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.470 
feels really long again its 29er so it's
expected<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.489> really<00:02:32.489> likes<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.790> sit<00:02:33.120> on<00:02:33.299> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
expected that really likes to sit on the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.000 
expected that really likes to sit on the
trail<00:02:33.750> wheels<00:02:34.349> don't<00:02:34.469> like<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.709> come<00:02:34.829> off<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
trail wheels don't like to come off the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.619 
trail wheels don't like to come off the
ground<00:02:35.250> but<00:02:35.790> when<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.060> does<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:37.019> doesn't<00:02:37.829> feel

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
ground but when it does it doesn't feel

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.539

element 950 half to minute felt a little
more<00:03:19.379> comfortable<00:03:19.799> on<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.069> 29er<00:03:20.939> version

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
then the 26 version probably just

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.729 
then the 26 version probably just
because<00:03:23.849> I<00:03:23.940> am<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> little<00:03:24.479> bit<00:03:24.659> taller<00:03:24.870> just

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
wobbly just because it's just a bit of a

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.899 
wobbly just because it's just a bit of a
