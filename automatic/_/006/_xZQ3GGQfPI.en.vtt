00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
weeds if you're fishing weed beds it's

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.210

it's going to sit in there so I usually

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.379 
it's going to sit in there so I usually
lay<00:05:10.169> it<00:05:10.289> up<00:05:10.349> next<00:05:11.220> to<00:05:11.340> it<00:05:11.460> if<00:05:11.880> I'm<00:05:12.000> not<00:05:12.180> familiar

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
lay it up next to it if I'm not familiar

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.330

with<00:05:12.660> how<00:05:12.750> it's<00:05:12.900> going<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.110> set<00:05:13.320> and<00:05:13.530> look<00:05:14.099> at

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
with how it's going to set and look at

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.980 
with how it's going to set and look at
it<00:05:14.490> now<00:05:14.639> I<00:05:14.669> got<00:05:15.030> a<00:05:15.060> vision<00:05:15.389> I<00:05:15.630> can<00:05:15.810> visualize
