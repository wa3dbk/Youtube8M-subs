00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:05.900 

okay<00:00:02.669> so<00:00:03.449> in<00:00:03.720> this<00:00:04.049> lecture<00:00:04.350> we<00:00:05.190> are<00:00:05.220> going<00:00:05.339> to

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
okay so in this lecture we are going to

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.930 
okay so in this lecture we are going to
see<00:00:06.150> that<00:00:06.600> concept<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.610> plotting<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.820> signals

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
see that concept of plotting of signals

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:18.920 
see that concept of plotting of signals
okay<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.420> plotting<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:14.210> signals<00:00:17.539> so<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.750> this

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
okay so plotting of signals so in this

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.580 
okay so plotting of signals so in this
again<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.770> two<00:00:20.580> subtopics<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:22.109> out<00:00:22.350> of

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
again we have two subtopics you out of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.460 
again we have two subtopics you out of
which<00:00:22.830> first<00:00:23.220> one<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.699> called<00:00:25.039> operations<00:00:26.039> on

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.069 

dependent<00:00:32.840> variable<00:00:34.610> operations<00:00:35.610> on

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
dependent variable operations on

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.130 
dependent variable operations on
dependent<00:00:37.550> variable<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.809> first<00:00:42.809> we

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
dependent variable so in this first we

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.450 
dependent variable so in this first we
will<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.460> called<00:00:44.930> amplitude

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
will see what is called amplitude

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.670 
will see what is called amplitude
scaling<00:00:47.690> we<00:00:48.690> will<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.020> what<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.350> called

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
scaling we will see what is called

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.680 
scaling we will see what is called
amplitude<00:00:51.110> scaling<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.620> example<00:00:56.660> let<00:00:57.660> us

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
amplitude scaling so for example let us

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.240 
amplitude scaling so for example let us
say<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.770> signal<00:00:59.370> called<00:00:59.789> X<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.329> T<00:01:00.980> we<00:01:01.980> say

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
say I have a signal called X of T we say

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
say I have a signal called X of T we say
Y<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.149> T<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:04.010> amplitude<00:01:05.119> scaled<00:01:06.119> version<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.049> X

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
Y of T as amplitude scaled version of X

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.590 
Y of T as amplitude scaled version of X
of<00:01:07.560> T<00:01:08.000> if<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.540> write<00:01:09.840> Y<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.439> T<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.220> times<00:01:12.210> X

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
of T if we can write Y of T as a times X

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.980 
of T if we can write Y of T as a times X
of<00:01:12.990> T<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:15.750> see<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.979> lies<00:01:17.729> between<00:01:18.240> 0

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
of T so here you see if a lies between 0

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.310 
of T so here you see if a lies between 0
and<00:01:19.170> 1<00:01:20.119> then<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.330> say<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.600> Y<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.590> T<00:01:22.920> is

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
and 1 then we say that Y of T is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.630 
and 1 then we say that Y of T is
attenuated<00:01:25.320> version<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.009> X<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:27.500> attenuated

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.200 

version<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.820> except<00:01:33.270> similarly<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.530> he<00:01:34.799> is

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
version of except similarly if he is

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.670 
version of except similarly if he is
greater<00:01:36.210> than<00:01:36.600> 1<00:01:37.460> then<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:38.490> say<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.270> Y<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.350> T

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
greater than 1 then we say that Y of T

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.970 
greater than 1 then we say that Y of T
is<00:01:41.180> amplified<00:01:42.180> version<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:46.369> exactly

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
is amplified version of exactly

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.900 
is amplified version of exactly
so<00:01:48.980> just<00:01:49.550> to<00:01:49.760> make<00:01:49.790> this<00:01:50.660> concept<00:01:51.260> clear<00:01:51.910> let

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
so just to make this concept clear let

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.860 
so just to make this concept clear let
us<00:01:53.120> take<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.450> small<00:01:53.780> example<00:01:54.430> so<00:01:55.430> if<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.970> take<00:01:56.480> X

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
us take a small example so if I take X

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.740 
us take a small example so if I take X
of<00:01:57.200> T<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.770> be<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.950> following<00:01:58.730> signal<00:01:59.210> let<00:01:59.600> us

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
of T to be the following signal let us

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.170 
of T to be the following signal let us
say<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.170> rectangle<00:02:00.770> signal<00:02:01.190> from<00:02:01.430> minus<00:02:01.910> 1

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
say it's a rectangle signal from minus 1

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.620 
say it's a rectangle signal from minus 1
to<00:02:02.210> plus<00:02:02.420> 1<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.880> corresponding

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
to plus 1 and the corresponding

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.609 
to plus 1 and the corresponding
amplitude<00:02:05.810> let<00:02:06.440> us<00:02:06.590> take<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:07.070> be<00:02:07.250> 1<00:02:08.179> now<00:02:09.080> if<00:02:09.440> I

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
amplitude let us take to be 1 now if I

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.590 
amplitude let us take to be 1 now if I
want<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:10.100> plot<00:02:10.450> Y<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.660> T<00:02:12.020> equal<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.880> 2<00:02:13.880> times<00:02:14.270> X

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
want to plot Y of T equal to 2 times X

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.460 
want to plot Y of T equal to 2 times X
of<00:02:14.870> T<00:02:15.200> as<00:02:15.680> a<00:02:15.710> plot<00:02:16.070> of<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.580> will<00:02:17.540> look<00:02:17.750> something

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
of T as a plot of it will look something

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.440 
of T as a plot of it will look something
like<00:02:18.680> this

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
like this

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.540 
like this
so<00:02:20.450> note<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.260> time<00:02:21.500> limits<00:02:21.920> will<00:02:22.130> remain

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
so note that the time limits will remain

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.350 
so note that the time limits will remain
same<00:02:22.880> because<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.540> are<00:02:23.690> doing<00:02:23.990> operations<00:02:24.290> on

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
same because you are doing operations on

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.000 
same because you are doing operations on
dependent<00:02:26.360> variable<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:26.990> no<00:02:27.170> name<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.800> this

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
dependent variable so no name of this

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.120 
dependent variable so no name of this
fellow<00:02:28.340> will<00:02:28.490> be<00:02:28.600> too<00:02:29.600> into<00:02:30.130> exactly

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
fellow will be too into exactly

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.190 
fellow will be too into exactly
similarly<00:02:31.820> if<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.450> want<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.900> plot<00:02:34.270> 1<00:02:35.270> by<00:02:35.540> 2<00:02:35.930> X

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
similarly if you want to plot 1 by 2 X

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.910 
similarly if you want to plot 1 by 2 X
of<00:02:36.590> T<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.820> amplitude<00:02:38.510> will<00:02:38.870> look<00:02:39.080> something

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
of T so amplitude will look something

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.820 
of T so amplitude will look something
like<00:02:39.950> this

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
like this

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.770 
like this
so<00:02:42.830> amplitude<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:43.640> fellow<00:02:43.880> is<00:02:44.120> 1/2<00:02:44.420> and

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
so amplitude of this fellow is 1/2 and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.970 
so amplitude of this fellow is 1/2 and
the<00:02:44.900> name<00:02:45.050> of<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.440> guy<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.860> 1<00:02:46.340> by<00:02:46.580> 2<00:02:46.910> into<00:02:47.709> X<00:02:48.709> of

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
the name of this guy is 1 by 2 into X of

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.120 
the name of this guy is 1 by 2 into X of
so<00:02:49.700> as<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:50.000> last<00:02:50.209> example<00:02:50.420> if<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.380> want<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.830> plot

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
so as a last example if I want to plot

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.410 
so as a last example if I want to plot
minus<00:02:52.910> X<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.420> T<00:02:53.720> how<00:02:54.590> does<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.130> plot<00:02:55.400> look<00:02:56.060> so

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
minus X of T how does the plot look so

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.320 
minus X of T how does the plot look so
minus<00:02:56.870> X<00:02:57.019> of<00:02:57.260> P<00:02:57.560> will<00:02:58.370> look<00:02:58.550> something<00:02:59.060> like

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
minus X of P will look something like

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.680 
minus X of P will look something like
this<00:03:00.019> so<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.470> will<00:03:00.769> get<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.370> plot<00:03:01.760> by

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
this so you will get this plot by

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.580 
this so you will get this plot by
rotating<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.620> signal<00:03:04.040> X<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.640> T<00:03:04.940> along<00:03:05.780> x<00:03:06.050> axis

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
rotating the signal X of T along x axis

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.830 
rotating the signal X of T along x axis
by<00:03:06.830> 180<00:03:07.459> degrees<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.150> if<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.330> rotate<00:03:08.630> this

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
by 180 degrees so if you rotate this

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.140 
by 180 degrees so if you rotate this
flow<00:03:09.050> along<00:03:09.380> x<00:03:09.620> axis<00:03:09.830> by<00:03:10.220> 180<00:03:10.550> degrees<00:03:10.940> you

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
flow along x axis by 180 degrees you

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.580 
flow along x axis by 180 degrees you
will<00:03:11.750> get<00:03:11.959> minus<00:03:12.890> X<00:03:13.120> often<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.840> this<00:03:15.110> is<00:03:15.320> about

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
will get minus X often so this is about

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.620 
will get minus X often so this is about
amplitude<00:03:16.519> scale<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:18.110> next<00:03:18.380> we<00:03:18.950> move<00:03:19.220> on<00:03:19.340> to

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
amplitude scale so next we move on to

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.890 
amplitude scale so next we move on to
what<00:03:20.630> is<00:03:20.810> called<00:03:21.110> addition<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:22.070> two<00:03:22.400> signals

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
what is called addition of two signals

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:31.850 
what is called addition of two signals
so<00:03:23.900> addition<00:03:24.350> of<00:03:24.530> two<00:03:25.160> signals

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.530 

we<00:03:32.400> define<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.540> addition<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.020> two<00:03:34.380> signals<00:03:35.540> x1

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
we define the addition of two signals x1

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.180 
we define the addition of two signals x1
of<00:03:36.720> T<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.260> x2<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.890> T<00:03:37.920> as<00:03:38.400> Y<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.300> T<00:03:39.570> equal<00:03:39.990> to<00:03:40.200> x1

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
of T plus x2 and this process of

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.420 
of T plus x2 and this process of
addition<00:03:45.870> we<00:03:46.080> do<00:03:46.380> for<00:03:47.190> all<00:03:47.370> time<00:03:47.910> T<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:49.430> is

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
addition we do for all time T so that is

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.000 
addition we do for all time T so that is
mentioned<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.270> we<00:03:51.870> will<00:03:51.960> directly<00:03:52.380> jump<00:03:52.500> into

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
mentioned so we will directly jump into

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.180 
mentioned so we will directly jump into
the<00:03:53.130> example<00:03:53.460> so<00:03:54.330> for<00:03:54.480> example<00:03:55.080> if<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.830> X

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
the example so for example if I have X

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.420 
the example so for example if I have X
of<00:03:56.400> T<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.910> be<00:03:56.940> like<00:03:57.270> this<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:58.320> let<00:03:58.800> us<00:03:58.830> say<00:03:59.160> it's

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430

this<00:05:00.510> amplitude<00:05:00.990> is<00:05:02.930> what<00:05:03.930> next<00:05:04.860> so<00:05:05.310> from

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
this amplitude is what next so from

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.790 
this amplitude is what next so from
minus<00:05:05.760> 1<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.270> plus<00:05:06.480> 1<00:05:06.720> this<00:05:07.410> fellow's

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
minus 1 to plus 1 this fellow's

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.460 
minus 1 to plus 1 this fellow's
amplitude<00:05:08.460> is<00:05:08.610> 1/2<00:05:08.880> and<00:05:09.570> from<00:05:09.840> minus<00:05:10.200> 1<00:05:10.440> to

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
amplitude is 1/2 and from minus 1 to

amplitude is 1/2 and from minus 1 to
plus<00:05:10.650> 1<00:05:10.860> this<00:05:11.250> have<00:05:11.490> useful<00:05:12.060> as<00:05:12.180> amplitude<00:05:12.540> is

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
plus 1 this have useful as amplitude is

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.470 
plus 1 this have useful as amplitude is
1<00:05:13.110> so<00:05:13.740> obviously<00:05:13.830> what<00:05:14.430> does<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.700> mean<00:05:14.940> the

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
1 so obviously what does it mean the

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.990 
1 so obviously what does it mean the
total<00:05:15.840> amplitude<00:05:16.500> from<00:05:16.830> minus<00:05:17.310> 1<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.580> plus<00:05:17.760> 1

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
total amplitude from minus 1 to plus 1

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.290 
total amplitude from minus 1 to plus 1
is<00:05:18.390> 1<00:05:18.600> plus<00:05:18.630> 1<00:05:18.930> by<00:05:19.169> 2<00:05:19.380> that<00:05:19.590> is<00:05:19.950> nothing<00:05:20.130> but<00:05:20.490> 3

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
is 1 plus 1 by 2 that is nothing but 3

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.940 
is 1 plus 1 by 2 that is nothing but 3
by<00:05:21.510> 2<00:05:22.370> so<00:05:23.370> again<00:05:23.400> from<00:05:24.120> 1<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.630> 2<00:05:25.230> this<00:05:25.470> fellow<00:05:25.800> is

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
by 2 so again from 1 to 2 this fellow is

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.090 
by 2 so again from 1 to 2 this fellow is
0<00:05:26.280> again<00:05:26.520> from<00:05:27.030> 1<00:05:27.240> to<00:05:27.450> 2<00:05:27.660> this<00:05:27.870> fellow<00:05:28.140> is<00:05:28.320> 1<00:05:28.890> so

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
0 again from 1 to 2 this fellow is 1 so

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.659 
0 again from 1 to 2 this fellow is 1 so
1<00:05:29.280> plus<00:05:29.520> 0<00:05:29.820> is<00:05:29.880> 1<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:30.630> overall<00:05:31.520> addition<00:05:32.520> of

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
1 plus 0 is 1 so overall addition of

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.300 
1 plus 0 is 1 so overall addition of
these<00:05:32.910> two<00:05:33.210> signals<00:05:33.450> will<00:05:34.110> look<00:05:34.350> something

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
these two signals will look something

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.640 
these two signals will look something
like<00:05:35.340> this<00:05:35.730> so<00:05:35.850> I<00:05:35.880> from<00:05:36.300> minus<00:05:36.690> 1<00:05:37.140> to<00:05:37.169> plus<00:05:37.410> 1

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
like this so I from minus 1 to plus 1

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.920 
like this so I from minus 1 to plus 1

rectangle from again let us say minus 1
to<00:06:24.960> plus<00:06:25.199> 1<00:06:25.680> so<00:06:26.669> let<00:06:27.210> me<00:06:27.419> call<00:06:27.690> this<00:06:28.050> guy<00:06:28.380> x1<00:06:29.190> of

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
to plus 1 so let me call this guy x1 of

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.189 
to plus 1 so let me call this guy x1 of
T<00:06:29.400> and<00:06:30.330> let<00:06:30.630> me<00:06:30.840> call<00:06:31.139> this<00:06:31.380> as<00:06:31.860> extra<00:06:32.930> so<00:06:33.930> let

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 
T and let me call this as extra so let

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.400 
T and let me call this as extra so let
this<00:06:34.440> fellow<00:06:34.680> exist<00:06:35.340> from<00:06:35.580> minus<00:06:36.060> 1<00:06:36.270> to<00:06:36.300> plus<00:06:36.810> 1

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
this fellow exist from minus 1 to plus 1

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.860 
this fellow exist from minus 1 to plus 1
so<00:06:38.190> if<00:06:38.340> you<00:06:38.460> want<00:06:38.669> to<00:06:38.759> add<00:06:38.970> these<00:06:39.300> two<00:06:39.360> signals

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
so if you want to add these two signals

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.400 
so if you want to add these two signals
how<00:06:40.860> does<00:06:41.250> the<00:06:41.430> plot<00:06:41.699> look<00:06:42.080> again

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
how does the plot look again

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
how does the plot look again
so<00:06:44.099> just<00:06:44.400> before<00:06:44.789> minus<00:06:45.539> 1<00:06:45.810> this<00:06:45.990> is<00:06:46.050> 0<00:06:46.410> just<00:06:47.250> to

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
so just before minus 1 this is 0 just to

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.510 
so just before minus 1 this is 0 just to
be<00:06:47.520> 4<00:06:47.789> minus<00:06:47.820> 1<00:06:48.330> X<00:06:48.570> 2<00:06:48.750> of<00:06:48.870> T<00:06:48.900> also<00:06:49.470> is<00:06:49.620> 0<00:06:49.889> so<00:06:50.310> if<00:06:50.400> I

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
be 4 minus 1 X 2 of T also is 0 so if I

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.430 
be 4 minus 1 X 2 of T also is 0 so if I
had<00:06:50.729> these<00:06:50.970> two<00:06:51.030> signals<00:06:51.419> the<00:06:51.990> overall

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
had these two signals the overall

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.580 
had these two signals the overall
addition<00:06:52.979> starts<00:06:53.610> at<00:06:53.760> minus<00:06:54.360> 1<00:06:54.720> so<00:06:54.840> at<00:06:54.990> minus<00:06:55.380> 1

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
addition starts at minus 1 so at minus 1

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.219 
addition starts at minus 1 so at minus 1
what<00:06:55.770> happens<00:06:56.419> amplitude<00:06:57.419> of<00:06:57.539> this<00:06:57.720> signal<00:06:57.780> is

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
what happens amplitude of this signal is

00:06:58.229 --> 00:06:58.909 
what happens amplitude of this signal is
minus<00:06:58.560> 1

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
minus 1

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.060 
minus 1
I<00:06:58.949> am<00:06:59.340> did<00:06:59.550> you<00:06:59.669> out<00:06:59.760> of<00:06:59.880> signal<00:07:00.240> at<00:07:00.960> x2<00:07:01.470> of<00:07:01.740> T<00:07:01.770> at

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
I am did you out of signal at x2 of T at

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.790 
I am did you out of signal at x2 of T at
minus<00:07:02.490> 1<00:07:02.699> has<00:07:02.940> a<00:07:02.970> discounted<00:07:03.630> is<00:07:03.780> obviously<00:07:04.260> 0

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
minus 1 has a discounted is obviously 0

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.520 
minus 1 has a discounted is obviously 0
plus<00:07:05.520> discontinuity<00:07:06.389> again<00:07:06.690> will<00:07:06.930> result<00:07:07.380> in

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
plus discontinuity again will result in

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.659 
plus discontinuity again will result in
it<00:07:07.710> this<00:07:08.310> continuity<00:07:08.789> so<00:07:09.060> how<00:07:09.180> does<00:07:09.240> that<00:07:09.630> look

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
it this continuity so how does that look

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.770 
it this continuity so how does that look
so<00:07:11.669> suddenly<00:07:12.060> there<00:07:12.449> will<00:07:12.630> be<00:07:12.659> a<00:07:12.840> jump<00:07:13.229> of<00:07:13.820> 1<00:07:14.820> so

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 
so suddenly there will be a jump of 1 so

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.629 
so suddenly there will be a jump of 1 so
month<00:07:16.080> of<00:07:16.229> this<00:07:16.380> quantity<00:07:16.860> is<00:07:16.919> 1<00:07:17.159> so<00:07:17.370> she<00:07:17.430> has<00:07:17.580> a

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 
month of this quantity is 1 so she has a

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.839 
month of this quantity is 1 so she has a
signal<00:07:18.060> suddenly<00:07:18.539> jumps<00:07:18.960> to<00:07:19.169> one<00:07:19.470> later<00:07:20.130> so

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:20.849 
signal suddenly jumps to one later so

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:23.390 
signal suddenly jumps to one later so
from<00:07:21.150> minus<00:07:21.419> 1<00:07:21.870> to<00:07:21.900> plus<00:07:22.080> 1<00:07:22.320> this<00:07:22.710> fellow<00:07:23.039> is<00:07:23.190> 1

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 
from minus 1 to plus 1 this fellow is 1

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.800 
from minus 1 to plus 1 this fellow is 1
again<00:07:24.240> minus<00:07:24.690> 1<00:07:24.900> to<00:07:25.050> plus<00:07:25.260> 1<00:07:25.289> this<00:07:25.680> fellow<00:07:25.949> is<00:07:26.099> a

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:26.810 
again minus 1 to plus 1 this fellow is a

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.750 
again minus 1 to plus 1 this fellow is a
trying<00:07:27.810> it's<00:07:28.050> obviously<00:07:28.620> a<00:07:28.740> rectangle<00:07:29.550> press

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:29.760 
trying it's obviously a rectangle press

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.670 
trying it's obviously a rectangle press
triangle<00:07:30.240> will<00:07:30.570> look<00:07:30.780> something<00:07:31.530> like<00:07:31.740> this

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 
triangle will look something like this

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.089 
triangle will look something like this
so<00:07:34.680> beyond<00:07:35.430> 1<00:07:35.669> again<00:07:36.030> it<00:07:36.180> is<00:07:36.360> 0<00:07:37.320> so<00:07:37.680> obviously

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:38.099 
so beyond 1 again it is 0 so obviously

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:40.939 
so beyond 1 again it is 0 so obviously
amplitude<00:07:38.760> will<00:07:38.940> be<00:07:39.120> 1<00:07:39.330> and<00:07:39.599> this<00:07:40.470> amplitude

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:40.949 
amplitude will be 1 and this amplitude

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:45.110 
amplitude will be 1 and this amplitude
is<00:07:41.370> 2<00:07:41.610> so<00:07:42.389> this<00:07:42.510> is<00:07:42.750> minus<00:07:43.260> 1<00:07:43.560> and<00:07:43.800> this<00:07:44.250> is<00:07:44.490> plus

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 
is 2 so this is minus 1 and this is plus

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.019
