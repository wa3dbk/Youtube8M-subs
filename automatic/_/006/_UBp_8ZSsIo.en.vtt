 cleaner 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.710
 it speeds up its action avoid 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.810
 apply stripper to currents

 with a spatula on the flat parts 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.540
 and use a brass brush to 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.540
 the hollows to find the bare wood

 rinse with water or with alcohol

 watch out for paint residues they 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.380
 are toxic 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.229
 they must be dropped off 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.090
 for their recycling 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.390
 once dry we went slightly 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.220
 dusted you can fade the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.260

 we are slightly in the direction of 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.360
 fibers to get a smooth surface 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:24.280
 then dust off one of to start with 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.060
 light sanding in the direction of the fibers 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.530
 brush to dust well 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.300
 enhanced protection you can 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.520
 strengthen the protection of new wood

 a wood of the caps is treated before 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.340
 the lightning 6 hours do not hesitate to 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.930
 apply a second coat after 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:51.070
 drying for better impregnation 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:53.500
 wood mix well the varnish in the 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.060
 pot diluted slightly the varnish with 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.720
 water for the first layer 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.519
 this will favor the impregnation of the wood 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.799
 applied with a brush for the azure or 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.860
 brush crossing the passes then in 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.850
 smoothing in the direction of the fibers 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.850
 let dry according to the recommendations 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.600

 second layer undiluted smoothing 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.510
 well in the fiber sense plus your 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.030
 varnish is tinted the more it will withstand 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.950
 uv rays and will remain effective on a 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.989
 long period 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.209
