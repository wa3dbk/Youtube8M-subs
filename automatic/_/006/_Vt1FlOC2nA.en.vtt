00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the battery well when I get a battery I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.850 
the battery well when I get a battery I

need to get a new battery but I want to
test<00:02:32.040> fuel<00:02:32.370> pump<00:02:32.580> out<00:02:32.730> see<00:02:32.970> if<00:02:33.030> that's

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
test fuel pump out see if that's

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.490

actually<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> problem<00:02:35.360> I'm<00:02:36.360> kind<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.170> torn

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.860 
actually the problem I'm kind of torn
between<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.100> mean<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.610> hope<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.630> fuel

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
between I mean I hope it is the fuel

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.620 
between I mean I hope it is the fuel
pump<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.290> mean<00:02:41.130> it's<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.400> little<00:02:41.610> bit<00:02:41.730> pricey<00:02:41.910> not

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
pump I mean it's a little bit pricey not

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.090 
pump I mean it's a little bit pricey not
too<00:02:42.870> bad<00:02:43.020> it's<00:02:43.170> just<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> hundred<00:02:43.980> and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
too bad it's just like a hundred and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.810 
too bad it's just like a hundred and
thirty<00:02:44.280> dollars<00:02:44.670> but<00:02:46.100> if<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.460> fuel<00:02:47.700> pump

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
thirty dollars but if it's a fuel pump

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.010 
thirty dollars but if it's a fuel pump
then<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.090> don't<00:02:48.300> have<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.510> trace<00:02:48.720> everything

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
then I don't have to trace everything

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.480 
then I don't have to trace everything
back<00:02:49.140> see<00:02:49.440> if<00:02:49.470> there's<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.740> blocked<00:02:50.010> fuel<00:02:50.280> line

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
back see if there's a blocked fuel line

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.070 
back see if there's a blocked fuel line
see<00:02:50.760> if<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.940> relays<00:02:51.240> are<00:02:51.390> bad<00:02:51.540> see<00:02:51.870> if<00:02:51.960> the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
see if the relays are bad see if the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.260 
see if the relays are bad see if the
fuel<00:02:52.320> injectors<00:02:52.680> bad<00:02:52.890> it's<00:02:53.640> just<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.910> fuel<00:02:54.120> pump

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
fuel injectors bad it's just a fuel pump

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.420 
fuel injectors bad it's just a fuel pump
it'll<00:02:54.510> be<00:02:54.600> fixed<00:02:55.020> so<00:02:55.680> that's<00:02:55.950> what<00:02:56.190> I'm<00:02:56.280> hoping
