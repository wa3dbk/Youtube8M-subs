00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.620
 hello to all these maxi for a new 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.770
 video discovery or today on f1 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.190
 2012 so the new version of the 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.500
 f1 simulator that will cost that costs 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.840
 at the moment 35 euros 99 on steam 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.059
 which costs in normal times so he in 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.449
 discounted to -10% it costs in 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.920
 normal time 39 euros 99 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.970
 it's a tea guy 3 it's released on the 20th 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.220
 September 2012 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.550
 so it's race simulation 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.260
 car edited by codemasters 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.390
 developed by codemasters studios from 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.070
 virgin games 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.950
 so we have on this news 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.820
 version always always very 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.830
 nice 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.180
 modeling cars like you 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.600
 can see it is really perfect 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.100
 will be running in the final game so we 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.430
 will have all the changes 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.160
 that were made on the vehicles 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.390
 during the 2012 season as for example 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.050
 the baffles to cool the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.380
 brakes on the part before the glo 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.550
 of air transmission at the rear of 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.740
 late vehicles all the latest 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.820
 changes that take place in the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.150
 new season 2 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.520
 of Formula 1 this year the game is 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.020
 always very nice he always proposes 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.140
 classic multiplayer modes 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.550
 cooperation in campaign and cooperation 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.100
 also in the league 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.240
 so that's new we did not have the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.630
 cooperation at the championship level 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.140
 now we are going to have at the level of 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.330
 steam 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.890
 a ranking on steam so who 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.720
 will list voters and that's for 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.610
 look a little bit at what your friends are doing and 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.640
 try to beat them even if you play 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.450
 not with them we have the backups so 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.160
 in the cloud 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.410
 at the style level so this is a 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.720
 option that interests me a lot since 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.380
 I often play on several different 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.570
 computers 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.880
 whether it's on my laptop pc 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.220
 fixed or a second fixed pc is not 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.890
 who is not at home so it's not bad 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.989
 it allows to continue his game while 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.430
 being on on different computers 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.200
 so the backup is hosted 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.390
 directly on the on the server of 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.650
 steam and it allows to continue his game 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.930
 his game quietly 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.340
 no matter where we are if 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.560
 never for example you have your pc 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.390
 portable and that 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.010
 you move on to a friend's house for him 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.830
 show the game or whatever it is that 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.410
 can be nice 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.090
 so at the gameplay level it's about 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.640
 simulation 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.140
 I want to tell you I have disabled 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.090
 a lot of help with driving 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.290
 we have to redo this video since 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.640
 I do not like having the assistance 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.790
 braking the car brakes alone 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.890
 I do not like to have the assistance of 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.570
 everything at the level of acceleration even though 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.070
 it's harder I prefer you to have the 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.980
 analog controls to play that's 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.540
 when dies it's a sad state 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.340
 so we end up on one on a small 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.380
 gameplay that I prepared for 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.600
 the occasion I am not a professional 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.470
 simulation games you'll see it at 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.560
 gameplay level 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.050
 I advise you to go watch the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.930
 Damien video 0.6 on his lady channel 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.360
 steevy when he made his get by 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.980
 personal opinion since June with a steering wheel 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.880
 is really more comfortable than me 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.500
 at the level of court games 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.000
 think of having him when 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.710
 I take this opportunity to convey to you 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.890
 information the game itself is not 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.800
 much changed graphically we will say 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.170
 I found that at the level of the gameplay 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.000
 he was a little bit more 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.130
 how to say a little bit harder 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.250
 a little bit more demanding for 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.350
 to be easy we really start to be 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.050
 sure of the real forest simulation of 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.680
 formula 1 already on the episode 2010 and 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.240
 2011 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.620
 had 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.870
 a simulation aspect that was very 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.630
 pronounced he continues in this optics 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.370
 there and it's really good so it's a 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.410
 relatively demanding game not to put 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.770
 in all hands it's sure it's 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.290
 not at all an arcade game 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:27.110
 I really enjoyed myself so 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.870
 there we are on the abu dhabi circuit which 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.580
 is not a circuit that 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.220
 that I really like who is 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.190
 relatively short for my taste and not 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.870
 quite fast with no turns 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.360
 necessarily simple to take is a 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.310
 very fast circuit so me it's not 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.200
 a mission he preferred but the demo 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.480
 too possessive he has so that's why 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.340
 to avoid over there 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.740
 I hope this little gameplay you 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.330
 will give a preview of the game you can 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.280
 always download the demo on steam 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.390
 it's totally free that you 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.730
 will give you an idea 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.500
 I spent all the tutorial part 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.030
 we have at the beginning to really 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.670
 focus on on the gameplay you 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.380
 to propose the sympathetic images 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.850
 I hope they are 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.350
 further for my part I think 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.510
 sincerely take it to me because 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.670
 I like it a lot I like it a lot 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.580
 formula 1 I played pretty well in 2002 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.950
 2011 and so the 2012 is for me 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.100
 the logical follow-up I sincerely think the 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.840
 take to play on while the more 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.000
 can play with his friends in co-op and 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.720
 it's good it's really 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.240
 nice 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.400
 so I leave you on the end of this 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.930
 all I tell you for my part to very 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.580
