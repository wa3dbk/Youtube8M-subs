00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 it seems that it is heating up and not 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.069
 dismiss any space that is 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.919
 fundamental to be able to turn well 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.809
 the fish thanks black spatula because 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.670
 it has a pretty large surface and 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.320
 back when Roman is not the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.280
 price are the title 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.280
 no sword 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.400
 so when it's left with a scab 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.220
 crocanti is but it is not a modern 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.470
 plant or how it is but I consume 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.960
 flour looks but a touch just be 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.120
 well we passed the fillets without egg without 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.220
 nothing simply have salt us by 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 flour that moisture absorb a little bit 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.530
 of spectacular light flour is like 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.280
 a rib 0 sing that is very very 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.379
 very very well 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.629
 notice that I prepare this I have the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.980
 pan warming in the fire and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.410
 then I'm going to do is I'm going to put a 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.960
 little bit of oil and it 's more if you 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.940
 eat very healthy for example another to 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.640
 my house times like pretty healthy 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.640
 It serves like a little fish like that with a salad 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.680
 Ready great but if it's not good it 's 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.780
 heavy winter with colder salad 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.220
 you can make a salami salsa 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.489
 super fast which are the ones that we are going to 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.489
 do now 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.159
 and rock because I love 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:27.090
 and good 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.440
 we have the little fish we put on him 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.930
 We put pepper we had it for flour 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.630
 oil in this case to use an oil of 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.850
 canola leader who is super healthy 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.850
 it's super rich and you get it in all the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.970
 business that goes we put oil here 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.539
 canola right now we're going straight 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.240
 to put the little fish direct listen 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.399
 that makes the noise are much to gild 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.550
 listen to the noise and to help 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.440
 He came back from the sea like rivers like noise 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:04.450
 from the sea I put the noise of more 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.450
 very good opportunity singing songs 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.270
 Well, look, fish, a lot of people say 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.390
 I do not want to be raw I do not want me 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.950
 be dry but I do not want me to stay 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.380
 I do not want to leave dry this 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.380
 written is turned and very well left 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.760
 well rich and juicy do not be scared and 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.400
 with a spatula in the bag by the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.930
 our perfect look sixth tail 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.940
 we will see how he is but look not 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.180
 it broke we turn it to cook a 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.640
 little bit more the other side and while 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.610
 says alejandra almost so 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.270
 this little fish in this way eat very 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.470
 fast as it is very very very rich besides 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.120
 it's economical because the truth that the 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.590
 fillet of hake filler to all 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.240
 can get super cheap and 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.930
 they also think with a single oven 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.930
 also money 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:04.980
 and I'm going to do it but you can not do it 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.770
 baked what I like are the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.160
 pans that grows the environment can 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.160
 find 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.400
 fast to eat and not mandated by the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.440
 heat not like come so fast you're going to 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.270
 eat back and forth that is ready 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.900
 for the grill if we do a little bit 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.900
 during a work 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.350
 I do not know why 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.940
 Fernando has the pan by the plate 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.800
 vice weight for example in here 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.800
 and following the clay oven 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.160
 we do it in the pan 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.730
 but good if I was going crazy 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.730
 come back to this 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.880
 put out the fire I do not want to be 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.100
 pass the fish the little dishes 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.610
 share emplazando in this there are cows 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.520
 as I thought in a little while in a 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.430
 jiffy but I said before I do not know 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.190
 what is right because before there 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.410
 say fish with salad gives me very 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.060
 light I do not want to do I want to eat 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.380
 something more blunt there are people who 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.990
 can you think good that the precious 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.210
 treasure you for all we go 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.310
 make three sauces but super super 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.650
 simple so you can pleasure them 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.380
 I listen perfect to my producer I am 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.840

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.380

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.050
 to respond is going well is going well we are there 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.790
 in the team is very concentrated the 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:05.600
 players the defense was ready 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.600
 good 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.830
 habits ready if you want you can put 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.500
 a little more lemon is very good 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.190
 fish in the freshest tomato and a 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.350
 of next because they also come 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.650
 eighty lemon sand 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.710
 pan jump here hot cream 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.200
 milk well so I'm going to put teeth in 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.090
 whole garlic because whole because after 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.670
 I'm not going to put it in the sauce 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.830
 previously by piercing or shading the cream 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.800
 here lemon cream on the same route 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.680
 Quick, you creep disgust until you take me 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.350
 add lemon rind low mobile no 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.090
 you know how good it is there is going to be 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.150
 or the salt press hot the cream 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.880
 immediately heated pepper salt to last 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.340
 selling a little bit of lemon juice and juice 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.250
 of lemon to the crisis amaine spectacular 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.670
 super cool and obviously not going to 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.500
 missing parsley first cream easy 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.500
 usach is proclaiming the greatest good 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:09.270
 the practical woman 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:25.050
 so that we finish a sauce that is 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:27.909
 cream we put a disgust are pepper 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.550
 lemon zest and how amazing 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:33.819
 encourage yourself to do it chopped parsley with 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.519
 dawn and a little bit of lemon juice 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:39.429
 to be amazing, we serve it 

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:42.219
 about the fish there are two possible and 

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:44.979
 we have a solution to the list list 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:47.409
 to eat with a little rice with 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:49.930
 some chips with what you think is great 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:52.460
 a total delight 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.260
 it came to what it is all the time 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.750
 many times believe that if you throw juice 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.120
 from lemon to cream you cut hot 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.560
 and they do not put the type cuts 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.290
 it's exactly a simple touch 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.360
 amazing that the cream is not cut 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:09.430
 workers and we're going to part a little bit of the 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.430
 program did not forget a little green
