00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
I think probably in the d-league I had

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.740 
I think probably in the d-league I had
must<00:00:28.920> have<00:00:29.039> had<00:00:29.130> at<00:00:29.250> least<00:00:29.279> one<00:00:29.580> last<00:00:29.820> year<00:00:30.029> you

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
must have had at least one last year you

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.299 
must have had at least one last year you
see<00:00:30.960> more<00:00:31.140> excited<00:00:31.529> than<00:00:31.560> anybody<00:00:31.949> ever<00:00:32.040> it

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
see more excited than anybody ever it

see more excited than anybody ever it
though<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.790> they<00:00:32.910> didn't<00:00:33.120> call<00:00:33.239> time<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
though and they didn't call time out of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.400 
though and they didn't call time out of
humor<00:00:34.079> yeah<00:00:34.530> well<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:36.050> try<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.079> play<00:00:37.260> with

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
humor yeah well I just try to play with

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.080

as<00:00:37.500> much<00:00:37.649> energy<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.129> emotion<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.730> can't<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
as much energy and emotion as I can't I

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.400 
as much energy and emotion as I can't I
let<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> all<00:00:39.450> hang<00:00:39.660> out<00:00:39.809> when<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:40.379> there

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
let it all hang out when I get out there

let it all hang out when I get out there
and<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:42.270> don't<00:00:42.450> really<00:00:42.540> try<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> hold<00:00:42.960> too

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
and and I don't really try to hold too

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.130 
and and I don't really try to hold too
much<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.500> well<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.340> getting<00:00:44.700> more<00:00:44.850> surreal

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.069 

I<00:00:49.250> mean<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:51.120> look<00:00:51.149> around<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.629> locker<00:00:51.809> room

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
I mean you look around the locker room

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.250 
I mean you look around the locker room
is<00:00:52.280> we<00:00:53.280> may<00:00:53.430> not<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:54.660> combined<00:00:54.989> salaries

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
is we may not the combined salaries

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.170 
is we may not the combined salaries
might<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:55.949> much<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.699> these<00:00:57.000> guys

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
might not be that much but these guys

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.790 
might not be that much but these guys

can play basketball I mean if you look
at<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> stat<00:00:59.730> sheet<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.210> mean<00:01:00.870> everybody

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
at the stat sheet I mean everybody

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.680 
at the stat sheet I mean everybody
across<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.340> board<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.120> way<00:01:03.270> they<00:01:03.449> play

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
across the board just the way they play

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.990

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
19-point games in limited minutes and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.480 
19-point games in limited minutes and
obviously<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.990> know<00:01:10.110> Tyson<00:01:10.560> Landry<00:01:10.979> chomping

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
obviously you know Tyson Landry chomping

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.190 
obviously you know Tyson Landry chomping
every<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> mean<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.780> whole<00:01:12.960> teens

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
every I mean it's just the whole teens

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.289 
every I mean it's just the whole teens
playing<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.310> much<00:01:14.460> chemistry<00:01:14.850> right<00:01:15.119> now

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
playing with so much chemistry right now

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.300 
playing with so much chemistry right now
I<00:01:15.509> think<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> important<00:01:16.890> thing<00:01:16.920> your

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
I think that's the important thing your

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.620 
I think that's the important thing your
teammates<00:01:17.640> keep<00:01:17.820> saying<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.210> chemistry<00:01:18.570> is

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
teammates keep saying that chemistry is

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.030 
teammates keep saying that chemistry is
because<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.080> today<00:01:19.350> said<00:01:19.619> you're<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> one

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
because of you today said you're the one

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.830 
because of you today said you're the one
getting<00:01:20.310> everybody<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.670> right<00:01:20.820> spots<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
getting everybody in the right spots and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.510 
getting everybody in the right spots and
everybody<00:01:22.170> all<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.189> use<00:01:23.310> either

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
everybody all then to use either

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
everybody all then to use either
chemistry<00:01:24.299> can't<00:01:24.540> only<00:01:24.750> come<00:01:25.020> from<00:01:25.170> one

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
chemistry can't only come from one

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.830 
chemistry can't only come from one
person<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.280> five-man<00:01:26.759> game<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.360> so

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
person it's just a five-man game and so

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.660 
person it's just a five-man game and so
you<00:01:27.900> know<00:01:28.049> there's<00:01:28.350> there's<00:01:28.979> obviously<00:01:29.430> five

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you know there's there's obviously five

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.780 
you know there's there's obviously five
people<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.210> are<00:01:30.329> involved<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
people that are involved so I think the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.429 
people that are involved so I think the
biggest<00:01:32.909> thing<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.450> we're<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.840> buying<00:01:34.170> in

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
biggest thing is we're just buying in

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.749 
biggest thing is we're just buying in
right<00:01:34.680> now<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.130> we're<00:01:35.310> getting<00:01:35.579> more

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
right now and we're getting more

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.580 
right now and we're getting more
comfortable<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.600> think<00:01:36.810> earlier<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.530> were

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
comfortable and I think earlier we were

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.899 
comfortable and I think earlier we were
making<00:01:37.890> strides<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.610> weren't<00:01:38.759> winning

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
making strides but we weren't winning

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.960 
making strides but we weren't winning
games<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.950> people<00:01:40.950> was<00:01:41.159> didn't<00:01:41.850> necessarily

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
games so people was didn't necessarily

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.740 
games so people was didn't necessarily
