00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.450
 Guard 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.450
 Fecapa needs to do 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.410
 sushi 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:17.820
 A typical Japanese snack is sushi 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:23.449
 The shop that eats this sushi is a sushi shop 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.449
 Most of the Japanese have a butt in front of this store 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:33.880
 This is the entrance of sushi left from three eyes in passing under a short curtain that this goodwill 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.300
 To the right of the cut diagonally to 48 degrees 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.090
 Place the back of your hand on the raised part 3.2 inches 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.940
 I will 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.520
 new If the store exceeds 30 minutes before the expected closing time, we still do 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.630
 It is doing Badr 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:58.210
 I'm still doing it I will not forget to say 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:01:01.930
 It's a two-person shop, but it represents the number of people. 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:06.100
 Similarly in the case of 3 people it is 3 people 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:12.940
 In the case of 4 people say it is 4 people 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:16.810
 However, in the case of one person , it is the point to show some apology with eyes 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.020
 It is best to use the counter when you come to a sushi shop 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:25.120
 But I can not afford to sit down 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.580
 Here to reverse next coming always ahead in Japan to respect the etiquette 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.900
 Sounds OK 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:36.310
 This is a word to check vacancies, not to everyone 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:40.870
 I is Japan's law and humanity style to call out to the customer 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:47.570
 If there was a vacant seat in the reverse is said Are you sure you want here 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:50.740
 Please feel free to say, Please check the number of seats on the counter for the first time 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.740
 Can be 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:03.750
 It is finally an order There is no waiter or waitress in the sushi shop 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:07.140
 Then the customer will order the desired menu directly to the master 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.430
 Main menu is the same at any sushi shop 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.510
 There is a large Toro in Toro large Toro in a typical menu 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.570
 This will damage the quality of tuna Daitoro is the finest 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.770
 It contains a lot of oil and is very delicious 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:28.120
 The rice called Shirley also uses the instructor of the finest brand light 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.870
 Toro, on the other hand, is junk food for low-income people 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:37.020
 Fish uses recycled products and does not use rice 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.020
 I have used fake rice chopped wheat and pasta 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.370
 beer 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.420
 Beer is self-service to but Could you unplug the popular drink is a menu war pour 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.430
 is 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:54.000
 It is manner in Japan to pour in each other in the case of two or more people 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.990
 If you are in a business relationship, the current person is the superior 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.440
 Ahead is an important determines the pouring Well Well that remains 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:06.330
 This is a word that you must say at that time 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:12.630
 It says the husband is when it is poured in the same way 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:15.100
 Maamaamamaotto and Well Maamama photos and Maamaamaamaa 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.710
 And her husband 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:24.400
 In the case of couples , women pour themselves into men and women pour themselves 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:30.930
 I see, it's a samurai country, sushi is 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:35.090
 With confidence because we use the ones that were disinfected, which will be issued and put into digit eaten sushi 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.840
 There are many people who wear this as it is and return 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.910
 It is for this reason that the smell of vinegar from the Japanese feet of 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.480
 Hatsu 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.480
 This is a hunt The material is a mystery 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.900
 I'm good at eating sushi first 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.560
 We will have 20 soy sauce called purple 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:03.360
 Next middle finger index finger thumb 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:07.290
 The other side of the sushi is put back in front of the snacks 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:12.800
 The amount of soy sauce sushi is not decided yet 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.800
 Let's soak in enough until the weight changes 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.630
 This is a guideline 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:31.260
 We raise chin 45 degrees in front and eat with one bite 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.470
 eat 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.750
 eat 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.410
 eat 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.410
 eat 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:50.340
 Wipe at hand of wet towel to hand in the marked with a rice and fish smell 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:56.699
 This is useful for various purposes called rags 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:59.380
 Cutting boards and floors are also blown with this cloth, and once used, they have not been for a while 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:05.560
 2 to cherish things like this 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:09.100
 This is the engineer who makes sushi . 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.970
 The customer must call the target 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:16.560
 The subject is usually something with a past that people can not say 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.560
 Let's not ask 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:27.960
 Bout represents the feelings of gratitude to the subject If you enjoyed sushi 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:32.889
 Whether the sushi served or not 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:37.419
 No, let's say that horse four place 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:40.960
 The restaurant manager also recommends the sushi restaurant as well as the restaurant 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:46.719
 This is something that is recommended 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:50.020
 Recommended also for the case of a menu that is not authorized by you laws that tell me Speaking 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:53.349
 Will not tell you if you do not listen to the menu 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:59.470
 I don't know anything I don't care 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:06:04.919
 Recommended recommendations for the possibility of those designated as International Protected Animals in the face of bad value awards 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.919
 It is the plan of the Japanese to enjoy and finish 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:14.960
 It is said that the post-meal tea service is up this ah 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:19.990
 Not also be accumulated one of the hunt in another stomach is full is hunting 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.990
 So Masu Tei represents the sense that please the tea 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:28.630
 Now it's an accounting Here we say hello 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:36.780
 Make punishment with the index finger of both hands 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:36.780
 This is the sign of your bill represents the meaning of whether to you of the store is needed anymore 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:48.470
 This way of wanting to account is because you insist that you are in a better position 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.100
 is 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:55.300
 I see you say that looks this 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.300
 It is a samurai country 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:03.530
 This is a mysterious god called a receipt 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:06.790
 If you write this, you can redeem it later 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.790
 The mechanism is a mystery 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:15.150
 I will come again, this is a greeting when I leave the store 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:18.410
 Because it means that it was delicious and satisfied 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.410
 Let's not be lazy 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:29.790
 There is plenty of use outside of the store for those who have not enough salty soy sauce 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.420
 Free service so eat freely 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:38.630
 This is the only space where you can talk in earnest 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.630
 This timing is better if you apologize 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.560
 How was it 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:53.920
