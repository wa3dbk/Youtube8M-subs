they made the small stuff out of lad and
as<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.330> got<00:02:30.420> bigger<00:02:30.480> they<00:02:30.930> made<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.170> out<00:02:31.290> of

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
as it got bigger they made it out of

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.780 
as it got bigger they made it out of
wood<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.710> it<00:02:31.770> wouldn't<00:02:31.980> be<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.190> heavy<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.700> you

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
wood so it wouldn't be so heavy and you

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.100 
wood so it wouldn't be so heavy and you
could<00:02:32.940> actually<00:02:33.060> move<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.630> around<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.990> deal

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
could actually move it around and deal

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.740 
could actually move it around and deal
with<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:35.580> these<00:02:35.760> are<00:02:35.940> all<00:02:36.060> fonts<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.540> wood

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
with it so these are all fonts of wood

00:02:36.750 --> 00:03:23.500 
with it so these are all fonts of wood
type

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.680 

slaves<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.870> process<00:03:25.410> that's<00:03:25.860> what<00:03:26.069> we<00:03:26.190> are<00:03:26.690> and

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
slaves to process that's what we are and

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.900 
slaves to process that's what we are and
like<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.290> say<00:03:28.440> early<00:03:28.680> there's<00:03:28.860> no<00:03:29.100> shortcut<00:03:29.670> to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
like I say early there's no shortcut to

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:39.890 
like I say early there's no shortcut to
producing<00:03:30.420> fine<00:03:30.690> work<00:03:37.640> precision<00:03:38.640> sauce<00:03:39.030> tool

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.520 
producing fine work precision sauce tool
you<00:03:40.080> have<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.290> have<00:03:41.810> everything<00:03:42.810> has<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.260> fit

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
you have to have everything has to fit

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.979 
you have to have everything has to fit
perfectly<00:03:44.070> in<00:03:44.489> our<00:03:44.610> line<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.120> work<00:03:45.150> here

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.250 

that's<00:03:48.989> what<00:03:49.230> makes<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.620> world<00:03:49.650> go<00:03:49.980> around

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
that's what makes the world go around

that's what makes the world go around
this<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.410> how<00:03:52.530> Ben<00:03:52.739> Franklin<00:03:53.190> printed<00:03:53.459> 200

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
this is how Ben Franklin printed 200

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.240 
this is how Ben Franklin printed 200
years<00:03:54.180> ago<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.239> is<00:03:57.300> how<00:03:58.250> Gutenberg

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
years ago and this is how Gutenberg

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.440 
years ago and this is how Gutenberg
invented<00:03:59.640> printing<00:04:00.000> it's<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.239> same

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
invented printing it's the same

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.970 
invented printing it's the same
technology<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.470> we<00:04:02.190> keep<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.550> going<00:04:02.970> here<00:04:03.980> we

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
technology so we keep that going here we

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.650 
technology so we keep that going here we
love<00:04:05.220> people<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.640> come<00:04:05.850> in<00:04:06.000> here<00:04:06.269> so<00:04:06.420> we<00:04:06.540> can

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
love people to come in here so we can

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.180 
love people to come in here so we can
demonstrate<00:04:06.840> how<00:04:07.320> we<00:04:07.380> made<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:08.130> think

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
demonstrate how we made it and I think

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.040 
demonstrate how we made it and I think
that<00:04:08.370> makes<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.910> even<00:04:09.060> more<00:04:09.209> impressive<00:04:09.570> once

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
that makes it even more impressive once

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.540 
that makes it even more impressive once
they<00:04:10.230> see<00:04:10.290> all<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.920> little<00:04:11.160> bits<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.489> pieces

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
they see all the little bits and pieces

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.090 
they see all the little bits and pieces
of<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.150> puzzle<00:04:12.510> that<00:04:12.660> go<00:04:12.780> together<00:04:12.930> I'll<00:04:13.920> just
