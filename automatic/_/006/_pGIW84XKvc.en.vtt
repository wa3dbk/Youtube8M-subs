00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.380
 good morning this erase in hand 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.540
 how long use per day to talk to 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.580
 talk half an hour a day you know 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.860
 that the threshold from which the risk starts 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.750
 more consistent than health is indeed 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.610
 yes or the sea earphone in the car 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.170
 specifically for this reason a sebha 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.040
 attached to the body when the dog turns 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.170
 in the tub I bid for health is 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.870
 a little surely worried no 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.770
 because I use it just a little and therefore 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.460
 because she doesn't care a little about it 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.320
 bad for your health 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.179
 because it hurts your health an hour a 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.789
 day together this is a bit of a pain 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:54.590
 and I imagine he uses some precautions 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:57.440
 no it is fatalistic on average 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.540
 at half an hour you know some say 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.239
 that hurts from half an hour upwards is a 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.420
 use at risk for radiation I do not know 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.310
 that turns in half an hour you do or never does 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.840
 feeling that warms your head a little 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.340
 ear with gentle phone like 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.619
 only for the heat no for the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.670
 I don't have those smartphones when 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.030
 messages and phone calls 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.979
 as little as possible because it hurts because 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.200
 my head overheats me 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.869
 very bad now it's comfortable it's so comfortable 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.670
 so why give it to you if you think 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.610
 what hurts hurts in the end 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.950
 a little all I have not heard or read as well 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.300
 on the internet but it is not that I have 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.369
 worried that much 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.080
 I am aware that it hurts so much it is 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.180
 true that they keep it in the bag but it is on 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.280
 chest but in the pocket 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.590
 I take it with me only if I go home 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.899
 sky almost always off so I don't 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.970
 annoyance use the fixed 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.850
 I know there are remedies to make it 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.550
 less harmful and that is to throw it in the first one 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.710
 sewer and attached the whole person 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.479
 the day eh yes because currently for 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.030
 as are the phones cimetti almost all 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.220
 your life therefore accordingly 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.670
 it is always advisable to carry it behind one of 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.310
 night of one off 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.230
 yes yes off ie those depends on 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.849
 young people maybe I forget though you are 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.680
 off I use the headset but not slow but 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.000
 according to me it should be used 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.010
 regular because these make 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.380
 home frequencies who really uses it for 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.480
 work that has been hours a day 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.970
 in my pocket, as she does, she is there as well 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.310
 near an important thing so if 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.380
 however, the region is not on the iphone 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.569
 I don't believe this to develop though 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.340
 one goes to see if one begins so much 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.470
 we are inundated with a dialect of manners 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.569
 that make antenna for all mater 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.260
 Vatican toasters broadcast radio 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.840
 Vatican use it know it 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.519
 but they pretend not to know it 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.910
 people pretend not to know why 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.820
 how I talked to her may be necessary 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.470
 by now the telephone booths in the 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.210
 they have taken it away 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.210
 I think it raises high you do a little 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.130
 too much alarmism about something does not create 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.740
 a crush from the point of 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.510
 opposing scientific view is not 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.630
 so 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.670
 so certain the room the question of 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.250
 negative effects of radio frequencies 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.660
 they're right now I'm talking to 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.300
 speaking you can hear the radio on 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.590
 mobile phone to always be on the phone is 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.690
 something that I never liked on the 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.910
 they give health they have said it all 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.550
 or the truth is a bit under track 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.870
 in the media on newspapers they hide below 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.750
 there is what hurts what he does 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.430
 well there probably aren't that 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.310
 if more information were available 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.440
 they would make even more conscious use 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.180
 the companies that produce sell 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.880
 mobile phones or telephony services 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.220
 according to her they are sufficiently 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.680
 transparent also for the risks to the 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.270
 health just what not not 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.150
 it is also never said because it would be a 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.370
 a deterrent, therefore, certainly not 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.380
 it is not the first thing as it is written 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.010
 on cigarettes that do a lot of harm 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.540
 to health 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.190
 in short, he would have written though 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.290
 cellular the new cienaga health 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.840
 it would be too much 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.010
 nobody but I don't think a market that 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.739
 it would affect this has 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.510
 surely he does not use the mobile phone ie 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.380
 however, the cell still smokes 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.510
 reason cellphone I didn't need was 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.180
 useless that it was useless I don't need it 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.460
 they use where they look for a time trial you can do 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.720
 except to say you can do without 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:39.070
 mobile phone to google phone 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.580
 sings but so need to be attached 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.580
 all alone go to a cell phone 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.580
 no
