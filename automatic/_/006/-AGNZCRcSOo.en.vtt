00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
 [Music] 

00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.669
 what happened to Juanito 6 people here 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.010
 with incredible terrible and sharp fairies 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:11.080
 news as you can see me on screen 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.990
 go asking for more concrete news of 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.160
 the new dragon ball movie z good 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:21.099
 we know two concrete facts and super 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.679
 expected at this time that I'm going to 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.230
 say if the cinema city site as we see 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:29.439
 here in the background a Japanese website ends 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.339
 of giving the duration of the 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.020
 movie of these supposedly 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.230
 disconfirmed since this is a site 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.030
 completely reliable web good the 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.310
 movie is supposed to last 120 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.830
 minutes which means it will last 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.960
 35 minutes more than the battle of the 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.250
 gods or good 15 minutes more than the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.870
 extended version of the battle of the 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.750
 gods that was not the one in most 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.550
 from the cinemas we could see good that's 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.650
 something very interesting since at least 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.500
 For my part, it turned out that the battle 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.050
 of the gods he was a little short but 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.140
 that we know we also know or we already knew 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.420
 what was this 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.510
 the golden week more or less when it was 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.710
 well we know then that on 25 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.550
 April is going to be premiering this 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.680
 japan film then from 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.450
 there we will be able to find surely 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.640
 on the internet although that is completely 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.860
 illegal so in children do not do it but 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.020
 we can also start calculating that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.400
 a few months after April 25 the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.710
 we will be able to see in cinemas of 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.000
 everyone I calculate that in the rest 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.740
 of the world is now going to be more 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.350
 prepared since the battle of the trade 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.250
 he was so successful that they are going to take into account 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.700
 this when bringing it to the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.590
 different countries sooner to the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.770
 movie that tentatively is titled 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.560
 worst wish of history you what 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.050
 they say this movie really charges 120 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.550
 minutes will premiere April 25 or all 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.960
 this website are cheating not the site 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.340
 web is completely reliable what 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.640
 may happen is that somehow 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.720
 have put some information a little 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.259
 random I do not think so 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.970
 the golden week that is not something that does not 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.590
 have to do with April 25 just 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.049
 as I already told you in other videos like this 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.980
 What more information do I hope to have soon? 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.170
 since we are very 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.090
 April for what would be a 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.860
 premiere on top of the cinematographic as well 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.060
 what people even if they continue here 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.530
 in my social networks that I also put 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.960
 a lot of information that is not seen in these 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.380
 videos about dragon ball the movie and 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.090
 46 others a pleasure to be here sending you 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.100

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.660
 little but good soon we will have more 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.660

 renewed section titled 6 answers the 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.260

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.450
 how do you guys ask and I 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.310
 I remember little science not having in 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.500
 account clear that one way that all 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.329
