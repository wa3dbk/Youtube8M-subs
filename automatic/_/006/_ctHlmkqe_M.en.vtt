smaller vortexes and lead them inside

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.760 
smaller vortexes and lead them inside
there<00:00:49.420> is<00:00:49.510> a<00:00:49.539> surprising<00:00:50.230> amount<00:00:50.350> of<00:00:50.649> variety

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
in the enemy types and you'll often be

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.020 
in the enemy types and you'll often be
forced<00:00:53.469> to<00:00:53.559> change<00:00:53.829> up<00:00:54.010> your<00:00:54.039> strategy<00:00:54.699> on<00:00:54.879> the

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
different game modes each mode is

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.380 
different game modes each mode is
basically<00:01:00.250> just<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.609> high<00:01:00.760> score<00:01:01.149> game

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
basically just a high score game

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.599 
basically just a high score game
surviving<00:01:02.140> as<00:01:02.260> long<00:01:02.440> as<00:01:02.559> you<00:01:02.679> can<00:01:02.890> racking<00:01:03.489> up

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609

the combos and points in classic mode

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.219 
the combos and points in classic mode
you<00:01:06.520> basically<00:01:06.970> just<00:01:07.119> do<00:01:07.479> what<00:01:07.630> I<00:01:07.659> described

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
you basically just do what I described

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.109 
you basically just do what I described
until<00:01:08.650> you<00:01:08.799> lose<00:01:09.009> all<00:01:09.220> of<00:01:09.310> your<00:01:09.400> lives<00:01:09.700> in

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
extreme mode the enemies start off much

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.429 
extreme mode the enemies start off much
stronger<00:01:13.299> and<00:01:13.450> come<00:01:13.630> at<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:13.869> faster<00:01:14.409> than

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
stronger and come at you faster than

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
pulse mode is where things got really

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.450 
pulse mode is where things got really
interesting<00:01:19.450> though<00:01:20.049> rather<00:01:20.799> than<00:01:21.070> create

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
interesting though rather than create

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.670 
interesting though rather than create
your<00:01:21.640> own<00:01:21.700> vortexes<00:01:22.540> you<00:01:22.990> have<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.259> collect

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
your own vortexes you have to collect

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.520 
your own vortexes you have to collect
these<00:01:23.979> pulsing<00:01:24.640> orbs<00:01:25.060> creating<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.930> vortex<00:01:26.079> the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
these pulsing orbs creating a vortex the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.280 
these pulsing orbs creating a vortex the
instant<00:01:27.009> you<00:01:27.070> touch<00:01:27.340> one<00:01:27.579> if<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.750> purple<00:01:29.110> ring

is falling inside the blue ring you'll

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.719 
is falling inside the blue ring you'll
get<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.509> small<00:01:31.810> vortex<00:01:32.259> but<00:01:32.829> if<00:01:32.950> it's<00:01:33.100> expanded

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
get a small vortex but if it's expanded

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.990 
get a small vortex but if it's expanded
to<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:33.970> rim<00:01:34.180> you'll<00:01:34.570> get<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.840> huge<00:01:35.320> one<00:01:35.560> any
