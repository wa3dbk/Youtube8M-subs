yeah<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:32.009> wait<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.120> think<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.809> an

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
yeah I wait I think there is an

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.119 
yeah I wait I think there is an
interesting<00:00:34.350> gambit<00:00:34.920> line<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.460> Bishop<00:00:35.850> c4

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
interesting gambit line with Bishop c4

94<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.250> castles<00:00:38.790> maybe<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.570> try<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:43.040> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
94 in castles maybe I can try that and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.869 
94 in castles maybe I can try that and
now<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> think<00:00:45.050> 95<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.559> move<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:47.309> Quincy

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.130 
now I think 95 is the move then Quincy
form<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:50.250> sum<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.660> think<00:00:51.870> quite

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
form the sum is is I think quite

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.389

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
simple check check and let's see I can

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.820 
simple check check and let's see I can
take<00:04:02.260> on<00:04:02.440> g2<00:04:02.830> I<00:04:03.100> mean<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.459> saw<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:03.940> but<00:04:04.209> I

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
take on g2 I mean I saw that but I

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.140 
take on g2 I mean I saw that but I
wonder<00:04:05.830> if<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:06.010> have<00:04:06.160> a<00:04:06.190> direct<00:04:06.670> made<00:04:07.000> or

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
wonder if I have a direct made or

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.009 
wonder if I have a direct made or
anything<00:04:07.620> probably<00:04:08.620> not<00:04:09.299> just<00:04:10.299> chat<00:04:10.780> just

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
anything probably not just chat just

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:21.170 
anything probably not just chat just
keep<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:14.620> just<00:04:15.100> a<00:04:15.250> piece<00:04:15.459> really

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:30.929 

check

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:30.939 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.510 

maybe<00:04:31.939> you<00:04:32.120> didn't<00:04:32.479> count<00:04:32.689> okay<00:04:33.520> sometimes

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
maybe you didn't count okay sometimes

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:47.860 
maybe you didn't count okay sometimes
you<00:04:34.969> just<00:04:35.030> forget<00:04:35.599> that<00:04:35.840> your<00:04:36.020> piece<00:04:36.289> down<00:04:46.870> it

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
you just forget that your piece down it

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.179 
you just forget that your piece down it
just<00:04:48.080> really<00:04:48.349> was<00:04:48.529> a<00:04:48.560> very<00:04:48.800> good<00:04:49.009> position

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:49.189 
just really was a very good position

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:55.300 
just really was a very good position
that<00:04:49.639> I<00:04:49.669> got<00:04:49.999> with<00:04:50.240> this<00:04:50.389> gambit<00:04:53.680> quite<00:04:54.680> quite

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
that I got with this gambit quite quite

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.409 
that I got with this gambit quite quite
amazing<00:04:55.900> maybe<00:04:56.900> it's<00:04:57.110> not<00:04:57.370> entirely

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
amazing maybe it's not entirely

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.350 
amazing maybe it's not entirely
sufficient<00:04:59.419> but<00:04:59.749> check<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.849> certainly<00:05:01.849> led<00:05:02.150> to

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
sufficient but check it certainly led to

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:23.519 
sufficient but check it certainly led to
good<00:05:02.629> play<00:05:02.960> in<00:05:03.110> this<00:05:03.229> game<00:05:05.199> check

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:23.529 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.579 

I<00:05:24.059> mean<00:05:25.059> I<00:05:25.119> have<00:05:25.239> one<00:05:25.539> minute<00:05:25.809> forty<00:05:26.289> four

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:26.589 
I mean I have one minute forty four

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:30.479 
I mean I have one minute forty four
think<00:05:27.069> I'll<00:05:27.219> manage<00:05:27.459> really<00:05:28.029> check<00:05:29.489> black

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:30.489 
think I'll manage really check black

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:35.249 
think I'll manage really check black
resigns<00:05:31.329> yeah<00:05:32.109> Kim<00:05:33.449> yeah<00:05:34.449> I<00:05:34.479> cannot<00:05:34.959> really

resigns yeah Kim yeah I cannot really
advise<00:05:35.709> on<00:05:36.039> the<00:05:36.069> theoretical<00:05:36.939> implications

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
advise on the theoretical implications

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.629 
advise on the theoretical implications
here<00:05:38.139> I<00:05:39.149> know<00:05:40.149> that<00:05:40.299> this<00:05:40.809> is<00:05:40.869> I<00:05:41.619> believe<00:05:42.009> too

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
here I know that this is I believe too

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.219 
here I know that this is I believe too
dangerous<00:05:43.239> it<00:05:44.069> feels<00:05:45.069> very<00:05:45.219> dangerous

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
dangerous it feels very dangerous

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.009 
dangerous it feels very dangerous
without<00:05:47.399> castling<00:05:48.399> him<00:05:48.609> so<00:05:48.999> this<00:05:49.449> is<00:05:49.629> this<00:05:49.809> is

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:50.019 
without castling him so this is this is

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:53.699 
without castling him so this is this is
probably<00:05:50.469> ok<00:05:50.919> but<00:05:51.659> well<00:05:52.659> don't<00:05:52.989> ask<00:05:53.229> me<00:05:53.469> what

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:53.709 
probably ok but well don't ask me what

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:56.579 
probably ok but well don't ask me what
is<00:05:53.769> the<00:05:54.159> right<00:05:54.339> way<00:05:54.969> here<00:05:55.359> to<00:05:55.899> play<00:05:56.139> I<00:05:56.379> don't

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:56.589 
is the right way here to play I don't

00:05:56.589 --> 00:06:00.029 
is the right way here to play I don't
know<00:05:56.739> I<00:05:57.479> really<00:05:58.479> don't<00:05:58.629> know<00:05:58.869> i<00:05:59.259> mean<00:05:59.439> i'm

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
know I really don't know i mean i'm

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.689 
know I really don't know i mean i'm
pretty<00:06:00.099> sure<00:06:00.489> that<00:06:01.619> the<00:06:02.619> way<00:06:02.799> it<00:06:02.979> was<00:06:03.219> I<00:06:03.489> was

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
pretty sure that the way it was I was

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.619 
pretty sure that the way it was I was
played<00:06:04.059> in<00:06:04.269> the<00:06:04.449> game<00:06:05.459> like<00:06:06.459> that<00:06:06.789> this<00:06:07.149> should

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:07.629 
played in the game like that this should

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:09.629 
played in the game like that this should
be<00:06:07.659> quite<00:06:08.169> good<00:06:08.469> company<00:06:08.859> quite<00:06:09.609> good

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629 
compensation how is he going to to

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:19.439 
compensation how is he going to to
untangle<00:06:17.259> himself<00:06:17.729> the<00:06:18.729> computer<00:06:19.269> here

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 
untangle himself the computer here

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:21.659 
untangle himself the computer here
suggests<00:06:19.899> king<00:06:20.199> of<00:06:20.349> a<00:06:20.559> diaz<00:06:20.859> it<00:06:21.099> makes<00:06:21.279> lots<00:06:21.519> of

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
suggests king of a diaz it makes lots of

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:26.489 
suggests king of a diaz it makes lots of
sense<00:06:21.729> actually<00:06:23.879> try<00:06:24.879> to<00:06:24.989> not<00:06:25.989> weaken

00:06:26.489 --> 00:06:26.499 
sense actually try to not weaken

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:29.669 
sense actually try to not weaken
yourself<00:06:26.619> anymore<00:06:27.629> and<00:06:28.629> this<00:06:29.199> is<00:06:29.379> how<00:06:29.619> the

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:29.679 
yourself anymore and this is how the

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:31.439 
yourself anymore and this is how the
computer<00:06:30.219> already<00:06:30.369> gives<00:06:30.759> a<00:06:30.849> wider<00:06:31.059> winning

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
computer already gives a wider winning

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.100 
computer already gives a wider winning
advantage<00:06:32.669> yeah<00:06:33.669> I<00:06:33.939> mean<00:06:34.299> it<00:06:34.479> looks<00:06:34.689> it<00:06:35.079> looks

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
advantage yeah I mean it looks it looks

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.729 
advantage yeah I mean it looks it looks
very<00:06:35.409> very<00:06:35.829> dangerous<00:06:36.069> I<00:06:37.079> thought<00:06:38.079> you<00:06:38.409> should

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:38.739 
very very dangerous I thought you should

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:41.519 
very very dangerous I thought you should
take<00:06:38.979> and<00:06:39.219> play<00:06:39.489> in<00:06:39.699> five<00:06:40.199> yeah<00:06:41.199> this<00:06:41.379> is

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:41.529 
take and play in five yeah this is

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:45.809 
take and play in five yeah this is
indeed<00:06:41.829> still<00:06:42.249> playable<00:06:44.129> so<00:06:45.129> probably<00:06:45.519> this

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:45.819 
indeed still playable so probably this

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.929 
indeed still playable so probably this
this<00:06:46.209> idea<00:06:46.599> Bishop<00:06:46.959> g7<00:06:47.139> wasn't<00:06:47.769> right<00:06:47.949> yeah

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:48.939 
this idea Bishop g7 wasn't right yeah

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:50.549 
this idea Bishop g7 wasn't right yeah
the<00:06:49.209> thing<00:06:49.389> is<00:06:49.419> he<00:06:49.689> cannot<00:06:50.019> do<00:06:50.229> anything

00:06:50.549 --> 00:06:50.559 
the thing is he cannot do anything

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:52.739 
the thing is he cannot do anything
anyway<00:06:51.039> so<00:06:51.099> I<00:06:51.309> can<00:06:51.579> probably<00:06:51.879> just<00:06:52.269> improve<00:06:52.719> a

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:52.749 
anyway so I can probably just improve a

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:56.519 
anyway so I can probably just improve a
bit<00:06:53.489> maybe<00:06:54.489> something<00:06:55.239> like<00:06:55.419> that<00:06:55.659> Black<00:06:56.349> has

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:56.529 
bit maybe something like that Black has

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:03.239 
bit maybe something like that Black has
no<00:06:57.129> way<00:06:57.309> to<00:06:57.569> get<00:06:58.569> out<00:06:58.599> of<00:06:58.899> this<00:07:00.989> and<00:07:02.129> after<00:07:03.129> you

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:03.249 
no way to get out of this and after you

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:06.439 
no way to get out of this and after you
went<00:07:03.399> b5<00:07:03.909> it's<00:07:04.149> probably<00:07:04.599> a<00:07:04.719> probably<00:07:05.349> gone

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:06.449 
went b5 it's probably a probably gone

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:10.939 
went b5 it's probably a probably gone
yeah<00:07:07.449> but<00:07:07.689> should<00:07:07.839> be<00:07:07.869> success<00:07:08.349> winning<00:07:09.089> this

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
yeah but should be success winning this

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:17.249 
yeah but should be success winning this
this<00:07:11.949> is<00:07:12.099> too<00:07:12.309> much<00:07:13.019> ok<00:07:14.019> thanks<00:07:14.769> for<00:07:14.889> watching
