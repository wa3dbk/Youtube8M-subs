to<00:03:12.269> be<00:03:12.390> tougher<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.870> all<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.140> but<00:03:13.290> come<00:03:13.560> on<00:03:13.739> a

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
to be tougher and all that but come on a

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.380 
to be tougher and all that but come on a
load<00:03:14.069> of<00:03:14.099> buckshot<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.880> chest<00:03:15.180> you've

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
load of buckshot to the chest you've

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.569 
load of buckshot to the chest you've
pretty<00:03:15.599> much<00:03:15.690> put<00:03:16.019> an<00:03:16.110> end<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.380> things<00:03:16.579> half

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
pretty much put an end to things half

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.830 
pretty much put an end to things half
the<00:03:17.730> time<00:03:17.880> enough<00:03:18.120> there's<00:03:18.329> guys<00:03:18.510> off<00:03:18.720> their

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
the time enough there's guys off their

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.449 
the time enough there's guys off their
feet<00:03:19.019> with<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.230> sniper<00:03:19.560> round<00:03:19.829> of<00:03:20.010> shotgun

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
feet with a sniper round of shotgun

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.130 
feet with a sniper round of shotgun
thinking<00:03:20.819> you've<00:03:20.940> finished<00:03:21.239> them<00:03:21.360> off<00:03:21.510> but

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
thinking you've finished them off but

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.330 
thinking you've finished them off but
they<00:03:22.200> just<00:03:22.410> end<00:03:22.590> up<00:03:22.650> getting<00:03:22.829> back<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.190> their

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
they just end up getting back to their

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.190 
they just end up getting back to their
feet<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.549> few<00:03:23.849> seconds<00:03:24.209> later<00:03:24.360> doing<00:03:24.930> running

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
feet a few seconds later doing running

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.960 
feet a few seconds later doing running
back<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.440> firing<00:03:25.680> at<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:26.010> as<00:03:26.190> if<00:03:26.220> it's<00:03:26.519> nothing

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
back to firing at you as if it's nothing

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.819 
back to firing at you as if it's nothing
but<00:03:27.840> then<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.019> guess<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.349> is<00:03:28.470> probably<00:03:28.590> the

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
but then I guess this is probably the

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:29.960 
but then I guess this is probably the
only<00:03:28.860> sensible<00:03:29.430> way<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.760> could<00:03:29.879> have

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
only sensible way that could have

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.350 
only sensible way that could have
increased<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.360> difficulty<00:03:30.690> in<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.049> campaign

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
increased the difficulty in the campaign

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.550 
increased the difficulty in the campaign
also<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.510> should<00:03:33.720> mention<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.379> last

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
also I should mention that in the last

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.259 
also I should mention that in the last
few<00:03:34.769> levels<00:03:35.040> there's<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.310> huge<00:03:35.730> difficulty

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
few levels there's a huge difficulty

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.580 
few levels there's a huge difficulty
spike<00:03:36.569> and<00:03:36.750> you're<00:03:36.870> probably<00:03:37.110> gonna<00:03:37.290> get<00:03:37.440> your

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
spike and you're probably gonna get your

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.830 
spike and you're probably gonna get your
ass<00:03:37.709> handed<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.129> you<00:03:38.220> more<00:03:38.489> than<00:03:38.519> once<00:03:38.840> but

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
ass handed to you more than once but

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.880 
ass handed to you more than once but
overall<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.290> don't<00:03:40.349> really<00:03:40.650> have<00:03:40.769> an<00:03:40.860> issue

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
overall I don't really have an issue

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.259 
overall I don't really have an issue
with<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.190> shooting<00:03:41.519> for<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.670> most<00:03:41.849> part<00:03:42.120> in

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
with the shooting for the most part in

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.819 
with the shooting for the most part in
fact<00:03:42.510> it's<00:03:42.660> actually<00:03:42.780> kind<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.350> easy<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.650> come

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
fact it's actually kind of easy to come

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.259 
fact it's actually kind of easy to come
to<00:03:43.950> grips<00:03:44.100> with<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.549> I<00:03:44.609> got<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.880> hang<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.180> it

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
to grips with and I got the hang of it

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.539 
to grips with and I got the hang of it
pretty<00:03:45.510> early<00:03:45.780> in<00:03:46.079> when<00:03:46.889> firing<00:03:47.280> from<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.430> hip

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
pretty early in when firing from the hip

pretty early in when firing from the hip
your<00:03:47.880> shot<00:03:48.180> aren't<00:03:48.480> entirely<00:03:48.810> accurate<00:03:49.109> that

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
your shot aren't entirely accurate that

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.900 
your shot aren't entirely accurate that

you can bring a crosshair up with the

you can bring a crosshair up with the

press of the left trigger allowing you

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.500 
press of the left trigger allowing you
to<00:03:52.889> be<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.010> bit<00:03:53.220> more<00:03:53.370> precise<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:54.120> go<00:03:54.269> for<00:03:54.420> that

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
to be a bit more precise and go for that

to be a bit more precise and go for that
much-needed<00:03:54.959> head<00:03:55.200> shot

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
much-needed head shot

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.500 
much-needed head shot
you<00:03:56.160> can't<00:03:56.459> however<00:03:56.819> strike<00:03:57.150> when<00:03:57.329> you're<00:03:57.450> in

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
you can't however strike when you're in

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.940 
you can't however strike when you're in
this<00:03:57.599> aiming<00:03:57.930> mode<00:03:58.049> making<00:03:58.319> you<00:03:58.500> something<00:03:58.859> of

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
this aiming mode making you something of

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.089 
this aiming mode making you something of
a<00:03:59.010> sitting<00:03:59.310> duck

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
a sitting duck

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.170 
a sitting duck
now<00:04:02.099> this<00:04:02.250> can<00:04:02.400> make<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.670> shooting<00:04:02.880> seem

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
now this can make the shooting seem

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.120 
now this can make the shooting seem
somewhat<00:04:03.569> slower<00:04:03.870> than<00:04:04.139> other<00:04:04.319> games<00:04:04.530> coupled

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
somewhat slower than other games coupled

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.500 
somewhat slower than other games coupled
with<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.310> fact<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.700> Jimmy<00:04:05.940> reloads<00:04:06.329> and

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
with the fact that Jimmy reloads and

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.050 
with the fact that Jimmy reloads and
swaps<00:04:06.870> weapons<00:04:07.260> out<00:04:07.410> like<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.590> senior<00:04:08.010> citizen

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
swaps weapons out like a senior citizen

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.159 
swaps weapons out like a senior citizen
but<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.150> is<00:04:09.269> keeping<00:04:09.480> in<00:04:09.720> touch<00:04:09.870> with<00:04:09.930> the

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
but it is keeping in touch with the

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.199 
but it is keeping in touch with the
game's<00:04:10.349> realistic<00:04:10.919> feel<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.489> thankfully

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
game's realistic feel and thankfully

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.759 
game's realistic feel and thankfully
this<00:04:12.329> mechanic<00:04:12.810> also<00:04:13.019> applies<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.680> the

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
this mechanic also applies to the

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.140 
this mechanic also applies to the
enemies<00:04:14.069> so<00:04:14.220> at<00:04:14.340> least<00:04:14.459> it's<00:04:14.730> somewhat

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
enemies so at least it's somewhat

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.029 
enemies so at least it's somewhat
balanced<00:04:15.599> it's<00:04:16.410> not<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.590> time<00:04:16.739> again<00:04:16.950> we're

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
balanced it's not the time again we're

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.199 
balanced it's not the time again we're
gonna<00:04:17.130> be<00:04:17.280> bunny<00:04:17.519> hopping<00:04:17.729> around<00:04:17.940> and

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
gonna be bunny hopping around and

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.210 
gonna be bunny hopping around and
spraying<00:04:18.510> your<00:04:18.660> mp40<00:04:19.289> like<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.470> madman<00:04:19.979> let<00:04:20.160> me

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
spraying your mp40 like a madman let me

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.719 
spraying your mp40 like a madman let me
put<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.459> that<00:04:20.489> way<00:04:21.889> now<00:04:22.889> I<00:04:22.919> said<00:04:23.310> earlier<00:04:23.460> that

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
put it that way now I said earlier that

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.159 
put it that way now I said earlier that
it<00:04:23.849> has<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:23.970> great<00:04:24.180> variety<00:04:24.690> in<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.870> missions

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
it has a great variety in the missions

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.050 
it has a great variety in the missions
which<00:04:25.349> is<00:04:25.530> true<00:04:25.860> though<00:04:26.400> this<00:04:26.550> doesn't<00:04:26.940> mean

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
which is true though this doesn't mean

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.370 
which is true though this doesn't mean
that<00:04:27.180> every<00:04:27.389> mission<00:04:27.660> is<00:04:27.750> perfect<00:04:28.229> in<00:04:28.349> fact

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
that every mission is perfect in fact

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.810 
that every mission is perfect in fact
the<00:04:28.650> quality<00:04:29.010> kind<00:04:29.220> of<00:04:29.280> goes<00:04:29.430> back<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.789> forth

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
the quality kind of goes back and forth

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.210 
the quality kind of goes back and forth
constantly<00:04:30.539> I<00:04:30.750> find<00:04:31.740> that<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:31.950> missions

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
constantly I find that the missions

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
constantly I find that the missions
where<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.400> do<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.580> little<00:04:32.700> more<00:04:32.820> than<00:04:32.880> search

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
where you do a little more than search

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.909 
where you do a little more than search
and<00:04:33.450> destroy<00:04:33.570> are<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.110> weakest<00:04:34.470> in<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.620> game

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
and destroy are the weakest in the game

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.860 
and destroy are the weakest in the game
they<00:04:35.430> just<00:04:35.639> built<00:04:35.849> the<00:04:36.000> most<00:04:36.180> derivative<00:04:36.750> and

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
they just built the most derivative and

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.879 
they just built the most derivative and
it's<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.110> kind<00:04:37.349> of<00:04:37.410> thing<00:04:37.530> you've<00:04:37.680> seen<00:04:37.830> a

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
hundred times before you know the time

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.719 
hundred times before you know the time

for<00:04:48.270> its<00:04:48.330> time<00:04:48.659> and<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.900> hasn't<00:04:49.110> entirely<00:04:49.620> aged

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.710 

missions<00:04:53.910> where<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.120> get<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.300> do<00:04:54.390> stuff<00:04:54.630> like

creative<00:04:57.780> is<00:04:58.440> where<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.710> game<00:04:58.890> still<00:04:59.220> holds

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
creative is where the game still holds

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.640 
creative is where the game still holds
up<00:04:59.700> like<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.840> one<00:05:00.990> where<00:05:01.140> you've<00:05:01.260> taken<00:05:01.440> out

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
up like the one where you've taken out

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.620 
up like the one where you've taken out
Nazis<00:05:02.100> in<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.310> moving<00:05:02.610> train<00:05:02.880> as<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.240> hunt<00:05:03.510> down

like<00:05:11.850> this<00:05:12.030> it<00:05:12.210> would<00:05:12.360> have<00:05:12.450> been<00:05:12.600> much<00:05:12.810> better

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
like this it would have been much better

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.230 
like this it would have been much better
off<00:05:13.200> but<00:05:13.500> these<00:05:13.650> kind<00:05:13.950> of<00:05:14.100> generic<00:05:14.490> half-assed

off but these kind of generic half-assed
levels<00:05:15.720> are<00:05:16.080> what<00:05:16.200> really<00:05:16.530> drags<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.980> game

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
levels are what really drags the game

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.490 
levels are what really drags the game
down<00:05:17.460> it's<00:05:18.270> not<00:05:18.480> that<00:05:18.630> they're<00:05:18.780> bad<00:05:18.810> but<00:05:19.380> it's

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
down it's not that they're bad but it's

down it's not that they're bad but it's
just<00:05:19.560> that<00:05:19.830> you've<00:05:19.950> seen<00:05:20.220> it<00:05:20.400> all<00:05:20.550> before<00:05:20.760> and

just that you've seen it all before and
it's<00:05:21.390> mediocrity<00:05:22.080> seems<00:05:22.320> even<00:05:22.710> more

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
it's mediocrity seems even more
