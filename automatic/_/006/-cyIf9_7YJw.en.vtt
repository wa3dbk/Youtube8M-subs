booth with Mike Center aqui Mike you've
got<00:00:09.880> the<00:00:10.000> hot<00:00:10.180> new<00:00:10.210> dx3<00:00:10.750> are<00:00:11.080> in<00:00:11.230> your<00:00:11.350> hands

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.710 
got the hot new dx3 are in your hands

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.959 
got the hot new dx3 are in your hands
what<00:00:12.100> can<00:00:12.250> you<00:00:12.340> tell<00:00:12.490> me<00:00:12.550> about<00:00:12.700> this<00:00:12.910> new

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
what can you tell me about this new

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.820 
what can you tell me about this new
radio<00:00:13.389> system<00:00:13.690> I<00:00:13.750> hear<00:00:13.959> it<00:00:14.049> uses<00:00:14.320> dsm2

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
radio system I hear it uses dsm2

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.800 
radio system I hear it uses dsm2
technology<00:00:15.639> what<00:00:16.209> does<00:00:16.360> that<00:00:16.390> mean<00:00:16.660> to<00:00:16.690> the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
technology what does that mean to the

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.930 
technology what does that mean to the
end<00:00:16.990> racer<00:00:17.380> well<00:00:17.619> basically<00:00:17.920> the<00:00:18.369> dsm<00:00:18.789> to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
end racer well basically the dsm to

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.450 
end racer well basically the dsm to
technology<00:00:19.539> is<00:00:19.660> the<00:00:19.810> new<00:00:19.930> protocol<00:00:20.460> that

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
technology is the new protocol that

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.160 
technology is the new protocol that
basically<00:00:21.849> gives<00:00:22.119> us<00:00:22.359> the<00:00:22.570> the<00:00:22.810> faster

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
basically gives us the the faster

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.390 
basically gives us the the faster
response<00:00:23.560> rate<00:00:23.769> that<00:00:23.920> everyone's<00:00:24.250> been

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
response rate that everyone's been

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.189 
response rate that everyone's been
looking<00:00:24.429> for<00:00:24.849> it<00:00:25.539> kind<00:00:25.779> of<00:00:25.840> gives<00:00:25.900> you<00:00:26.080> that

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
looking for it kind of gives you that

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.290 
looking for it kind of gives you that
consistent<00:00:26.769> edge<00:00:26.890> around<00:00:27.189> the<00:00:27.369> track<00:00:27.640> keep

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
consistent edge around the track keep

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.779 
consistent edge around the track keep
that<00:00:28.509> line<00:00:28.720> going<00:00:29.140> and<00:00:29.710> basically<00:00:30.400> just<00:00:30.669> the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
that line going and basically just the

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.780 
that line going and basically just the
frame<00:00:31.269> rate<00:00:31.480> and<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:32.140> latency<00:00:32.560> has<00:00:32.650> been<00:00:32.860> been

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
frame rate and the latency has been been

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.060 
frame rate and the latency has been been
improved<00:00:34.150> and<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:35.590> we<00:00:35.650> have<00:00:35.770> like<00:00:36.040> a

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
improved and now we have like a

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.220 
improved and now we have like a
basically<00:00:36.910> a<00:00:37.000> pro<00:00:37.210> class<00:00:37.420> level<00:00:37.719> radio<00:00:37.960> going

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
basically a pro class level radio going

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.529 
basically a pro class level radio going
now<00:00:38.890> with<00:00:39.190> this<00:00:39.460> was<00:00:39.789> one<00:00:40.210> of<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.360> first

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
now with this was one of the first

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:41.940 
now with this was one of the first
things<00:00:40.600> I<00:00:40.780> noticed<00:00:40.809> when<00:00:41.140> I<00:00:41.200> held<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.649> radio

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
things I noticed when I held the radio

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.680 
things I noticed when I held the radio
was<00:00:42.160> how<00:00:42.309> light<00:00:42.579> it<00:00:42.730> was<00:00:42.879> was<00:00:43.239> that<00:00:43.270> one<00:00:43.539> of<00:00:43.629> the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
was how light it was was that one of the

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.930 
was how light it was was that one of the
major<00:00:43.870> goals<00:00:44.260> going<00:00:44.860> forward<00:00:45.309> starting<00:00:45.730> with

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
major goals going forward starting with

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.400 
major goals going forward starting with
this<00:00:46.030> project<00:00:46.270> or<00:00:46.660> what<00:00:46.809> were<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.289> major

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
this project or what were the major

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.540 
this project or what were the major
goals<00:00:47.710> that<00:00:47.860> you<00:00:47.949> guys<00:00:48.100> were<00:00:48.219> looking<00:00:48.370> to

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
goals that you guys were looking to

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.459 
goals that you guys were looking to
accomplish<00:00:48.789> with<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.270> DX<00:00:49.539> 3r<00:00:49.870> well<00:00:50.170> with<00:00:50.379> the

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
accomplish with the DX 3r well with the

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.439 
accomplish with the DX 3r well with the
dsm<00:00:50.890> to<00:00:51.070> it<00:00:51.280> actually<00:00:51.460> is<00:00:51.730> more<00:00:51.910> efficient<00:00:52.329> so

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
dsm to it actually is more efficient so

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.450 
dsm to it actually is more efficient so
it<00:00:52.570> doesn't<00:00:52.840> use<00:00:52.960> as<00:00:53.109> much<00:00:53.230> voltage<00:00:53.469> so<00:00:53.890> we

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
it doesn't use as much voltage so we

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.549 
it doesn't use as much voltage so we
reduce<00:00:54.760> the<00:00:54.789> amount<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.300> battery<00:00:56.170> that<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.440> has

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
reduce the amount of battery that it has

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.110 
reduce the amount of battery that it has
in<00:00:56.739> there<00:00:56.890> so<00:00:57.010> it's<00:00:57.160> got<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.309> lighter<00:00:57.550> feel<00:00:57.850> and

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
in there so it's got a lighter feel and

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.090 
in there so it's got a lighter feel and
we're<00:00:59.019> noticing<00:00:59.260> that<00:00:59.440> racers<00:00:59.739> really<00:00:59.949> like

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
we're noticing that racers really like

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.950 
we're noticing that racers really like
that<00:01:00.309> on<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.519> long<00:01:00.699> manes<00:01:01.000> and<00:01:01.300> those<00:01:01.690> long

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
that on the long manes and those long

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.840 
that on the long manes and those long
races<00:01:02.260> that<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:03.070> radio<00:01:03.370> is<00:01:03.460> not<00:01:03.579> getting

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
races that the radio is not getting

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.100 
races that the radio is not getting
heavy<00:01:04.030> it's<00:01:04.210> real<00:01:04.390> light<00:01:04.540> it's<00:01:04.750> almost<00:01:04.960> like

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
heavy it's real light it's almost like

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.750 
heavy it's real light it's almost like
an<00:01:05.230> extension<00:01:05.560> of<00:01:05.740> your<00:01:05.830> hands<00:01:06.190> you<00:01:06.550> have<00:01:06.670> to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
an extension of your hands you have to

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.609 
an extension of your hands you have to
worry<00:01:06.940> about<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.300> weight<00:01:07.420> so<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:08.140> helps<00:01:08.530> out

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
worry about the weight so that helps out

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.740 
worry about the weight so that helps out
a<00:01:08.650> lot<00:01:08.770> now<00:01:09.340> with<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.549> dsm<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.180> technology

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
a lot now with the dsm to technology

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.700 
a lot now with the dsm to technology
does<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:11.020> mean<00:01:11.170> someone's<00:01:11.470> going<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.619> have

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
does that mean someone's going to have

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.410 
does that mean someone's going to have
to<00:01:11.830> replace<00:01:12.130> all<00:01:12.430> their<00:01:12.640> existing<00:01:13.000> receivers

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
to replace all their existing receivers

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.179 
to replace all their existing receivers
if<00:01:13.540> they<00:01:13.659> already<00:01:13.930> have<00:01:14.170> either<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.710> module

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
if they already have either a module

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.280 
if they already have either a module
system<00:01:15.400> or<00:01:15.670> a<00:01:15.700> DX<00:01:16.060> 2<00:01:16.270> or<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.450> DX<00:01:16.810> 3<00:01:16.990> great

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
system or a DX 2 or a DX 3 great

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.050 
system or a DX 2 or a DX 3 great
question<00:01:17.710> actually<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.280> good<00:01:18.520> news<00:01:18.700> is<00:01:18.909> is

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
question actually the good news is is

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.819 
question actually the good news is is
that<00:01:19.090> if<00:01:19.330> you<00:01:19.420> don't<00:01:19.570> have<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.840> dsm<00:01:20.320> 2<00:01:20.470> receiver

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
that if you don't have a dsm 2 receiver

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.190 
that if you don't have a dsm 2 receiver
and<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.369> got<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.549> bunch<00:01:21.759> of<00:01:21.909> existing<00:01:22.780> dsm

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
and you got a bunch of existing dsm

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.109 
and you got a bunch of existing dsm
standard<00:01:24.100> receivers<00:01:24.369> this<00:01:24.640> will<00:01:24.790> work<00:01:24.880> with

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
standard receivers this will work with

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.160 
standard receivers this will work with
it<00:01:25.240> what<00:01:25.360> will<00:01:25.450> happen<00:01:25.689> is<00:01:25.780> when<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:25.960> go<00:01:26.049> into

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
it what will happen is when you go into

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.140 
it what will happen is when you go into
bind<00:01:26.470> mode<00:01:26.650> it's<00:01:27.070> going<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.310> look<00:01:27.460> for<00:01:27.640> dsm<00:01:28.000> too

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
bind mode it's going to look for dsm too

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.940 
bind mode it's going to look for dsm too
and<00:01:28.299> if<00:01:28.360> it<00:01:28.479> doesn't<00:01:28.720> find<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:29.079> it'll<00:01:29.590> default

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
and if it doesn't find it it'll default

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.710 
and if it doesn't find it it'll default
back<00:01:30.130> down<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.460> regular<00:01:30.790> dsm<00:01:31.210> so<00:01:31.390> all<00:01:31.570> the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
back down to the regular dsm so all the

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.450 
back down to the regular dsm so all the
receivers<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.200> already<00:01:32.409> have<00:01:32.560> good<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.340> go

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
receivers you already have good to go

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.639 
receivers you already have good to go
now<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.360> can<00:01:34.509> also<00:01:34.659> adjust<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.049> frame<00:01:35.380> rate

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
now you can also adjust the frame rate

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.620 
now you can also adjust the frame rate
on<00:01:35.860> this<00:01:36.009> radio<00:01:36.280> as<00:01:36.520> well<00:01:36.549> what<00:01:37.030> will<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.270> do

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
on this radio as well what will that do

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.569 
on this radio as well what will that do
for<00:01:37.840> racers<00:01:38.170> well<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:38.770> just<00:01:38.829> depends<00:01:39.369> on<00:01:39.460> what

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
for racers well it just depends on what

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:40.800 
for racers well it just depends on what
you're<00:01:39.759> looking<00:01:40.030> for<00:01:40.210> monster<00:01:40.540> trucks

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
you're looking for monster trucks

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.539 
you're looking for monster trucks
obviously<00:01:41.350> there's<00:01:41.530> not<00:01:41.710> as<00:01:41.890> much<00:01:42.070> accuracy

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
obviously there's not as much accuracy

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.010 
obviously there's not as much accuracy
there<00:01:42.820> that's<00:01:43.030> needed<00:01:43.299> but<00:01:43.689> some<00:01:43.869> of<00:01:43.960> these

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
there that's needed but some of these

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.830 
there that's needed but some of these
carpet<00:01:44.439> racers<00:01:44.740> are<00:01:44.920> on<00:01:45.430> road<00:01:45.670> cars<00:01:46.119> having

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
carpet racers are on road cars having

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.330 
carpet racers are on road cars having
that<00:01:46.960> latency<00:01:47.259> in<00:01:47.469> that<00:01:47.619> fine<00:01:47.829> line<00:01:47.860> is<00:01:48.189> real

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
that latency in that fine line is real

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.859 
that latency in that fine line is real
important<00:01:48.759> so<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:48.909> can<00:01:49.060> actually<00:01:49.210> increase

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
important so you can actually increase

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.690 
important so you can actually increase
or<00:01:50.110> decrease<00:01:50.229> that<00:01:50.649> depending<00:01:51.490> on<00:01:51.579> what

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
or decrease that depending on what

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.520 
or decrease that depending on what
you're<00:01:51.820> driving<00:01:51.969> now<00:01:52.719> how<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.290> radar

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
you're driving now how is the radar

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.719 
you're driving now how is the radar
going<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.710> come<00:01:53.920> bundled<00:01:54.219> is<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:54.549> going<00:01:54.670> to

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
going to come bundled is it going to

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.190 
going to come bundled is it going to
have<00:01:54.880> multiple<00:01:55.149> receivers<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:56.049> coming

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
have multiple receivers is it coming

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.929 
have multiple receivers is it coming
with<00:01:56.380> servos<00:01:56.799> how<00:01:57.040> exactly<00:01:57.399> we<00:01:57.579> rate<00:01:57.850> should

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
with servos how exactly we rate should

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.190 
with servos how exactly we rate should
be<00:01:58.030> able<00:01:58.149> to<00:01:58.299> get<00:01:58.390> that's<00:01:58.570> this<00:01:58.780> point<00:01:59.049> we're

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
be able to get that's this point we're

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.330 
be able to get that's this point we're
just<00:01:59.229> going<00:01:59.469> to<00:01:59.530> offer<00:01:59.649> it<00:01:59.770> with<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.009> receiver

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
just going to offer it with the receiver

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.160 
just going to offer it with the receiver
and<00:02:00.460> as<00:02:00.909> far<00:02:01.060> as<00:02:01.119> servos<00:02:01.509> are<00:02:01.659> concerned<00:02:01.990> it's

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
and as far as servos are concerned it's

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.749 
and as far as servos are concerned it's
just<00:02:02.409> up<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.649> racer<00:02:03.009> there's<00:02:03.460> so<00:02:03.640> many

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
just up to the racer there's so many

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.580 
just up to the racer there's so many
options<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.360> can<00:02:04.509> have<00:02:04.719> with<00:02:05.020> this<00:02:05.200> radio

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
options you can have with this radio

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.410 
options you can have with this radio
that<00:02:06.130> it's<00:02:06.399> probably<00:02:06.759> best<00:02:06.969> just<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.329> you

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
that it's probably best just that you

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.670 
that it's probably best just that you
get<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.630> receiver<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.020> transmitter<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.619> go

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
get the receiver and transmitter and go

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.090 
get the receiver and transmitter and go
with<00:02:08.770> what<00:02:08.920> you

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100
