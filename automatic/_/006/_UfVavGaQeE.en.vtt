00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.700
 changed 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.310
 proud 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.620
 this state 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.620
 [Music] 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.710
 not everyone 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.650
 My name is Alberto Asia and I am 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.930
 researcher here at the veracruz campus 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.480
 in the area of ​​aquaculture and systems 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.910
 agricultural good one of the jobs that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.370
 we are already driving for almost 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.820
 three years is the marketing of 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.400
 live tilapia as it knows all our 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.409
 auditorium the tilapia is one of the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.930
 most important species in the country and in 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.579
 particular in veracruz but there are few 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.530
 chances of getting the fish 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.300
 I live unless I go to one of the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.339
 farms then the idea of ​​this 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.010
 project that has financing by 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:06.360
 different instances recently of 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.479
 inapesca is bringing live product to 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.869
 consumer is what we are driving 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.420
 good if one goes to any fishmonger or 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.340
 supermarket you can find tilapia and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.800
 the presentations in which is more 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.660
 common to find it is to see how cool 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.490
 whole or fillet 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.289
 however when we buy that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.560
 product we do not know how long 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.000
 has there on the shelf even 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.710
 we know its origin much of what is 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.630
 is consuming in veracruz and in the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.579
 country is imported more or less 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.670
 Mexico imports 40,000 tons of china 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.320
 of taiwan and the live fish is the best 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.640
 guarantee for a consumer that the 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.079
 fish is fresh there is no 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.119
 presentation of fish of any 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.100
 species that is cooler than 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.450
 fish alive today the only 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.329
 possibility that one has is to go to the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.229
 farms that in Veracruz there are many 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.409
 we estimate that in the central part of 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.509
 veracruz there are about 600 tilapia farms 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.920
 there's like 200 trout and probably 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.439
 throughout the state we may reach the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.479
 2,000 production units however 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.970
 the consumer who lives in urban areas 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.340
 sometimes it has no possibilities or access 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.549
 to those farms and the only option that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.930
 is is to go to these points of sale 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:17.730
 in the area near the port of veracruz 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.200
 we have identified 24 points right now 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.420
 of sale of live fish 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.220
 there are some that are fixed in some 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.750
 communities there are some that are 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.430
 rotating are being put in some 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.080
 colonies and really what we want is 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.090
 boost because to the extent that it 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.010
 consume more live fish also 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.959
 the producers benefit 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.910
 they sell supplies as food breeding 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.099
 etcetera then we push all the 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.920
 chain the entire value network at the time of 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.989
 promote and consume live fish one of 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.880
 the strongest lines that drives the 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.980
 school is about transferring 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.490
 technology we are very interested in 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.100
 what 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.240
 technological practices apply them 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.940
 the producers to make them more 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.990
 efficient we are interested in increasing their 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.790
 production is to say the kilos that 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.590
 produces each production unit but 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.330
 also your productivity how many kilos 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.070
 per unit volume or surface 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.950
 can produce good for 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.500
 producers who are already active the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.150
 that are already producing we invite you to 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.520
 that approach organized groups 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.990
 since there is in the state the committee 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.310
 product system the association of 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.650
 consultants of the state of veracruz the 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.110
 back the same veracruz campus here 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.390
 can advise you on recommendations 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.670
 for them to do better what they are 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.130
 currently doing for the producer 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.500
 that the person who is interested in 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.510
 involved in the activity will 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.730
 we suggest that you advise before 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.830
 start it is very important that you visit 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.960
 other farms that do not fan without 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.130
 have an idea so that they do not repeat 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.410
 errors that others have already committed 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.690
 producers and for consumers and 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.120
 more in this area where we already have the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.190
 fish consumption culture 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.299
 that they consider the possibility of buying 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.760
 fish alive because that way 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.519
 They also have the certainty that this 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.069
 product was grown in veracruz then 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.810
 we are also supporting the producer 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.840
 local if we want to support the 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.370
 local producer the only way 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.799
 is currently consuming live fish 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.659
 because we still do not get to fish 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.340
 I live from other parts of the world that 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.010
 approach the campus we can give 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.000
 recommendations we can support and we 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.950
 It is very interesting to promote 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.769
 the development of these units of 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.170
 production are generated self jobs are 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.840
 about fish to communities are 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.750
 improves the quality of life of people in 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.070
 our entity and good we are in the 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.090
 better able to support all 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.420
 who are interested in joining 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:43.949
 aquaculture
