00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.849 
you first start up you have to toggle it
on<00:03:23.829> and<00:03:23.889> off<00:03:24.099> to<00:03:24.310> get<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.579> to<00:03:24.699> connect<00:03:25.859> here

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
on and off to get it to connect here

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.530 
on and off to get it to connect here
under<00:03:27.159> sound<00:03:27.400> you'll<00:03:27.609> find<00:03:27.849> the<00:03:27.970> sound<00:03:28.209> device

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
sleep timer available on this ROM which

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.460 
sleep timer available on this ROM which
wasn't<00:03:52.090> always<00:03:52.449> available<00:03:52.659> on<00:03:52.900> Android<00:03:53.290> Mini

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
wasn't always available on Android Mini

wasn't always available on Android Mini
pcs<00:03:53.919> sometimes<00:03:54.819> you<00:03:54.939> come<00:03:55.060> down<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.389> you're

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
pcs sometimes you come down and you're

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.839 
pcs sometimes you come down and you're
monitored<00:03:55.900> or<00:03:56.079> TV<00:03:56.530> had<00:03:56.620> been<00:03:56.799> on<00:03:56.919> for<00:03:57.250> 12<00:03:57.519> hours

so<00:03:58.150> this<00:03:58.540> will<00:03:58.750> eliminate<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.430> here<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.519> can

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
so this will eliminate that here you can

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.789 
so this will eliminate that here you can
see<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:00.909> does<00:04:01.060> have<00:04:01.090> 1080p<00:04:01.930> output<00:04:01.959> it's

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
see it does have 1080p output it's

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.649 
see it does have 1080p output it's
