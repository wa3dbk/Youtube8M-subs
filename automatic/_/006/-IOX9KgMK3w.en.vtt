I'll just go ahead and I'll write some

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.369 
I'll just go ahead and I'll write some
paragraphs<00:00:37.620> out<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.079> this<00:00:40.079> could<00:00:40.350> be

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
paragraphs out here so this could be

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.160 
paragraphs out here so this could be
paragraph<00:00:41.010> 1<00:00:43.670> this<00:00:44.670> paragraph<00:00:45.120> 1<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.690> you

paragraph 1 this paragraph 1 and you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.779

think<00:00:46.379> okay<00:00:46.649> well<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:47.039> break<00:00:47.250> down<00:00:47.460> two

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
think okay well I can break down two

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.709 
think okay well I can break down two
lines<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:49.789> could<00:00:50.789> be<00:00:50.820> paragraph<00:00:51.420> two

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
lines and this could be paragraph two

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.850 
lines and this could be paragraph two
and<00:00:53.329> then<00:00:54.329> we'll<00:00:54.539> write<00:00:54.960> another<00:00:55.230> story<00:00:55.379> over

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.549 
and then we'll write another story over
here<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:56.370> whatever<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.120> then<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.140> think<00:00:58.350> okay

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
here or whatever and then you think okay

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.560 
here or whatever and then you think okay
cool<00:00:59.100> I'm<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> go<00:00:59.699> ahead<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.059> save<00:01:00.300> this

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
cool I'm going to go ahead and save this

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.830 
cool I'm going to go ahead and save this
and<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.989> should<00:01:01.230> get<00:01:01.440> three<00:01:02.059> nice<00:01:03.059> paragraphs

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
and I should get three nice paragraphs

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.230 
and I should get three nice paragraphs
printed<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.339> browser<00:01:07.070> but

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
printed out in the browser but

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.390 
printed out in the browser but
unfortunately<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> case<00:01:10.400> okay

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
unfortunately that's not the case okay

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.359 
unfortunately that's not the case okay
so<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.970> go<00:01:12.119> ahead<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.010> launch<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.189> in

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
so if I go ahead then I launch this in

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.940 
so if I go ahead then I launch this in
Firefox<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.810> see<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.229> I've<00:01:16.380> got<00:01:16.740> all

Firefox you can see that I've got all
three<00:01:17.610> things<00:01:17.970> printed<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> screen

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
three things printed out on the screen

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.940 
three things printed out on the screen
but<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:21.299> all<00:01:21.540> appeared<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.320> line<00:01:22.590> what

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
but they all appeared in one line what

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.660 
but they all appeared in one line what
the<00:01:23.310> heck<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:24.900> well<00:01:25.799> let<00:01:26.520> me

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the heck is going on here well let me

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.539 
the heck is going on here well let me
explain<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.360> way

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
explain it to you this way

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.390 
explain it to you this way
HTML<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.790> actually<00:01:30.650> whitespace<00:01:31.650> insensitive

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
HTML is actually whitespace insensitive

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.770 
HTML is actually whitespace insensitive
so<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.610> doesn't<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:32.970> matter<00:01:33.240> how<00:01:33.540> much

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
so it doesn't really matter how much

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.499 
so it doesn't really matter how much
space<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:34.890> leave<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.430> between<00:01:35.790> yeah<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.150> mean<00:01:36.360> I

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
space we leave in between yeah I mean I

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.560 
space we leave in between yeah I mean I
could<00:01:36.799> put<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.130> hole<00:01:38.490> what<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.420> like

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
could put in a hole what is that like

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.679 
could put in a hole what is that like
probably<00:01:39.930> 20<00:01:40.229> inches<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:40.740> something<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.689> when

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
probably 20 inches or something and when

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.410 
probably 20 inches or something and when
I<00:01:42.720> go<00:01:43.200> back<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.890> click<00:01:44.130> refresh<00:01:44.430> nothing's

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
I go back and I click refresh nothing's

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
I go back and I click refresh nothing's
changed<00:01:46.200> okay<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:48.259> that's<00:01:49.259> why<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.770> use<00:01:50.130> these

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
changed okay so that's why we use these

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.859 
changed okay so that's why we use these
things<00:01:50.579> called<00:01:51.180> tags<00:01:51.509> okay<00:01:52.170> they<00:01:52.890> basically

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
things called tags okay they basically

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.789 
things called tags okay they basically
tell<00:01:54.869> HTML<00:01:55.619> how<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> mark<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:58.110> text<00:01:58.500> inside

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
tell HTML how to mark up the text inside

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.399 
tell HTML how to mark up the text inside
of<00:01:58.860> them<00:01:59.390> okay<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:01.619> break<00:02:01.950> down<00:02:02.250> one<00:02:02.670> line

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
of them okay so to break down one line

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.520 
of them okay so to break down one line
what<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.829> we<00:02:04.979> use<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:06.090> break<00:02:06.750> tag<00:02:07.110> so

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
what we do is we use this break tag so

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.270 
what we do is we use this break tag so
that<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.220> BR<00:02:08.929> with<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.170> forward<00:02:10.619> slash<00:02:10.739> just

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
that is BR with a forward slash just

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.820 
that is BR with a forward slash just
like<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.629> want<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.840> break<00:02:12.989> down

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
like that and if I want to break down

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.920 
like that and if I want to break down
another<00:02:14.460> line<00:02:14.730> then<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.240> go<00:02:15.450> ahead<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.900> put

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
another line then I go ahead and I put

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.770 
another line then I go ahead and I put
one<00:02:16.320> there<00:02:16.560> as<00:02:16.680> well<00:02:17.120> okay<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.150> now<00:02:18.480> when<00:02:18.690> I

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
one there as well okay so now when I

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.580 
one there as well okay so now when I
save<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.320> and<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:20.640> go<00:02:20.850> back<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.780> Firefox<00:02:22.410> and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
save this and I go back to Firefox and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.270 
save this and I go back to Firefox and
click<00:02:22.830> refresh<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.030> see<00:02:24.210> we've<00:02:25.170> got<00:02:25.280> this

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
click refresh you can see we've got this

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.130 
click refresh you can see we've got this
on<00:02:26.490> line<00:02:26.730> one<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:28.050> line<00:02:28.260> 2<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.740> line<00:02:28.800> 3<00:02:30.140> ok

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
on line one this on line 2 and line 3 ok

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.260 
on line one this on line 2 and line 3 ok
so<00:02:31.200> they're<00:02:31.440> all<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:31.920> their<00:02:32.280> own<00:02:32.340> separate

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
so they're all on their own separate

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.020 
so they're all on their own separate
lines<00:02:33.620> but<00:02:34.620> that's<00:02:34.830> actually<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.580> how<00:02:35.970> to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
lines but that's actually just how to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.930 
lines but that's actually just how to
break<00:02:36.510> down<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.840> line<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
break down a line so this is the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.630 
break down a line so this is the
equivalent<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.680> hitting<00:02:40.680> enter<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:41.580> your

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
equivalent of hitting enter on your

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.420 
equivalent of hitting enter on your
keyboard<00:02:42.320> but<00:02:43.320> if<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.560> guys<00:02:43.740> actually<00:02:44.040> want

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
keyboard but if you guys actually want

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.540 
keyboard but if you guys actually want
to<00:02:44.550> have<00:02:44.730> paragraphs<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.650> paragraphs<00:02:46.980> have

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
to have paragraphs and paragraphs have

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.170 
to have paragraphs and paragraphs have
spaces<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.330> between<00:02:49.280> these<00:02:50.280> two<00:02:50.550> lines<00:02:50.790> then

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
spaces in between these two lines then

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.000 
spaces in between these two lines then
we<00:02:51.210> have<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.720> go<00:02:51.870> ahead<00:02:51.990> and<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:52.560> use<00:02:52.830> a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
we have to go ahead and we use a

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.440 
we have to go ahead and we use a
different<00:02:53.370> tag<00:02:53.880> called<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.350> paragraph<00:02:55.980> tag

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
different tag called the paragraph tag

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.660 
different tag called the paragraph tag
so<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:58.680> do<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:58.830> you're<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.310> going<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.490> go

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
so to do that you're just going to go

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.910 
so to do that you're just going to go
ahead<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.090> put<00:03:00.900> in<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:01.110> smaller<00:03:01.410> than<00:03:01.650> and

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
ahead and put in a smaller than and

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.970 
ahead and put in a smaller than and
greater<00:03:01.950> than<00:03:02.250> sign<00:03:02.580> with<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.940> P<00:03:03.240> and<00:03:03.980> same

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
greater than sign with a P and same

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.910 
greater than sign with a P and same
thing<00:03:05.280> on<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.580> side<00:03:05.790> as<00:03:06.000> well<00:03:06.590> okay<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:07.620> that

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
thing on this side as well okay so that

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.550 
thing on this side as well okay so that
is<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.340> start<00:03:09.210> of<00:03:09.480> one<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.750> our<00:03:09.990> paragraphs

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
is the start of one of our paragraphs

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.460 
is the start of one of our paragraphs
and<00:03:10.880> then<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.900> end<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.380> that

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
and then this is the end of that

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.790 
and then this is the end of that
paragraph<00:03:14.190> okay<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.930> we'll<00:03:16.380> go<00:03:16.500> ahead<00:03:16.530> and

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
paragraph okay so we'll go ahead and

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.840 
paragraph okay so we'll go ahead and
we'll<00:03:17.360> do<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.840> couple<00:03:18.900> times

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.080 

ending<00:03:23.850> P<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:25.220> we'll<00:03:26.220> start<00:03:26.520> this<00:03:26.670> P<00:03:26.940> over

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
ending P and we'll start this P over

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.870 
ending P and we'll start this P over
there<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:29.150> why<00:03:30.150> P<00:03:30.209> over<00:03:30.510> there<00:03:31.670> ha<00:03:32.670> ha

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880

as you can see we've got these three

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.220 
as you can see we've got these three
pretty<00:03:43.350> cool<00:03:43.790> paragraphs<00:03:44.790> all<00:03:45.080> printed<00:03:46.080> out

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
pretty cool paragraphs all printed out

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.010 
pretty cool paragraphs all printed out
nicely<00:03:46.500> on<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.920> screen<00:03:47.160> with<00:03:48.030> space<00:03:48.750> in

nicely on the screen with space in

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.370 
nicely on the screen with space in
between<00:03:49.350> them

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380

between them
okay<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.650> that's<00:03:53.100> quite<00:03:53.520> cool<00:03:53.760> we've<00:03:54.480> covered

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
okay so that's quite cool we've covered

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.300 
okay so that's quite cool we've covered
how<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.850> actually<00:03:56.850> break<00:03:57.180> down<00:03:57.540> one<00:03:57.900> line<00:03:58.310> and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
how to actually break down one line and

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.340 
how to actually break down one line and
we've<00:03:59.489> also<00:03:59.640> covered<00:04:00.209> how<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.600> make<00:04:00.959> different

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
we've also covered how to make different

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.280 
we've also covered how to make different
paragraphs<00:04:02.070> so<00:04:02.310> let's<00:04:02.970> take<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.390> look<00:04:03.630> at<00:04:03.810> how

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
paragraphs so let's take a look at how

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.010 
paragraphs so let's take a look at how
to<00:04:04.350> actually<00:04:04.739> make<00:04:05.120> headers<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.630> web<00:04:06.810> page

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
to actually make headers on the web page

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.940 
to actually make headers on the web page
okay<00:04:07.770> now<00:04:08.520> we<00:04:09.330> actually<00:04:09.510> get<00:04:09.900> six<00:04:10.440> different

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
okay now we actually get six different

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.360 
okay now we actually get six different
kinds<00:04:11.670> of<00:04:11.730> headers<00:04:12.090> by<00:04:12.330> default<00:04:13.160> okay<00:04:14.160> and

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
kinds of headers by default okay and

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.050 
kinds of headers by default okay and
they<00:04:14.760> are<00:04:14.940> actually<00:04:15.420> named<00:04:16.459> h1<00:04:17.459> just<00:04:17.910> like

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
they are actually named h1 just like

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.920 
they are actually named h1 just like
that<00:04:18.299> right<00:04:19.080> down<00:04:19.350> until<00:04:19.919> h6<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:21.299> we've<00:04:21.450> got<00:04:21.570> h1

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
that right down until h6 so we've got h1

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.370 
that right down until h6 so we've got h1
h2<00:04:23.090> h3

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:34.930 

out<00:04:27.380> of<00:04:27.530> habit<00:04:27.680> I<00:04:27.919> put<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:28.580> closing<00:04:29.000> tag<00:04:30.910> h4<00:04:33.940> h5

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
out of habit I put a closing tag h4 h5

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:44.430 
out of habit I put a closing tag h4 h5
and<00:04:38.110> h6<00:04:39.340> not<00:04:40.340> H<00:04:40.490> 56<00:04:41.180> just<00:04:42.169> h6<00:04:43.180> okay<00:04:44.180> and

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
and h6 not H 56 just h6 okay and

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.750 
and h6 not H 56 just h6 okay and
obviously<00:04:45.440> when<00:04:45.889> you<00:04:45.950> have<00:04:46.100> to<00:04:46.220> go<00:04:46.340> ahead<00:04:46.460> and

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
obviously when you have to go ahead and

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.659 
obviously when you have to go ahead and
end<00:04:46.910> these<00:04:47.180> as<00:04:47.480> well<00:04:47.840> so<00:04:48.139> I<00:04:48.889> think<00:04:49.250> what<00:04:49.580> I'm

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
end these as well so I think what I'm

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.409 
end these as well so I think what I'm
going<00:04:49.790> to<00:04:49.820> do<00:04:49.910> is<00:04:50.030> just<00:04:50.180> copy<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:51.220> paste

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
going to do is just copy that paste

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.420 
going to do is just copy that paste
paste<00:04:53.419> paste<00:04:53.950> paste<00:04:54.950> paste<00:04:55.960> okay<00:04:56.960> so<00:04:57.050> one<00:04:57.430> two

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
paste paste paste paste okay so one two

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.050 
paste paste paste paste okay so one two
three<00:04:59.330> four<00:05:00.520> five<00:05:02.260> okay<00:05:03.260> and<00:05:03.729> we<00:05:04.729> can<00:05:04.880> go<00:05:05.030> ahead

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
three four five okay and we can go ahead

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.969 
three four five okay and we can go ahead
and<00:05:05.450> just<00:05:05.600> type<00:05:05.780> some<00:05:06.080> stupid<00:05:06.440> stuff<00:05:06.620> in<00:05:06.770> here

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
and just type some stupid stuff in here

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.620 
and just type some stupid stuff in here
to<00:05:07.160> see<00:05:07.400> what<00:05:07.430> all<00:05:07.700> these<00:05:07.790> headers<00:05:08.120> come<00:05:08.389> out

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
to see what all these headers come out

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.000 
to see what all these headers come out
looking<00:05:09.530> like<00:05:09.560> so<00:05:10.600> this<00:05:11.600> would<00:05:11.870> be<00:05:12.080> the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
looking like so this would be the

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.390 
looking like so this would be the
biggest<00:05:13.220> header<00:05:14.139> h1<00:05:15.139> is<00:05:15.590> obviously<00:05:16.220> the

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
biggest header h1 is obviously the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.480 
biggest header h1 is obviously the
biggest<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:16.910> then<00:05:17.320> h6<00:05:18.320> is<00:05:18.530> going<00:05:19.010> to<00:05:19.160> be<00:05:19.280> the

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
biggest and then h6 is going to be the

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:26.440 
biggest and then h6 is going to be the
smallest<00:05:21.130> and<00:05:23.680> a<00:05:24.680> somewhere<00:05:25.610> around<00:05:25.729> h3

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
smallest and a somewhere around h3

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.480 
smallest and a somewhere around h3
that's<00:05:26.660> almost<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.229> same<00:05:27.410> size<00:05:27.710> as<00:05:28.070> like<00:05:28.310> the

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
that's almost the same size as like the

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.540 
that's almost the same size as like the
default<00:05:28.910> text<00:05:29.389> what<00:05:29.660> might<00:05:29.900> be<00:05:30.110> h4<00:05:31.150> so<00:05:33.550> that

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
default text what might be h4 so that

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:42.870 
default text what might be h4 so that
would<00:05:34.700> be<00:05:34.850> like<00:05:34.970> a<00:05:35.030> medium<00:05:35.539> header

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:50.280 

as<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:44.380> text<00:05:45.630> will<00:05:46.800> test<00:05:47.800> text<00:05:48.430> whatever<00:05:49.290> will

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
as the text will test text whatever will

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:56.450 
as the text will test text whatever will
have<00:05:50.950> a<00:05:50.980> few<00:05:51.250> typos<00:05:51.670> in<00:05:51.700> yet<00:05:52.440> h2<00:05:53.440> can<00:05:53.980> just<00:05:54.430> say

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
have a few typos in yet h2 can just say

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.910 
have a few typos in yet h2 can just say
