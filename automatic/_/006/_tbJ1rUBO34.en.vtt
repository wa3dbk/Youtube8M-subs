here<00:00:16.610> is<00:00:16.789> rotating<00:00:17.570> globe<00:00:17.960> of<00:00:18.080> Mars<00:00:18.380> and<00:00:18.560> we're

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
here is rotating globe of Mars and we're

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.519 
here is rotating globe of Mars and we're
going<00:00:19.310> to<00:00:19.400> zoom<00:00:19.640> in<00:00:19.849> on<00:00:20.119> the<00:00:20.450> middle<00:00:20.779> southern

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
going to zoom in on the middle southern

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.490 
going to zoom in on the middle southern
latitudes<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:22.939> part<00:00:23.419> of<00:00:23.540> Mars<00:00:23.750> where<00:00:24.050> we<00:00:24.200> find

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
latitudes the part of Mars where we find

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.950 
latitudes the part of Mars where we find
these<00:00:24.919> active<00:00:25.489> slope<00:00:25.700> features<00:00:26.149> and<00:00:26.450> zooming

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
these active slope features and zooming

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.630 
these active slope features and zooming
in<00:00:27.140> on<00:00:27.349> the<00:00:27.680> Newton<00:00:28.220> Basin<00:00:29.000> crater<00:00:29.450> here<00:00:30.640> what

in on the Newton Basin crater here what

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.850 
in on the Newton Basin crater here what
you<00:00:31.730> can<00:00:31.880> see<00:00:31.910> are<00:00:32.360> lots<00:00:32.570> of<00:00:32.689> gullies<00:00:33.079> the

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
you can see are lots of gullies the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.680 
you can see are lots of gullies the
active<00:00:34.309> features<00:00:34.700> that<00:00:35.120> we've<00:00:35.329> recently

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
active features that we've recently

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.690 
active features that we've recently
discovered<00:00:36.020> on<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:36.920> slopes<00:00:37.190> that<00:00:37.340> are<00:00:37.460> facing

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
discovered on the slopes that are facing

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.680 
discovered on the slopes that are facing
mostly<00:00:38.450> to<00:00:38.719> the<00:00:38.840> north<00:00:39.079> to<00:00:39.380> the<00:00:39.410> equator<00:00:40.690> what

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
mostly to the north to the equator what

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.360 
mostly to the north to the equator what
we<00:00:41.809> see<00:00:42.019> are<00:00:42.170> much<00:00:42.350> smaller<00:00:42.679> scale<00:00:43.010> features

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
we see are much smaller scale features

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.479 
we see are much smaller scale features
than<00:00:43.820> gullies<00:00:47.230> you<00:00:48.230> can<00:00:48.410> see<00:00:48.679> an<00:00:48.949> area<00:00:49.429> of

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
than gullies you can see an area of

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.509 
than gullies you can see an area of
bedrock<00:00:50.149> a<00:00:50.210> steep<00:00:50.749> cliff<00:00:51.289> here<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:51.949> it's<00:00:52.219> from
