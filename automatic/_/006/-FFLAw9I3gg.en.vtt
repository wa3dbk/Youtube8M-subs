Trading<00:00:04.710> is<00:00:04.740> very<00:00:04.980> important<00:00:05.460> this<00:00:05.580> year

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
Trading is very important this year

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.550 
Trading is very important this year
obviously<00:00:06.270> we<00:00:06.390> kind<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.750> work<00:00:06.930> on<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.170> four-year

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
obviously we kind of work on a four-year

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.080 
obviously we kind of work on a four-year
cycle<00:00:07.800> in<00:00:08.099> between<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.460> Olympics<00:00:08.880> but

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
cycle in between the Olympics but

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.940 
cycle in between the Olympics but
singing<00:00:09.720> is<00:00:09.809> quite<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> unique<00:00:10.200> sport<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.920> that

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
singing is quite a unique sport in that

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.980 
singing is quite a unique sport in that
you<00:00:11.280> have<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.700> perform<00:00:12.120> consistently<00:00:12.419> every

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
you have to perform consistently every

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.379 
you have to perform consistently every
year<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.530> can't<00:00:13.769> take<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.070> year<00:00:14.429> out<00:00:14.459> or<00:00:14.820> have<00:00:15.360> a

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
year you can't take a year out or have a

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.790 
year you can't take a year out or have a
year<00:00:15.629> where<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.809> underperform<00:00:16.260> because<00:00:16.680> your

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
year where you underperform because your

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.710 
year where you underperform because your
world<00:00:17.039> ranking<00:00:17.490> increases<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.270> much<00:00:18.510> that

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
world ranking increases so much that

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.570 
world ranking increases so much that
then<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.380> have<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:19.619> much<00:00:19.740> deficit<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.340> can't

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
then you have so much deficit you can't

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740 
then you have so much deficit you can't
get<00:00:20.730> back<00:00:20.880> from<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.240> you've<00:00:21.360> got<00:00:21.630> to

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
get back from so you've got to

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.900 
get back from so you've got to
consistently<00:00:22.290> perform<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:22.950> the<00:00:23.490> training

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
consistently perform so the training

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.850 
consistently perform so the training

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
everything in together there's hardly

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.010 
everything in together there's hardly
any<00:01:10.380> rest<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.119> said<00:01:12.180> before<00:01:12.329> you've<00:01:12.719> got

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
any rest but as I said before you've got

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.899 
any rest but as I said before you've got
to<00:01:13.229> kind<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.500> keep<00:01:13.740> scoring<00:01:14.100> World<00:01:14.369> Cup<00:01:14.579> points

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
to kind of keep scoring World Cup points

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.550

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
so that when you get the Olympics you've

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.080 
so that when you get the Olympics you've
got<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> best<00:01:17.040> possible<00:01:17.460> start<00:01:17.549> number<00:01:17.969> to

whole<00:01:36.509> time<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.079> i'm<00:01:37.500> scared<00:01:37.649> i<00:01:37.979> win<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
whole time and i'm scared i win the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.670 
whole time and i'm scared i win the
first<00:01:38.549> event<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.090> then<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> can't<00:01:39.780> handle<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
first event and then I can't handle the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.410 
first event and then I can't handle the
expectation<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> pressure<00:01:41.880> around<00:01:42.210> me

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
expectation and the pressure around me

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.810 
expectation and the pressure around me
and<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.289> want<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.770> work<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.579> it's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and so I want to work up to that it's

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.190 
and so I want to work up to that it's
more<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.180> confidence<00:01:45.600> thing<00:01:45.719> I<00:01:45.840> know<00:01:45.899> what

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
more of a confidence thing I know what

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.690 
more of a confidence thing I know what
to<00:01:46.289> do<00:01:46.409> technically<00:01:46.859> it's<00:01:47.310> more<00:01:47.609> about

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
to do technically it's more about

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.669 
to do technically it's more about
experiencing<00:01:48.689> winning<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> can

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
experiencing winning so that I can

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.679 
experiencing winning so that I can
handle<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.460> hopefully<00:01:50.729> win<00:01:51.179> one<00:01:51.390> medal

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
handle it and hopefully win one medal

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.270 
handle it and hopefully win one medal
and<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.259> know<00:01:52.380> perhaps<00:01:52.649> win<00:01:52.950> some<00:01:53.159> more

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
and then you know perhaps win some more

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.010 
and then you know perhaps win some more
