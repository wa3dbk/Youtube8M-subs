advice that you would recommend for a

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.100 
advice that you would recommend for a
player<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.160> me<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.149> my<00:00:54.539> first<00:00:54.840> piece<00:00:55.079> of

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
player like me and so my first piece of

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.380 
player like me and so my first piece of
advice<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.980> know<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
advice is to know that this is a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.270 
advice is to know that this is a
hit-and-run<00:00:57.809> weapon<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.800> get<00:00:59.039> into<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
hit-and-run weapon if you get into a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.430 
hit-and-run weapon if you get into a
room<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.030> multiple<00:01:00.390> targets<00:01:00.780> take<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
room you see multiple targets take the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.439 
room you see multiple targets take the
shot<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> hell<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.420> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
shot and then just get the hell out of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.420 
shot and then just get the hell out of
there<00:01:03.629> hopefully<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.199> got<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> kill<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.280> if

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
there hopefully you got the kill but if

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.899 
there hopefully you got the kill but if
not<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.420> run<00:01:06.780> away<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.700> crossbow<00:01:08.700> has

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
not just just run away the crossbow has

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.179 
not just just run away the crossbow has
one<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.689> longest<00:01:09.990> reload<00:01:10.530> times<00:01:10.799> out<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
one of the longest reload times out of

one of the longest reload times out of
any<00:01:11.400> weapon<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.909> battlefield<00:01:12.210> 3<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.840> as

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
any weapon in battlefield 3 it's not as

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.469 
any weapon in battlefield 3 it's not as
long<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:14.250> light<00:01:14.430> machine<00:01:14.790> guns<00:01:15.030> granted

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
long as the light machine guns granted

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.149 
long as the light machine guns granted
but<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> take<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:16.979> long

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
but it's going to take you a really long

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.100 
but it's going to take you a really long
time<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:18.119> into<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.450> room<00:01:18.659> let's<00:01:18.990> say

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
time so if you go into a room let's say

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.929 
time so if you go into a room let's say
there's<00:01:19.380> two<00:01:19.619> targets<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.430> take<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:20.820> the

there's two targets you take out the
first<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.630> then<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.229> kind<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.890> hide<00:01:23.070> in

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
first one and then you kind of hide in

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.499 
first one and then you kind of hide in
the<00:01:23.280> corner<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.790> second<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> go<00:01:24.299> through

the corner for a second to go through

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.929 
the corner for a second to go through
the<00:01:24.600> animation<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.040> give<00:01:26.250> the

corner<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.329> some<00:01:33.570> weird<00:01:33.900> grin<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:34.350> face

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
corner with some weird grin on your face

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.080 
corner with some weird grin on your face
as<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.220> through<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.549> reload<00:01:35.909> animation

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
as you go through the reload animation

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.990 
as you go through the reload animation
and<00:01:36.570> then<00:01:37.020> pump<00:01:37.320> your<00:01:37.500> body<00:01:37.710> full<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.100> virtual

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and then pump your body full of virtual

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.969 
and then pump your body full of virtual
bullets<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.560> something

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
bullets and that is that something

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.590 
bullets and that is that something
you're<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> want<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.479> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
you're not going to want and so what you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.960 
you're not going to want and so what you
see<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.960> today's<00:01:43.049> video<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.799> am<00:01:44.189> constantly

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
see in today's video is I am constantly

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.969 
see in today's video is I am constantly
going<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> hit<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.899> runs<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.350> will<00:01:46.799> peak

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
going with the hit and runs I will peak

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.380 
going with the hit and runs I will peak
around<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.340> corner<00:01:47.579> real<00:01:47.700> fast<00:01:47.939> take<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
around the corner real fast take the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.569 
around the corner real fast take the
shot<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.780> then<00:01:48.960> run<00:01:49.320> away<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.590> am<00:01:49.860> constantly

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
shot and then run away I am constantly

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.639 
shot and then run away I am constantly
doing<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.810> reality<00:01:51.990> what<00:01:52.500> you

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
doing that and in reality what you

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.170 
doing that and in reality what you
should<00:01:52.829> probably<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.250> doing<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.640> what<00:01:54.090> you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
should probably be doing is what you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.730 
should probably be doing is what you
known<00:01:54.329> over<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.720> your<00:01:54.869> primary<00:01:55.049> or<00:01:55.590> your

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
known over to your primary or your

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.709 
known over to your primary or your
secondary<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.549> using<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> cross<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.570> which

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
secondary and using the cross but which

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.780 
secondary and using the cross but which
is<00:01:57.840> kind<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.200> backup<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:59.130> sometimes<00:01:59.610> you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
is kind of a backup but sometimes you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.819 
is kind of a backup but sometimes you
know<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.420> can't<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> your<00:02:01.259> primary<00:02:01.649> or

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
know you can't do that your primary or

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.830 
know you can't do that your primary or
your<00:02:02.009> secondary<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.729> out<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.030> ammunition<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
your secondary is out of ammunition and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.109 
your secondary is out of ammunition and
so<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.229> do<00:02:04.500> need<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> use<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.009> crossbow<00:02:05.640> but

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
so you do need to use the crossbow but

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.219 
so you do need to use the crossbow but
in<00:02:06.240> reality<00:02:06.360> once<00:02:06.780> again<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.170> should

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
in reality once again you should

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.330 
in reality once again you should
probably<00:02:07.409> switch<00:02:07.649> on<00:02:07.829> back<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.099> over<00:02:08.310> your

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
probably switch on back on over your

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.979 
probably switch on back on over your
primary<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.000> reload<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.360> instead<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.810> going

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
primary and reload that instead of going

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.290 
primary and reload that instead of going
through<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.200> long<00:02:10.379> reload<00:02:10.800> animation

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
through the long reload animation

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.420 
through the long reload animation
of<00:02:11.420> your<00:02:12.140> crossbow<00:02:12.560> but<00:02:12.770> once<00:02:12.920> again<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.340> just

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
of your crossbow but once again you just

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.490 
of your crossbow but once again you just
need<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.820> realize<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.690> this<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:15.050> a

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
need to realize that this is a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.140 
need to realize that this is a
hit-and-run<00:02:16.040> weapon<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.730> you're<00:02:16.820> not<00:02:17.000> going

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
hit-and-run weapon and you're not going

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.570 
hit-and-run weapon and you're not going
to<00:02:17.210> be<00:02:17.300> able<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.570> go<00:02:17.690> full<00:02:18.020> Rambo<00:02:18.470> with<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.830> so

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
to be able to go full Rambo with it so

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.070 
to be able to go full Rambo with it so
for<00:02:19.730> my<00:02:19.850> next<00:02:20.090> piece<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.420> advice<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.900> to

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
for my next piece of advice is to

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.890 
for my next piece of advice is to
understand<00:02:21.710> that<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.280> has<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.880> very<00:02:23.510> slow

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
understand that this has a very slow

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.810 
understand that this has a very slow
projectile<00:02:24.500> speed<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.340> going<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.550> take<00:02:25.610> the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
projectile speed it is going to take the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.030 
projectile speed it is going to take the
arrow<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.560> considerable<00:02:27.560> amount<00:02:27.770> of<00:02:27.980> time

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
arrow a considerable amount of time

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.640 
arrow a considerable amount of time
before<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.760> reaches<00:02:29.060> its<00:02:29.210> destination<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.960> to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
before it reaches its destination and to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.010 
before it reaches its destination and to
to<00:02:31.370> line<00:02:31.700> up<00:02:31.910> those<00:02:32.060> shots<00:02:32.360> at<00:02:32.600> medium<00:02:32.990> range

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
to line up those shots at medium range

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.200 
to line up those shots at medium range
and<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.650> get<00:02:33.800> used<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.430> bolt<00:02:34.610> travel<00:02:35.000> speed

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
and to get used to the bolt travel speed

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.450 
and to get used to the bolt travel speed
can<00:02:35.540> be<00:02:35.570> quite<00:02:36.110> tricky<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.160> way<00:02:37.280> that

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
can be quite tricky and so the way that

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.620 
can be quite tricky and so the way that
I<00:02:37.490> went<00:02:37.820> about<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.120> in<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.270> way<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.420> I

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
I went about it in the way that I

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.690 
I went about it in the way that I
learned<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.320> is<00:02:39.560> too<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.100> joined<00:02:40.490> team

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
learned it is too I joined team

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.180 
learned it is too I joined team
deathmatches<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.300> joined<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:42.290> close<00:02:42.890> quarter

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
deathmatches I joined a close quarter

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.490 
deathmatches I joined a close quarter
close<00:02:43.310> quarter<00:02:43.670> DLC<00:02:44.030> maps<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:45.080> pretty<00:02:45.380> much

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
close quarter DLC maps and I pretty much

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500 
close quarter DLC maps and I pretty much
just<00:02:45.650> went<00:02:45.920> for<00:02:46.220> people<00:02:46.550> at<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.940> medium

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
just went for people at a medium

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.540 
just went for people at a medium
distance<00:02:47.960> and<00:02:48.110> while<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.440> missed<00:02:49.070> nine<00:02:49.310> out<00:02:49.520> of

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
distance and while I missed nine out of

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.700 
distance and while I missed nine out of
ten<00:02:49.790> times<00:02:50.060> because<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.540> is<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:50.960> challenging<00:02:51.200> I

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
ten times because it is so challenging I

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.160 
ten times because it is so challenging I
started<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.640> watch<00:02:52.880> how<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.270> arrow<00:02:53.720> flew

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
started to watch how the arrow flew

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.900 
started to watch how the arrow flew
through<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.440> air<00:02:54.530> i<00:02:54.680> watch<00:02:55.130> where<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.490> landed

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
through the air i watch where it landed

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.690 
through the air i watch where it landed
and<00:02:56.120> my<00:02:56.930> brain<00:02:57.290> started<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.160> make<00:02:58.310> connections

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
and my brain started to make connections

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.760 
and my brain started to make connections
it<00:02:59.150> started<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.600> get<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.930> feel<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.530> how<00:03:00.710> the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
it started to get the feel of how the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.460 
it started to get the feel of how the
arrow<00:03:01.160> flew<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:01.940> then<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.480> started<00:03:03.020> to<00:03:03.170> nail
