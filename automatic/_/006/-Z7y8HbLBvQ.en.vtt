definitely<00:02:07.990> so<00:02:08.829> is<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.130> like<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:10.209> is<00:02:10.269> a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
definitely so is this like this is a

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.590 
definitely so is this like this is a
class<00:02:10.690> or<00:02:11.049> is<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.500> yes<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.340> class<00:02:12.700> it's

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
class or is this yes it is a class it's

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.780 
class or is this yes it is a class it's
actually<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.260> labeled<00:02:14.890> my<00:02:14.980> classes<00:02:15.370> RSS<00:02:15.760> news

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
actually I labeled my classes RSS news

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.610 
actually I labeled my classes RSS news
and<00:02:16.269> it's<00:02:16.360> got<00:02:16.480> some<00:02:16.630> built-in<00:02:16.959> functions<00:02:17.440> so

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
and it's got some built-in functions so

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.800 
and it's got some built-in functions so
that<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:18.280> just<00:02:18.519> creates<00:02:18.790> an<00:02:18.910> object<00:02:19.329> so<00:02:19.630> this

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
that it just creates an object so this

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.380 
that it just creates an object so this
is<00:02:19.840> really<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.260> engine<00:02:20.620> behind<00:02:20.769> your<00:02:21.459> PHP

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
is really the engine behind your PHP

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.930 
is really the engine behind your PHP
script<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:23.049> guards<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.739> XML<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.760> what

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
script that guards on the XML so what

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.340 
script that guards on the XML so what
actually<00:02:25.090> puts<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.630> together<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.019> makes<00:02:26.200> it

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
actually puts it together and makes it

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.750 
actually puts it together and makes it
look<00:02:26.380> as<00:02:26.620> beautiful<00:02:26.769> as<00:02:27.070> this<00:02:27.250> well<00:02:27.579> if<00:02:27.670> we

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
look as beautiful as this well if we

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.390 
look as beautiful as this well if we
scroll<00:02:27.940> down<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.299> bottom<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:30.130> is<00:02:30.280> all

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
scroll down to the bottom this is all

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.610 
scroll down to the bottom this is all
the<00:02:30.519> preg<00:02:30.730> match<00:02:30.760> where<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.420> matches<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.930> data

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
the preg match where it matches the data

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.180 
the preg match where it matches the data
from<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.670> array<00:02:34.359> to<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.720> node<00:02:35.260> then<00:02:35.859> it<00:02:35.950> grabs

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
from the array to the node then it grabs

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.130 
from the array to the node then it grabs
that<00:02:36.370> data<00:02:36.609> on<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.850> inside<00:02:37.209> then<00:02:37.840> we'll<00:02:37.989> just

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
that data on the inside then we'll just

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.289 
that data on the inside then we'll just
scroll<00:02:38.350> down<00:02:38.380> here<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:39.910> doing<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.180> little

scroll down here this is doing a little
bit<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.480> stripping<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.609> this<00:02:42.609> is<00:02:42.730> where<00:02:42.880> the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
bit of stripping and this is where the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.479 
bit of stripping and this is where the
actual<00:02:43.239> RSS<00:02:43.959> feed<00:02:44.230> gets<00:02:44.470> passed<00:02:44.769> into<00:02:45.070> the

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
actual RSS feed gets passed into the

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.300 
actual RSS feed gets passed into the

going to create those URL objects mmm

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.680 
going to create those URL objects mmm
since<00:04:09.639> it's<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.850> class<00:04:10.060> we<00:04:10.239> have<00:04:10.359> to<00:04:10.420> create<00:04:10.569> an

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
since it's a class we have to create an

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.599 
since it's a class we have to create an
object<00:04:10.780> for<00:04:11.200> it<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.530> it's<00:04:12.040> going<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.220> count

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
object for it and it's going to count

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.330 
object for it and it's going to count
for<00:04:12.700> each<00:04:13.000> in<00:04:13.329> every<00:04:13.569> URL<00:04:14.019> so<00:04:14.739> now<00:04:15.069> what<00:04:15.190> we're

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
for each in every URL so now what we're

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.529 
for each in every URL so now what we're
going<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.519> do<00:04:15.670> is<00:04:15.819> we're<00:04:16.000> going<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.150> take<00:04:16.359> that

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
going to do is we're going to take that

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:17.969 
going to do is we're going to take that
out<00:04:16.600> I'm<00:04:17.019> familiar<00:04:17.260> with<00:04:17.470> this<00:04:17.650> let's<00:04:17.889> see

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
out I'm familiar with this let's see

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.150 
out I'm familiar with this let's see
body<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.639> some<00:04:18.940> devta<00:04:19.329> yeah<00:04:19.650> yeah<00:04:20.650> well<00:04:20.979> right

body and some devta yeah yeah well right
before<00:04:21.310> that<00:04:21.489> we're<00:04:21.789> actually<00:04:21.880> going<00:04:22.120> to

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
before that we're actually going to

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.719 
before that we're actually going to
parse<00:04:22.450> these<00:04:22.600> URLs<00:04:23.139> we're<00:04:23.530> going<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.950> feed<00:04:24.580> it

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
parse these URLs we're going to feed it

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.500 
parse these URLs we're going to feed it
the<00:04:24.970> URL<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.310> parse<00:04:27.310> it<00:04:27.520> is<00:04:28.180> going<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.419> go

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
the URL and parse it is going to go

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.240 
the URL and parse it is going to go
through<00:04:28.720> all<00:04:29.560> right<00:04:29.680> then<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:29.950> we're<00:04:30.070> going<00:04:30.160> to

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
through all right then so we're going to

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.390 
through all right then so we're going to
move<00:04:30.490> on<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.090> actual<00:04:31.240> HTML<00:04:31.539> and<00:04:32.220> as<00:04:33.220> you

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
move on to the actual HTML and as you

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.040 
move on to the actual HTML and as you
can<00:04:33.550> see<00:04:33.580> it's<00:04:33.910> it's<00:04:34.300> really<00:04:34.539> lower<00:04:34.810> down

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
can see it's it's really lower down

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.810 
can see it's it's really lower down
because<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.620> CSS<00:04:36.099> and<00:04:36.280> I<00:04:36.310> just<00:04:36.490> call<00:04:36.700> my

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
because of the CSS and I just call my

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.230 
because of the CSS and I just call my
div<00:04:37.000> tags<00:04:37.410> I've<00:04:38.410> got<00:04:38.620> your<00:04:38.710> RSS<00:04:39.099> header<00:04:39.340> if<00:04:40.090> you

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
div tags I've got your RSS header if you

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.700 
div tags I've got your RSS header if you
wanted<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.599> you<00:04:40.780> can<00:04:40.900> include<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.380> data<00:04:41.590> in

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
wanted to you can include the data in

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.770 
wanted to you can include the data in
there<00:04:41.860> with<00:04:42.070> a<00:04:42.099> simple<00:04:42.700> date<00:04:43.120> function<00:04:43.570> call

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
there with a simple date function call

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.860 
there with a simple date function call
through<00:04:44.169> PHP<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:44.979> then<00:04:45.849> we<00:04:46.060> actually<00:04:46.360> call

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
through PHP and then we actually call

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.300 
through PHP and then we actually call
the<00:04:47.020> function<00:04:47.229> that's<00:04:47.500> in<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.770> class<00:04:47.979> called

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
the function that's in that class called

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.980 
the function that's in that class called
print<00:04:48.580> rose<00:04:48.789> so<00:04:49.330> we<00:04:49.419> don't<00:04:49.599> actually<00:04:49.720> have<00:04:49.900> to

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
print rose so we don't actually have to

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.129 
print rose so we don't actually have to
have<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.410> engine<00:04:50.770> code<00:04:51.010> in<00:04:51.280> our<00:04:51.580> PHP<00:04:52.139> index

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
have the engine code in our PHP index

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.050 
have the engine code in our PHP index
and<00:04:53.410> that<00:04:53.740> makes<00:04:53.950> actually<00:04:54.310> so<00:04:54.520> much<00:04:54.700> shorter

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
and that makes actually so much shorter

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.940 
and that makes actually so much shorter
yeah<00:04:55.330> and<00:04:55.659> the<00:04:55.720> cs<00:04:56.020> because<00:04:56.440> if<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:56.680> was<00:04:56.800> in<00:04:56.860> the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
yeah and the cs because if it was in the

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.260 
yeah and the cs because if it was in the
index<00:04:57.159> file<00:04:57.370> you'd<00:04:57.520> have<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.760> go<00:04:57.849> like<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.060> for

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
index file you'd have to go like a for

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.399 
index file you'd have to go like a for
each<00:04:58.390> loop<00:04:58.419> and<00:04:58.960> then<00:04:59.020> print

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409 
each loop and then print

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.109 
each loop and then print
so<00:04:59.830> instead<00:05:00.159> it<00:05:00.339> just<00:05:00.369> throw<00:05:00.639> it<00:05:00.699> in<00:05:00.759> the<00:05:00.849> class

00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:01.119 
so instead it just throw it in the class

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:04.320 
so instead it just throw it in the class
and<00:05:01.479> then<00:05:01.599> just<00:05:01.749> call<00:05:01.929> it<00:05:02.080> nice<00:05:02.849> so<00:05:03.849> how<00:05:04.179> are<00:05:04.269> we

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
and then just call it nice so how are we

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.699 
and then just call it nice so how are we
going<00:05:04.449> to<00:05:04.539> automate<00:05:04.869> this<00:05:05.019> hoof<00:05:05.229> prints<00:05:05.469> every

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:05.709 
going to automate this hoof prints every

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:07.499 
going to automate this hoof prints every
