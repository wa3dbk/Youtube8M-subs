dollars<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.130> thought<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.030> a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
dollars so I thought that's so it's a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.120 
dollars so I thought that's so it's a

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
were joking about it like that's how New

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.760 
were joking about it like that's how New
York<00:02:06.509> thinks<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.899> us<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.290> then<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.439> went<00:02:07.619> to

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
York thinks of us and then I went to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.740 
York thinks of us and then I went to
have<00:02:07.920> some<00:02:08.489> food<00:02:08.640> my<00:02:09.209> friend<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.599> was

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
sitting there I was thinking well

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.170 
sitting there I was thinking well
actually<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:11.069> could<00:02:11.160> be<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> flip<00:02:11.670> off<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
actually it could be a flip off of the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.410 
actually it could be a flip off of the
aisle

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
aisle

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.120 
aisle
New<00:02:12.569> York<00:02:12.780> inside<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.260> was<00:02:13.380> drawing<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.709> napkin

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
New York inside it was drawing on napkin

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.740 
New York inside it was drawing on napkin
and<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.370> was<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:15.360> New<00:02:15.480> York<00:02:15.599> doesn't

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
and I was like like New York doesn't

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.430 
and I was like like New York doesn't
love<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.319> then<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:18.000> idea<00:02:18.330> evolved<00:02:18.900> into

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
love you and then that idea evolved into

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.580 
love you and then that idea evolved into
