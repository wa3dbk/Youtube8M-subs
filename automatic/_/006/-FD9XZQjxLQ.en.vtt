00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
mounting bars on this bike we'll put on

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.499 
mounting bars on this bike we'll put on
the<00:01:22.439> lowest<00:01:22.740> setting<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.880> may<00:01:24.000> differ<00:01:24.180> for

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the lowest setting but it may differ for

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.880 
the lowest setting but it may differ for
you<00:01:24.659> depending<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> dimensions<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.830> your

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you depending on the dimensions of your

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.580 
you depending on the dimensions of your
bike<00:01:26.210> be<00:01:27.210> sure<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> top<00:01:27.810> slit<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> bar

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
bike be sure the top slit of the bar

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.010 
bike be sure the top slit of the bar
goes<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.220> an<00:01:29.310> upward<00:01:29.640> diagonal<00:01:30.119> angle<00:01:30.689> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
goes in an upward diagonal angle that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.850 
goes in an upward diagonal angle that
goes<00:01:31.200> from<00:01:31.380> bottom<00:01:31.680> left<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.970> top<00:01:33.000> right

goes from bottom left to top right

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.140 
goes from bottom left to top right
putting<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.189> wrong<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:35.369> will<00:01:35.939> prevent

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
putting this the wrong way will prevent

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.870 
putting this the wrong way will prevent
you<00:01:36.299> from<00:01:36.329> lifting<00:01:36.780> your<00:01:36.930> engine<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.880> next

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
you from lifting your engine up next

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.609 
you from lifting your engine up next
we'll<00:01:39.000> mount<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> engine<00:01:39.479> onto<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> mounting

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
we'll mount the engine onto the mounting

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.670 
we'll mount the engine onto the mounting
plates<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.850> part<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.210> much<00:01:42.390> easier<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.409> two

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
plates this part is much easier with two

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.569 
plates this part is much easier with two
people<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.329> possible<00:01:45.810> with<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.079> person

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
people but it's possible with one person

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.580 
people but it's possible with one person
put<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> engine<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.030> place<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.590> then

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
put the engine in place like so then

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.770 
put the engine in place like so then
drive<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> bolt<00:01:50.100> through<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:51.119> sure<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.600> put<00:01:51.750> a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
drive the bolt through be sure to put a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.480 
drive the bolt through be sure to put a
spacer<00:01:52.229> between<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.770> mounting<00:01:53.040> plates<00:01:53.250> and
