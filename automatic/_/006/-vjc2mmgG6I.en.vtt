derailleur is moving up and up and up
and<00:00:23.930> up<00:00:24.400> into<00:00:25.400> your<00:00:25.670> easiest<00:00:26.030> gear<00:00:26.330> up<00:00:26.510> here

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
and up into your easiest gear up here

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.480 
and up into your easiest gear up here
which<00:00:27.200> is<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.410> largest<00:00:27.710> cog<00:00:27.920> on<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.190> cassette

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
which is the largest cog on the cassette

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.190 
which is the largest cog on the cassette
and<00:00:28.850> then<00:00:29.630> as<00:00:29.750> I<00:00:29.840> shift<00:00:30.110> back<00:00:30.320> down<00:00:32.200> this

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
and then as I shift back down this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.529 
and then as I shift back down this
derailleur<00:00:33.770> then<00:00:33.980> moves<00:00:34.670> into<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.180> hardest

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
derailleur then moves into the hardest

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.009 
derailleur then moves into the hardest
gear<00:00:35.690> which<00:00:35.989> is<00:00:36.140> actually<00:00:36.469> the<00:00:36.649> smallest<00:00:36.829> cog

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
gear which is actually the smallest cog

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.840 
gear which is actually the smallest cog
and<00:00:39.019> that's<00:00:39.949> the<00:00:40.129> basics<00:00:40.460> of<00:00:40.550> how<00:00:40.699> your

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
and that's the basics of how your

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.160 
and that's the basics of how your
derailleur<00:00:41.120> moves<00:00:41.149> and<00:00:41.870> we'll<00:00:41.960> show<00:00:42.140> you

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
derailleur moves and we'll show you

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.829 
derailleur moves and we'll show you
again<00:00:42.530> from<00:00:42.679> another<00:00:42.800> angle<00:00:43.659> okay<00:00:44.659> here's

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
again from another angle okay here's

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.060 
again from another angle okay here's
another<00:00:44.899> shot<00:00:45.230> of<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.379> ruder<00:00:45.649> edit<00:00:45.920> from<00:00:46.010> the

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
another shot of the ruder edit from the

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.779 
another shot of the ruder edit from the
back<00:00:46.280> as<00:00:46.940> I<00:00:47.089> shift<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:49.100> chain<00:00:49.129> moves<00:00:49.550> into<00:00:49.730> a

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
back as I shift the chain moves into a

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.020 
back as I shift the chain moves into a
smaller<00:00:50.089> cog<00:00:50.390> here<00:00:50.749> on<00:00:50.839> the<00:00:50.929> cassette<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:52.030> you

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
smaller cog here on the cassette and you

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.750 
smaller cog here on the cassette and you
can<00:00:53.210> see<00:00:53.390> that<00:00:53.569> the<00:00:53.690> derailleur<00:00:53.960> itself<00:00:54.760> this

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
can see that the derailleur itself this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.099 
can see that the derailleur itself this
part<00:00:55.999> is<00:00:56.089> called<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.329> parallelogram<00:00:56.809> is

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
part is called the parallelogram is

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.130

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
high screw limits how far the chain can

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.130 
high screw limits how far the chain can
move<00:02:03.289> this<00:02:03.469> way<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:04.310> your<00:02:05.119> low<00:02:05.390> screw<00:02:05.780> here

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
move this way and your low screw here

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.809 
move this way and your low screw here
which<00:02:06.319> limits<00:02:06.829> how<00:02:06.890> far<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.310> chain<00:02:07.489> can<00:02:07.700> do

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
which limits how far the chain can do

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.319 
which limits how far the chain can do
this<00:02:08.000> one<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:09.429> now<00:02:10.429> this<00:02:10.609> derivative<00:02:11.060> as<00:02:11.120> well

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
this one and now this derivative as well

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.250 
this one and now this derivative as well
has<00:02:11.629> these<00:02:11.900> two<00:02:12.200> wheels<00:02:12.440> on<00:02:12.769> here<00:02:13.450> here<00:02:14.450> called

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
has these two wheels on here here called

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.960 
has these two wheels on here here called
the<00:02:15.410> jockey<00:02:15.620> wheels<00:02:15.890> or<00:02:16.190> chain<00:02:16.400> pulleys<00:02:16.730> and

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
the jockey wheels or chain pulleys and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.170 
the jockey wheels or chain pulleys and
this<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.079> what<00:02:18.230> actually<00:02:18.620> move<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.730> chain<00:02:19.940> up

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
this is what actually move the chain up

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.300 
this is what actually move the chain up
and<00:02:20.359> down<00:02:20.510> as<00:02:20.750> you're<00:02:21.709> pedaling<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:22.220> you

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
and down as you're pedaling so you

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.250 
and down as you're pedaling so you
always<00:02:22.639> have<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.910> be<00:02:23.030> pedaling<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:23.870> order<00:02:24.109> to

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
always have to be pedaling in order to

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.620 
always have to be pedaling in order to
shift<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.590> bike<00:02:24.769> so<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.670> each<00:02:25.849> step<00:02:26.120> make<00:02:26.480> sure

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
shift the bike so in each step make sure

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.870 
shift the bike so in each step make sure
that<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.959> are<00:02:27.170> pedaling<00:02:27.620> as<00:02:27.769> you<00:02:28.430> check<00:02:28.639> each

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
that you are pedaling as you check each

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.879 
that you are pedaling as you check each
step<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.780> you'll<00:02:29.989> be<00:02:30.109> able<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.410> figure<00:02:30.680> out

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:30.889 
step and you'll be able to figure out

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.370 
step and you'll be able to figure out
what's<00:02:31.040> going<00:02:31.190> on
