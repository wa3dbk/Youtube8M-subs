00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
remove a bolt over here at the bottom so

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.269 
remove a bolt over here at the bottom so
where<00:00:25.330> the<00:00:25.539> where<00:00:26.199> the<00:00:26.230> shock<00:00:26.529> absorbers<00:00:27.039> one

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
where the where the shock absorbers one

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.369 
where the where the shock absorbers one
end<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:28.210> fastened<00:00:28.750> it<00:00:29.590> is<00:00:31.050> let's<00:00:32.050> see<00:00:32.199> if<00:00:32.259> we

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
end is fastened it is let's see if we

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:42.329 
end is fastened it is let's see if we
can<00:00:32.559> get<00:00:32.710> that<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.440> there's<00:00:41.650> a<00:00:41.739> bolt<00:00:42.040> over

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
can get that so there's a bolt over

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:48.390 
can get that so there's a bolt over
there<00:00:46.170> which<00:00:47.170> is<00:00:47.409> I<00:00:47.589> believe<00:00:47.619> a<00:00:47.920> 19<00:00:48.250> millimeter

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
there which is I believe a 19 millimeter

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.049 
there which is I believe a 19 millimeter
bolt<00:00:48.909> bolt<00:00:49.720> head<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.580> other<00:00:51.699> side

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
bolt bolt head and on the other side

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:59.009 
bolt bolt head and on the other side
there<00:00:52.299> is<00:00:52.330> a<00:00:52.449> nut<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:55.409> rule<00:00:56.409> that<00:00:56.559> boat<00:00:58.019> remove

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
there is a nut and rule that boat remove

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.810 
there is a nut and rule that boat remove
this<00:00:59.260> bolt<00:00:59.500> actually<00:00:59.769> I<00:00:59.979> might<00:01:00.189> do<00:01:00.339> this<00:01:00.489> first

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
this bolt actually I might do this first

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.399 
this bolt actually I might do this first
because<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.269> found<00:01:01.659> from<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.930> other<00:01:02.049> side<00:01:02.379> that

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
because I found from the other side that

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.229 
because I found from the other side that
that's<00:01:02.920> actually<00:01:03.129> hard<00:01:03.460> to<00:01:03.519> take<00:01:03.790> out<00:01:03.939> if<00:01:04.119> you

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
that's actually hard to take out if you

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.810 
that's actually hard to take out if you
don't<00:01:04.689> have<00:01:04.989> this<00:01:05.140> removed<00:01:05.500> so<00:01:06.310> take<00:01:06.490> this<00:01:06.610> guy

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
don't have this removed so take this guy

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.870 
don't have this removed so take this guy
out<00:01:07.060> tap<00:01:07.450> it<00:01:07.570> out<00:01:07.689> then<00:01:08.400> remove<00:01:09.400> that<00:01:09.430> bottom

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
out tap it out then remove that bottom

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:23.039 
out tap it out then remove that bottom
bolt<00:01:10.590> then<00:01:11.590> remove<00:01:11.920> these<00:01:12.250> four<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.799> here<00:01:22.049> one

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
bolt then remove these four one here one

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:31.560 
bolt then remove these four one here one
there<00:01:27.659> two<00:01:28.659> over<00:01:28.990> there<00:01:29.969> those<00:01:30.969> are<00:01:31.149> 17

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
there two over there those are 17

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.809 
there two over there those are 17
millimeters<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.749> tools<00:01:34.960> you<00:01:35.079> need<00:01:35.320> are

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
millimeters so the tools you need are

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.450 
millimeters so the tools you need are
I've<00:01:36.819> got<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.119> big<00:01:37.329> extension<00:01:37.749> a<00:01:38.590> breaker<00:01:39.189> bar

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
I've got a big extension a breaker bar

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.429 
I've got a big extension a breaker bar
which<00:01:39.789> is<00:01:39.819> just<00:01:40.409> useful<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:43.600> this<00:01:43.780> bolt

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
which is just useful to get this bolt

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.380 
which is just useful to get this bolt
started<00:01:45.299> happens<00:01:46.299> to<00:01:46.390> drive<00:01:46.659> a<00:01:47.520> punch<00:01:48.520> hammer

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
started happens to drive a punch hammer

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.139 
started happens to drive a punch hammer
and<00:01:51.240> 17<00:01:52.240> into<00:01:52.539> 18<00:01:52.810> millimeter<00:01:53.139> sockets<00:01:54.149> so

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
and 17 into 18 millimeter sockets so

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.879 
and 17 into 18 millimeter sockets so
this<00:01:55.329> bolt<00:01:55.569> is<00:01:55.689> almost<00:01:55.960> this<00:01:56.319> nut<00:01:56.499> is<00:01:56.530> almost

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
this bolt is almost this nut is almost

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.779 
this bolt is almost this nut is almost
off<00:01:57.130> here<00:01:57.549> and<00:01:57.850> I'll<00:01:58.600> take<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:58.960> off

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
off here and I'll take it off

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.139 
off here and I'll take it off
and<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:02.439> guy<00:02:02.649> is<00:02:02.710> also<00:02:03.280> threaded<00:02:03.670> in<00:02:03.819> over

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
and this guy is also threaded in over

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.080 
and this guy is also threaded in over
there<00:02:04.329> so<00:02:05.079> it<00:02:05.560> takes<00:02:05.889> a<00:02:06.100> bit<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.369> work<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.880> think

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
there so it takes a bit of work I think

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.850 
there so it takes a bit of work I think
here<00:02:07.209> to<00:02:07.329> tap<00:02:07.600> this<00:02:07.780> port<00:02:08.080> first<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.649> another

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
here to tap this port first and another

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.460 
here to tap this port first and another
guy<00:02:09.100> will<00:02:09.220> come<00:02:09.399> off

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
guy will come off

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.380 
guy will come off
so<00:02:12.470> this<00:02:12.710> brake<00:02:13.010> cable<00:02:13.370> has<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.730> be<00:02:13.880> pushed

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
so this brake cable has to be pushed

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.090 
so this brake cable has to be pushed
pulled<00:02:15.320> out<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.500> its<00:02:16.060> bracket<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.860> out<00:02:18.860> of<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
pulled out of its bracket and out of the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:31.560 
pulled out of its bracket and out of the
way<00:02:19.250> otherwise<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.360> ball<00:02:29.560> push<00:02:30.560> hard<00:02:30.860> and

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
way otherwise the ball push hard and

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.780 
way otherwise the ball push hard and
comes<00:02:32.570> free<00:02:32.960> so<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:33.950> comes<00:02:34.280> out<00:02:34.490> of<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.670> way

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
comes free so that comes out of the way

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.110 
comes free so that comes out of the way
a<00:02:34.820> little<00:02:35.000> bit<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.740> this<00:02:36.740> bolt<00:02:37.070> over<00:02:37.280> here<00:02:37.670> as

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
a little bit and this bolt over here as

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.870 
a little bit and this bolt over here as
now<00:02:39.020> I<00:02:39.050> have<00:02:39.530> already<00:02:39.770> taken<00:02:40.100> it<00:02:40.340> out<00:02:40.490> and<00:02:40.730> I

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
now I have already taken it out and I

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.080 
now I have already taken it out and I
need<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.180> just<00:02:41.360> push<00:02:41.750> push<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.380> out<00:02:42.500> with<00:02:42.680> my

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
need to just push push it out with my

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.390 
need to just push push it out with my
punching<00:02:44.090> hammer<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.710> believe<00:02:45.980> it's

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
punching hammer and I believe it's

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.770 
punching hammer and I believe it's
actually<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.000> should<00:02:47.390> come<00:02:47.600> out<00:02:47.630> fairly

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
actually it should come out fairly

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.670 
actually it should come out fairly
easily<00:02:48.310> because<00:02:49.310> loosen<00:02:50.090> its<00:02:50.350> may<00:02:51.350> even<00:02:51.590> come

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
easily because loosen its may even come

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:02.650 
easily because loosen its may even come
out<00:02:51.830> by<00:02:51.980> hand<00:02:52.190> actually<00:03:00.550> still<00:03:01.550> loose<00:03:01.790> still

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
out by hand actually still loose still

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.800 
out by hand actually still loose still
those<00:03:02.870> there<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.500> is<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:04.520> this<00:03:05.330> certainly<00:03:05.570> is

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
those there it is so this certainly is

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.760 
those there it is so this certainly is
the<00:03:05.840> better<00:03:06.140> way<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.320> do<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.700> take<00:03:08.530> this<00:03:09.530> guy

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
the better way to do it take this guy

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.860 
the better way to do it take this guy
out<00:03:09.920> first<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.520> then<00:03:10.580> take<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.630> guy<00:03:11.840> out

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
out first and then take that guy out

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.930 
out first and then take that guy out
otherwise<00:03:12.260> it's<00:03:12.560> this<00:03:13.040> is<00:03:13.190> really<00:03:13.490> hard<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.760> do

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
otherwise it's this is really hard to do

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.210 
otherwise it's this is really hard to do
it<00:03:14.060> hard<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.330> do<00:03:14.450> if<00:03:14.570> you<00:03:14.780> try<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.680> do<00:03:15.860> that<00:03:16.010> one

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
it hard to do if you try to do that one
