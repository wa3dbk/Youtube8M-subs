have even I think it looks pretty
similar<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.890> 755<00:00:17.660> except<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.140> a

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:19.169 
similar to the 755 except you have a

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.529 
similar to the 755 except you have a
longer<00:00:19.410> blade<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.980> possibly<00:00:20.850> longer<00:00:21.029> handle

longer blade and possibly longer handle

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.269 
longer blade and possibly longer handle
but<00:00:21.960> there's<00:00:22.500> actually<00:00:22.800> more<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.160> than
