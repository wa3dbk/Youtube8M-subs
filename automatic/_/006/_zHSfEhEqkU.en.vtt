solo<00:00:10.420> canoes<00:00:10.840> today<00:00:16.320> we<00:00:17.320> use<00:00:17.439> two<00:00:17.679> basic

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:18.189 
solo canoes today we use two basic

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.550 
solo canoes today we use two basic
strokes<00:00:18.519> the<00:00:19.150> sweep<00:00:19.449> and<00:00:19.689> the<00:00:20.140> J<00:00:22.019> their<00:00:23.019> job<00:00:23.349> as

strokes the sweep and the J their job as
you<00:00:23.679> see<00:00:23.859> here<00:00:24.220> is<00:00:24.369> to<00:00:24.550> steer<00:00:24.849> us<00:00:25.029> left<00:00:25.390> and

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:25.659 
you see here is to steer us left and

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.059 
you see here is to steer us left and
right<00:00:25.839> depending<00:00:26.409> on<00:00:26.470> which<00:00:26.560> way<00:00:26.679> you<00:00:26.739> want<00:00:26.980> to

go the tandem canoe sweep pushes us

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.250 
go the tandem canoe sweep pushes us
forwards<00:00:32.980> as<00:00:33.160> well<00:00:33.879> as<00:00:34.090> steers<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.570> canoe

forwards as well as steers the canoe

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.170 
forwards as well as steers the canoe
first<00:00:37.260> place<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.739> paddle<00:00:37.980> 90<00:00:38.579> degrees<00:00:38.969> from

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
first place the paddle 90 degrees from

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.689 
first place the paddle 90 degrees from
the<00:00:39.270> canoe<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:39.750> out<00:00:39.899> from<00:00:40.110> your<00:00:40.230> body<00:00:40.699> then

the canoe or out from your body then

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.850 
the canoe or out from your body then
sweep<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.480> paddle<00:00:42.840> along<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.379> surface<00:00:43.739> of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
sweep the paddle along the surface of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.639 
sweep the paddle along the surface of
the<00:00:43.920> water<00:00:44.100> all<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.750> way<00:00:45.870> along<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> back

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the water all the way along to the back

of the canoe

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.030 
of the canoe
another<00:00:49.899> way<00:00:50.079> to<00:00:50.110> think<00:00:50.410> of<00:00:50.530> this<00:00:50.649> paddle

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
another way to think of this paddle

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.729 
another way to think of this paddle
stroke<00:00:51.280> is<00:00:51.460> as<00:00:52.000> a<00:00:52.030> forward<00:00:52.420> stroke<00:00:52.960> as<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:53.590> see

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
stroke is as a forward stroke as you see

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:01.529 
stroke is as a forward stroke as you see
here<00:00:54.100> and<00:00:54.220> then<00:00:54.970> a<00:00:55.000> draw<00:00:55.450> at<00:00:55.720> the<00:00:55.930> end

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.819 

from<00:01:02.539> a<00:01:02.629> different<00:01:02.780> vantage<00:01:03.050> point<00:01:03.530> you'll

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
from a different vantage point you'll

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.190 
from a different vantage point you'll
notice<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:04.460> I<00:01:04.519> have<00:01:04.670> body<00:01:05.269> rotation<00:01:05.990> through

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
notice that I have body rotation through

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.530 
notice that I have body rotation through
this<00:01:06.320> paddle<00:01:06.680> stroke<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.520> is<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:07.909> key<00:01:08.180> to

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
this paddle stroke this is the key to

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.200 
this paddle stroke this is the key to
making<00:01:08.750> this<00:01:09.020> one<00:01:09.140> really<00:01:09.500> move<00:01:09.680> your<00:01:09.890> canoe

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.090 

when<00:01:14.210> we<00:01:14.390> use<00:01:14.570> this<00:01:14.750> paddle<00:01:15.170> stroke<00:01:15.409> in<00:01:15.500> a<00:01:15.590> solo

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
when we use this paddle stroke in a solo

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.370 
when we use this paddle stroke in a solo
canoe<00:01:16.460> you'll<00:01:16.940> notice<00:01:17.390> right<00:01:17.479> here<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:18.229> I'm

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
canoe you'll notice right here that I'm

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.499 
canoe you'll notice right here that I'm
about<00:01:18.409> to<00:01:18.649> go<00:01:18.890> all<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.550> way<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.970> front<00:01:20.330> of

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
about to go all the way to the front of

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.139 
about to go all the way to the front of
my<00:01:20.659> canoe<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.259> sweep<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.040> paddle<00:01:22.430> all<00:01:22.580> the

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
my canoe and sweep the paddle all the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.510 
my canoe and sweep the paddle all the
way<00:01:23.270> around<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.780> back<00:01:24.050> we<00:01:24.830> could<00:01:25.009> do<00:01:25.220> this

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
way around to the back we could do this

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.790 
way around to the back we could do this
because<00:01:26.000> we<00:01:26.330> can<00:01:26.479> affect<00:01:26.840> both<00:01:27.200> ends<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.649> the

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
because we can affect both ends of the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.830 
because we can affect both ends of the
canoe<00:01:28.100> unlike<00:01:28.759> when<00:01:28.909> we're<00:01:29.090> tandem<00:01:29.509> when

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
canoe unlike when we're tandem when

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.080 
canoe unlike when we're tandem when
we're<00:01:30.020> at<00:01:30.080> one<00:01:30.350> end<00:01:30.560> or<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.770> other<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.759> stroke

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
we're at one end or the other the stroke

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.080 
we're at one end or the other the stroke
also<00:01:32.330> has<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:33.110> pivot<00:01:33.500> effect<00:01:34.009> versus<00:01:34.970> the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
also has a pivot effect versus the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.730 
also has a pivot effect versus the
forward<00:01:35.420> propulsion<00:01:35.690> like<00:01:36.170> we've<00:01:36.350> seen<00:01:36.530> when

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
forward propulsion like we've seen when

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.859 
forward propulsion like we've seen when
paddling<00:01:36.950> tandem<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:40.280> reverse<00:01:40.670> sweep<00:01:40.970> simply

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
paddling tandem the reverse sweep simply

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.480 
paddling tandem the reverse sweep simply
pivots<00:01:42.320> our<00:01:42.440> canoe<00:01:42.710> in<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:42.920> other<00:01:43.130> direction

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
pivots our canoe in the other direction

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.600 
pivots our canoe in the other direction
as<00:01:43.789> a<00:01:44.509> side<00:01:44.869> note<00:01:44.920> we'll<00:01:45.920> deal<00:01:46.190> with<00:01:46.220> the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
as a side note we'll deal with the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.580 
as a side note we'll deal with the
tilting<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.179> the<00:01:47.240> canoe<00:01:47.600> as<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:47.840> see<00:01:48.080> me<00:01:48.229> here

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
tilting of the canoe as you see me here

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.980 
tilting of the canoe as you see me here

paddling<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:54.229> J<00:01:54.530> stroke<00:01:54.860> will<00:01:55.310> steer<00:01:55.670> us<00:01:55.880> in

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
paddling the J stroke will steer us in

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.440 
paddling the J stroke will steer us in
the<00:01:56.390> opposite<00:01:56.960> direction<00:01:57.140> from<00:01:57.800> our<00:01:58.009> sweet
