00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
at my previous school it really wasn't

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.930 
at my previous school it really wasn't
as<00:00:36.650> challenging<00:00:37.310> as<00:00:37.460> Webb<00:00:37.700> is<00:00:39.489> and<00:00:40.489> you<00:00:40.700> didn't

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
as challenging as Webb is and you didn't

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.660 
as challenging as Webb is and you didn't
have<00:00:41.060> as<00:00:41.180> much<00:00:41.330> freedom<00:00:41.720> as<00:00:41.960> we<00:00:42.170> do<00:00:42.320> here<00:00:42.670> my

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
have as much freedom as we do here my

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.240 
have as much freedom as we do here my
old<00:00:43.910> school<00:00:44.150> it<00:00:44.510> was<00:00:44.690> a<00:00:44.720> lot<00:00:44.960> easier<00:00:45.440> then

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
old school it was a lot easier then

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.250 
old school it was a lot easier then
Webb's<00:00:46.850> but<00:00:47.270> you<00:00:47.360> know<00:00:47.480> that's<00:00:47.750> not<00:00:47.900> always<00:00:48.050> a

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
Webb's but you know that's not always a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.700 
Webb's but you know that's not always a
bad<00:00:48.290> thing<00:00:48.470> and<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:50.600> social<00:00:50.989> climate<00:00:51.170> was<00:00:51.680> a

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
bad thing and the social climate was a

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.710 
bad thing and the social climate was a
lot<00:00:51.920> different<00:00:52.309> because<00:00:52.460> everyone<00:00:53.360> was<00:00:53.540> in

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
lot different because everyone was in

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.390 
lot different because everyone was in
their<00:00:53.870> own<00:00:53.900> little<00:00:54.200> groups<00:00:54.290> but<00:00:55.070> here<00:00:55.280> it<00:00:55.370> was

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
their own little groups but here it was

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.420 
their own little groups but here it was
it's<00:00:56.390> more<00:00:56.629> like<00:00:56.780> people<00:00:57.470> intermingle<00:00:57.770> and

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
it's more like people intermingle and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.970 
it's more like people intermingle and
the<00:00:59.330> grade<00:00:59.570> you're<00:00:59.750> in<00:00:59.780> doesn't<00:01:00.260> make<00:01:00.530> as<00:01:00.830> much

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
the grade you're in doesn't make as much

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.050

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
geography is interesting because it's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.500 
geography is interesting because it's
it's<00:01:36.130> different<00:01:36.610> from<00:01:36.760> history<00:01:37.270> because

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
it's different from history because

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.540 
it's different from history because
you're<00:01:37.660> learning<00:01:37.840> about<00:01:38.650> countries<00:01:39.280> like

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
you're learning about countries like

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.180 
you're learning about countries like
physical<00:01:40.090> features<00:01:40.480> and<00:01:40.750> it's<00:01:40.870> interesting

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
physical features and it's interesting

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.450 
physical features and it's interesting
and<00:01:42.460> then<00:01:42.640> physics<00:01:43.540> with<00:01:44.050> mr.<00:01:44.380> retro<00:01:44.800> he's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
and then physics with mr. retro he's

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.480 
and then physics with mr. retro he's
like<00:01:45.760> one<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.030> us<00:01:46.270> in<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.690> way<00:01:46.840> because<00:01:47.800> he<00:01:48.070> has

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
like one of us in a way because he has

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.710 
like one of us in a way because he has
so<00:01:48.670> much<00:01:48.820> fun<00:01:49.090> with<00:01:49.270> it

so much fun with it
so<00:01:50.410> how<00:01:50.560> serious<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.600> more<00:01:52.840> relaxed<00:01:53.170> and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
so how serious it's more relaxed and

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.600 
so how serious it's more relaxed and
cool<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.760> then<00:01:54.940> my<00:01:55.570> Spanish<00:01:56.320> with<00:01:56.830> mr.<00:01:57.160> Rana

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
cool and then my Spanish with mr. Rana

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.420 
cool and then my Spanish with mr. Rana
she's<00:01:58.479> from<00:01:58.690> Belize<00:01:58.990> it's<00:01:59.770> interesting<00:02:00.040> as<00:02:00.340> I
