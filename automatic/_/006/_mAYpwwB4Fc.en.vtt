00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello people welcome to the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.850
 other features tutorial and today is 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.960
 It's a beginner tutorial again 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.990
 I'll take care of that 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.370
 power here vice beast and 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.960
 yes, we start with the basics 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.289
 electricity is first generated in one 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.910
 generator here we can either wood 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.160
 or burn coal and then it works 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.439
 through a suitcase cable in a bed 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.350
 box this blackbox stores the stream 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.119
 and here for example now 750 eu us 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.310
 Let's get some coal here 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.029
 in the generator and it would do anything for 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.180
 burned him 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.280
 The thing is in a bed box can one 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.989
 from all sides but only current reintun 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.160
 from one side the stream again 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.680
 find out 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.420
 there is just this green dots and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.850
 here we have to connect the cable 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.020
 So that's how it works in ours 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.760
 consumer here for example 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.829
 electric works and here we can 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.360
 our things burn for him more 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.610
 We would have to store electricity 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.920
 sit down a lot more boxing now 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.870
 but that's pretty hard 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.770
 There are also devices that have more power 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.020
 can save 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.120
 but to prove that it works 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.460
 I'll put some coal in here and now 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.049
 the stream becomes old for you 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.640
 fraction of a second stored here 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.760
 then in here and then it always works 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.750
 Continue until here to fifth box and here 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.939
 it is then saved 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.759
 and yes then that's just going through again 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.220
 a coupÃ© cable in the consumer there 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.710
 there is a lot of space 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.409
 a device called mlp and that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.060
 can save up to 600,000 eu 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.820
 We now fear simply times the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.530
 generator with bit of coal and we 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.799
 see that the thing explodes here 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.009
 are 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.340
 because the mfg the whole in a middle 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.450
 voltage transformed and the oven only 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.850
 a 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.800
 low voltage came around the stove 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.230
 but to operate despite the power out 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.050
 We need a lv 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.620
 transformer and the sitting seen that 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.350
 that the three points so watch that 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.210
 hold the strong current in the three points 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.910
 Looks straight and so and now we see 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.430
 also that the cable explodes because of 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.470
 the average voltage is too high 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.340
 has tension for the comeback and 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.190
 so now need one 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.270
 fiber optic cable that we read 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.510
 and now we can stay here too 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.700
 operate our oven and it explodes 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.010
 Do not stop if we do so at some point 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.870
 a lot of electricity needs this 600,000 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.810
 no longer need the eu enough 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.170
 We can get up to one million mfs 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.400
 store electricity 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.000
 and yes, we'll do a little bit more 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.160
 Just like that, and yes, we'll just see that 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.100
 that is getting more and more power here and yes 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.500
 that's about a consumer now 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.140
 only a low voltage can off 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.080
 We have to operate it first 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.540
 mv in the mfs transformer as a halt 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.220
 has high voltage or just stop on one 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.720
 high voltage brings us that 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.220
 first down to medium voltage 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.489
 transform and then with one 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.680
 lv transformer that on the low 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.780
 then transform the voltage to stop it 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.100
 oven to use 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.230
 which devices need which voltage 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.120
 you have to either on the meadow of 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.050
 read wiki or just yourself 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.700
 try out 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.620
 Of course you can also use several devices 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.570
 operate with a power source to do so 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.940
 I just have a generator her 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.650
 punkig pure coal and then that is why 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.050
 saved in a blackbox bit 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.390
 and then goes behind a suitcase cable 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.940
 so long that all three devices 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.470
 be connected 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.840
 Also important is that you pay attention when 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.940
 Now you have a long stretch of cable 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.560
 wanted to put that your fiber optic cable 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.880
 used because they have only one off 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.470
 length of 40 meters a pleasure rate and 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.850
 yes, these copper cables stop off 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.709
 Four blocks far a loss rate one 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.120
 Of course, this does not necessarily mean electricity 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.310
 with a generator but produce 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.630
 can also switch to solar energy 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.220
 to the solar panels 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.440
 I already have a tutorial for that 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.290
 Made the produce in daylight 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.540
 current as we see and then there is 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.180
 still these geothermal generators here 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.430
 we can either lover or lava 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.290
 cells into it when I'm doing it 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.880
 just put the solar cells in here and 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.470
 then it is eaten and we see 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.380
 that his color has changed here and 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.330
 then I will produce electricity here 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.720
 i hope the tutorial will please until the 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.720
 next time
