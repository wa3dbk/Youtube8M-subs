little bit unfair about I guess about
what<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.569> did<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:36.930> some<00:02:37.110> choices<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:37.590> made<00:02:37.860> now

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
what I did in some choices I made now

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.180 
what I did in some choices I made now
invisible<00:02:39.630> chimp<00:02:40.080> actually<00:02:40.500> ran<00:02:40.709> around<00:02:40.860> that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
invisible chimp actually ran around that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.640 
invisible chimp actually ran around that
map<00:02:41.430> for<00:02:41.880> most<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.540> his<00:02:42.959> final<00:02:43.349> score

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
map for most of it and his final score

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.470 
map for most of it and his final score
was<00:02:43.860> something<00:02:44.190> obscene<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.880> he<00:02:45.299> had<00:02:45.390> only

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
was something obscene and he had only

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.440 
was something obscene and he had only
actually<00:02:45.900> died<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.730> small<00:02:47.730> number<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.120> times

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
actually died a small number of times

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.390 
actually died a small number of times
during<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.780> entire<00:02:48.989> gameplay<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:49.890> because<00:02:50.370> I

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
during the entire gameplay but because I

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.920 
during the entire gameplay but because I
don't<00:02:50.730> want<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.970> commentate<00:02:51.390> for<00:02:51.630> 10<00:02:51.750> minutes

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
don't want to commentate for 10 minutes

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.089 
don't want to commentate for 10 minutes
because<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.260> don't<00:02:52.410> think<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.650> guys<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.890> find

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099

that<00:02:53.190> entertaining<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.910> cut<00:02:54.209> out<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.480> best

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
that entertaining I cut out the best

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.839 
that entertaining I cut out the best
snippets<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.410> these<00:02:55.769> Moab's<00:02:56.190> sometimes

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
snippets of these Moab's sometimes

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.970 
snippets of these Moab's sometimes
depending<00:02:57.360> on<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:58.140> different<00:02:58.290> situation<00:02:58.890> in

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
depending on the different situation in

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.100 
depending on the different situation in
a<00:02:59.069> different<00:02:59.340> gameplay<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.269> he<00:03:00.569> actually<00:03:00.750> was

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
a different gameplay so he actually was

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.449 
a different gameplay so he actually was
running<00:03:01.410> around<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.739> lot<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.099> he<00:03:02.250> wasn't

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
running around a lot and he wasn't

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.670 
running around a lot and he wasn't
camping<00:03:03.030> for<00:03:03.209> most<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.630> game<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.440> think

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
camping for most of the game and I think

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.229 
camping for most of the game and I think
that<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.160> was<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.310> little<00:03:05.430> bit<00:03:05.579> unfair<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.120> him

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
that that was a little bit unfair to him

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.930 
that that was a little bit unfair to him
and<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.780> apologize<00:03:07.019> for<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.819> so<00:03:08.819> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
and I have to apologize for that so the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.729 
and I have to apologize for that so the
final<00:03:09.120> comment<00:03:09.540> I'm<00:03:09.630> gonna<00:03:09.780> throw<00:03:10.110> up<00:03:10.140> here<00:03:10.530> is

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739

controversial<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:26.040> think<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.519> comment<00:03:26.850> was<00:03:26.880> a

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
controversial I think that comment was a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.370 
controversial I think that comment was a
little<00:03:27.209> harsh<00:03:27.450> but<00:03:27.540> once<00:03:27.840> again<00:03:27.930> that's<00:03:28.230> my

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
little harsh but once again that's my

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.080
