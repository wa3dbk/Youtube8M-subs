 The feeling of the fishing rod is oyster curve and elasticity 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:17.970
 I heard a lot about pro-duro lure fishing pros. 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:21.329
 Lie down and look at the fishing rod . I can see it in two big ways. 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.439
 First of all, let's start with the most common yotta 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.640
 Requirements Spinning I'm talking about a long-range requirement Spinning reel requirements Spinning fishing rod 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.270
 Now let 's talk 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.880
 Freedom combination we often Throw Fishing Toka Toka's common gaetbawi 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.730
 I'm lying, I'm the type I see the most. 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.790
 It's lightweight , it's small , it's low, and it's easy to cast. 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.380
 I will allow you to be part of the 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:53.579
 If you have a big party like this feature words are Lili 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:57.930
 Once we have such a big catch when fishing under catch your hand on the handle 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:02.489
 And then called the yoga guide through which the line passes. 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.640
 Part, but the guide form is different from the other equipment . 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.640
 character 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.870
 Yoge I'd just told, uh Beit equipment bay tree bait casting reel requirements 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.070
 It's a date fishing pole. 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:20.320
 I'm the official name bait casting of characters here 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.760
 Preview Back when I took a hand when Neil would have been so gripped gripping hand 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.320
 It 's a Yoron type coming up . 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.020
 And the mechanism that the line winds up is the Spinning Maintenance 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:35.260
 Can I get the line than other forms gamge 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:39.010
 The advantage of the case is that it is a little heavy and you can fly easily 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:44.500
 And then it uses, the more important thing to be a thick line fishing 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.610
 Now that that's part of it is fairly straightforward, so this example so doing 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.500
 It's always like this. 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.330
 Just before spring maintenance and the other is the size of the guide is the first editor John 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.170
 Part of small size 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.570
 The thing is related to the mechanism that my line is winding, 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.370
 You can see the difference. 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.560
 LaCie is also a name for the mouth . Even if you are a beginner, 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:10.510
 I need to be locked up 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.540
 Why you do not'd know at least this much should know 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.540
