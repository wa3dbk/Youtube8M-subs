the background to bleach a little so

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.170 
the background to bleach a little so
you'll<00:02:06.159> need<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.430> adjust<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.790> power<00:02:06.940> of<00:02:07.090> the

you'll need to adjust the power of the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.899 
you'll need to adjust the power of the
gel<00:02:07.390> as<00:02:07.600> necessary<00:02:08.220> right<00:02:09.220> let's<00:02:09.640> take<00:02:09.759> some

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
gel as necessary right let's take some

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:29.180 
gel as necessary right let's take some
test<00:02:10.119> shots

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.470 

right<00:02:30.190> let's<00:02:30.640> drop<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.820> lie<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.240> it's<00:02:31.360> such<00:02:31.450> a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
right let's drop a lie and it's such a

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.120 
right let's drop a lie and it's such a
few<00:02:31.720> soft<00:02:31.960> boxes<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.530> remaining<00:02:32.800> three

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
few soft boxes to the remaining three

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.430 
few soft boxes to the remaining three
heads<00:02:33.370> I'm<00:02:34.240> using<00:02:34.390> one<00:02:34.630> soft<00:02:34.930> box<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.230> lift<00:02:35.380> the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
heads I'm using one soft box to lift the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.200 
heads I'm using one soft box to lift the
models<00:02:35.710> hair<00:02:35.920> from<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.160> background<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
models hair from the background the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.030 
models hair from the background the
second<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.750> add<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.900> little<00:02:38.140> fill<00:02:38.350> light<00:02:38.590> and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
second to add a little fill light and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.520 
second to add a little fill light and
the<00:02:39.220> third<00:02:39.460> light<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:39.910> key<00:02:40.290> we've<00:02:41.290> got<00:02:41.410> to

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
the third light is a key we've got to

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.140 
the third light is a key we've got to
start<00:02:41.770> by<00:02:41.920> setting<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.430> key<00:02:42.610> light<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:42.970> about

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
start by setting the key light to about

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.180 
start by setting the key light to about
f11<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:43.930> then<00:02:44.350> metering<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.800> rest<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.100> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
f11 and then metering the rest of the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.850 
f11 and then metering the rest of the
lights<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.640> create<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:45.970> effect<00:02:46.180> I'm<00:02:46.300> after<00:02:46.630> I

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
lights to create the effect I'm after I

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.500 
lights to create the effect I'm after I
think<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:48.040> black<00:02:48.220> backdrop<00:02:48.430> will<00:02:49.060> really<00:02:49.390> help

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
think a black backdrop will really help

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.670 
think a black backdrop will really help
the<00:02:49.660> model<00:02:49.900> contrast<00:02:50.350> against<00:02:50.620> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
the model contrast against the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.990 
the model contrast against the
background<00:02:56.250> okay<00:02:57.250> let's<00:02:57.459> check<00:02:57.550> this<00:02:57.670> out<00:02:57.820> for

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
background okay let's check this out for

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.790 
background okay let's check this out for
a<00:02:58.030> final<00:02:58.330> age<00:02:58.510> basically<00:02:59.290> we<00:02:59.380> start<00:02:59.650> with

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
a final age basically we start with

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.710 
a final age basically we start with
three<00:03:00.010> lights<00:03:00.250> we've<00:03:01.030> pulled<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.360> gray<00:03:01.480> paper

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
three lights we've pulled the gray paper

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.420 
three lights we've pulled the gray paper
background<00:03:02.020> down<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.860> we<00:03:02.920> swap<00:03:03.100> one<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
background down and we swap one of the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.520 
background down and we swap one of the
soft<00:03:03.640> boxes<00:03:04.060> were<00:03:04.360> set<00:03:04.510> at<00:03:04.600> barn<00:03:04.810> doors<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.410> a

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
soft boxes were set at barn doors and a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.010 
soft boxes were set at barn doors and a
red<00:03:05.680> gel<00:03:05.950> I've<00:03:06.880> removed<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.209> second<00:03:07.540> softbox

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
red gel I've removed the second softbox

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.870 
red gel I've removed the second softbox
and<00:03:08.290> replace<00:03:08.739> this<00:03:08.920> with<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.160> honeycomb<00:03:09.430> grid

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
and replace this with the honeycomb grid

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.910 
and replace this with the honeycomb grid
this<00:03:10.720> will<00:03:10.900> light<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.200> back<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.590> hair<00:03:11.770> and

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
this will light the back of the hair and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.470 
this will light the back of the hair and
shoulders<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.459> model<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:12.880> have<00:03:13.300> some

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
shoulders of the model and have some

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.000 
shoulders of the model and have some
separation<00:03:13.660> from<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.380> strong<00:03:14.620> background

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010

where<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:51.660> gel<00:04:51.870> comes<00:04:52.110> out<00:04:52.259> very<00:04:52.800> rich<00:04:53.160> why

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
where the gel comes out very rich why

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.360

not<00:04:53.849> try<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.120> gray<00:04:54.570> or<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.900> black<00:04:55.410> one<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:55.979> it

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
not try a gray or a black one and it

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.450 
not try a gray or a black one and it
just<00:04:56.639> gives<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:56.910> slightly<00:04:57.330> different<00:04:57.599> color
