then I'll show you the next step I'm
gonna<00:02:28.750> add<00:02:29.020> it<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.260> my<00:02:29.320> fruit<00:02:29.620> pectin<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.310> this

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
gonna add it in my fruit pectin and this

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.290 
gonna add it in my fruit pectin and this
is<00:02:30.820> what<00:02:30.970> gives<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.360> jammy<00:02:31.810> consistency

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
is what gives it that jammy consistency

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.460 
is what gives it that jammy consistency
stir<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:34.480> in<00:02:34.660> really<00:02:34.990> well

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
now I'm gonna put in all the sugar and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.650 
now I'm gonna put in all the sugar and
it<00:02:40.330> is<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.510> lot<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.870> sugar<00:02:41.140> but<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.710> is<00:02:41.860> just

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
it is a lot of sugar but that is just

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.840 
it is a lot of sugar but that is just
that's<00:02:43.660> what<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.710> takes<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.370> make<00:02:45.520> homemade

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
that's what it takes to make homemade

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.720 
that's what it takes to make homemade
jam<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.500> I'm<00:02:47.590> gonna<00:02:47.830> give<00:02:48.040> this<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.280> stir<00:02:48.340> really

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.880 

the<00:02:54.970> sugars<00:02:55.330> all<00:02:55.510> mixed<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:56.020> now<00:02:56.680> I'm<00:02:56.740> gonna

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
the sugars all mixed in now I'm gonna

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.430 
the sugars all mixed in now I'm gonna
put<00:02:57.130> in<00:02:57.310> my<00:02:57.370> candy<00:02:57.760> thermometer<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:59.290> I'm

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.670 
away until it reaches 220 degrees I
mixed<00:03:06.940> raise<00:03:07.090> up<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.510> 220<00:03:08.550> take<00:03:09.550> out<00:03:09.730> my

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
mixed raise up to 220 take out my

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.760 
mixed raise up to 220 take out my
thermometer<00:03:12.690> you're<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.810> stirrer<00:03:14.350> and

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
thermometer you're the stirrer and

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.850 
thermometer you're the stirrer and
making<00:03:15.610> jam<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.390> science<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:17.560> there<00:03:17.740> are

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
making jam is a science so there are

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.220 
making jam is a science so there are
these<00:03:18.130> tools<00:03:18.490> I<00:03:18.760> feel<00:03:18.940> like<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.209> need<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.020> have

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
off all the foam that's collected on the

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.900 
off all the foam that's collected on the
top<00:03:26.010> or<00:03:27.010> as<00:03:27.340> much<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.239> as<00:03:28.360> you<00:03:28.510> can<00:03:28.660> manage

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
I've skimmed all of my phone where's

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.490 
I've skimmed all of my phone where's
most<00:03:33.370> of<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:33.700> off<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:33.970> top<00:03:34.300> so<00:03:35.080> now<00:03:35.290> we're

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
most of it off the top so now we're

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.310 
most of it off the top so now we're
ready<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.860> pretty<00:03:36.130> much<00:03:36.250> get<00:03:36.550> canning<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:37.750> you

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
ready to pretty much get canning so you

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.070 
ready to pretty much get canning so you
take<00:03:38.590> your<00:03:39.090> place<00:03:40.090> in<00:03:40.300> jars<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.690> had<00:03:40.900> been

take your place in jars that had been
simmering<00:03:41.620> water<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:43.150> get<00:03:43.269> rid<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.720> water

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
simmering water you get rid of the water

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:54.900 
simmering water you get rid of the water
line<00:03:46.750> them<00:03:46.959> up<00:03:50.130> okay<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:51.820> now<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:53.200> take<00:03:53.910> a

line them up okay so now you take a
little<00:03:55.630> bit<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:56.650> take<00:03:56.860> a<00:03:56.890> canning<00:03:57.340> funnel<00:03:57.519> put

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
little bit you take a canning funnel put

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.810 
little bit you take a canning funnel put
it<00:03:58.480> in<00:03:58.660> each<00:03:58.930> one<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.530> you're<00:04:00.280> gonna<00:04:00.370> fill<00:04:00.670> it
