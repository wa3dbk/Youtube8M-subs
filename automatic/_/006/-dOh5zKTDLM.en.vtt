00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
like transporting hazardous material

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.760 
like transporting hazardous material
yeah<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:02.420> scared<00:04:02.660> me<00:04:02.900> more<00:04:03.200> than<00:04:03.380> even

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
yeah that scared me more than even

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.290 
yeah that scared me more than even
thinking<00:04:04.190> about<00:04:04.220> cancer<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:04.940> we're<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:05.210> the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
thinking about cancer and we're like the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.020 
thinking about cancer and we're like the
place<00:04:05.630> and<00:04:05.930> remembers<00:04:06.530> them<00:04:06.770> yeah<00:04:07.130> because<00:04:07.640> of

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
place and remembers them yeah because of

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.060 
place and remembers them yeah because of
the<00:04:08.210> chemotherapy<00:04:09.200> that<00:04:09.230> destroys<00:04:09.890> your

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
the chemotherapy that destroys your

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.100 
the chemotherapy that destroys your
immune<00:04:10.370> system<00:04:10.610> so<00:04:11.090> my<00:04:11.240> doctor<00:04:11.420> said<00:04:11.870> I<00:04:11.900> have

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
immune system so my doctor said I have

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.660 
immune system so my doctor said I have
to<00:04:12.140> stay<00:04:12.410> away<00:04:12.620> from<00:04:12.650> fresh<00:04:13.070> flowers<00:04:13.520> and

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
to stay away from fresh flowers and

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.180 
to stay away from fresh flowers and
fresh<00:04:13.880> fruit<00:04:14.090> because<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:15.260> bacteria<00:04:15.920> could

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
fresh fruit because a bacteria could

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.310 
fresh fruit because a bacteria could
cause<00:04:17.120> an<00:04:17.299> infection<00:04:17.420> than<00:04:17.870> it<00:04:17.989> might<00:04:18.109> not

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
cause an infection than it might not

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.629 
cause an infection than it might not
recover<00:04:18.859> from

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
recover from

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.369 
recover from
so<00:04:19.909> I<00:04:21.310> was<00:04:22.310> like<00:04:22.460> that<00:04:22.759> it<00:04:23.060> just<00:04:23.539> didn't<00:04:24.289> make

00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:24.379 
so I was like that it just didn't make

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.559 
so I was like that it just didn't make
any<00:04:24.439> sense<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:25.189> destroy<00:04:25.999> my<00:04:26.210> immune<00:04:26.479> system

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:26.569 
any sense to destroy my immune system

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.200 
any sense to destroy my immune system
with<00:04:27.080> radicals<00:04:27.620> but<00:04:28.039> to<00:04:28.759> get<00:04:28.909> rid<00:04:29.060> of<00:04:29.090> the

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
with radicals but to get rid of the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.450 
with radicals but to get rid of the
cancer<00:04:29.419> when<00:04:29.960> i<00:04:29.990> say<00:04:30.169> abuse<00:04:30.499> it<00:04:30.680> will<00:04:31.159> build<00:04:31.400> up

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
cancer when i say abuse it will build up

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.429 
cancer when i say abuse it will build up
exactly<00:04:32.120> made<00:04:32.479> more<00:04:32.689> sense<00:04:32.900> for<00:04:33.050> me<00:04:33.199> to<00:04:33.229> build

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:33.439 
exactly made more sense for me to build

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.320 
exactly made more sense for me to build
up<00:04:33.620> my<00:04:33.770> immune<00:04:34.009> system<00:04:34.039> and<00:04:34.490> let<00:04:34.669> my<00:04:34.789> body<00:04:34.819> do

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
up my immune system and let my body do

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.800 
up my immune system and let my body do
what<00:04:35.360> it's<00:04:35.719> naturally<00:04:36.110> designed<00:04:36.379> to<00:04:36.560> do<00:04:36.710> and

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
what it's naturally designed to do and

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.929 
what it's naturally designed to do and
four<00:04:38.810> months<00:04:39.080> later<00:04:39.139> amazingly<00:04:40.129> i<00:04:40.370> thought<00:04:40.849> it

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 
four months later amazingly i thought it

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.850 
four months later amazingly i thought it
won't<00:04:41.060> take<00:04:41.240> longer<00:04:41.539> but<00:04:42.080> i<00:04:42.560> knew<00:04:42.680> it<00:04:42.740> was

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
won't take longer but i knew it was

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.899 
won't take longer but i knew it was
going<00:04:42.949> to<00:04:43.039> happen<00:04:43.159> i<00:04:43.400> thought<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:43.699> was<00:04:43.819> going

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:43.909 
going to happen i thought it was going

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.850 
going to happen i thought it was going
to<00:04:43.969> take<00:04:44.120> longer<00:04:44.389> like<00:04:44.749> really<00:04:45.199> but<00:04:45.499> four
