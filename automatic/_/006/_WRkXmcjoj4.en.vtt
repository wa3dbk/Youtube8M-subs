00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
seagull but you know the similarities

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.140 
seagull but you know the similarities
would<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> types<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.369> tackle<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:18.000> know<00:01:18.119> I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
would be the types of tackle you know I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.789 
would be the types of tackle you know I
mean<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.810> too<00:01:18.930> crazy<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.409> going<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
right kind of hooks circle hooks you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.020 
right kind of hooks circle hooks you
know<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.860> where<00:01:35.040> we<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.250> hook<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> fish<00:01:35.700> and

know to where we can hook the fish and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.520 
know to where we can hook the fish and
get<00:01:36.570> them<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> structure<00:01:37.380> that

get them out of the structure that

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.230 
get them out of the structure that
probably<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> main<00:01:38.159> similarity<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.060> type

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
probably the main similarity is the type

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.780 
probably the main similarity is the type
of<00:01:39.270> tackle<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.040> kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> bait<00:01:41.460> close

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
of tackle the right kind of bait close

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.219 
of tackle the right kind of bait close
to<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> whatever<00:01:42.329> structure<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.020> no

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
to the whatever structure it is no

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.480 
to the whatever structure it is no
matter<00:01:43.350> what<00:01:43.439> species<00:01:43.740> you're<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.159> after

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
matter what species you're going after
it's<00:01:44.729> very<00:01:44.909> similar<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.360> respect<00:01:45.570> it's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
it's very similar in that respect it's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.310 
it's very similar in that respect it's
