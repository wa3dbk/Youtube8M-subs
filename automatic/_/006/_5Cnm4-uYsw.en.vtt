00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
played Jason in this one again very hard

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.430

to<00:02:16.790> get<00:02:16.910> hold<00:02:17.120> off<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:19.840> can't<00:02:20.840> decide<00:02:21.200> between

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
to get hold off I can't decide between

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.230 
to get hold off I can't decide between
the<00:02:21.740> platform<00:02:22.190> part<00:02:22.490> six<00:02:22.820> which<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.060> the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
the platform part six which is the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.720 
the platform part six which is the
hardest<00:02:23.690> but<00:02:23.930> but<00:02:24.770> this<00:02:24.890> guy<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.190> quite<00:02:25.520> hard

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
hardest but but this guy is quite hard

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.730 
hardest but but this guy is quite hard
to<00:02:25.790> get<00:02:25.940> hold<00:02:26.060> off

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
to get hold off

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.490 
to get hold off
so<00:02:27.740> that's<00:02:28.510> Jason<00:02:29.510> as<00:02:29.660> seen<00:02:29.900> in<00:02:29.930> part

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.640 
so that's Jason as seen in part
for<00:02:32.500> all<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.010> should<00:02:33.280> say<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.819> final<00:02:34.180> chapter

two<00:04:28.750> of<00:04:28.900> these<00:04:29.050> guys<00:04:29.380> I<00:04:29.620> don't<00:04:29.800> think<00:04:29.860> there's

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
two of these guys I don't think there's

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.660

eight<00:04:30.340> figures

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
eight figures

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.650 
eight figures
but<00:04:33.670> yeah<00:04:33.820> oh<00:04:34.120> oh<00:04:34.990> fairly<00:04:35.350> good<00:04:35.530> figures<00:04:35.920> I

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
but yeah oh oh fairly good figures I

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.850 
but yeah oh oh fairly good figures I
personally<00:04:37.950> would<00:04:38.950> rather<00:04:39.190> collect<00:04:40.180> the

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
personally would rather collect the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.770 
personally would rather collect the
advise<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:42.340> click<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.910> Necker<00:04:43.540> ones<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:44.670> for

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
advise to click the Necker ones a for

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.930 
advise to click the Necker ones a for
financial<00:04:46.780> reasons<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.500> B<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:48.100> just<00:04:48.490> think

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
financial reasons and B I just think

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.430 
financial reasons and B I just think
they're<00:04:49.150> they're<00:04:49.480> better<00:04:49.690> figures<00:04:50.140> to<00:04:50.320> be

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
they're they're better figures to be

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.410 
they're they're better figures to be
honest<00:04:51.870> although<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:54.520> know<00:04:54.700> as<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:55.000> say<00:04:55.210> the

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
honest although you know as I say the

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.380 
honest although you know as I say the
mezco<00:04:55.900> ones<00:04:56.110> have<00:04:56.410> become<00:04:56.740> rarer<00:04:57.070> and<00:04:57.460> harder

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
mezco ones have become rarer and harder

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.830 
mezco ones have become rarer and harder
to<00:04:58.540> get<00:04:58.630> hold<00:04:58.870> off<00:04:59.050> so<00:04:59.920> if<00:05:00.580> you're<00:05:00.790> looking<00:05:00.970> to
