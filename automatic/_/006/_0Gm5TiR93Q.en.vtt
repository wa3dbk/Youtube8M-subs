of<00:02:54.580> thirty<00:02:55.239> pounds<00:02:55.690> just<00:02:55.900> up<00:02:56.049> just<00:02:56.350> around

eight<00:02:56.830> pounds<00:02:57.160> per<00:02:57.310> terabyte<00:02:57.549> so<00:02:58.420> six

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
eight pounds per terabyte so six

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.690 
eight pounds per terabyte so six
terabytes<00:02:59.500> would<00:02:59.769> have<00:02:59.860> cost<00:03:00.069> me<00:03:00.160> almost<00:03:00.489> one

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
hundred and eighty pounds anyway I think

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.320 
hundred and eighty pounds anyway I think
come<00:03:02.319> up<00:03:02.410> 275<00:03:03.310> pounds<00:03:03.670> something<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:04.150> that

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
come up 275 pounds something like that

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.050 
come up 275 pounds something like that
but<00:03:04.540> just<00:03:04.930> round<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.410> up<00:03:05.470> 180<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.760> it's<00:03:06.849> a<00:03:06.910> very

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
but just round it up 180 so it's a very

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.059 
but just round it up 180 so it's a very

shipping fees and handling fees and you

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.880 
shipping fees and handling fees and you
know<00:03:13.299> certain<00:03:13.630> taxes<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.230> sort<00:03:14.470> take<00:03:14.590> care<00:03:14.769> of

but<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.070> came<00:03:15.340> up<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.670> an<00:03:16.540> extra<00:03:16.870> $30<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:17.590> top

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
but that came up to an extra $30 on top

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.770 
but that came up to an extra $30 on top
so<00:03:18.160> it's<00:03:18.280> an<00:03:18.340> extra<00:03:18.549> 18<00:03:18.850> pounds<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:19.359> know<00:03:19.480> on

so it's an extra 18 pounds you know on

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.259 
so it's an extra 18 pounds you know on
top<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.410> 180<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.430> then<00:03:21.549> that's<00:03:21.850> worth<00:03:22.060> it

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
top of the 180 and then that's worth it

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.849 
top of the 180 and then that's worth it
I<00:03:22.359> mean<00:03:22.510> if<00:03:22.840> you're<00:03:23.109> really<00:03:23.140> after<00:03:23.769> the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
capacity and extra 18 pounds to pay it's

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.960 
capacity and extra 18 pounds to pay it's
nothing<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.829> know<00:03:26.920> well<00:03:27.910> worth<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:29.280> yeah<00:03:30.280> if

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970

nothing you know well worth it yeah if
you<00:03:31.239> want<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.450> have<00:03:31.570> a<00:03:31.630> lower<00:03:31.810> size<00:03:32.019> drive<00:03:32.320> you

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
you want to have a lower size drive you

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.380 
you want to have a lower size drive you
know<00:03:32.890> not<00:03:33.040> as<00:03:33.130> large<00:03:33.310> as<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.519> six<00:03:33.850> but<00:03:34.000> above<00:03:34.269> the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
know not as large as a six but above the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.240 
know not as large as a six but above the
two<00:03:34.569> then<00:03:35.049> yeah<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.440> can<00:03:35.739> use<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:35.950> three

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
two then yeah you can use a three

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.949 
two then yeah you can use a three
terabytes<00:03:36.670> I've<00:03:36.819> tested<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.269> four

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
terabytes I've tested that four

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.479 
terabytes I've tested that four
terabytes<00:03:38.290> will<00:03:38.560> work<00:03:38.739> because<00:03:38.950> six<00:03:39.340> is

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
terabytes will work because six is

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.340 
terabytes will work because six is
supported<00:03:39.970> but<00:03:40.450> obviously<00:03:40.780> such<00:03:41.079> large

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
supported but obviously such large

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.750 
supported but obviously such large
capacities<00:03:41.859> aren't<00:03:42.100> for<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.579> know<00:03:42.670> you

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
capacities aren't for you you know you

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.490 
capacities aren't for you you know you
want<00:03:42.910> anything<00:03:43.209> below<00:03:43.480> two<00:03:43.840> terabytes<00:03:44.290> then

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
want anything below two terabytes then

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.440 
want anything below two terabytes then
you<00:03:44.590> can<00:03:44.769> just<00:03:44.920> use<00:03:45.069> a<00:03:45.100> standard<00:03:45.340> 2.5<00:03:46.090> inches

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
you can just use a standard 2.5 inches

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.319 
you can just use a standard 2.5 inches
which<00:03:47.049> do<00:03:47.230> go<00:03:47.380> offer<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.950> up<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.340> two

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
which do go offer you up to two

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.430 
which do go offer you up to two
terabytes<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:50.260> data<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.850> I<00:03:52.319> think<00:03:53.319> that

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
terabytes of of data and I think that

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.990 
terabytes of of data and I think that
about<00:03:53.590> covers<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:54.040> you've<00:03:54.190> seen<00:03:54.340> an<00:03:54.549> example

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
about covers that you've seen an example

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.490 
about covers that you've seen an example
of<00:03:55.120> gaming<00:03:55.690> session<00:03:55.989> you've<00:03:56.109> seen<00:03:56.319> the

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
of gaming session you've seen the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.949 
of gaming session you've seen the
performance<00:03:56.889> and<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.400> navigation<00:03:57.549> through<00:03:58.180> the

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
performance and a navigation through the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.470 
performance and a navigation through the
various<00:03:59.260> menu<00:03:59.680> menus<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.430> titles<00:04:00.850> you've

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
various menu menus and titles you've

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.699 
various menu menus and titles you've
seen<00:04:01.660> me<00:04:01.780> go<00:04:01.900> back<00:04:02.109> in<00:04:02.319> and<00:04:02.470> out<00:04:02.530> of<00:04:02.650> the

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
seen me go back in and out of the

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.979 
seen me go back in and out of the

PlayStation Store you know various times

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.229 
PlayStation Store you know various times
and<00:04:05.380> it's<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.920> would<00:04:06.760> say<00:04:06.880> it's<00:04:07.180> very

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
and it's I would say it's very

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.550 
and it's I would say it's very
acceptable<00:04:07.870> is<00:04:08.049> it's<00:04:08.260> more<00:04:08.440> or<00:04:08.530> less

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
acceptable is it's more or less

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.259 
acceptable is it's more or less
instantaneous<00:04:09.370> I'll<00:04:09.519> do<00:04:09.639> a<00:04:09.700> quick<00:04:09.850> trophy

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
sink

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.010 
sink
and<00:04:11.890> there<00:04:12.890> you<00:04:12.980> go<00:04:13.130> that's<00:04:13.660> that's<00:04:14.660> done<00:04:14.870> as

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
and there you go that's that's done as

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.990 
and there you go that's that's done as
well<00:04:17.739> so<00:04:18.739> yeah<00:04:18.889> you<00:04:19.340> know<00:04:19.370> if<00:04:19.579> you<00:04:19.670> want<00:04:19.790> a<00:04:19.820> six

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000

well so yeah you know if you want a six
terabyte<00:04:20.329> drive<00:04:20.829> inside<00:04:21.829> your<00:04:22.010> Playstation<00:04:22.460> 4

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
terabyte drive inside your Playstation 4

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.280 
terabyte drive inside your Playstation 4
technically<00:04:23.270> it's<00:04:23.389> not<00:04:23.450> really<00:04:23.720> inside<00:04:24.020> but

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
technically it's not really inside but

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.790 
technically it's not really inside but
you<00:04:24.950> get<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.160> drift<00:04:25.280> you<00:04:26.440> want<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:27.500> all<00:04:27.590> hooked

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
you get the drift you want it all hooked

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.340 
you get the drift you want it all hooked
up<00:04:28.010> you<00:04:28.430> can<00:04:28.639> do<00:04:28.820> up<00:04:29.450> to<00:04:29.630> six<00:04:29.780> terabytes<00:04:30.020> I

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
up you can do up to six terabytes I

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.720 
up you can do up to six terabytes I
would<00:04:30.530> have<00:04:30.620> loved<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.040> test<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.520> with<00:04:31.700> the

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
would have loved to test it with the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.370 
would have loved to test it with the
with<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.360> 8<00:04:32.480> terabytes<00:04:32.630> but<00:04:33.080> I<00:04:33.139> think<00:04:33.290> that

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
with the 8 terabytes but I think that

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.020 
with the 8 terabytes but I think that
would<00:04:33.470> have<00:04:33.530> been<00:04:33.590> overkill<00:04:34.010> price<00:04:34.400> plus<00:04:34.790> them

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
would have been overkill price plus them

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.659 
would have been overkill price plus them
because<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.540> drive<00:04:35.780> is<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.110> rare<00:04:36.470> I<00:04:36.680> think<00:04:37.400> it

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
because the drive is so rare I think it

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.370 
because the drive is so rare I think it
was<00:04:37.760> costing<00:04:38.300> me<00:04:38.360> sort<00:04:38.630> of<00:04:38.690> like<00:04:38.750> four<00:04:39.110> hundred

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
was costing me sort of like four hundred

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.440 
was costing me sort of like four hundred
pounds<00:04:39.710> which<00:04:39.860> is<00:04:39.889> which<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:40.400> over<00:04:40.610> $600<00:04:41.300> I

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
pounds which is which is over $600 I

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.270 
pounds which is which is over $600 I
remember<00:04:41.870> something<00:04:42.470> like<00:04:42.620> there<00:04:42.919> was<00:04:43.040> it<00:04:43.190> was

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
remember something like there was it was

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.430 
remember something like there was it was
some<00:04:43.430> stupidly<00:04:44.390> ridiculous<00:04:44.900> price<00:04:45.110> for<00:04:45.380> an

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
some stupidly ridiculous price for an

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.260 
some stupidly ridiculous price for an
extra<00:04:45.650> 2<00:04:45.740> terabytes<00:04:46.160> when<00:04:46.850> I<00:04:46.880> was<00:04:47.030> getting

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
extra 2 terabytes when I was getting

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.880 
extra 2 terabytes when I was getting
this<00:04:47.360> for<00:04:47.570> 180<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:48.080> know<00:04:48.169> is<00:04:48.290> over<00:04:48.410> double<00:04:48.860> the

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
this for 180 you know is over double the

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.940 
this for 180 you know is over double the
price<00:04:49.450> so<00:04:50.450> yeah<00:04:51.050> you<00:04:51.260> know<00:04:51.550> hope<00:04:52.550> this<00:04:52.700> helps
