00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.030
 more people Niamey that of course I'm still making a video I know 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.819
 no song did not keep my promise 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.550
 Although he is not a world power sorbier jersey this is where no wind blows 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.159
 but an atomic bomb the whole comes out of that is the KEB 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:21.980
 Mor coins 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.220
 I have not seen me anymore because I show RatzenbÃ¶ck 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.720
 but it's not quite as wild as he thinks but bad 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.399
 you will see so well 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.699
 I have not just pulled a life down a bit 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.050
 Sutter himself be inflamed 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.590
 Karaca colorful market neat and will have a look 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.400
 and the whole has led in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.320
 and who drive themselves 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.170
 There he answers promptly denied 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.670
 like the radar 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.280
 the trucks work 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.170
 but once again Lubmin filed brilliantly 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.690
 more popular 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.690
 Zoellick 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.710
 so put into what looks beautiful best suits one 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.470
 he is not exactly beautiful 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.330
 it does not matter we can take something like this, for example 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.820
 Point remained 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.550
 to build such an idea 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.550
 Lindemann 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.690
 the workshop will be 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.690
 in the head 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.450
 and is all the way to empty 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.450
 SID as a highlight ride on course 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 finally allowed 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:17.079
 but annually would 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.079
 Profit is no sport either 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.779
 Leipzig 15 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.369
 the existence 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:39.719
 that is absolutely necessary 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.719
 should Pechstein 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.199
 Program if you put down such a performance 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.179
 have been asked 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.769
 so back 40 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.189
 Federation and countries 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.189
 Ferguson was also injured and Aubin lengthened 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.479
 just by doing that here 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.289
 one outside around connection and one 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.749
 in between you also a top and then just continue in the duty 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.269
 it does not happen that way 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.720
 for unexplained reasons to scribe this quantity St 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.569
 the sailors and be forgiven miserably 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.039
 we did 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:48.759
 at a low point the broker 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:52.959
 more that has 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.959
 Lowenstein 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.340
 Utl just four times Cabral Stocker Basel with 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.559
 something of value to everyone 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.309
 yes, do not buy the comparison 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.369
 to create leaks through banks themselves 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.319
 Now it works again 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.479
 Now the lie has become a natural bath in no time 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.960
 so listen to St 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.129
 they are quite appealing 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.430
 as you are interested in the sea - from IZ the plans of this place you from 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.499
 The goal is even louder threw these now not so sparkling but 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.490
 now is also pretty best source 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.509
 and Vattenfall as elsewhere 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.809
 because you know what these big-brockhoffs are
