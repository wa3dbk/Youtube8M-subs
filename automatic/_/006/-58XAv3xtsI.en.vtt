 we speak is living and it is well 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:12.230
 sure is going to return to rosario the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.230
 return 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.609
 Efe 18 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.539
 we talked before we talked about you 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.359
 return its fullness with fullness 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.520
 who came back ruben frame 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.770
 as we said of mouth sorry this 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.059
 mouth cut that ghana in cordoba 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.890
 in front of the building 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.230
 this also marks a bit the authority 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.329
 central of a key date versus new 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.340
 the classic visitor being when he had 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.500
 than showing the artist sheet for 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.110
 pelé championship wins the classic quarter 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.770
 consecutive to the thread and also it 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.350
 positions at the top of the table with 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.390
 55 points we continue analyzing what was 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.289
 this rosarino classic but we have 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.410
 images of what was the celebration of the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.410
 players 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.630
 to the intimate intimate 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.050
 no no 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.640
 celebrations that are already running in the 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.950
 central network that you have to recognize that 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.870
 It also comes on a streak so 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.040
 pressure on the news side because this 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.040
 is the fourth consecutive classic 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.920
 they return to play 24 that is going to be the date 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.160
 of classics play in the giant of 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.760
 little arroyito just said something interesting 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.600
 branca the central rosary did not feel the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.060
 pressure to play as a visitor and it's something 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.540
 mentally not easy to handle in a 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:34.520
 classic of these characteristics in a 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:38.440
 party and the visitor endured it in his 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.440
 I played them against the agents 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.510
 the match was going for a 0 to 0 was a 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.430
 frightening party seen with eyes of 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.450
 total is a very bad frightful match 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.920
 played pure work for me of the two 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.709
 hard fight 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.340
 that the goal unlocks with an error 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.390
 garrafal of between the coti fernández and 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.880
 ustari 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.110
 I was going for a 0 to 0 he held it well 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.330
 planted in his field the games against 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.130
 Now that does not seem to me to be much more 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.600
 that the result that explains you there is no 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.400
 much more than what you think is not that 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.170
 talking about the teams that are the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.620
 image and likeness of the coaches 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.110
 the guy seems to me a character 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.670
 touching poignant wonderful that you 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.370
 does football very well beyond that 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.230
 the trainings suffer tonight 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.170
 especially but I think that in this 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.630
 case this games that are played with the 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.840
 level of friction and tension as the 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.989
 classic rosarino does not have the same in 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.750
 other areas are a mouth-river a 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.750
 gymnastics students are workshops but 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.730
 now no no does not have this attention and I 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.590
 it seems that the degree of madness of the 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.220
 coach said this chacho masters 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.720
 great hug the fiery darling this 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.160
 it ends up helping it ends when 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.320
 because in addition that is able to rise and 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.920
 come down it was just the guy is not 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.900
 acting 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.000
 the guy becomes completely nutty 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.459
 when the criminal shouts and I see it from here 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.500
 then it goes down and manages to communicate and 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.790
 establishes a minimum dialogue that 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.709
 It seems that this also happens with the 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.470
 players is a guy capable of grabbing 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.720
 from the neck to one to bring it back 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.850
 to the party but is also capable of 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.190
 order and put one the other one change 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.700
 so I with respect to these parties 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.950
 let's say also left a little on the side 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.360
 the issue of whistleblower and other ccoo 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.950
 because the first time you play 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.540
 the classic that one of the two wins 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.520
 four consecutive games so that 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.440
 this is to see from Mariano that is very 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.870
 I want to say a little something 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.270
 skinny favor we do to this situation 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.970
 that we criticize so many times of the 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.940
 violence and riots and fights 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.520
 the deaths if we decide that the classic 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.800
 you play to die that it does not matter anything that 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.990
 win 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.000
 exclusive of the discursive because 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:05:00.260
 then after we stop in 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.120
 the one who did that is what happens inside 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.160
 that field when you leave the court in 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.970
 hot we started 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.600
 I say later if we like to say love 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:15.050
 it does not matter anything to play not to win as 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:18.370
 we leave life later when the 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:23.780
 things that happen that true 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:26.150
 with many 4 cards of that with 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.100
 Regarding what I'm going to look at ss 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.370
 more action that remained of the america cup 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.700
 of this is South America is growing 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.830
 because the kick is becoming more rigid 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:41.660
 and the answer which one is in the 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:44.300
 daddy floor this is american but not 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.000
 prove to valdés sacatarjetaroja to play 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.800
 mouth 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.380
 the gil astro the fiery pitana is made in 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.930
 the criminal in the prison and in the expulsion 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.930
 I probably do not think you want 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:03.270
 I did not see more but to rescue this that 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.910
 said Mariano, I'm not going to a game 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.060
 kill yourself neither with bad intention nor to 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:13.320
 hurt the one next door and that's what I'm talking about 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.690
 the speeches are enjoyed 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.520
 superclassic and it's good to live them in 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.400
 peace I think there were good gestures from part 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.120
 of the players 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:26.550
 unfortunately outside the stadium and it's 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.620
 what we all want 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.620
 -mariano let's go up
