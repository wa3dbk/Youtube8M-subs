00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.310 
and somebody went off and they remade
the<00:00:11.519> entire<00:00:11.849> thing<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.450> same<00:00:12.480> track<00:00:13.049> but

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
the entire thing it's the same track but

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.900 
the entire thing it's the same track but
all<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.190> environment<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.759> completely

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
all the environment is completely

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.430 
all the environment is completely
different<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.750> now<00:00:15.809> it's<00:00:15.990> using<00:00:16.139> Unreal

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
different and now it's using Unreal

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.050 
different and now it's using Unreal
Engine<00:00:16.770> 4<00:00:17.010> or<00:00:17.520> at<00:00:17.609> least<00:00:17.789> some<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
Engine 4 or at least some of the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.490 
Engine 4 or at least some of the
environments<00:00:18.570> from<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.810> tech<00:00:18.990> demos<00:00:19.320> and

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
environments from the tech demos and

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710 
environments from the tech demos and
it's<00:00:19.949> for<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> dk2<00:00:20.640> now<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.359> thought<00:00:21.600> it'd

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
it's for the dk2 now so I thought it'd

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.359 
it's for the dk2 now so I thought it'd
be<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.810> good<00:00:21.930> idea<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.680> go<00:00:22.769> off<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.100> try<00:00:23.220> and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
be a good idea to go off and try and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.740 
be a good idea to go off and try and
play<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.699> one<00:00:23.850> again<00:00:24.060> because<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.330> did<00:00:24.539> play

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
it's an updated version of the old one

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.379 
it's an updated version of the old one
do<00:04:36.070> you<00:04:36.130> own<00:04:36.220> was<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.550> little<00:04:36.760> clunky<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.270> was<00:04:37.360> a

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
do you own was a little clunky it was a

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.670 
do you own was a little clunky it was a
little<00:04:37.660> weird<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:38.020> was<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.199> first<00:04:38.380> roller

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
little weird it was the first roller

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.320 
little weird it was the first roller
coaster<00:04:39.070> that<00:04:39.100> seemed<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.729> come<00:04:39.880> out<00:04:39.910> for<00:04:40.210> the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
coaster that seemed to come out for the

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.969 
coaster that seemed to come out for the
rift<00:04:40.510> so<00:04:41.139> it's<00:04:41.290> a<00:04:41.320> bit<00:04:41.440> all<00:04:41.620> over<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.889> place

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
rift so it's a bit all over the place

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.770 
rift so it's a bit all over the place
but<00:04:42.310> this<00:04:42.430> one<00:04:42.639> is<00:04:42.760> really<00:04:43.000> really<00:04:43.300> cool<00:04:43.570> this

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
but this one is really really cool this

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.810 
but this one is really really cool this
is<00:04:43.960> still<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.139> work<00:04:44.320> in<00:04:44.380> progress<00:04:44.699> because<00:04:45.699> they

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
is still a work in progress because they

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.700 
is still a work in progress because they
have<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.000> figure<00:04:46.240> out<00:04:46.360> like<00:04:46.570> how<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.810> make<00:04:47.139> the

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
have to figure out like how to make the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.010 
have to figure out like how to make the
game<00:04:47.889> run<00:04:47.919> a<00:04:48.250> bit<00:04:48.460> better<00:04:48.639> on<00:04:49.030> mid<00:04:49.780> tier

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
game run a bit better on mid tier

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.750 
game run a bit better on mid tier
systems<00:04:50.500> because<00:04:50.800> my<00:04:50.979> system<00:04:51.400> is<00:04:51.550> really

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
systems because my system is really

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.000 
systems because my system is really
high-end<00:04:52.300> so<00:04:52.900> it's<00:04:53.080> kind<00:04:53.289> of<00:04:53.380> brute<00:04:53.650> forcing

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
high-end so it's kind of brute forcing

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.469 
high-end so it's kind of brute forcing
its<00:04:54.250> way<00:04:54.310> through<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.669> lot<00:04:54.820> of<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.030> performance

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
its way through a lot of the performance

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.020 
its way through a lot of the performance
issues<00:04:55.630> but<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:56.770> will<00:04:57.580> leave<00:04:57.699> a<00:04:57.729> link<00:04:57.940> in
