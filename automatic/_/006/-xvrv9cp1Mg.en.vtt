00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
basically you you you start off with a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.430 
basically you you you start off with a
gladiator<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.760> buy<00:00:57.000> him<00:00:57.090> equipment<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
gladiator you can buy him equipment to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.740 
gladiator you can buy him equipment to
get<00:00:59.370> him<00:00:59.489> building<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> stuff<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
get him building up the stuff but you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.330 
get him building up the stuff but you
can<00:01:00.809> only<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.109> style<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
can only have one style so I think the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.619 
can only have one style so I think the
guy<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.520> started<00:01:02.879> off<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.090> at<00:01:03.239> least<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
guy I started off with at least was a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.570 
guy I started off with at least was a
sword<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.140> shield<00:01:04.320> guy<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.830> then<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.460> can

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
sword and shield guy and then you can

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.490 
sword and shield guy and then you can
purchase<00:01:05.760> new<00:01:06.210> gladiators<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.350> also

you can build up your ludus you build up

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.850 
you can build up your ludus you build up
be<00:02:11.810> different<00:02:12.140> characters

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
be different characters

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.979 
be different characters
she's<00:02:13.310> pretty<00:02:13.519> interesting<00:02:14.090> although<00:02:14.780> it

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
she's pretty interesting although it

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.540 
she's pretty interesting although it
looks<00:02:15.170> like<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.440> characters<00:02:15.800> can<00:02:15.980> die<00:02:16.220> the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
looks like the characters can die the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.300 
looks like the characters can die the
actions<00:02:16.910> can<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.870> cost<00:02:18.110> money<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.470> revive<00:02:19.040> them

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
actions can it cost money to revive them

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.729 
actions can it cost money to revive them
I<00:02:19.670> think<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.180> first<00:02:20.420> time<00:02:20.569> is<00:02:20.750> free<00:02:21.049> play

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
I think the first time is free play

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.110 
I think the first time is free play
starts<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.220> cost<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.489> little<00:02:22.549> bit<00:02:22.670> more<00:02:22.880> but<00:02:23.060> it

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
starts to cost a little bit more but it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.610 
starts to cost a little bit more but it
didn't<00:02:23.299> seem<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.510> happen<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.750> me<00:02:23.840> till<00:02:24.049> I<00:02:24.380> was

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
didn't seem to happen to me till I was

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.410 
didn't seem to happen to me till I was

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
like level I don't know eight or

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.990 
like level I don't know eight or
something<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.980> beware<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.340> cuz<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.700> was<00:02:28.819> kind

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
something so beware that cuz I was kind

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.100 
something so beware that cuz I was kind
of<00:02:29.090> like<00:02:29.269> not<00:02:29.330> worrying<00:02:29.870> too<00:02:29.959> much<00:02:29.989> about
