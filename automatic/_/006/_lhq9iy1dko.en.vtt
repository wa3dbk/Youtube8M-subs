 it puts it inside our central 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.170
 notification should already be accustomed to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.760
 working with this central 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.890
 notification because we already have this 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.789
 on the iphone and ipad for some time 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.280
 huh 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.050
 when we stand here in our paper 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.629
 wall and she hides 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.910
 as the messages appear 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.100

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.320
 A bath for us here and this

 little baby appears after a while 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.930
 they are with that message or with 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.540

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.790
 we have to do 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.650
 so look at itunes put the song 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.259

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.210
 little baby he hides inside 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.460
 notification center if it applies 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.150
 will appear there saying that it is being 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.930
 played this song now when people 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.700

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.799
 she also appears in this little hat looks 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.290
 there's a message I can click 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.970
 directly do not answer here when 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.850
 receive a message you click on 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.560
 that you do not have to open the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.840

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.540
 Ready, you already respond to the message. 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.729
 super-fast super practical the same thing 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.470
 It happens to and through emails neoci 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.360
 we can respond only that the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.860
 barrel and we can not even respond 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.170
 at the time we wanted 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.410
 where he will open the middle program and 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.060

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.370
 write an email in the case of messages 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.200
 we respond directly here but the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.090
 What can I do from here is to turn off the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.370
 I do not want to see this message 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.410
 clip to be paid to him directly from 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.180
 central office has already paid my 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.090
 email there in my program 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.640
 then this is a nice advantage and 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.350

 message without opening the program 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.280
 super practical, right? 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.110
 one more tip about the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.910
 notification where we call sit 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.890

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.080
 hiding here I'll show you 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.570

 disturbing what is an opening for those who 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.750
 Do not you know I'll go on the apple menu at 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.810
 system preferences and here in the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.640
 notifications or set everything I 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.620
 need to be configured regarding the line 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.900
 notification center and one of them is a 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.459
 disturbed do not disturb 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.110
 it will that will make the time you 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.090
 active and do not disturb 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.950
 these banners links that appear here and 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.260
 a sound that sounds when a 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.750
 little doll will be mute and urban not 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.100
 What are you going to do? 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.110
 is doing a job he does not want 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.880
 be interrupted if you aggravate a video 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.560
 As I'm recording, you do not want the 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.410
 banks are disturbing 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.440
 so you activate or not disturb and that 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.930
 will not happen however the modifications 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.970
 will remain here within the 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.560
 panel will not only appear a banner and 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.269
 also will not play a sound 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.880
 so here you can activate or not 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.979
 of an hour and a certain amount of 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.140
 time zone is 10 7 for example 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.919
 for me it was not like conquering 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.720
 Sunday 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.750
 This is very nice here during the 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.640
 mirroring on tv or projectors 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.710
 Are you waiting to take only one 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.540
 datashow to give a class to do 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.540
 any kind of presentation 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.160
 you can leave this option enabled and then 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.080
 the baneseanos with the messages 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.060
 particulars and medium will not appear 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.010
 everyone that is hard right 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.720
 do not let this here is activated and ready 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.450
 Do you have your privacy? 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.550
 When are you making presentations? 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.370
 another thing that is cool is to allow 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.350
 connections than this team of all or 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.450
 only of favorites that your 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.880
 favorites aside if your contacts in 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.460
 so you can leave that ford 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.760
 that is in the open if any 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.590
 Contact your favorite if I make a 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.690
 connection on that connection will 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.150
 you will be able to meet or 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.110
 then allow the repeated connections 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.870
 sometimes someone calls you 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.910
 incessantly one after another and 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.650
 suddenly some emergency a thing 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.690
 important then you can stop 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.120
 several repetitive links 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.180
 she did not happen there or did not disturb 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.360
 will not refuse such links is for that 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.220
 You can answer that very cool right then. 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.560
 the notification center of the seated 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.520
 has been worked on for each 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.979
 one more time 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.410
 I'm going to close Spanish, but here's another. 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.729
 thing that has here in the matter of the battery 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.590
 that I'll show you to whom 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.840
 works with the macbook when people 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.450
 explains that on the drums now it will 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.220
 of which application information 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.740
 is using a lot of energy and 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.680
 consequently will train faster 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.479
 your battery here in my case I take care 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.700
 where you are using a lot of energy 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.040
 so if I can turn it off 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.470
 I hang up and then I have a run 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.690
 then bigger battery okay that's a 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.910
 another option that's cool for us 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.490
