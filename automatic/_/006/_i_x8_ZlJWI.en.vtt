hi I'm Jason with your talk and this is

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:11.770 
hi I'm Jason with your talk and this is
the<00:00:02.730> wish<00:00:03.210> cooker<00:00:03.570> LT<00:00:03.899> titanium<00:00:04.470> wood<00:00:04.650> stove<00:00:04.890> a

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.940 

lot<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.870> wood<00:00:13.019> stoves<00:00:13.259> are<00:00:13.440> known<00:00:13.590> for<00:00:13.769> being

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
lot of wood stoves are known for being

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.620 
lot of wood stoves are known for being
big<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.219> kind<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.700> clunky<00:00:15.030> but<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> nice

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
big and kind of clunky but the nice

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.120 
big and kind of clunky but the nice
thing<00:00:15.870> about<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.320> stove<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:17.010> it

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
thing about this stove is that it

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.470 
thing about this stove is that it
actually<00:00:17.250> fits<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.880> side<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.270> Snow

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
actually fits to the side of the Snow

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.990 
actually fits to the side of the Snow
Peak<00:00:18.690> trek<00:00:19.109> 700<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.430> can<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:20.910> very

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
Peak trek 700 as you can see it's very

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.300 
Peak trek 700 as you can see it's very
small<00:00:21.570> very<00:00:21.840> compact<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.890> very<00:00:23.130> lightweight

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
small very compact and very lightweight

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.310 
small very compact and very lightweight
okay<00:00:26.310> let's<00:00:26.490> check<00:00:26.939> out<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.240> design<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:28.199> at

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
okay let's check out the design so at

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.660 
okay let's check out the design so at
first<00:00:28.470> glance<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.980> looks<00:00:29.189> almost<00:00:29.460> kind<00:00:29.640> of

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
first glance it looks almost kind of

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.849 
first glance it looks almost kind of
like<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> spaceship<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.349> made<00:00:31.710> out<00:00:31.830> of

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
like a spaceship this is made out of

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.310 
like a spaceship this is made out of
titanium<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.540> very<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:34.079> lightweight

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
titanium so it's very very lightweight

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.340 
titanium so it's very very lightweight
and<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.309> you've<00:00:35.399> got<00:00:35.520> four

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
and you can see you've got four

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.709 
and you can see you've got four
permanent<00:00:37.350> pot<00:00:38.190> supports<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.600> then

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
permanent pot supports here and then

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.270 
permanent pot supports here and then
inside<00:00:40.230> there's<00:00:41.219> almost<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.640> propeller

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
inside there's almost like a propeller

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.369 
inside there's almost like a propeller
presumably<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.670> ventilation<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.570> then

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
presumably for ventilation and then

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.680 
presumably for ventilation and then
we've<00:00:46.530> got<00:00:46.649> some<00:00:46.850> jets<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> inside<00:00:48.420> some

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
we've got some jets on the inside some

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.500 
we've got some jets on the inside some
Jets<00:00:48.899> down<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.410> along<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> bottom<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.510> it's

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
Jets down here along the bottom and it's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.439 
Jets down here along the bottom and it's
a<00:00:51.629> very<00:00:51.809> small<00:00:52.820> burning<00:00:53.820> chamber<00:00:54.149> as<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.329> can

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
a very small burning chamber as you can

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.420 
a very small burning chamber as you can
see<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.170> really<00:00:55.469> want<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.649> use<00:00:55.800> small<00:00:56.190> wood

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
see so you really want to use small wood

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.590 
see so you really want to use small wood
with<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.910> don't<00:00:57.000> want<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> put<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.539> know

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
with this you don't want to put you know

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.119 
with this you don't want to put you know
real<00:00:57.840> big<00:00:58.079> chunks<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.530> wood<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.829> there<00:00:58.980> but

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
real big chunks of wood in there but

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.310 
real big chunks of wood in there but
think<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.820> twig<00:01:00.180> size<00:01:00.420> than<00:01:00.809> finger<00:01:01.289> size

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
think more twig size than finger size

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.660 
think more twig size than finger size
okay<00:01:04.320> I've<00:01:04.470> got<00:01:04.619> my<00:01:04.650> wood<00:01:04.949> all<00:01:05.070> prepared<00:01:05.430> and

starting to go pretty good no I know I'm
gonna<00:02:13.250> start<00:02:13.519> adding<00:02:13.760> some<00:02:14.299> thicker<00:02:14.569> pieces

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
gonna start adding some thicker pieces

gonna start adding some thicker pieces
of<00:02:15.650> fuel<00:02:15.890> wood

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.440 

okay<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.130> now<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.340> I've<00:02:29.580> got<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> good<00:02:29.970> fire

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
okay so now that I've got a good fire

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.390 
okay so now that I've got a good fire
going<00:02:30.510> here<00:02:30.990> I'm<00:02:31.170> going<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.500> go<00:02:31.890> ahead<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.220> put

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
going here I'm going to go ahead and put

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.510 
going here I'm going to go ahead and put
my<00:02:32.430> windscreen<00:02:32.870> around<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.250> the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
my windscreen around it and that is the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.090 
my windscreen around it and that is the
very<00:02:36.150> vent<00:02:36.420> windscreen<00:02:36.960> you<00:02:37.710> might<00:02:37.860> have<00:02:37.950> seen

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
very vent windscreen you might have seen

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.370 
very vent windscreen you might have seen
that<00:02:38.160> in<00:02:38.340> my<00:02:38.400> last<00:02:38.550> video<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.150> his<00:02:39.720> good<00:02:39.870> idea

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
that in my last video so his good idea

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.720 
that in my last video so his good idea
to<00:02:40.530> use<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> windscreen<00:02:40.980> with<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> wood<00:02:41.460> stove

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
pretty windy out here I probably should

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
pretty windy out here I probably should
have<00:03:04.140> use<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.320> little<00:03:04.470> bit<00:03:04.530> higher<00:03:04.710> of<00:03:04.920> a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
have use a little bit higher of a

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.420 
have use a little bit higher of a
windscreen<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.800> anyway<00:03:07.800> got<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:07.980> boil<00:03:08.190> off<00:03:08.310> for

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430

windscreen but anyway got a boil off for
about<00:03:08.490> seven<00:03:08.880> minutes<00:03:09.150> not<00:03:09.300> too<00:03:09.450> bad<00:03:10.730> one

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
about seven minutes not too bad one

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.770 
about seven minutes not too bad one
thing<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.150> like<00:03:12.300> about<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.630> Bush

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
thing I really like about the Bush

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.810 
thing I really like about the Bush
cooker<00:03:13.080> algae<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:14.070> it's<00:03:14.220> very<00:03:14.460> compact

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
cooker algae is that it's very compact

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.880 
cooker algae is that it's very compact
so<00:03:15.480> for<00:03:15.690> example<00:03:16.020> here's<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.410> bush<00:03:16.620> buddy

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
so for example here's the bush buddy

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.000 
so for example here's the bush buddy
ultra<00:03:17.520> a<00:03:17.640> very<00:03:17.880> popular<00:03:18.300> UL<00:03:18.990> wood<00:03:19.230> stove<00:03:19.500> and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
ultra a very popular UL wood stove and

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.860 
ultra a very popular UL wood stove and
you<00:03:20.100> can<00:03:20.220> just<00:03:20.400> see<00:03:20.550> side-by-side<00:03:20.940> how<00:03:21.510> much

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
you can just see side-by-side how much

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.530 
you can just see side-by-side how much
more<00:03:22.110> compact<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.250> Bush<00:03:23.550> cooker<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.210> this

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
more compact the Bush cooker is so this

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.170 
more compact the Bush cooker is so this
will<00:03:24.690> fit<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:24.960> a<00:03:24.990> lot<00:03:25.140> more<00:03:25.440> smaller<00:03:25.950> UL<00:03:26.910> pots

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
will fit in a lot more smaller UL pots

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.350 
will fit in a lot more smaller UL pots
like<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.720> Snow<00:03:28.230> Peak<00:03:28.730> 700<00:03:29.730> as<00:03:29.820> you've<00:03:29.940> seen<00:03:30.120> I
