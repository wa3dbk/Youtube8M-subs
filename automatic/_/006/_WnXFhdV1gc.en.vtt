just got to open up macromedia we'll
just<00:00:30.449> go<00:00:30.630> file<00:00:30.869> new<00:00:31.610> it's<00:00:32.610> got<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> be<00:00:32.850> 48<00:00:33.300> by<00:00:33.840> 48

just go file new it's got to be 48 by 48
now<00:00:35.520> make<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.910> transparent<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:36.660> good<00:00:36.840> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
then we just go to I got another file to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.580 
then we just go to I got another file to
fight<00:00:40.950> already<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:43.250> picture<00:00:44.250> there<00:00:45.590> just

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
fight already so just picture there just

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
fight already so just picture there just
drag<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.730> I've<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.300> rescaled<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
drag that in and I've really rescaled it

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.720

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
so it's the right size that's it so you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.200 
so it's the right size that's it so you
need<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> file<00:00:55.379> save<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:58.430> then<00:00:59.430> we
