00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.180
 New railway line Wendlingen-ulm 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.639
 construction progress 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.370
 this film shows the state of 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.099
 Construction work in March 2014 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.660
 the new 60 kilometer long 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.720
 high-speed rail between 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.529
 Wendlingen and Ulm are halfway through 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.600
 in tunis 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.640
 that protects the landscape just like the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.500
 parallel guidance of aboveground 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.160
 stretch sections to the 8th 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.630
 the 164 year old facetime train remains 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.630
 also in operation in the future 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.750
 in Wendlingen the sub- projects border 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.180
 Stuttgart 21 and new line 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.890
 wendlingen-ulm together 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.219
 through the over eight kilometer long 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.030
 Albvorland tunnel remains the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.790
 high speed traffic in kirchheim 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.190
 teck largely unnoticed 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.070
 at aichelberg the portal of the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.570
 boßler tunnels already prepared 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.750
 finished bridge over the 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.610
 Highway 12 14 is part of the construction sites 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.610
 surfaces along the a 8 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.030
 also from the intervening vaccination tal will 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.050
 the construction of the 88 km long boßler tunnel 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.630
 before you started 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.200
 from the construction site furnishing areas 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.660
 already became 1 895 meters longer 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.540
 help in the direction of the future 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.820
 boßler tunnel dug the boßler tunnel 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.780
 can be from two places 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.869
 be produced simultaneously 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.670
 before the construction of the 85 meter high rock 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.920
 must begin some bridge 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.290
 various preparatory measures 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.509
 be carried out currently be sample 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.480
 foundations and construction sites 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.750
 produced surfaces 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.550
 the steinbühl tunnel is progressing rapidly 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.520
 This is done by the module 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.070
 sharp corner out of the four tunnel tubes 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.330
 altogether were already 3000 meters far 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.700
 driven into the mountains 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.890
 the excavation is later with soil to 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.200
 Covered so the Steinbühler tunnel 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.880
 even at this point not to see 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.880
 will be 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.890
 about 400 meters further direction 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.740
 the tunnel portal of the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.440
 Stone sculptor built by the pit 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.660
 pfaffen corner became the stone picture 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.230
 tunnel already up to the porch in front 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.230
 entered 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.530
 at 962 meters, the tunnel is back 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.319
 steep to the shorter of the new line 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.349
 He is right on the highway and will 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.049
 in open construction created on the 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.750
 The new construction line runs along the entire valley 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.970
 mostly above ground and parallel 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.099
 to the highway for the new line 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.670
 Been along the freeway trees 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.230
 like to compensate for this loss 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.269
 Thousands of new trees are going up 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.410
 different areas near the 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.000
 been re-planted so far 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.790
 120,000 plants at different 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.140
 locations set new 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.150
 between temmenhausen and dornstadt 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.780
 the construction sites can not be left anymore 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.090
 overlook 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.489
 on a length of over 7 kilometers 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.250
 is working on the new line 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.120
 Three new road bridges are already 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.430
 completed 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.849
 six further bridges are located in the 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.890
 building between dornstadt and ulm becomes the 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.769
 construction of the nearly six kilometer long 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.989
 descent tunnels prepared at the time 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.480
 the construction areas at the portal in 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.609
 dornstadt furnished similar to the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.340
 boßler tunnel will also be added 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:37.970
 between aggression built in part teacher 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.290
 in the les apron of ulm main station 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.390
 was the replacement for the 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.910
 Railway overpass a lot of style railway 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.769
 finished as the station in 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.560
 second world war heavily bombed 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.780
 was found as preparation for 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.310
 further construction measures thorough 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.310
 weaponry soundings instead
