without part of the environment for

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.090 
without part of the environment for
themselves<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:01.320> they're<00:04:01.500> studying<00:04:01.770> the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
themselves and they're studying the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.460 
themselves and they're studying the
world's<00:04:02.490> creatures<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:03.750> they<00:04:03.900> can<00:04:04.080> protect
