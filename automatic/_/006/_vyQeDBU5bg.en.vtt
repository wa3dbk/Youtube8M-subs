about the first three quarters what we

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.640 
about the first three quarters what we
do<00:04:57.919> when<00:04:58.070> it<00:04:58.190> mattered<00:04:58.550> when<00:04:58.820> it<00:04:58.940> was<00:04:59.650> 1614

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
do when it mattered when it was 1614

what<00:05:00.919> did<00:05:01.040> we<00:05:01.160> do<00:05:01.310> when<00:05:01.460> it<00:05:01.550> mattered<00:05:01.910> screwed

what did we do when it mattered screwed

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.300 
what did we do when it mattered screwed
that<00:05:02.960> up<00:05:03.020> screwed<00:05:03.410> that<00:05:03.530> up<00:05:03.590> lost<00:05:03.950> the<00:05:04.100> game

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
that up screwed that up lost the game

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.830 
that up screwed that up lost the game
you<00:05:04.700> know<00:05:04.790> I'm<00:05:04.850> saying

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:23.250 

I<00:05:21.389> think<00:05:22.389> that<00:05:22.449> anytime<00:05:22.870> you<00:05:23.169> have

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
I think that anytime you have

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.350 
I think that anytime you have
quarterback<00:05:23.800> three<00:05:24.550> running<00:05:24.820> backs<00:05:24.850> two

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
quarterback three running backs two

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.390 
quarterback three running backs two
tight<00:05:25.570> ends<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:26.110> four<00:05:26.530> offensive<00:05:26.889> linemen

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
tight ends and four offensive linemen

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.520 
tight ends and four offensive linemen
coming<00:05:27.669> back<00:05:27.880> that<00:05:28.870> that's<00:05:29.139> going<00:05:29.290> to<00:05:29.350> take

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
coming back that that's going to take

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.990 
coming back that that's going to take
pressure<00:05:29.770> off<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:30.160> receivers<00:05:30.639> you<00:05:30.880> know<00:05:30.970> I

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
pressure off the receivers you know I

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.280 
pressure off the receivers you know I
think<00:05:31.120> we<00:05:31.330> need<00:05:31.449> to<00:05:31.510> be<00:05:31.570> able<00:05:31.600> to<00:05:31.750> I<00:05:31.810> think<00:05:32.139> the

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
think we need to be able to I think the

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.510 
think we need to be able to I think the
biggest<00:05:32.470> thing<00:05:32.620> we<00:05:32.770> could<00:05:32.889> do<00:05:33.040> is<00:05:33.070> be<00:05:33.310> able<00:05:33.460> to

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
biggest thing we could do is be able to

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.650 
biggest thing we could do is be able to
run<00:05:33.639> the<00:05:33.669> football<00:05:33.910> better<00:05:34.240> than<00:05:34.300> we<00:05:34.479> did<00:05:34.600> last

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
run the football better than we did last

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.780 
run the football better than we did last
year<00:05:34.960> now<00:05:35.350> that<00:05:35.380> that's<00:05:36.100> on<00:05:36.280> coach<00:05:36.550> Fulmer

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
year now that that's on coach Fulmer

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.740 
year now that that's on coach Fulmer

00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:58.409 
I think I think that's a media

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:01.339 
I think I think that's a media
perception<00:06:58.770> i<00:06:59.069> think<00:06:59.309> that<00:06:59.490> that<00:07:00.139> Peyton<00:07:01.139> I

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:01.349 
perception i think that that Peyton I

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:02.839 
perception i think that that Peyton I
mean<00:07:01.589> he's<00:07:01.710> the<00:07:01.740> best<00:07:02.069> there<00:07:02.249> is<00:07:02.279> right<00:07:02.639> now
