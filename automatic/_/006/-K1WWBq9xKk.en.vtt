but I wanted to talk about I had I don't
think<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.030> related<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> my<00:00:39.570> skincare

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
think this is related to my skincare

think this is related to my skincare
routine<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.500> had<00:00:40.680> two<00:00:40.980> rather<00:00:41.640> large<00:00:42.260> cystic

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
routine I had two rather large cystic

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.340 
routine I had two rather large cystic
acne<00:00:44.879> spots<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.899> my<00:00:46.020> face<00:00:46.260> last<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:47.039> week<00:00:47.219> and

acne spots on my face last this week and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.540 
acne spots on my face last this week and
I<00:00:49.350> think<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.250> hormonal<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:52.280> there<00:00:53.280> wasn't<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
I think it's hormonal so there wasn't a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.950 
I think it's hormonal so there wasn't a
lot<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.820> could<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.239> avoid<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
lot I could do to avoid that with the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.819 
lot I could do to avoid that with the
skincare<00:00:55.230> routine

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
but when I used to clear it up with

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.240 
but when I used to clear it up with
something<00:00:58.350> different

when I was looking through

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.560 
when I was looking through
notice<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.010> cabinet's<00:02:00.400> a<00:02:00.549> lot<00:02:00.970> like<00:02:01.270> the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
notice the cabinet's a lot like the

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.800 
notice the cabinet's a lot like the
Mario<00:02:01.780> Badescu<00:02:02.970> bottle<00:02:03.970> that<00:02:04.150> some<00:02:04.450> gurus

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
Mario Badescu bottle that some gurus

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.510 
Mario Badescu bottle that some gurus
that<00:02:04.900> were<00:02:05.200> just<00:02:05.470> posting<00:02:05.860> on<00:02:05.979> side<00:02:06.190> that<00:02:06.310> well

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
that were just posting on side that well

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.020 
that were just posting on side that well
I<00:02:06.900> got<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:08.020> try<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.740> idea<00:02:09.100> is<00:02:09.280> it's

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
I got to try it and so the idea is it's

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.910 
I got to try it and so the idea is it's
it's<00:02:10.780> not<00:02:10.959> shaken<00:02:11.319> up<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.560> don't<00:02:11.680> know<00:02:11.770> if<00:02:11.860> you

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
can see but um there's this clearer

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.229 
can see but um there's this clearer
