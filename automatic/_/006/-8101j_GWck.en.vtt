00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.300 
computer
and<00:04:28.540> so<00:04:29.540> that's<00:04:29.750> what<00:04:29.900> you<00:04:30.020> do<00:04:30.260> so<00:04:30.950> you'll<00:04:31.130> have

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
and so that's what you do so you'll have

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.490 
and so that's what you do so you'll have
to<00:04:31.460> make<00:04:31.640> sure<00:04:31.820> your<00:04:32.210> device<00:04:32.390> is<00:04:32.540> both<00:04:32.900> off<00:04:33.140> and

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
to make sure your device is both off and

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.230 
to make sure your device is both off and
plugged<00:04:33.980> in<00:04:34.130> before<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:34.670> proceed<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:35.090> the

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
plugged in before you proceed to the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.950 
plugged in before you proceed to the
next<00:04:35.450> step

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
next step

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.080 
next step
all<00:04:36.230> right<00:04:36.410> so<00:04:36.680> you'll<00:04:36.920> head<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:37.430> your<00:04:37.610> iPhone

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
all right so you'll head to your iPhone

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.570 
all right so you'll head to your iPhone
or<00:04:38.210> iPod<00:04:38.510> touch<00:04:38.750> you'll<00:04:39.590> hit<00:04:39.800> slide<00:04:40.250> to<00:04:40.550> power

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
or iPod touch you'll hit slide to power

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.740 
or iPod touch you'll hit slide to power
off<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:42.010> then<00:04:43.010> wait<00:04:43.250> till<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.790> is<00:04:44.210> completely

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
off and then wait till it is completely

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:53.710 
off and then wait till it is completely
off<00:04:51.040> so<00:04:52.040> you'll<00:04:52.340> make<00:04:52.580> sure<00:04:52.880> you're<00:04:53.240> ready<00:04:53.450> to

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720

proceed<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.350> next<00:04:54.380> step<00:04:54.800> because<00:04:55.340> once

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
proceed to the next step because once

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.280 
proceed to the next step because once
you<00:04:55.940> proceed<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.480> next<00:04:56.630> step<00:04:56.990> though

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
you proceed to the next step though

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.070 
you proceed to the next step though
you'll<00:04:57.830> have<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:58.160> go<00:04:58.430> directly<00:04:58.940> into<00:04:59.210> DFU<00:04:59.840> mode

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
you'll have to go directly into DFU mode

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.520 
you'll have to go directly into DFU mode
all<00:05:00.800> right<00:05:01.010> so<00:05:01.370> first<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.270> will<00:05:02.390> say<00:05:02.600> hold<00:05:03.260> the
