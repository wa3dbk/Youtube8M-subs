00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.890
 hi everyone is red skull and 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.530
 this is my second commentary on 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.410
 beat weapons in this episode of 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.150
 introduce a weapon for class i 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:23.750
 snipers or the barrett model 98 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:28.520
 lemme 98 is released at 146 thousand points 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.789
 for the scout kit it makes about 95 points of 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.429
 damage between 100 and 200 meters over 200 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.069
 months the damage gradually goes up to 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:40.219
 reach the minimum damage of 59 points 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:43.370
 life then to kill an enemy in 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.129
 one shot in normal mode you have to 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.819
 hit him in the head or a part 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.589
 vital then in the chest while if you want 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.929
 kill with one shot could 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.219
 Also playing so that the k born co 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:59.449
 will allow you to take down the enemy 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.190
 also hitting it on a leg 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.229
 then the charger contains about five 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.030
 Shocks The charging time may vary 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.850
 from two and a half seconds and four if not 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.700
 in the middle he did not give fire because he is 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.100
 a bolt action rifle and then it will depend 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.890
 us with when to shoot can't 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.600
 shoot in quick succession because 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.320
 also you will have to recharge to do 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.260
 exit the empty case and load 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.190
 to put another in the barrel 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.960
 this weapon at the beginning is equipped with a 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:34.900
 telescopic sight for eight per man 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.800
 hand stop the ballistic at 10 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.970
 incisions the coop 50 and gradually and up to 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.400
 reach the Russian soldiers I advise 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.920
 this but with a viewfinder that can pay 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.070
 from the ballistic one that is that 12 for the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.410
 long distances for long distances 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.190
 I recommend the accompanied ballistics 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.110
 from a biped for that if not from 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.490
 take too long and then breath 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.370
 it would be profitable and no weapon no 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.399
 secondary accessory while you want 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.520
 killing enemies at medium distance close 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.010
 the tips a telescopic sight 8 for 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.450
 always accompanied by the b code or 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:23.460
 since from the pool bolt I don't know how to say it 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.500
 however from the sliding shutter we say 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.750
 so that you unlock 60 kills that 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.050
 allows you to shoot at speed 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.570
 higher then you have more chances 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.650
 to hit the target 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.640
 then my 90 98 b and the weapon for i 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.310
 the strongest snipers of the game are me 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:50.310
 below her there may be 96 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.800
 gene g ninety as power while like 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.380
 the muzzle velocity of the projectile does not 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.660
 it's the same in fact it's much faster 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.459
 of his sniper rifle nets and 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.860
 it even goes much further without it 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.709
 fall without having too much effect 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.790
 of gravity 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:12.000
 then we say the cable on 138 magnum heir 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.819
 also the bullet much more lethal than 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.230
 those of the other rifles and the kit 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.690
 scout and then I recommend this weapon a 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.140
 all those who want to undertake 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.590
 let's say a sniper career since 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.450
 is the most powerful as mentioned before and 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.030
 will allow you to hit people who 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.209
 they are also a kilometer away 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.750
 but always calculating the right one 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:43.080
 distance with the viewfinder now I will make you 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:47.390
 see a short video and greet you at 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.390
