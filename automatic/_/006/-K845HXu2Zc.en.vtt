00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.809
 friends welcome on the channel today 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:12.179
 we have an example of not successfully successful repair 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.250
 nokia asha 308 came to me 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.240
 what was her problem she is not 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.760
 included this phone came in after 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.699
 two services which said that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.510
 it cannot be restored 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:34.829
 but let's see whether it is true or not 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:41.700
 try to turn it on press the button 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:46.649
 switching on and how we see the phone started 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:51.770
 start what was done here say 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:55.350
 Immediately here was completely dug 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:01:01.280
 roll on steam that is what a couple 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.280
 this is flash memory and processor 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.909
 after the transfer, what problem did I reveal 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.270
 which revealed the problem would seem to all 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.240
 phone recovered everything works 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.759
 everything is fine but now if we introduce 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.060
 magic combination sprocket 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.540
 but now the lattice to watch and may 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.920
 this unit let's not on 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.329
 leisure time we try to do it 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:36.360
 sprocket lattice 06 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:44.390
 ratchet you see two of these 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:50.939
 strange looking 123456 106 54 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.509
 321 and at the same time also? present well 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.259
 let's 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.259
 and disconnect telefonchik 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:07.080
 Now the splash screen goes off but we 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.640
 let's see what is the real May 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.730
 batteries and see right here 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.849
 two and boy we have they present 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.930
 not at all coincide with those that were 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.930
 displayed on the display 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:27.190
 why did this happen before did everything there 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.260
 what phones on the x gold platform 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:35.410
 not only that they are very flimsy 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:41.860
 processor and by themselves so to all 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:44.829
 still , the flash memory is very 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.579
 afraid of them i don't know heat or how 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:52.269
 still say that is when heated 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:56.709
 heating them flies have and everything would 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:59.769
 nothing our box would help us 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.630
 already known for some of my videos 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:08.859
 which is called best dongle 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.450
 if we had merged mercury then 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.350
 there is tolerated this is the area that 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.120
 directly and kept such may 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.000
 if we had this suffered we were 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.859
 myself no problem for lily potter plz 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.940
 the telephone number would have danced with us 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:27.190
 earned everything would be great but since 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.290
 the phone originally came to me in 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.530
 idle did not turn off to 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.079
 I also connected it to the programmer 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.450
 he did not see him, he saw him only already 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:43.569
 after stitching again I repeat couples 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.180
 so what options what options 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:51.910
 there is a way out of this situation is clear 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:54.760
 that with default on by and phone simok 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.750
 simply will not see the network will not 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.609
 so we have some options here you are 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.970
 probably guessed that this is such 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:08.010
 trash bag here's the first option this 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.010
 just throw it in the trash 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:17.120
 second option second option 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:23.360
 what's the second option we have is 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:26.030
 find a similar phone well maybe even 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.460
 not working but that there was working 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:35.390
 The device has a processor and flash memory and 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:38.540
 roll instead of native to the processor and 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.580
 flash memory those that we take but with 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:47.180
 donor's phone will be so right 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:49.870
 say here but the phone is already natural 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.460
 will already be with my other 7th will 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.830
 donor's phone but he will call 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.190
 will see senki will be all right 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.490
 or the third option is he 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:06.290
 I show you the last server already 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.160
 which was my video order factory 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.780
 lpl 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:17.419
 for a coin, look at how much it costs 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:19.430
 order this lpl and that is even now 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.820
 the server is temporarily unavailable 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:26.120
 but here so that you would guess 34 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.840
 dollars worth ordering p sang for from this 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.360
 phone 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:35.480
 Well, in general for all bb5 rpr at the same time 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.360
 as for platform dkt 4 rp possible 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.390
 order for only 1 dollar 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.330
 Well, in principle, if it was a duck 4 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.360
 then with that help again this 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:52.360
 endured can be generated and not necessarily 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:57.590
 ruin the dollar and now rpr for bb5 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:59.840
 need to order for money and not for 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.890
 small what caused such a price 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.350
 politics give them that very expensive 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.460
 maintenance costs from these servers 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:13.560
 which compute 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.560
 ppr they are very strong 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.650
 expensive so here's the price well 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.170
 and of course people also want something 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.560
 earn so he throws on top 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:32.850
 I don't know how many dollars there are 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:36.640
 10 for 1 l p l somewhere so probably well 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:40.090
 principle that's all i wanted 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:44.550
 tell if the video was helpful 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:51.360
 put likes subscribe to the channel 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:51.360
 we will go further circuit design 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:58.590
 telephone devices and in their repair and all 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.590
 thanks, bye
