the<00:01:29.939> pole<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.329> lot<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.659> installers<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.530> this

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the pole a lot of installers have this

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.700 
the pole a lot of installers have this
particular<00:01:32.040> trick<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.390> use<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:34.409> take<00:01:34.680> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
particular trick that we use we take a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950 
particular trick that we use we take a
carpenter's<00:01:35.400> level<00:01:35.430> like<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.780> we

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
carpenter's level like this one and we

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.370 
carpenter's level like this one and we
put<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.299> LMB<00:01:39.299> pole<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:41.420> deduct<00:01:42.420> five

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
put it on the LMB pole and deduct five

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.429 
put it on the LMB pole and deduct five
and<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.619> half<00:01:43.829> degrees<00:01:44.549> from<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.689> elevation<00:01:46.079> in

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
and a half degrees from the elevation in

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.620 
and a half degrees from the elevation in
this<00:01:46.590> case<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.610> set<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:48.149> elevation

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
this case I have to set my elevation

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.510 
this case I have to set my elevation
irid<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:50.540> 25<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:54.360> half<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.310> my

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
irid at 25 and the half to get my

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.940 
irid at 25 and the half to get my
elevation<00:01:57.049> so<00:01:58.049> now<00:01:58.259> I'll<00:01:58.469> go<00:01:58.500> ahead<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
elevation so now I'll go ahead and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.249 
elevation so now I'll go ahead and
proceed<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.430> fire<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.700> my<00:01:59.759> meter

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
proceed and fire up my meter

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.529 
proceed and fire up my meter
and<00:02:01.460> set<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.610> alignment<00:02:02.899> by<00:02:03.899> 131<00:02:04.969> degrees<00:02:05.969> is

fire<00:02:27.450> up<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.900> receiver<00:02:28.319> my<00:02:29.690> beater<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.080> I'll

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
fire up the receiver my beater and I'll

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.759 
fire up the receiver my beater and I'll
have<00:02:31.890> signal<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:33.090> it's<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.599> good<00:02:34.140> technique<00:02:34.380> to

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
have signal so it's a good technique to

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.160 
have signal so it's a good technique to
use<00:02:34.799> take<00:02:35.519> my<00:02:35.760> meter<00:02:36.390> in<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:36.720> case<00:02:36.959> I'm<00:02:37.140> using

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
use take my meter in this case I'm using

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.460 
use take my meter in this case I'm using
a<00:02:37.470> tri<00:02:37.680> max<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.519> I'm<00:02:39.209> going<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.510> begin<00:02:39.959> by

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
a tri max and I'm going to begin by

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.500 
a tri max and I'm going to begin by
rotating<00:02:41.250> my<00:02:41.579> satellite<00:02:42.000> dish<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.329> a
