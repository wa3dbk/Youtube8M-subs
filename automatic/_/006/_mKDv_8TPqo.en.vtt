 good humor seen have passed almost 12 years 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.810

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.930
 of those hugs 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.790
 since on August 24, 2003 and that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.530
 Fernando Alonso changed forever the

 history of motorsport in Spain ' 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.490
 at only 22 years old he got his first 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.690
 victory in formula 1 and his countrymen 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.910
 they untied 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.280
 that king who has been writing after the 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.230
 year and I come from gijÃ³n to return them 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.789
 you did not have to go to Germany to 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.879
 village of schumacher to see these 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.879
 images 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.390
 In exchange, especially my life in 2003 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.940
 when I won the first race many 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.400
 personalities many important things 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.890
 and he's 22 years old and you live things that 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.960
 better you did not have to live and I've 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.520
 spoken a few times 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.030
 and he was one of the moment 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.030
 nerves 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.710
 after the race because 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.780
 a low adrenaline gre 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.520
 I usually did not see the city 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.710
 it was one hour and thirty nine 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.659
 minutes of tension in which the pilot 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.430
 Asturian clung to his dream and only 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.650
 was left without leading a return of the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.570

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.880
 chance 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.230
 that was 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.970
 let's say to confirm the truth so much 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.950
 that day became the pilot more 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.170
 young man to win a big record prize that 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.790
 it would take him years later vettel though 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.110
 now I am suffering with mclaren 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.350
 Alonso's numbers speak for themselves 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:11.009
 same 32 wins 22 goals and the third 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.110
 pilot with more podiums of the formula 197

 magic day for Spanish sport a 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:29.640
