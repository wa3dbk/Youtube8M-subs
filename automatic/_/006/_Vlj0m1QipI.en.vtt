00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.020
 sales 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.260
 here 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.390
 then you choose the parquet 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.039
 wanted to install you want to create 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.319

 me I uninstall them so I'm going 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.769
 not do it so once it will be 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.629
 installed normally they would not have 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.150
 need to key logically you will not have 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.430
