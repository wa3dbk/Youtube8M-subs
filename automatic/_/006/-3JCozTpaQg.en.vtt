00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
 Well, no 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.090
 for more information visit my blog 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.640
 silvia quiroz blog.com good guys that 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.800
 maybe you see my channel one more time today 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.990
 I want to bring this superchulo makeup 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.060
 which is from a triangular eyeliner and is 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.160
 very easy to do let's start 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.220
 creating a base I will apply this 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.470
 matte color light brown all over 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.360
 Eyelid mobile is for eyebrow can you 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.740
 apply if you want instead of this a 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.110
 SEDESO more try but I think with 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.720
 This color is clear to me because 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.750
 I do not have the fatty eyelids 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.300
 Apply with a brush to blur 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.910
 soft bristle and we will create it 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.090
 this base we are going to take a black colt 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.790
 creamy and we will create what is the 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.250
 drawing in the shape is going to be a triangle 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.830
 more or less than eyeliner what I'm going to 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.170
 do is going to be first create the form the 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.730
 inner part of the triangle is what 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.229
 it matters less that it is polished 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.869
 matter is that the part is polished 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.290
 external and we will draw more or less 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.600
 up to half the banana 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.780
 gently care in the part of the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.300
 banana because the skin is softer 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.520
 and it's easier than with the pencil 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.230
 take and not be so polished then 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.230
 it is better to do it little by little 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.710
 make sure that it is necessarily the same 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.030
 in exactly the same in exactly 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.030
 same in one eye and in another 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.399
 so take your time 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.700
 it is not we have this is going to take a brush 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.770
 biased first I'm going to fill in as the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.070
 half of the triangle with pencil pencil 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.159
 with alcohol as such and then I will go 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.590
 to the skewed brush and I 'll start creating a 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.220
 small blur a kind of 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.610
 degraded 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.050
 from where we have finished filling 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.050
 to the rest of the mobile eyelid 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.080
 I have picked up a brush biased a pencil a 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.260
 biased brush and if I dedicate you because 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.180
 We are working with cream product 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.159
 once we have it well diffused 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.260
 let's take the same brush and let's 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.930
 take the pencil product and let's go 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.730
 delineating the rest of the top line 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.980
 of tabs to finish this eyeliner 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.379
 we've started, I'm going to do it 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.510
 pretty soft finite in the area of 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.269
 tear and it is increasing a little 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.099
 size and thickness as we get to 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.730
 the external part of the eyeliner that 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.730
 we just created 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.660
 for this reason it is also interesting 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.290
 having caught choosing a brush 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.290
 synthetic 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.480
 the creamier it is which 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.570
 let's choose better let's work this 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.670
 this technique and it does not matter if it's 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.590
 too creamy because now we're going to 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.970
 pass to the sealing of this pencil with a 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.970
 shadow so in the problem 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.990
 take your time to blur the 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.560
 pencil because it is important that there is a 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.560
 uniform gradient a blur 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.560
 uniform 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.170
 and once we have our eyes well we are going to 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.629
 take a shadow me in this case I have 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.769
 chosen a matte brown shadow because 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.499
 I want to give it a tad less 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.959
 intensity to the look and we're going to seal all 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:41.239
 the area that we have applied alcohol 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.490
 creamy then let's start with the 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.260
 more external zone intensifying the well 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.390
 taking the product every time 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.540
 let's use, let's seal the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.730
 pencil and when we come in half 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.890
 of design let's stop catching 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.420
 product to blur what is already 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.390
 we have in the brush in this way 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.400
 we will create a much easier gradient 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.290
 If we needed, we can apply a 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.850
 little bit more of the clarita shadow that 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.680
 we have applied the principle in this area 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.200
 to create more the blur 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.340
 with a clear pencil this beige can 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.290
 give a little opening to the eyes 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.009
 applying it in the water area in the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.009
 water line 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.970
 the next step is going to be apply 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:28.920
 this side and then we use a curler 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.260
 hot but after the mask 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.150
 we prick from the root to the tip as 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.150
 always to create more intensity 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.880
 and with the eyelashes still wet from the 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.880
 mask let's apply the slider 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.880
 thermal 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.409
 I do not sell, we are going to create the 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.840
 eyebrows let's design the eyebrows for 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.520
 this makeup I have decided to design some 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.860
 pretty intense eyebrows for this I'm going to 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.610
 use three products one is a pencil 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.500
 eyebrows other is an illuminator a pencil 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.110
 illuminator that I will apply in the arch of the 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.110
 eyebrow and finally apply a fixative gel 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.080
 these are the important parts of 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:18.080
 pretty intense eyebrows and makeup 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.960
 and once we have we will pass to 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.960
 face 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.830
 the face of applying the first a basis 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.560
 a cream with color to create our 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.090
 base if we need some kind of 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.680
 cleaning because the product we would 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.539
 before applying this step 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.720
 you can apply once it includes another type 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.910
 of products are a 1st 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.280
 and we are going to apply it to our 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.190
 makeup base 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.830
 this time I'm going to use allison rafael the 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.690
 makeup foundation that's great that gives 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.700
 a very juicy finish and it diffuses very 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.970
 well and integrates perfectly in the 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.970
 face 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.790
 as always we will not forget the line 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.320
 of the neck and jaw the ears and 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.320
 as the line of hair growth 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.580
 as always I repeat take the time 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.289
 what do you need for the base 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.939
 I'm going to warm it up a little bit with my 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.770
 fingers so that it integrates even more in 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:24.220
 My skin 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.660
 and we will apply the corrector, I will 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.610
 use it mostly to clean the area 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.930
 of the lacrimal and the external zone of 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.180
 makeup 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.460
 going down a tad simply to the 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.700
 cheekbone to create with lighting 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.640
 we pass to seal 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.800
 and this time I will teach especially in 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.870
 the part of the corrector in the high zone 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.960
 but good if you need for all the 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.330
 face do it 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.550
 the next step will be to give a little 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.150
 shape the face to use a powder of 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.250
 contour 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.170
 and a tone a tone and a half darker than 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.240
 my real skin tone to make it a lot 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.510
 more natural and I'm going to focus on 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.460
 all in the part of those below the 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.920
 cheeks to create more depth more 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.920
 intensity my cheek and on the temple 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.640
 as blusher I'm going to use an earth color 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:19.289
 brown cited and I'm going to apply it just 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:22.289
 over where the contour applied 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:25.279
 in this way we will give a pretty touch 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.279
 natural redness 

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:32.900
 and the last touch is going to be on the lips 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:35.330
 a super natural product 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.889
 It is a product that can be used both 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.520
 the eyes as the cheeks as in the 

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:42.740
 pink lips is already more finished like this is 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.690
 easy final health as you see very very 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.220
 easy to do and they are very fashionable to 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.169
 this type of eyeliner and eyebrows very 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.180
 intense I hope you liked this 

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:52.430
 look you try all the pictures 

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.810
 final and in the list of products that 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.820
 I used will be as always in my blog 

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.080
 continues here will go dark dotcom millions 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.360
 of thanks but they are percent with me 

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.800
 and we 'll see each other in the next and not 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.620
 forget that here I leave the two looks 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.990
 previous ones that are the rainbow eyeliner 

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.990
 and the edge is elegant next chao
