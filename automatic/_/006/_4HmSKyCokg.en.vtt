intellectual understanding yes and

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.990 
intellectual understanding yes and
basically<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.890> don't<00:03:41.190> know<00:03:41.280> what<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.580> topic

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
basically you don't know what the topic

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.210 
basically you don't know what the topic
really<00:03:42.270> is

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
really is

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.380 
really is
all<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.430> know<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:44.610> there's<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:46.560> pretty

all you know is there's this is pretty
and<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.600> incubated<00:03:54.230> so<00:03:55.230> this<00:03:55.440> is<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> dynamic

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
and you incubated so this is a dynamic

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.760 
and you incubated so this is a dynamic
situation<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:58.020> sounds<00:03:58.290> almost<00:03:58.410> like<00:03:58.560> you're
