so<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:02.280> nicely<00:02:02.790> laid<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.030> piece<00:02:03.990> here<00:02:04.409> with

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
so it nicely laid out piece here with

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.760 
so it nicely laid out piece here with
our<00:02:05.100> solenoids<00:02:05.670> all<00:02:06.510> their<00:02:06.720> fittings<00:02:07.080> is<00:02:07.440> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
our solenoids all their fittings is the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.880 
our solenoids all their fittings is the
the<00:02:08.130> fogger<00:02:08.369> Nagy<00:02:08.610> nozzle<00:02:09.590> some<00:02:10.590> wiring

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
the fogger Nagy nozzle some wiring

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.530 
the fogger Nagy nozzle some wiring
brackets<00:02:12.860> all<00:02:13.860> your<00:02:14.130> lines<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.150> that'll<00:02:15.420> be

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
brackets all your lines so that'll be

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.090 
brackets all your lines so that'll be
the<00:02:15.690> line<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:15.900> goes<00:02:16.170> from<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.500> bottle<00:02:16.830> to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
the line that goes from the bottle to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.809 
the line that goes from the bottle to
the<00:02:17.130> front<00:02:17.489> then<00:02:18.000> you'll<00:02:18.180> have<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:19.819> think

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
the front then you'll have a I think

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.190 
the front then you'll have a I think
that'll<00:02:21.120> be<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.330> nitrous<00:02:21.690> line<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.080> that'll

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
that'll be the nitrous line and that'll

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.650 
that'll be the nitrous line and that'll
be<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.380> fuel<00:02:22.709> lunch<00:02:22.920> usually<00:02:23.459> blue<00:02:24.450> for

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
be the fuel lunch usually blue for

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.979 
be the fuel lunch usually blue for
nitrous<00:02:25.080> red<00:02:25.380> for<00:02:25.590> fuel<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.660> it's<00:02:27.840> all

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
nitrous red for fuel and so it's all

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.410 
nitrous red for fuel and so it's all
nicely<00:02:28.230> laid<00:02:28.560> out<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.010> can't<00:02:29.550> really<00:02:30.090> lose

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
nicely laid out so you can't really lose

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.220 
nicely laid out so you can't really lose
