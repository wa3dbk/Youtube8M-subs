something<00:06:14.259> in<00:06:14.500> a<00:06:14.589> paragraph<00:06:14.889> this<00:06:15.639> is<00:06:15.819> what

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
something in a paragraph this is what

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.909 
something in a paragraph this is what
it's<00:06:16.120> going<00:06:16.270> to<00:06:16.360> do<00:06:16.539> to<00:06:16.689> it<00:06:16.810> and<00:06:17.080> everything

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
it's going to do to it and everything

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.820 
it's going to do to it and everything
all<00:06:18.159> right<00:06:18.449> this<00:06:19.449> is<00:06:19.629> pretty<00:06:19.810> cool<00:06:20.080> but<00:06:20.379> it

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
all right this is pretty cool but it

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.850 
all right this is pretty cool but it
would<00:06:21.069> be<00:06:21.189> a<00:06:21.219> lot<00:06:21.520> more<00:06:21.759> easy<00:06:22.270> if<00:06:22.629> this<00:06:22.899> was<00:06:23.139> you

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
would be a lot more easy if this was you

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.279 
would be a lot more easy if this was you
know<00:06:23.889> a<00:06:24.009> little<00:06:24.339> more<00:06:24.550> readable<00:06:25.060> so<00:06:25.659> what

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
know a little more readable so what

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:28.920 
know a little more readable so what
people<00:06:26.469> usually<00:06:26.979> do<00:06:27.430> is<00:06:27.699> they<00:06:27.939> separate<00:06:28.689> each

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
people usually do is they separate each

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.920 
people usually do is they separate each
rule<00:06:29.589> on<00:06:29.949> the<00:06:30.219> line<00:06:30.430> so<00:06:30.669> maybe<00:06:30.699> the<00:06:31.269> colors<00:06:31.659> on

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
rule on the line so maybe the colors on

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.470 
rule on the line so maybe the colors on
the<00:06:32.019> first<00:06:32.259> line<00:06:32.500> and<00:06:32.709> the<00:06:33.370> font<00:06:33.699> family<00:06:33.940> can

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 
the first line and the font family can

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.780 
the first line and the font family can
be<00:06:34.570> on<00:06:34.690> the<00:06:34.720> second<00:06:35.200> line<00:06:35.350> and<00:06:35.590> I<00:06:36.340> usually<00:06:36.550> just

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
be on the second line and I usually just

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.030 
be on the second line and I usually just
take<00:06:37.120> this<00:06:37.240> last<00:06:37.540> bracket<00:06:38.080> and<00:06:38.230> put<00:06:38.800> it<00:06:38.920> right

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
take this last bracket and put it right

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.310 
take this last bracket and put it right
there<00:06:39.100> because<00:06:39.640> then<00:06:39.910> I<00:06:39.940> can<00:06:40.180> see<00:06:40.210> easier<00:06:41.110> when

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
there because then I can see easier when

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.560 
there because then I can see easier when
it<00:06:41.410> ends<00:06:41.710> but<00:06:41.860> if<00:06:42.250> you<00:06:42.760> want<00:06:43.000> to<00:06:43.150> well<00:06:43.300> you<00:06:43.540> know

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
it ends but if you want to well you know

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.040 
it ends but if you want to well you know
maybe<00:06:44.500> line<00:06:44.920> all<00:06:45.400> your<00:06:45.730> rules<00:06:46.000> up<00:06:46.300> it<00:06:46.720> really

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
maybe line all your rules up it really

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.470 
maybe line all your rules up it really
