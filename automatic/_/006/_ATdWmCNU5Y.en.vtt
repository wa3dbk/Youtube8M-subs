00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.940 
would make you alter your game plan well
they<00:02:30.510> both<00:02:30.660> getting<00:02:30.989> older<00:02:31.290> yeah<00:02:31.560> i<00:02:31.590> know<00:02:31.920> that

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
they both getting older yeah i know that

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.100 
they both getting older yeah i know that
some<00:02:32.400> weekend<00:02:32.760> getaway<00:02:33.180> from<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:33.630> they<00:02:33.900> both

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
some weekend getaway from so they both

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.020 
some weekend getaway from so they both
got<00:02:34.349> older<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.370> think<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.700> fight<00:02:35.880> would

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
got older and I think the fight would

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.360 
got older and I think the fight would
have<00:02:36.150> been<00:02:36.269> much<00:02:36.420> more<00:02:36.950> exciting<00:02:37.950> for<00:02:37.980> years

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
have been much more exciting for years

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.160 
have been much more exciting for years
ago<00:02:38.609> but<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.269> thing<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.079> still

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
ago but the thing is I think it's still

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.289 
ago but the thing is I think it's still
exciting<00:02:40.530> yes<00:02:40.980> but<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.310> don't<00:02:41.700> think<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.060> as

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
exciting yes but I don't think it's as

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.319 
exciting yes but I don't think it's as
great<00:02:43.230> as<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.530> once<00:02:43.890> was<00:02:43.980> how<00:02:44.940> long<00:02:45.120> have<00:02:45.239> you
