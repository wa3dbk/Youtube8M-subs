00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
get this ask the hell of a fucking lot

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.460 
get this ask the hell of a fucking lot
and<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.060> why<00:01:48.240> don't<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.570> show<00:01:48.600> my<00:01:48.990> face<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.319 
and it's why don't I show my face and
the<00:01:49.560> simple<00:01:49.950> answer<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.759> because<00:01:50.790> I

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the simple answer for that is because I

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.440 
the simple answer for that is because I
look<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> frog<00:01:52.470> um<00:01:52.829> well<00:01:53.579> actually<00:01:53.850> i

don't know i probably i might do i might
not<00:01:56.640> i'm<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.060> reason<00:01:57.210> why<00:01:57.450> i<00:01:57.479> don't<00:01:57.780> is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960

a lot of effort into and I don't really

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.100 
a lot of effort into and I don't really
feel<00:04:56.880> as<00:04:57.120> though<00:04:57.240> I'm<00:04:57.420> doing<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:57.840> at<00:04:57.990> the

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
feel as though I'm doing that at the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.360 
feel as though I'm doing that at the
