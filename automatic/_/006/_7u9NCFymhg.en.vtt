00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.920 
want to call it cable port I'm i think
that's<00:00:46.920> under<00:00:47.580> bolt<00:00:47.850> cable<00:00:48.150> i'm<00:00:48.390> not<00:00:48.570> quite

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
that's under bolt cable i'm not quite

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.650 
that's under bolt cable i'm not quite
sure<00:00:49.130> not<00:00:50.130> sure<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.610> no<00:00:50.910> i<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.240> that<00:00:51.450> one<00:00:51.630> is

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660

sure not sure but no i think that one is
a<00:00:51.780> thunderbolt<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> USB<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.200> is<00:00:55.290> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
a thunderbolt this is a USB this is the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.120 
a thunderbolt this is a USB this is the
USB<00:00:55.830> um<00:00:56.720> i<00:00:57.720> believe<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.560> an<00:00:58.680> SD<00:00:59.100> card

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
USB um i believe that is an SD card

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.690 
USB um i believe that is an SD card
reader<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.900> where<00:01:01.079> i<00:01:01.110> plug<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.590> my

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
reader and this is where i plug in my

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.040 
reader and this is where i plug in my
ear<00:01:02.700> right<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> has<00:01:05.010> quite<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
ear right here so it has quite the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.460 
ear right here so it has quite the
