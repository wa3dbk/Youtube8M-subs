00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
to enter into command /b space L for the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.090 
to enter into command /b space L for the
line<00:00:43.710> brush<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.820> slash<00:00:45.270> V<00:00:45.690> space<00:00:46.410> whatever

end and a straight line between the two

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.729 
end and a straight line between the two
points<00:01:01.890> will<00:01:02.160> appear<00:01:02.750> now<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.260> make<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> hanging

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
points will appear now to make a hanging

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.990 
points will appear now to make a hanging
bridge<00:01:04.949> from<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.309> you're<00:01:05.640> kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.850> gonna

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
bridge from this you're kind of gonna

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.600 
bridge from this you're kind of gonna
have<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.540> adapt<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.229> own<00:01:07.380> style<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.950> whatever

have to adapt your own style to whatever

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.730 
have to adapt your own style to whatever
line<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:10.229> some<00:01:10.409> things<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
line that you have but some things to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.090 
line that you have but some things to
keep<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:10.950> mind<00:01:11.159> are<00:01:12.020> which<00:01:13.020> points<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.770> higher

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
keep in mind are which points are higher

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
keep in mind are which points are higher
which<00:01:14.580> are<00:01:14.850> which<00:01:15.119> point<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.479> higher<00:01:15.689> than<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
which are which point is higher than the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.109 
which are which point is higher than the
other<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.009> bridge<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.549> naturally

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
other because the bridge is naturally

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:36.230 
other because the bridge is naturally
going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> lean<00:01:18.810> closer<00:01:19.170> towards<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> lower

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.889 

our<00:01:37.240> second<00:01:37.689> tip<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.079> day<00:01:38.229> is<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
our second tip of the day is the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.240 
our second tip of the day is the
basically<00:01:40.899> using<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.439> line<00:01:41.649> brush<00:01:41.920> a<00:01:41.950> little

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
basically using the line brush a little

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.370 
basically using the line brush a little
more<00:01:42.520> in-depth<00:01:42.789> than<00:01:42.880> what<00:01:43.689> I<00:01:43.720> just<00:01:43.780> explained

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
more in-depth than what I just explained

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.779 
more in-depth than what I just explained
so<00:01:44.500> again<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.920> command<00:01:45.130> for<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.399> line<00:01:45.579> brush

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
so again the command for the line brush

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.219 
so again the command for the line brush
is<00:01:46.060> /b<00:01:46.630> space<00:01:47.110> L<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:49.270> you're<00:01:49.479> going<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.780> go

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
is /b space L then you're going to go

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.850 
is /b space L then you're going to go
slash<00:01:51.070> V<00:01:51.520> space<00:01:52.119> one<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:53.079> select<00:01:53.320> stone<00:01:53.710> as

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
slash V space one to select stone as

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.609 
slash V space one to select stone as
your<00:01:53.979> material<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:55.110> basically<00:01:56.110> all<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.500> have

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
your material and basically all you have

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
to do here to make easy spikes or spires

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.059 
to do here to make easy spikes or spires
is<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.880> set<00:02:01.750> one<00:02:02.110> block<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.439> little<00:02:02.710> ways<00:02:02.950> away

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
is to set one block a little ways away

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.319 
is to set one block a little ways away
from<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.369> wall<00:02:03.579> and<00:02:03.759> off<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.000> ground

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
from a wall and off the ground

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
want to create a sponge path using a

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.450 
want to create a sponge path using a
voxel<00:02:53.090> overlay<00:02:53.450> command<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:55.130> should<00:02:55.340> be

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
voxel overlay command and you should be

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.620 
voxel overlay command and you should be
seeing<00:02:55.640> that<00:02:55.760> pop<00:02:55.970> up<00:02:56.150> at<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.330> bottom<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.570> the

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
that path and you replace the sponge

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.680 
that path and you replace the sponge
with<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:05.320> percentage<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:07.300> cobblestone<00:03:08.300> grass

you've got your island right side up and

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.660 
you've got your island right side up and
it's<00:04:02.260> floating<00:04:02.440> off<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.799> ground<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.250> can<00:04:03.280> do

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
it's floating off the ground you can do

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.970 
it's floating off the ground you can do
an<00:04:03.880> overlay<00:04:04.299> command<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:05.350> cover<00:04:05.500> with<00:04:05.680> dirt

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
an overlay command to cover with dirt

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.220 
an overlay command to cover with dirt
and<00:04:06.190> then<00:04:06.880> another<00:04:07.150> overlay<00:04:07.569> to<00:04:07.900> cover<00:04:08.080> it

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
and then another overlay to cover it

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.460 
and then another overlay to cover it
with<00:04:08.349> grass<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:10.110> there's<00:04:11.110> your<00:04:11.260> floating

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
with grass and there's your floating

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:20.720 
with grass and there's your floating
island

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730

waterfall or have waterfalls that are
somewhat<00:04:29.880> natural<00:04:30.300> now<00:04:31.230> you're<00:04:31.410> gonna<00:04:31.560> take

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
somewhat natural now you're gonna take

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.590 
somewhat natural now you're gonna take
your<00:04:31.860> overlay<00:04:32.640> command<00:04:32.940> again<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.420> you're

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
your overlay command again and you're

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.650 
your overlay command again and you're
gonna<00:04:33.690> do<00:04:33.840> slash<00:04:34.110> be<00:04:34.470> space<00:04:35.010> over<00:04:35.610> space<00:04:36.060> D<00:04:36.330> 1

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
gonna do slash be space over space D 1
