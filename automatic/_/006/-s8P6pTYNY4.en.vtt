00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
think all I'm gonna do this but once you

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.939 
think all I'm gonna do this but once you
beat<00:04:39.970> it<00:04:40.150> notice<00:04:40.870> how<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.080> icon<00:04:41.470> is<00:04:41.620> Mario's

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
beat it notice how the icon is Mario's

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.580 
beat it notice how the icon is Mario's
head<00:04:42.270> this<00:04:43.270> is<00:04:43.330> actually<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:43.990> harder<00:04:44.560> version

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
head this is actually a harder version

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.770 
head this is actually a harder version
of<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.280> game<00:04:45.460> it's<00:04:45.699> there's<00:04:46.389> no<00:04:46.509> real

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
of the game it's there's no real

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.909 
of the game it's there's no real
difference<00:04:47.820> but<00:04:48.820> I<00:04:49.710> think<00:04:50.710> there's<00:04:50.860> like

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
difference but I think there's like

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.589 
difference but I think there's like
slightly<00:04:51.430> more<00:04:51.610> enemies<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.330> like<00:04:52.479> the

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
slightly more enemies and like the

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.659 
slightly more enemies and like the
bosses<00:04:53.050> are<00:04:53.349> like<00:04:53.830> take<00:04:54.070> more<00:04:54.250> hits<00:04:54.430> or

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
bosses are like take more hits or

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.839 
bosses are like take more hits or
something<00:04:55.229> I<00:04:56.229> have<00:04:56.740> beaten<00:04:57.099> this<00:04:57.190> before<00:04:57.610> and

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
something I have beaten this before and

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.040 
something I have beaten this before and
after<00:04:58.150> that<00:04:58.300> there's<00:04:58.539> like<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:58.720> level

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
after that there's like a level

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.540 
after that there's like a level
selection<00:04:59.470> you<00:04:59.680> can<00:04:59.710> go<00:04:59.949> back<00:05:00.099> to<00:05:00.160> whichever

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
selection you can go back to whichever

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.310 
selection you can go back to whichever
level<00:05:00.910> you<00:05:01.060> like<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.539> that's<00:05:01.870> pretty<00:05:02.080> much<00:05:02.199> it

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
level you like and that's pretty much it

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.810 
level you like and that's pretty much it
i<00:05:02.620> guess<00:05:02.800> it's<00:05:03.009> supposed<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.340> add<00:05:03.460> maybe<00:05:03.729> a

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
i guess it's supposed to add maybe a

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.760
