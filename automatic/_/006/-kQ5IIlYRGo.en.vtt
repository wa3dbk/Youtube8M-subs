00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.590
 Hello my name is Alexander 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.260
 orrotin I speculate on 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.070
 video I will tell you that such 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.099
 document 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.559
 surely every one of you at least once 

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:17.769
 held in hand 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.009
 just impossible 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:19.980
 he invented 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.769
 interesting but 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.480
 rubles and patented in 1575 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.300
 Moscow is already on sale, he entered in 1960 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.390
 from that time more than five were released 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.489
 million copies 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.810
 every eighth inhabitant of the earth kept him 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.360
 but those who see it as a pledge 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.380
 for the first time I will explain what is its essence in this 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 column can rotate each of 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.400
 deadline 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.860
 and your task is to lead him from this 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.670
 states 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.500
 collected by the treatment of all 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 citizens that is such a scenario 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.840
 the end of 2010 the smallest time for 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.539
 which allowed to collect a cube 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.260
 this is part of the whole 50 acres 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.540
 minimum number of moves 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.700
 who managed to collect the Rubik's cube 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.710
 this is 20 traditionally this algorithm 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.180
 called lateral algorithms 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.140
 unfortunately man is not able to teach 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.430
 movements all facets republic 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.740
 at the same time therefore this algorithm to the State Duma 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.140
 when did you learn to collect the rubik's cube 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.370
 the bank wants to play everything faster and faster 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.000
 faster for this is carried out 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.460
 specialists for example 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.150
 speed assembly that is in the post 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.060
 championship speedbobbing pass 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.490
 worldwide including in russia 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.560
 at the last European Championship 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.659
 our compatriot won 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.090
 Sergey Ryabkov during the visit, the case 30 11 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.400
 hundredths of a second 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.460
 my personal best form in Rubik's cube 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.120
 15.50 one hundredth of a second 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.120
 First is the decision of the mayor of children 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.490
 the cube assembly model showed me your 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.320
 hockey 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.380
 but then told myself 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.380
 but performance 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.860
 i still do i teach you uneasy 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.260
 play it is available to everyone
