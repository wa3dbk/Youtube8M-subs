00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:01:03.500 

we<00:00:45.039> have<00:00:52.679> anyway

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
I think the first time I realized that I

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.890

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.200 
was nine ten so very young
it's<00:01:25.320> tricky<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:25.950> me<00:01:26.070> because<00:01:26.910> I've<00:01:27.150> always

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
it's tricky with me because I've always

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.970 
it's tricky with me because I've always
felt<00:01:27.570> something<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> never<00:01:28.410> accepted<00:01:28.710> it

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
felt something but I never accepted it

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.180 
felt something but I never accepted it

and<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:10.369> started<00:02:11.000> missing<00:02:11.470> myself<00:02:12.489> in

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
and I started missing myself in

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.339 
and I started missing myself in
conversation<00:02:14.209> with<00:02:14.390> colleagues<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.959> friends

conversation with colleagues and friends

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.250 
conversation with colleagues and friends
like<00:02:15.760> they<00:02:16.760> have<00:02:17.060> something<00:02:17.690> for<00:02:18.079> theirselves

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
like they have something for theirselves

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.660 
like they have something for theirselves
and<00:02:18.890> well<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.549> was<00:02:19.760> married<00:02:20.299> quite<00:02:20.660> young<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.200> I

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
and well I was married quite young and I

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.910 
and well I was married quite young and I
didn't<00:02:22.670> have<00:02:22.819> I<00:02:23.060> missed<00:02:23.720> my<00:02:23.870> identity<00:02:24.530> at<00:02:24.769> that

time<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.540> also<00:02:26.690> difficult<00:02:26.989> that<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.319> talk

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
time so it's also difficult that I talk

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.250 
time so it's also difficult that I talk
about<00:02:27.709> myself<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.130> end<00:02:28.280> my<00:02:28.400> life<00:02:28.840> there<00:02:29.840> was

about myself to end my life there was

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.960 
about myself to end my life there was
time<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.040> thought<00:02:31.280> by<00:02:31.400> myself<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.940> just

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
time that I thought by myself I just

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.449 
time that I thought by myself I just
have<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.510> jump<00:02:33.440> all<00:02:33.560> over<00:02:33.799> the<00:02:34.069> edge<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
have to jump all over the edge of the

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.740 
have to jump all over the edge of the
9/9<00:02:35.180> floor<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:36.260> then<00:02:37.160> when<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.579> had<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.329> in

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
9/9 floor and then when I had this in

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.319 
9/9 floor and then when I had this in
mind<00:02:39.049> that<00:02:39.860> was<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.160> time<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.640> was<00:02:40.849> thinking<00:02:41.120> by

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
mind that was the time I was thinking by

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.240 
mind that was the time I was thinking by
myself<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.870> have<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.110> go<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.440> doctor<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:43.130> I

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
myself I have to go to the doctor and I

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.450 
myself I have to go to the doctor and I
did

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
did

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.030 
did
it<00:02:45.460> took<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.790> while<00:02:46.060> before<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:47.040> realized

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
it took a while before I realized

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.650 
it took a while before I realized
exactly<00:02:48.970> what<00:02:49.120> was<00:02:49.270> going<00:02:49.540> on<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:50.380> then

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
exactly what was going on and then

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.290 
exactly what was going on and then
accepting<00:02:52.660> what<00:02:53.080> was<00:02:53.200> going<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:55.150> of

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
accepting what was going on and of

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.570 
accepting what was going on and of
course<00:02:55.360> next<00:02:55.810> step<00:02:56.050> is<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.680> try<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:56.920> find<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.430> way

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
course next step is to try to find a way

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.770 
course next step is to try to find a way
to<00:02:57.880> deal<00:02:58.840> with<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.890> live<00:03:00.070> with<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.780> I

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
to deal with it to live with it and I
