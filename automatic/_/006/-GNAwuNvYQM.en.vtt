00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
pot because we have a lot of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.839 
pot because we have a lot of
things<00:02:13.379> going<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.739> there<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.099> we<00:02:14.280> need<00:02:14.489> some

in<00:02:44.700> now<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.329> a<00:02:45.440> Macedonian<00:02:46.440> cabbage<00:02:46.829> stew

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
in now this is a Macedonian cabbage stew

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.890 
in now this is a Macedonian cabbage stew
and<00:02:47.430> we<00:02:48.090> said<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.360> we're<00:02:48.480> going<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.629> come<00:02:48.810> up

and we said that we're going to come up
with<00:02:49.079> a<00:02:49.110> name<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:50.459> i<00:02:50.910> think<00:02:51.030> Macedonian

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.420 
with a name so i think Macedonian
cabbage<00:02:52.019> true<00:02:52.200> sounds<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.560> little<00:02:52.920> bit<00:02:53.040> boring

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
cabbage true sounds a little bit boring
