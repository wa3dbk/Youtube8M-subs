00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
and that was a very important feature to

and that was a very important feature to
the<00:02:14.540> customer<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.530> clearway<00:02:16.100> lift<00:02:16.490> what<00:02:16.790> it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
the customer the clearway lift what it

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.880 
the customer the clearway lift what it
does<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.360> when<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:17.720> folds<00:02:17.990> back<00:02:18.290> up<00:02:18.560> into<00:02:18.709> the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
does is when it folds back up into the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.760 
does is when it folds back up into the
van<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.340> doesn't<00:02:20.000> take<00:02:20.209> up<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.600> whole<00:02:20.810> inside

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770
