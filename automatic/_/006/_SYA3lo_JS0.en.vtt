00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.990 

the<00:00:00.269> moon<00:00:00.810> is<00:00:01.020> so<00:00:01.230> perfectly<00:00:01.740> positioned<00:00:02.000> but

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
the moon is so perfectly positioned but

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.240 
the moon is so perfectly positioned but
because<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:03.899> where<00:00:04.200> it<00:00:04.380> is<00:00:04.620> when<00:00:04.890> we<00:00:04.980> have<00:00:05.130> an

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
because of where it is when we have an

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.390 
because of where it is when we have an
eclipse<00:00:05.670> it<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.660> same<00:00:06.899> size<00:00:07.259> as<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.189> Sun

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
eclipse it is the same size as the Sun

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.490 
eclipse it is the same size as the Sun
that's<00:00:08.639> why<00:00:08.670> we<00:00:08.940> have<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.240> eclipses<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.230> the

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
that's why we have the eclipses of the

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.890 
that's why we have the eclipses of the
author<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.950> moon<00:00:11.130> say<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.509> moon<00:00:12.719> is

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
author of the moon say this the moon is

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.060 
author of the moon say this the moon is
bigger<00:00:13.110> than<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.410> should<00:00:13.679> be

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
bigger than it should be

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.039 
bigger than it should be
apparently<00:00:14.849> older<00:00:15.210> than<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.389> should<00:00:15.660> be<00:00:15.839> and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
apparently older than it should be and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.290 
apparently older than it should be and
much<00:00:16.590> lighter<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.130> mass<00:00:17.460> than<00:00:17.789> he<00:00:17.850> should<00:00:17.880> be

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
much lighter in mass than he should be

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.929 
much lighter in mass than he should be
it<00:00:18.810> occupies<00:00:19.109> an<00:00:19.560> unlikely<00:00:19.890> orbit<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.730> so

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
it occupies an unlikely orbit and is so

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.490 
it occupies an unlikely orbit and is so
extraordinary<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.750> all<00:00:22.020> existing

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
extraordinary that all existing

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.019 
extraordinary that all existing
explanations<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.340> its<00:00:23.460> presence<00:00:23.880> are

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
explanations for its presence are

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.480 
explanations for its presence are
fraught<00:00:24.420> with<00:00:24.570> difficulties<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.680> none<00:00:26.340> of

where'd the moon come from you get this

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.530 
where'd the moon come from you get this
story<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.579> much<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.300> call

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
story like so much in what we call

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.170 
story like so much in what we call
science<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.620> people<00:00:37.829> take<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.430> fact<00:00:38.820> it's

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
science that people take it as fact it's

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.479 
science that people take it as fact it's
actually<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.629> theory<00:00:40.350> which<00:00:40.800> repeating

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
actually a theory which repeating

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.450 
actually a theory which repeating
becomes<00:00:41.879> fat<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:42.809> then<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.140> go<00:00:43.950> back<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
becomes fat but then you go back you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.940 
becomes fat but then you go back you
find<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> theory<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.170> first<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.770> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950

the moon when the physics of that didn't
work<00:01:00.329> out<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:01.590> came<00:01:01.920> up<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.520> double

satellites in general then when a planet
does<00:01:50.750> have<00:01:50.990> satellites<00:01:51.560> those<00:01:52.040> satellites

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
does have satellites those satellites

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.370 
does have satellites those satellites
are<00:01:52.790> much<00:01:52.970> smaller<00:01:53.270> than<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:53.630> planet<00:01:53.960> itself

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
are much smaller than the planet itself

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.740 
are much smaller than the planet itself
therefore<00:01:55.220> even<00:01:55.970> if<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.210> earth<00:01:56.240> has<00:01:56.720> a

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.290 
therefore even if the earth has a
satellite<00:01:57.350> there<00:01:57.950> would<00:01:58.340> be<00:01:58.370> every<00:01:58.700> reason<00:01:58.880> to

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
satellite there would be every reason to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.510 
satellite there would be every reason to
suspect<00:01:59.480> that<00:01:59.840> at<00:02:00.050> best<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.590> would<00:02:00.740> be<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:00.950> tiny

but<00:02:04.460> that<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:04.850> not<00:02:05.150> so<00:02:05.600> Earth<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.680> not<00:02:06.890> only<00:02:07.100> has

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
the best explanation for the moon is

from NASA it seems easier to explain the

from NASA it seems easier to explain the
non-existence<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.700> moon<00:02:37.880> then<00:02:38.270> its

non-existence of the moon then its
existence<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:40.280> then<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:40.790> get<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.030> hollow
