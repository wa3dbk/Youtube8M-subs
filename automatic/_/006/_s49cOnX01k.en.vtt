00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
but I'm putting it on first and you're

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.750 
but I'm putting it on first and you're
going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> see<00:01:12.960> when<00:01:13.650> i<00:01:13.680> blend<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.520> gonna

look<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.680> bright<00:01:16.680> at<00:01:16.950> first<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.460> then

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
look a little bright at first but then

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
look a little bright at first but then
when<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:17.970> put<00:01:18.240> my<00:01:18.270> bronzer<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.110> blush<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.590> top

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
when I put my bronzer and blush on top

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
when I put my bronzer and blush on top
it<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.610> kind<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.820> peeks<00:01:21.090> through<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
it just kind of peeks through and it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.719 
it just kind of peeks through and it
just<00:01:21.990> gives<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> really<00:01:22.530> pretty<00:01:22.950> glow<00:01:23.460> it's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
just gives you a really pretty glow it's

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.429 
just gives you a really pretty glow it's
not<00:01:23.880> super<00:01:24.299> shimmery<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:25.259> just

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
not super shimmery it's actually just

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.030 
not super shimmery it's actually just
kind<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.939> brightening<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.869> think<00:01:28.110> mostly

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
kind of brightening and I think mostly

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.200 
kind of brightening and I think mostly
it's<00:01:29.159> supposed<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.670> used<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.090> like

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it's supposed to be used to like

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.120 
it's supposed to be used to like
illuminate<00:01:30.659> your<00:01:30.780> under-eye<00:01:31.170> area<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:32.100> I

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
illuminate your under-eye area but I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.859 
illuminate your under-eye area but I
