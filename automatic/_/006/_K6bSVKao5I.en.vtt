or something that i was done by harvard
university<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.320> i<00:00:22.320> think<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:23.010> kind<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.490> cool

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
university and i think it's kind of cool

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.359 
university and i think it's kind of cool
i<00:00:24.029> tried<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.720> earlier<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.439> basically

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
i tried this earlier and basically

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.859 
i tried this earlier and basically
what's<00:00:26.640> supposed<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.910> be<00:00:27.000> able<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.510> with

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
what's supposed to be able to do is with

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.910 
what's supposed to be able to do is with
about<00:00:28.590> 50<00:00:29.070> clicks<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.640> circles<00:00:30.650> it's<00:00:31.650> supposed

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
about 50 clicks on circles it's supposed

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.889 
about 50 clicks on circles it's supposed
to<00:00:32.070> be<00:00:32.189> able<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> determine<00:00:32.790> how<00:00:33.210> old<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.719> are

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to be able to determine how old you are

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.350 
to be able to determine how old you are
and<00:00:34.200> i<00:00:35.070> did<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.340> again<00:00:35.399> once<00:00:35.820> earlier<00:00:35.969> today

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
and i did it again once earlier today

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.590 
and i did it again once earlier today
and<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:37.170> was<00:00:37.500> pretty<00:00:38.250> damn<00:00:38.550> accurate<00:00:38.790> guess

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and it was pretty damn accurate guess

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.680 
and it was pretty damn accurate guess
that<00:00:39.870> was<00:00:39.989> 31<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.950> I'm<00:00:41.129> actually<00:00:41.370> 32<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.660> I

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that was 31 and I'm actually 32 so I

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.299 
that was 31 and I'm actually 32 so I
kind<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.110> want<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.350> see<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.100> guys<00:00:44.129> all

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
get also to see if it was able to guess

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.069 
get also to see if it was able to guess
it<00:00:47.010> accurately<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.480> maybe<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.960> was

click on each of them i think that's

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.050

definitely one I don't think it's

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.399 
definitely one I don't think it's
tracking<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.510> action<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.900> mass<00:02:35.019> movement

tracking the action of mass movement

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.479 
tracking the action of mass movement
though<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.709> might<00:02:35.860> be<00:02:36.099> I<00:02:36.129> have<00:02:36.340> no<00:02:36.670> idea<00:02:37.319> I

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
though it might be I have no idea I

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.280 
though it might be I have no idea I
don't<00:02:39.489> know<00:02:39.579> if<00:02:39.760> like<00:02:40.239> as<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.659> get<00:02:40.840> older

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290

you're<00:02:41.799> able<00:02:42.129> to<00:02:42.310> or<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.000> slow<00:02:43.269> down<00:02:43.480> you're

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
you're able to or you slow down you're

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.930 
you're able to or you slow down you're
clicking<00:02:43.930> or<00:02:44.379> something<00:02:44.680> like<00:02:44.799> that<00:02:44.940> maybe

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
clicking or something like that maybe

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.580 
clicking or something like that maybe
there's<00:02:46.209> like<00:02:46.269> a<00:02:46.359> tipping<00:02:46.720> point<00:02:46.750> also<00:02:47.109> like

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
there's like a tipping point also like

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.559 
there's like a tipping point also like
if<00:02:47.769> you're<00:02:47.950> under<00:02:48.519> certain<00:02:48.970> age<00:02:49.239> you're

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
if you're under certain age you're

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.020 
if you're under certain age you're
slower<00:02:49.870> also<00:02:50.290> i'm<00:02:50.530> really<00:02:50.799> not<00:02:50.920> sure<00:02:50.980> I'm<00:02:51.849> not

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
slower also i'm really not sure I'm not

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.020 
slower also i'm really not sure I'm not
doing<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.170> think<00:02:53.739> as<00:02:53.980> good<00:02:54.250> as<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.430> did<00:02:54.459> last<00:02:54.609> time
