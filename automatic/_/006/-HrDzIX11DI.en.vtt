00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
 I told them an earlier of the 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:08.309
 Destruction here in the tribune 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.230
 important one was the epicenter of the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.280
 major incidents but we 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.019
 let's talk 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.960
 now with roberto with a fan of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.230
 national who was here last night during 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.970
 the incidents in the centennial stadium 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.100
 we protect you the identity asked not to 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.350
 we show it but it will give us its 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.150
 testimony of what happened the day 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.590
 from more broken you're trying to find your 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.550
 phone because in the avalanche what 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.360
 you lost 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.270
 I did not lose because it was an avalanche in the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.760
 awesome never seen never seen in 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.390
 other parties had something happened to you this 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.270
 I am always went if I go whenever I can 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.129
 and you saw that there was never anything like 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.129
 yesterday yesterday was something impressive 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.380
 the truth that I never saw how it all started 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.620
 what happened 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.640
 He started the fans who came before 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.269
 see that the police had planned 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.800
 than having them at the door and when entering 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.190
 the doors at the time of the whistle 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.680
 I do not know if it's bancada I know it's not 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.750
 they were allowed to leave the layers that 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.760
 there was a cord because in goal line the 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.250
 Quartermaster not allow you to close the 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.800
 stadium gates the field that is 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.450
 prohibited in public shows not 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.350
 can the door sound like there was a 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.920
 police cord 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.770
 and the people rushed and expression to the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.960
 I do not know how it was put 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.119
 in fighting the 21 touches that they 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.610
 the police was leaving waiting for 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.280
 the 20 minutes he had said the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.850
 police should wait clear if we are going to go 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.810
 the first line I was waiting for the 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.240
 20 minutes that the police said and then 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.399
 or obviously the first seat that 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.560
 flies and the first police park that that 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.560
 sea eyes starts all 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.140
 and if there is food, everything is that 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.800
 will specify this tight by the balance 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.680
 that does not exceed 20 minutes when I say 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.440
 90 minutes I left and there was a cord 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.380
 police who was insulting the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.610
 people to go out the other door he says 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.730
 through the door where the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.550
 great social and through the door 21 that the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.980
 we see through door 21 that they were not 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.430
 the trouble has left quieter with 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.290
 a quiet partial however I 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.900
 showed receipts of the is a brand 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.580
 of an important hematoma of the 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.440
 arm and also in the leg they hit you 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.050
 that with sticks yes if they hit me 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.430
 tell it because when I went to lower the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.489
 stairs are the cops doing 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.280
 Chinese bridge type or as the school and 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.680
 what children do when they meet Aryan 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.769
 good are the prices making bridges 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.380
 Chinese with clowns with told passed by 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:07.660
 there people would stick with older people 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.660
 with children to women they hit everything 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:19.830
 I'm in children 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.930
 in view of the news I saw 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.360
 after the stadium arrives in the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.280
 moment in the moment those senses 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.670
 disparate detonations the felt ones 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.460
 at that time I do not know I think maybe 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.530
 you had to go out to the stadium solo 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.460
 and then I saw it for an informational color 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.970
 that all the future exit yes no 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.850
 on the court 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.860
 with this kind of background that 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.270
 play for example the classic one Monday to 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.230
 the night 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:56.970
 that I know that stays too 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:01.300
 by cardin form that also brings people together 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.320
 for a classic at night with what happened 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.320
 It is not complicated 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.060
 there was the testimony of this fan that 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.640
 as anecdotal data is looking here 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.110
 your phone where you have all the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.600
 Work contacts obviously because 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.200
 he lost it yesterday during during the departure 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.000
 of the stadium and good the testimony of 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.190
 say that what we experienced was part of 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.810
 what was lived is just and I 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.280
 I asked that as before I was centered 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.900
 as a point to keep in mind 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.570
 in a moment where we talk about 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.720
 violence in sport to mitigate the 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.910
 risk of these overflows that are given to 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.919
 swollen level or at the level of a group 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.630
 a part of the fans that can 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.100
 get to happen for example in a moment 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.900
 so high for the sporting 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.090
 speaking for national of peÃ±arol that the 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.860
 classic is played on a Monday night 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.080
 where obviously the securities and 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.230
 guarantees are less than if the 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.120
 show and security is 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.430
 will develop in the afternoon with 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.580
 obviously by sunlight that for the 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.850
 police is better the procedure without 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.850
 Doubts
