00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.850
 Hmm 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:15.120
 Hmmm 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.720

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.720

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.210
 2 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.580
 there were 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.580
 Masu Tei 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.110
 Nde not afford to simmer Well indeed like a ramen soup for a long time 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.940
 Manioi but I feel much 10 minutes 20 minutes 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:51.930
 It is because it uses the meat sauce of the roll product but it is a nice smell 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.630
 Then put the pasta here + + entwined with the sauce and the birdie is up Here is the autumn leaves of the bird 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.660
 Poke from 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:01:00.130
 ー ー ー ー ミ ー ト ー ソ ー ス ー ス ス ー ス パ ッ で す ー で す 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:03.640
 For the time being, I tried riding on the hot spring Tamako for peace of mind, though 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:08.640
 This is too hot 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 What kind of spaghetti are people who eat it 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.520
 Well because it is using the I'm good off-the-shelf 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.090
 But I feel like it is more rich than the day because it is cooked in this rather than eat normally 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.560
 Isn't it 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.659
 Then I will try to eat a portion of the problem 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.300
 This part of this hand is really 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:33.430
 New there 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:37.330
 Perfect This is a tricker That bird will squeeze and pull and pull 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.540
 It feels like it's spread all over his mouth 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.650
 Isn't it worthwhile to eat this while it 's water ? 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:49.570
 Just because there are many bones and it is very hard to eat 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:55.260
 It hurts when this and the lower part of the center hits the shoes, but the taste is mine for 12 minutes 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.260
 If you want to secure collagen in this way is recommended 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.480
 me 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.620
 ni 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.330
 What 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.980
 I am one
