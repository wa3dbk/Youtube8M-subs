00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.410 
look at the actual facts firstly
playstation<00:03:29.140> 4<00:03:29.380> sales<00:03:29.710> numbers<00:03:30.130> are<00:03:30.370> just

playstation 4 sales numbers are just

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.600 
playstation 4 sales numbers are just
exponentially<00:03:31.420> larger<00:03:32.320> than<00:03:32.440> Xbox<00:03:32.980> one's<00:03:33.370> as

exponentially larger than Xbox one's as

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
PlayStation 4 the Xbox one is only sold

PlayStation 4 the Xbox one is only sold
10<00:03:40.930> million<00:03:41.260> copies<00:03:41.530> indicated<00:03:42.280> by<00:03:42.400> their

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
sales reports and PlayStation 4 actually

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.430 
sales reports and PlayStation 4 actually
sold<00:03:45.430> over<00:03:45.760> twenty<00:03:46.180> two<00:03:46.390> point<00:03:46.720> three<00:03:46.840> million

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
sold over twenty two point three million

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.980 
sold over twenty two point three million
so<00:03:47.920> that<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.310> itself<00:03:48.370> is<00:03:48.940> just<00:03:49.300> some<00:03:49.420> dwarfing

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
so that in itself is just some dwarfing

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.320 
so that in itself is just some dwarfing
numbers<00:03:50.350> right<00:03:50.830> there<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.430> naturally<00:03:52.000> player

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
numbers right there and naturally player

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.420 
numbers right there and naturally player
numbers<00:03:52.720> on<00:03:52.900> PlayStation<00:03:53.530> 4<00:03:53.740> are<00:03:53.920> much<00:03:54.190> higher

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
numbers on PlayStation 4 are much higher

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.000 
numbers on PlayStation 4 are much higher
than<00:03:54.760> Xbox<00:03:55.540> one's<00:03:55.900> player<00:03:56.230> numbers<00:03:56.620> so<00:03:56.860> it

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
than Xbox one's player numbers so it

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.770 
than Xbox one's player numbers so it
could<00:03:57.190> work<00:03:57.400> out<00:03:57.580> that<00:03:57.760> Activision<00:03:58.360> markets

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
could work out that Activision markets

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.870 
could work out that Activision markets
this<00:03:58.959> deal<00:03:59.200> towards<00:03:59.590> PlayStation<00:04:00.220> 4<00:04:00.520> because

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
this deal towards PlayStation 4 because

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.420 
this deal towards PlayStation 4 because
the<00:04:01.209> masses<00:04:01.690> are<00:04:01.900> there<00:04:02.260> on<00:04:02.440> PlayStation<00:04:03.190> 4

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
the masses are there on PlayStation 4

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.400 
the masses are there on PlayStation 4
but<00:04:04.000> another<00:04:04.180> theory<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:05.050> fact<00:04:05.320> that

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
but another theory is the fact that

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.020 
but another theory is the fact that
Activision<00:04:05.920> could<00:04:06.130> maybe<00:04:06.340> work<00:04:06.610> this<00:04:06.820> in

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
Activision could maybe work this in

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.970 
Activision could maybe work this in
Reverse<00:04:07.209> instead<00:04:08.140> of<00:04:08.170> marketing<00:04:08.709> it<00:04:08.800> to

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
Reverse instead of marketing it to

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.520 
Reverse instead of marketing it to
PlayStation<00:04:09.640> 4<00:04:09.850> where<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.240> masses<00:04:10.690> are<00:04:10.900> could

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
PlayStation 4 where the masses are could

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.260 
PlayStation 4 where the masses are could
they<00:04:11.650> actually<00:04:12.070> market<00:04:12.400> at<00:04:12.490> sim<00:04:12.670> Microsoft

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
they actually market at sim Microsoft

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.750 
they actually market at sim Microsoft
here<00:04:13.540> again<00:04:13.930> for<00:04:14.170> another<00:04:14.620> deal<00:04:15.040> so<00:04:15.550> that<00:04:15.700> it

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
here again for another deal so that it

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.000 
here again for another deal so that it
could<00:04:15.880> help<00:04:16.060> boost<00:04:16.450> up<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.780> sales<00:04:17.260> of<00:04:17.440> Xbox

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
could help boost up the sales of Xbox

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.070 
could help boost up the sales of Xbox
one<00:04:18.370> because<00:04:18.730> Microsoft<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:19.600> Activision

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
one because Microsoft and Activision

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.260 
one because Microsoft and Activision
have<00:04:20.320> been<00:04:20.560> closely<00:04:20.890> knit<00:04:21.250> now<00:04:21.400> for<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.760> long

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
have been closely knit now for a long

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.390 
have been closely knit now for a long
time<00:04:22.540> so<00:04:23.140> it<00:04:23.260> could<00:04:23.380> work<00:04:23.560> out<00:04:23.740> like<00:04:23.979> a<00:04:24.040> buddy

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
time so it could work out like a buddy

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.680 
time so it could work out like a buddy
system<00:04:24.669> but<00:04:25.090> I<00:04:25.300> fine

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
system but I fine

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.850 
system but I fine
that<00:04:25.870> theory<00:04:26.170> to<00:04:26.230> be<00:04:26.320> a<00:04:26.380> little<00:04:26.680> bit

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
that theory to be a little bit

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.130 
that theory to be a little bit
improbable<00:04:27.370> but<00:04:27.790> instead<00:04:28.570> of<00:04:28.690> actually

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
improbable but instead of actually

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.170 
improbable but instead of actually
trying<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.530> favor<00:04:29.980> which<00:04:30.460> one<00:04:30.790> or<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.150> other

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
trying to favor which one or the other

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.690 
trying to favor which one or the other
gets<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.960> just<00:04:32.290> based<00:04:32.560> off<00:04:32.800> of<00:04:32.860> sales<00:04:33.340> numbers

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
gets it just based off of sales numbers

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.280 
gets it just based off of sales numbers
alone<00:04:34.120> we<00:04:34.660> do<00:04:34.810> know<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:34.990> they've<00:04:35.260> been

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
alone we do know that they've been

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.590 
alone we do know that they've been
played<00:04:35.710> testing<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.190> game<00:04:36.370> on<00:04:36.520> PlayStation<00:04:37.270> 4

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
played testing the game on PlayStation 4

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.390 
played testing the game on PlayStation 4
and<00:04:37.840> that's<00:04:38.230> another<00:04:38.380> thing<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:39.010> a<00:04:39.040> lot<00:04:39.160> of

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
and that's another thing that a lot of

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.130 
and that's another thing that a lot of
people<00:04:39.610> are<00:04:39.820> saying<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.270> going<00:04:40.510> to<00:04:40.600> suggest<00:04:40.810> a

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
people are saying is going to suggest a

playstation 4 deal for DLC early for
black<00:04:44.380> ops<00:04:44.410> 3<00:04:44.920> but<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.130> biggest<00:04:45.310> thing<00:04:45.490> I

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
black ops 3 but the biggest thing I

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.030 
black ops 3 but the biggest thing I
think<00:04:46.090> out<00:04:46.240> of<00:04:46.480> this<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:47.200> take<00:04:47.350> a<00:04:47.380> look<00:04:47.650> at<00:04:47.830> is

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
think out of this to take a look at is

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.010 
think out of this to take a look at is
the<00:04:48.250> hardware<00:04:48.700> differences<00:04:48.970> between<00:04:49.480> two

the hardware differences between two

the hardware differences between two

standpoint playstation 4 is by far the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.380 
standpoint playstation 4 is by far the
way<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.710> go<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.100> develop<00:04:57.610> your<00:04:57.700> game<00:04:57.940> on<00:04:57.970> and

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
then port it over to xbox one simply go

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.090 
then port it over to xbox one simply go
to<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.450> hardware<00:05:01.690> in<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.020> playstation<00:05:02.590> 4<00:05:02.890> is

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.060 
to the hardware in the playstation 4 is
much<00:05:03.760> better<00:05:04.060> than<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.540> xbox<00:05:05.050> one<00:05:05.440> if<00:05:05.650> you

much better than the xbox one if you

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.670 
much better than the xbox one if you

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.890 
Xbox one has been 900p and I think maybe
950<00:05:29.770> or<00:05:29.950> 1000<00:05:30.760> piece<00:05:30.970> so<00:05:31.180> obviously<00:05:31.630> that's

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
950 or 1000 piece so obviously that's

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.750 
950 or 1000 piece so obviously that's
not<00:05:31.990> too<00:05:32.410> big<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:32.620> a<00:05:32.740> difference<00:05:32.919> but<00:05:33.490> in<00:05:33.580> terms

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
not too big of a difference but in terms

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.730 
not too big of a difference but in terms
of<00:05:33.910> the<00:05:34.030> output<00:05:34.450> as<00:05:34.600> a<00:05:34.660> whole<00:05:35.169> and<00:05:35.410> a<00:05:35.500> raw

xbox one is that it will run a full 60

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
frames per second which is something

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.140 
frames per second which is something
that<00:05:44.169> we<00:05:44.320> have<00:05:44.560> seen<00:05:44.800> frame<00:05:45.160> tearing<00:05:45.610> in<00:05:45.760> a<00:05:45.880> lot

60fps<00:06:02.940> that's<00:06:03.940> something<00:06:04.330> that<00:06:04.360> is<00:06:04.660> only

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
60fps that's something that is only

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.720 
60fps that's something that is only
rumoured<00:06:05.260> at<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:05.590> time<00:06:05.800> and<00:06:06.070> really<00:06:06.490> would

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
that's what we're stuck out that's the

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.360 
that's what we're stuck out that's the
facts<00:06:16.419> that<00:06:16.630> we<00:06:16.720> have<00:06:16.930> and<00:06:17.200> really<00:06:17.440> it's<00:06:17.740> still

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
facts that we have and really it's still

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.100 
facts that we have and really it's still
kind<00:06:18.610> of<00:06:18.669> gridlocked<00:06:19.150> I<00:06:19.390> think<00:06:19.690> it<00:06:19.810> could<00:06:19.990> go

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
kind of gridlocked I think it could go

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.770 
kind of gridlocked I think it could go
either<00:06:20.140> way<00:06:20.470> or<00:06:20.680> maybe<00:06:21.220> not<00:06:21.520> even<00:06:21.730> at<00:06:22.090> all<00:06:22.419> so

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
either way or maybe not even at all so

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.090 
either way or maybe not even at all so
that's<00:06:23.050> we're<00:06:23.169> gonna<00:06:23.260> end<00:06:23.470> up<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.650> video<00:06:23.860> here
