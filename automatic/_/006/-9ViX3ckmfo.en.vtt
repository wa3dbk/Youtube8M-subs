00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.640
 phrase all past time was better for

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.540

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.730

 as they were beautiful as they were beautiful 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.469
 I remember the first holidays 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.620
 when you went out to that first party 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.899
 with horrible denim pants like 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.199
 until each shirt as taken by the 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.750
 mom so if the men aside the 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.130
 women to the other one nervous to take out 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.229
 the old woman to dance I do not think that 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.540
 he said go go almost that he was pushed to 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:15.060
 11 here and there and one said the old 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.060
 with that trembling hello voice 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:26.850

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.860
 one day I'm going to rebel and I'm going to kill you 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.820
 and it was leaving but it was healthy parties 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.680
 they agree the most bravo in a dance was 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.390
 the blender that ended the people in 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.030

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.310

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.980
 of the blender is now going to a motel 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.440

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.420
