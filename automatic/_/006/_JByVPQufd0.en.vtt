feel for the performance first thing I'm
gonna<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.790> increase<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
gonna do here is just increase the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.850 
gonna do here is just increase the
screen<00:00:42.719> brightness<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.500> see<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
screen brightness and you can see that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.029 
screen brightness and you can see that
it's<00:00:43.980> quite<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.190> bright<00:00:44.489> display<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:46.230> another

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
it's quite a bright display and another

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.740 
it's quite a bright display and another
really<00:00:47.640> important<00:00:48.120> thing<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.480> look<00:00:48.629> for

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
really important thing that we look for

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.410 
really important thing that we look for
on<00:00:48.840> tablets<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.469> wide<00:00:49.710> IPS<00:00:50.550> type<00:00:50.879> viewing

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
on tablets is that wide IPS type viewing

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.450 
on tablets is that wide IPS type viewing
angle<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.110> in-plane<00:00:52.559> switching<00:00:52.590> or<00:00:53.070> IPS

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
angle so it's in-plane switching or IPS

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.619 
angle so it's in-plane switching or IPS
and<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> Innova<00:00:55.980> mix<00:00:56.190> two

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.790 
and you can see that the Innova mix two
passes<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:58.020> flying<00:00:58.289> colors<00:01:00.680> we<00:01:01.680> go

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
passes that with flying colors we go

doesn't<00:01:58.259> work<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.950> has<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.100> take<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.520> out

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670

into<00:01:59.820> another<00:01:59.939> app<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.509> make<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.259> work

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.600 
YouTube's probably exception to the rule
there<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.259> generally<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:05.070> find<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.460> those

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
there but generally we find that those

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.100 
there but generally we find that those
things<00:02:05.909> are<00:02:06.030> broken<00:02:06.180> on<00:02:06.540> other<00:02:06.719> tablet

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
things are broken on other tablet

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.589 
things are broken on other tablet
platforms<00:02:07.590> Windows<00:02:08.340> 8<00:02:08.520> they<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:09.000> work<00:02:09.209> which

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
platforms Windows 8 they just work which

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.270 
platforms Windows 8 they just work which
is<00:02:09.780> great

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
is great

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.730 
is great
switching<00:02:11.849> between<00:02:12.000> webpages<00:02:12.959> is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
switching between webpages is

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.360 
switching between webpages is
really<00:02:14.700> quite<00:02:14.880> easy<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.830> just<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:17.070> little

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
really quite easy and just a little

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.840 
really quite easy and just a little
swipe<00:02:17.580> gestures<00:02:18.030> there<00:02:18.210> that<00:02:18.360> we<00:02:18.450> need<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.140> do

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
swipe gestures there that we need to do

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.130 
swipe gestures there that we need to do
and<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.120> see<00:02:21.270> I've<00:02:21.360> got<00:02:21.480> four<00:02:21.750> different

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
and you can see I've got four different

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
web browsing windows open here and

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.840 
web browsing windows open here and
that's<00:02:24.660> not<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.900> problem

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
that's not a problem

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.800 
that's not a problem
alright<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.150> really<00:02:27.420> test<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
alright so to really test the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.630 
alright so to really test the
performance<00:02:27.960> of<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.800> tablet<00:02:29.160> out<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.490> see

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
performance of the tablet out and to see

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.430 
performance of the tablet out and to see
what<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.090> new<00:02:30.360> bank<00:02:30.630> trail<00:02:30.840> atom<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.290> all

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
what this new bank trail atom is all

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.800 
what this new bank trail atom is all
about<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:32.160> we<00:02:32.880> need<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.180> probably<00:02:33.360> load<00:02:33.630> up

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
about and we need to probably load up

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.390 
about and we need to probably load up
something<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:34.170> ash<00:02:34.530> valve<00:02:34.920> eight<00:02:35.160> here

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
something like ash valve eight here

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.060 
something like ash valve eight here
which<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.820> game<00:02:36.390> that's<00:02:36.600> in<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.070> available

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
which is a game that's in the available

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
and the windows tablets store it's a car

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.550 
and the windows tablets store it's a car
game<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.550> pretty<00:02:41.880> high-intensity<00:02:42.630> sort<00:02:43.500> of

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
game it's pretty high-intensity sort of

game it's pretty high-intensity sort of
car<00:02:43.800> game<00:02:44.040> but<00:02:44.220> I'm<00:02:44.340> going<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.550> go<00:02:44.700> here<00:02:45.120> and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
car game but I'm going to go here and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.560 
car game but I'm going to go here and
see<00:02:46.830> if<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:46.980> can<00:02:47.100> figure<00:02:47.310> out<00:02:47.430> how<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.730> light<00:02:48.450> up

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
see if I can figure out how to light up

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.490 
see if I can figure out how to light up
a<00:02:48.690> race<00:02:49.460> right<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:51.750> can<00:02:51.900> see<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.350> hasn't

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
a race right you can see that it hasn't

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.440 
a race right you can see that it hasn't
missed<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.860> beat<00:02:52.890> in<00:02:53.460> terms<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.880> those<00:02:54.000> graphics

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
missed a beat in terms of those graphics

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:04.050 
missed a beat in terms of those graphics
and<00:02:54.600> content<00:02:55.050> so<00:02:55.230> far

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.900

the only old atom processor the last

the only old atom processor the last
generation<00:03:07.540> third<00:03:08.440> generation<00:03:08.470> it

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
generation third generation it

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.590 
generation third generation it
definitely<00:03:09.730> would<00:03:09.850> have<00:03:09.880> been<00:03:10.090> able<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.390> fire

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600
