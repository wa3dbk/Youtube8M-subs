00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.949 
washer to go if you look at the bottom
of<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.160> bag<00:02:13.400> you'll<00:02:13.940> notice<00:02:14.360> there<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.930> a

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
of the bag you'll notice there is a

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.830 
of the bag you'll notice there is a
washer<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.220> has<00:02:16.490> to<00:02:16.700> be<00:02:16.819> installed<00:02:17.209> into

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
washer so that has to be installed into

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.990 
washer so that has to be installed into
the<00:02:17.870> rim<00:02:18.230> before<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:18.980> install<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.549> on<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.879> the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
the rim before you install it on to the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.880 
the rim before you install it on to the
RC<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.810> last<00:02:21.019> thing<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.319> want<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.560> talk<00:02:21.769> about

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
RC the last thing I want to talk about

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.570 
RC the last thing I want to talk about
is

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
is

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.220 
is
check<00:02:22.640> out<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.910> size<00:02:23.270> difference<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.990> mean<00:02:24.140> the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
check out the size difference I mean the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.320 
check out the size difference I mean the
talent<00:02:24.710> scenes<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.160> much<00:02:25.310> smaller<00:02:25.670> than<00:02:26.030> dirt

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
talent scenes so much smaller than dirt

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.860 
talent scenes so much smaller than dirt

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.320 
hogs
the<00:02:27.290> width<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.710> about<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.130> same<00:02:28.400> though<00:02:28.610> now

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
the width is about the same though now

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.910 
the width is about the same though now
there<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:29.630> couple<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.080> things<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.650> have

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
there is a couple of things that I have

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.220 
there is a couple of things that I have
to<00:02:31.070> explain<00:02:31.310> since<00:02:32.150> there<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.570> a<00:02:32.840> wider

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
to explain since there is a wider

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.410 
to explain since there is a wider
diameter<00:02:33.530> on<00:02:34.040> these<00:02:34.220> tires<00:02:34.460> I<00:02:34.850> am<00:02:35.060> gonna<00:02:35.210> get<00:02:35.390> a

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
diameter on these tires I am gonna get a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.210 
diameter on these tires I am gonna get a
higher<00:02:35.660> top<00:02:35.990> speed<00:02:36.320> but<00:02:36.590> since<00:02:36.920> these<00:02:37.160> are

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
higher top speed but since these are

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.580 
higher top speed but since these are
rather<00:02:37.640> heavy<00:02:38.060> especially<00:02:38.510> compared<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.530> the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
rather heavy especially compared to the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.790 
rather heavy especially compared to the
stock<00:02:39.890> tires<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.520> cannot<00:02:41.390> use<00:02:41.840> top<00:02:42.410> speed

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
stock tires I cannot use top speed

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.950 
stock tires I cannot use top speed
gearing<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.520> would<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:43.940> work<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.480> motor<00:02:44.720> and

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
gearing it would just work the motor and

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.810 
gearing it would just work the motor and
ESC<00:02:45.110> way<00:02:45.590> too<00:02:45.650> much<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.340> could<00:02:46.550> easily

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
ESC way too much and I could easily

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.400 
ESC way too much and I could easily
overheat<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:48.250> destroy<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:50.170> I'm<00:02:51.170> not

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
overheat it and destroy it so I'm not

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.170 
overheat it and destroy it so I'm not
gonna<00:02:51.530> be<00:02:51.710> doing<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:52.070> but<00:02:52.520> I'm<00:02:52.640> more<00:02:53.000> than

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
gonna be doing that but I'm more than

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.670 
gonna be doing that but I'm more than
satisfied<00:02:53.360> with<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.050> gearing<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.470> have

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
satisfied with the gearing that I have

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.500 
satisfied with the gearing that I have
right<00:02:54.830> now<00:02:54.890> which<00:02:55.310> is<00:02:55.430> just<00:02:55.460> a<00:02:55.790> stock<00:02:56.120> gearing

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
right now which is just a stock gearing

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.570 
right now which is just a stock gearing
that<00:02:56.540> comes<00:02:56.870> with<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:57.470> enough<00:02:58.100> talk<00:02:58.340> let's

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
that comes with it so enough talk let's

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.810 
that comes with it so enough talk let's
get<00:02:58.940> these<00:02:59.090> installed<00:02:59.590> guys<00:03:00.590> these<00:03:01.220> tires

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
get these installed guys these tires

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.800 
get these installed guys these tires
look<00:03:02.630> good<00:03:03.880> now<00:03:04.880> because<00:03:05.300> of<00:03:05.420> these<00:03:05.540> tires

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
look good now because of these tires

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.050 
look good now because of these tires
being<00:03:06.230> bigger<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.950> does<00:03:07.190> ride<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.459> little<00:03:07.910> bit

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
being bigger it does ride a little bit

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.060 
being bigger it does ride a little bit
higher<00:03:08.330> but<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.930> ribs<00:03:09.140> do<00:03:09.440> push<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.830> tires

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
higher but the ribs do push the tires

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.730 
higher but the ribs do push the tires
away<00:03:10.340> from<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.820> chassis<00:03:11.090> which<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:11.930> awesome

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
away from the chassis which is awesome

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.380 
away from the chassis which is awesome
one<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.520> things<00:03:13.760> that<00:03:14.030> has<00:03:14.209> always

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
one of the things that has always

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.840 
one of the things that has always
bothered<00:03:14.930> me<00:03:15.170> about<00:03:15.320> this<00:03:15.709> RC<00:03:16.100> is<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.580> when

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
bothered me about this RC is that when

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.480 
bothered me about this RC is that when
you<00:03:16.940> get<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.270> stock<00:03:17.660> when<00:03:18.380> you<00:03:18.500> open<00:03:18.950> up<00:03:19.190> either

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
you get it stock when you open up either

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.550 
you get it stock when you open up either
one<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:19.880> these<00:03:19.970> battery<00:03:20.360> doors<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.959> rubs<00:03:21.380> up

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
one of these battery doors it rubs up

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.010 
one of these battery doors it rubs up
against<00:03:21.860> a<00:03:21.920> tire<00:03:22.160> look<00:03:23.030> at<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.300> clearance<00:03:23.780> on

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
against a tire look at the clearance on

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.290 
against a tire look at the clearance on
that<00:03:24.230> now<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:24.920> is<00:03:25.100> awesome

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
that now that is awesome

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.100 
that now that is awesome
I<00:03:26.330> love<00:03:27.320> these<00:03:27.680> tires<00:03:28.180> thank<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.420> so<00:03:29.840> much
