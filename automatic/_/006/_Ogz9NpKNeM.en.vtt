00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.100 
point reason why people is so weak it's
because<00:04:06.000> again<00:04:06.239> it's<00:04:06.390> big<00:04:06.540> weakness<00:04:06.930> with<00:04:07.019> his

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
because again it's big weakness with his

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.810 
because again it's big weakness with his
new<00:04:07.200> transformation<00:04:07.590> was<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.459> fact<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:08.730> he

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
new transformation was the fact that he

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.780 
new transformation was the fact that he
can't<00:04:09.060> hold<00:04:09.239> it<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.780> form<00:04:10.140> last<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.430> little

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
can't hold it the form last so little

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.920 
can't hold it the form last so little
for<00:04:11.910> him<00:04:12.060> it's<00:04:12.239> like<00:04:12.330> a<00:04:12.360> goat<00:04:12.570> when<00:04:12.750> Super

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
for him it's like a goat when Super

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.210 
for him it's like a goat when Super
