work I'm an architect and very
interested<00:00:34.010> in<00:00:34.129> green<00:00:34.489> design<00:00:34.910> in<00:00:35.269> my<00:00:36.170> home<00:00:36.410> I

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
interested in green design in my home I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.560 
interested in green design in my home I
was<00:00:36.710> able<00:00:36.949> to<00:00:37.100> really<00:00:37.370> employ<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:37.850> lot<00:00:38.300> of<00:00:38.329> these

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
was able to really employ a lot of these

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.840 
was able to really employ a lot of these
materials<00:00:39.140> that<00:00:39.679> I<00:00:40.039> was<00:00:40.219> interested<00:00:40.519> in

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
materials that I was interested in

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.729 
materials that I was interested in
everything<00:00:41.269> from<00:00:41.480> rammed<00:00:41.840> earth<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.469> poured

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
everything from rammed earth to poured

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.410 
everything from rammed earth to poured
and<00:00:42.829> placed<00:00:43.039> concrete<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:43.879> then<00:00:44.269> of<00:00:44.390> course

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
and placed concrete and then of course

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.979 
and placed concrete and then of course
in<00:00:44.809> decreed<00:00:45.170> I<00:00:45.519> develop<00:00:46.519> sin<00:00:46.760> decree<00:00:47.149> mainly

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
in decreed I develop sin decree mainly

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.020 
in decreed I develop sin decree mainly
because<00:00:48.199> I<00:00:48.379> wasn't<00:00:49.010> happy<00:00:49.250> with<00:00:49.429> a<00:00:49.579> lot<00:00:49.850> of<00:00:49.969> the

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
because I wasn't happy with a lot of the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.910 
because I wasn't happy with a lot of the
materials<00:00:50.510> that<00:00:50.600> were<00:00:50.809> available<00:00:50.989> to<00:00:51.530> me<00:00:51.800> as

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
materials that were available to me as

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.979 
materials that were available to me as
an<00:00:52.070> architect<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:52.850> also<00:00:53.690> because

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
an architect and also because

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.560 
an architect and also because
architecture<00:00:54.769> was<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:55.730> much<00:00:55.969> about<00:00:56.239> just

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
architecture was so much about just

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.290 
architecture was so much about just
selecting<00:00:57.350> products<00:00:58.010> from<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.609> catalog<00:00:59.059> and

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
selecting products from a catalog and

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.079 
selecting products from a catalog and
what's<00:01:00.019> lost<00:01:00.350> often<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:01.429> architecture<00:01:01.969> is<00:01:02.059> the

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
what's lost often in architecture is the

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.479 
what's lost often in architecture is the
ability<00:01:02.480> for<00:01:02.859> customization<00:01:03.859> and<00:01:03.980> for<00:01:04.159> craft

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
ability for customization and for craft

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.730 
ability for customization and for craft
and<00:01:04.940> thus<00:01:05.660> in<00:01:05.840> decree<00:01:06.080> it<00:01:06.140> became<00:01:06.410> a<00:01:06.440> perfect

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
and thus in decree it became a perfect

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.570 
and thus in decree it became a perfect
choice<00:01:11.200> when<00:01:12.200> I<00:01:12.230> first<00:01:12.530> started<00:01:12.950> concrete<00:01:13.430> was

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
choice when I first started concrete was

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.520 
choice when I first started concrete was
really<00:01:13.880> considered<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.420> radical<00:01:14.720> material

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
really considered a radical material

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.650 
really considered a radical material
really<00:01:16.190> dedicated<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:17.090> realms<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.600> the

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
really dedicated to the realms of the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.110 
really dedicated to the realms of the
exterior<00:01:18.260> and<00:01:18.650> not<00:01:19.160> as<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.490> finished<00:01:19.970> material

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
exterior and not as a finished material

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.920 
exterior and not as a finished material
for<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.660> inside

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.480 

for<00:01:24.930> me<00:01:25.049> architecture<00:01:25.680> especially<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:26.399> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
for me architecture especially for the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.210 
for me architecture especially for the
home<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.729> about<00:01:27.350> natural<00:01:28.350> light<00:01:28.560> natural

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
home is about natural light natural

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.510 
home is about natural light natural
materials<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.659> certain<00:01:31.020> tranquility<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
materials and a certain tranquility and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.960 
materials and a certain tranquility and
almost<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.090> Zen<00:01:33.560> feeling<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.740> respite<00:01:35.250> from<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
almost a Zen feeling of respite from the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.330 
almost a Zen feeling of respite from the
rest<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> world<00:01:37.039> one<00:01:38.039> of<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.189> things

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
rest of the world one of the things

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.919 
rest of the world one of the things
that's<00:01:38.460> been<00:01:38.640> fascinating<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:39.299> me<00:01:39.570> what's<00:01:39.780> in

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
that's been fascinating for me what's in

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.260 
that's been fascinating for me what's in
decreed<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.340> out<00:01:41.460> into<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> world

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
decreed is to get it out into the world

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.899 
decreed is to get it out into the world
and<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.869> other<00:01:43.140> people<00:01:43.200> have<00:01:43.979> input<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.850> it

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and have other people have input on it

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
and have other people have input on it
because<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.810> infinitely<00:01:46.320> customizable

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
because it is so infinitely customizable

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.569 
because it is so infinitely customizable
in<00:01:47.789> terms<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.179> color<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.590> aggregate<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.829> lot<00:01:50.460> of

the other things that we employ and in

the other things that we employ and in
the<00:01:52.710> house<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.490> real<00:01:53.759> connection

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the house is this real connection

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.449 
the house is this real connection
between<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.720> outside<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.950> lot<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.220> glass

between the outside with a lot of glass
and<00:01:57.030> also<00:01:57.569> the<00:01:58.110> ability<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.679> natural

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
material for the exterior so that I

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.199 
material for the exterior so that I
could<00:02:04.380> blur<00:02:04.619> really<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.280> definition<00:02:05.459> between

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
could blur really the definition between

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.559 
could blur really the definition between
the<00:02:06.539> inside<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:06.929> outside<00:02:08.479> with<00:02:09.479> the

my architecture there's a an interest in
