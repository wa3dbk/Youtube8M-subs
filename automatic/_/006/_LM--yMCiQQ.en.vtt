00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.070
 Tyrol in Austria staged in one 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.109
 Promotional film of the award winning design 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.109
 company prospectus course 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.260
 The region is dominated by the mountains 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.160
 and forests and is the home of all 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.160
 special glasses 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.780
 wooden glasses for with the wood 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.430
 timeless material par excellence and wood 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.920
 but always timeless for me 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.170
 will stay white unique and 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.060
 developed his own character and 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.660
 you always develop new styles 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.610
 came with wood pure wood glasses without 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.620
 metal is always a challenge 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.670
 for roland wolf and his team in the 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.670
 Tyrolean workshop 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.110
 the biggest problem is the conception 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.930
 should actually cut through 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.490
 will use the glasses 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.040
 After that, the glasses would be unstable 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.840
 the solution a special rides the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.100
 between the version and the glass and 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.290
 then pulled tight 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.200
 This is how the glass is put into spectacle frame 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.910
 Another point of failure fixes the wood 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.700
 joints their development took months 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.880
 but they also wanted the 34 year old and 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.680
 do not give up his team 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.270
 we have developed it with that 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.550
 We can do real wood glasses 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.430
 only wood is in particular like 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.630
 it is said that they are made of wood 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.970
 but the whole functions with it 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.470
 bring the high quality eyewear long with 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.590
 it should not fall 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.930
 they themselves do not open themselves 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.000
 stop before the glasl broke that 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.490
 Things are the economy in which 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.870
 joint to unravel from her wood 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.000
 be machine eyewear blanks 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.630
 Shaped to do the rest around 30 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.180
 Employee 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.580
 they glue wood joints 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.860
 and grind surfaces sheet everything in 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.090
 It takes about six hours to get it done 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.410
 a glasses is finished 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.850
 The biggest difficulty is with you 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.920
 safety the precision with the 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.220
 eyewear and the 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.840
 symmetry so in front of the optician you have to 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.610
 that must adapt exactly 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.430
 left and right the haptic that one in the 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.950
 end effect if you touch the glasses 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.570
 roland wolf has a pleasant feeling 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.630
 founded the company together with his 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.980
 partner maria elisabeth 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.270
 For months they experimented for the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.980
 manufacture the wooden eyewear with 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.810
 Rebuilt moped brakes 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.239
 they even relieve old milks 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.820
 automatically after a year of hard 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.410
 work came the success 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.630
 2009 was like the founding year for us 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.940
 said bankruptcy no money from the 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.050
 bank the last money we have then 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.459
 tries to reach the fair in paris 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.290
 this is then with a mobile home around 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.120
 then we went to eat 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.600
 had another meal and to eat something 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.280
 to buy 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.410
 the beautiful thing for us was that 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.570
 dream weekend was for us 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.880
 we have the first one there 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.380
 sale weekend the biggest price 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.910
 Winning glasses can always be there 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.799
 not just the prestigious ten models 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.299
 they have now received twice 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.760
 The glasses were with us until today 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.970
 numerous prizes awarded under 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.690

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.690
 award for product design 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.290
 Maria Elisabeth designs the models 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.890
 The technical can be inspired 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.630
 Draftsman prefers oldtimers 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.970
 She sits at one for up to four hours 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.180
 she pays particular attention to the sketch 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.069
 one thing when he design wood glasses then 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.080
 she has to take that into account too 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.819
 the material can be seen somewhere 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.010
 Should because the glasses when you go 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.870
 somehow not at all you can see it 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.790
 somehow wood or sometime completely 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.250
 it will not be that thin anymore 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.050
 then loses loses the equally 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:13.739
 your flair of the company's store in 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.989
 a former gas station 600 to 2500 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.220
 Euros cost the glasses you will be in 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.620
 the whole world is sold 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.280

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.640
 All friends are also thrilled 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.419

 roland wolf has ideas for new models 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.529
 already 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.569
 Wood was actually the beginning 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:54.029
 We are always looking for new ones 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.649
 materials of course the basis 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:56.879
 they do not have natural materials 

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:58.589
 be put 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:02.279
 our latest project is the stein 

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:04.499
 glasses are materials that we super 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:05.789
 find and where we are very much in 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.879
 existing new products now 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.879
 develop 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.050
 design eyewear made of natural material 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.050
 sustainable and not eco 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.150
 No
