00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.619
 hello, I'm Juan from the leroy store 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.390
 merlin from above and I'm going to teach you 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.130
 Install a small module in your lamp 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.400
 of ceiling to control them from a 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.400
 remote control 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:34.199
 and the remote control does not just 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.600
 will allow you to turn your lamp on and off 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.220
 but also regulate its intensity is 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.949
 a way to incorporate home automation in 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.809
 your home this simple task is a 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.460
 example of how you can automate the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.989
 operation not only of a lamp 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.000
 but also other devices 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.100
 electric as fans stoves 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.100
 coffee makers garage doors and shutters 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.230
 motorized the principle is very simple 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.239
 you need an issuer in our case is 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.370
 a remote control and a receiver like 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.620
 this module that is connected to the device 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.600
 that you want to control the emitter 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.300
 will transmit the orders to the receiver via 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.110
 radiofrequency these are the products 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.110
 what are we going to need 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.020
 a three-channel remote control 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.020
 god a 200 watt receiver module 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.969
 how do you see this remote control has 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.759
 three channels with which you can control 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.439
 up to three devices and something very 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.060
 important our lamp has a 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.829
 halogen bulb but this command 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.689
 it also allows you to regulate the intensity 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.689
 of led bulbs and low consumption 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.890
 as long as they are adjustable and these 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.750
 are the tools that we are going to 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.450
 use 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.640
 a common flat-blade screwdriver or 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.010
 an electrician screwdriver 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.010
 gloves, goggles and stairs 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.760
 as in any electricity task 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.220
 before starting cut the supply 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.140
 electrical we will place the module 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.570
 receiver hidden in the crest of the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.550
 lamp for this we have to remove the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.200
 lamp to access the cream where it 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.810
 join the two cables that come from the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.910
 installation with those of the lamp with the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.970
 screwdriver releases the four wires 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.540
 of the blue cream is neutral and brown 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.540
 the phase 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.180
 place the receiver and insert the cables 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.860
 that come from the roof in the terminals of 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.440
 entry that are those from the sides 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.680
 the letter n is for neutral the color 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.680
 blue 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.320
 and those of the lamp on the terminals of 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.890
 exit that are those of the center the n is 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.890
 for the neutral 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.520
 Restore the power supply 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.410
 so that the receiver module responds to 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.800
 command commands do the following 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.890
 the led flashes press the button on the 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.900
 I control how you see the LED flashes twice 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.200
 You can control your lamp from the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.700
 I send 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.700
 reassemble the lamp 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.750
 as you see the lamp responds to 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.750
 command orders 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.260
 if you want to continue having the option of 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.390
 control the lamp from a 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.270
 switch places a compatible one without 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.610
 cables where you want in your store 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.370
 you will find more domotic solutions that 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.410
 they work with these modules as a 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.360
 motion sensor detects when 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.610
 a presence sends a signal to the module 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.470
 of the lamp so that a 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.620
 opening sensor so that when opened 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.959
 a door lights the light 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.580
 a twilight sensor so that when 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.040
 dusk lights the bulb 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.720
 automatically a programmable command that 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.610
 will allow you to schedule hours of 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.930
 on and off or simulate that there 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.930
 people when you're not at home 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.890
 and if you wanted to control the lamp or 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.989
 any electrical device at a distance 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.940
 from your mobile you just have to make yourself 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.400
 with a compatible domotic central 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.989
 do not miss the video how to install a 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.989
