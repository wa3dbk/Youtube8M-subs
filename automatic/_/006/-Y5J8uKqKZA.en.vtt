00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.270 
think this could be used for utter on
skin<00:04:15.780> tones<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.349> but<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.709> depends<00:04:16.979> on<00:04:17.099> how<00:04:17.250> you

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
skin tones to but it depends on how you

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.129 
skin tones to but it depends on how you
use<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.729> but<00:04:18.000> they<00:04:18.150> come<00:04:18.630> in<00:04:18.750> different<00:04:18.930> colors

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
use it but they come in different colors

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.020 
use it but they come in different colors
this<00:04:19.829> one<00:04:20.099> called<00:04:20.340> topaz<00:04:20.909> and<00:04:21.860> Sandor

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
this one called topaz and Sandor

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.240

something<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.600> don't<00:04:23.780> know<00:04:23.840> but<00:04:24.500> I'll<00:04:24.830> try<00:04:25.130> to

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
something I don't know but I'll try to

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.770

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
get the Topaz I could probably use it

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.780 
get the Topaz I could probably use it
for<00:04:26.900> contouring<00:04:27.410> or<00:04:27.620> something<00:04:28.070> you<00:04:28.639> know<00:04:28.760> I

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790
