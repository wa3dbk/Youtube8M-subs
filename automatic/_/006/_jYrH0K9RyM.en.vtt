back of the transom whereas the previous

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.580 
back of the transom whereas the previous
model<00:00:41.270> they<00:00:41.390> tapered<00:00:41.780> right<00:00:41.930> back<00:00:42.170> so<00:00:42.500> it

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
model they tapered right back so it

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.310 
model they tapered right back so it
gives<00:00:42.800> you<00:00:42.980> a<00:00:43.190> bit<00:00:43.550> more<00:00:43.810> internal<00:00:44.810> freeboard

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
gives you a bit more internal freeboard

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.990
