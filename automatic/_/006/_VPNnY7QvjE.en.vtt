00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello friends from youtube I'm law kender 97 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.299
 this is my first video will be about 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.610
 PC games with few requirements 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.440
 I clarify all these games I've tried 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.570
 on my pc that is crap and that the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.670
 games are not sorted by chance 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.529
 well let's start in the first place is 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.390
 the game land of the dead the game is 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.220
 a prequel to the land of the movie 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
 dead that will take place during the outbreak 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.060
 initial of the zombie epidemic the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.039
 players take on the role of a farmer 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.480
 called since one day he finds his 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.820
 farm besieged by the undead 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.009
 after finding the other farms 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.989
 nearby desolate link their way to the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.730
 city hoping to find 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.500
 help but instead of finding the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.510
 ruined city invaded by the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.430
 living dead 'and later it 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.440
 whole of the existence of a refuge 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.210
 secure located within the city and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.670
 makes his priority to get to him 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.950
 has acceptable graphics so it is 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.050
 very good I recommend it a lot in the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.079
 second place is the game counter 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.300
 strike 1 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.670
 counter-strike that is a type game 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.800
 multiplayer either in lan or online is 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.870
 a complete modification of the game to 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.759
 flight made by min laws live 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.090
 who released the first version on 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.979
 June 18, 1999 the latest version 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.990
 of the game is the global counter strike 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.789
 offensive to one of the versions of the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.770
 action game in first person 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.689
 line most played in the world against games 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.700
 most recent as the counter version 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.500
 strike is urss based on the source engine 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.140
 which has been developed for the game 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.179
 to flight 2 today is also 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.009
 playable in gnu / linux or in macintosh os 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.259
 we say from the steam platform 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.909
 game does not have the best graphics but 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.159
 itself is very good also the ones 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.409
 I recommend this game runs in all 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.420
 computers do not need graphics card 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.979
 even the most crap pc in the world what 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.289
 run to the game you can apply 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.000
 many to make changes like changing the 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.369
 start menu and more in position 3 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.869

 during its first versions it was 

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:07.369
 Free valve improved its motor system 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.319
 graphic connection and interface this game 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.269
 It does not have the best graphics but in itself 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.459
 It is good is like a cross between 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.590

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.560

 most important of the second war 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.000
 world in a virtual recreation 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.280
 three-dimensional in which the player 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.400
 can submerge as a soldier on foot or in 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.900
 vehicle in one of the two sides 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.820
 among the novelties that he contributed in his 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.860
 At this time, the possibility of 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.080
 handle various types of vehicles and 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.850
 your maps based on real orography with 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.460
 capacity for several tens of 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.220
 simultaneous players 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.470
 battlefield 1942 was a game that did not 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.840
 I had many graphic innovations but 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.270
 surprised by its dynamism realism and 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.580
 playability when creating gravity effects 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.230
 call yourself jump from the jeeps mode in 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.090
 that the wheels of the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.960
 tanks when making contact with soil 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.810
 rugged 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.940
 etc and mainly and although it already existed 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.800
 europe battleground by incorporating 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.600
 planes to a shooting game in 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.240
 first person of war what you 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.340
 I add realism another thing 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.530
 interesting that can be drawn from 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.270
 this game is the maps as it is 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.270
 they created great and small maps 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.250
 scale and with very good personalization 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.020
 there are small flaws such as the 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.970
 interior of the vehicles or the sky 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.700
 static and the haze of war that does not 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.130
 important failures in the position 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.170
 put 6 is the quad game that 24 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.880
 second is a video game of shots in 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.480
 first person developed by ik 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.550
 software and distributed by activision in 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.040
 1997 although it uses the name of quad that 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.080
 also software and it is considered of 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.970
 made as its sequel its history will 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.620
 completely away from the mythical environment 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.360
 medieval seen on quad that stops 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.220
 get into science fiction the 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.270
 solo action takes place in a 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.060
 invasion of civilization 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.430
 extraterrestrial strokes the player is a 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.350
 soldier of the presumably last 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.330
 humanity's attempt to get rid of 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.640
 the early assimilation by the 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.440
 extraterrestrial cyborgs strokes that 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.320
 they invade planets to take him 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.060
 resources however the resources of the 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.190
 strokes are living beings for 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.590
 work with your expanding machines 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.030
 well his domain the continuation of the 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.150
 history of quad that second is not 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.100
 any third sand but 44 the 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.770
 music of the game was made by the 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.900
 May sonic band in which second 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.300
 uses a client network network system 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.340
 server similar to 4 and has all 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.710
 other engine features 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.290
 said game in addition to several additional 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.360
 unlike quad that where not 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.550
 got acceleration by hardware but by 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.670
 later patches since second was 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.010
 released with native support of open in 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.840
 great great play the truth and in the last 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.520
 put is the game grand theft auto 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.890

 posted by rockstar games implements 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.270
 new attributes like for example power 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.220
 strike out ideal in shooting missions 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.320
 new weapons and better graphics 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.449
 compared to the previous ones in the saga 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.250
 grand theft auto 'more sexual content 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.169
 the story begins when in a 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.440
 meeting in the bistro frames of liberty 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:32.900

 idea of expanding their businesses to the south and 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.500
 who is watching as the traffickers 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.930
 Mexicans and Colombians and even the 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.060
 Cuban refugees are taking the 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.580
 benefits and he also wants his part 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.650
 one of his men warns him that everything 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.660
 the money from drugs and that 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.000
 it could bring you problems because the 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.979
 families do not accept to get involved in that 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.050
 but they are and are convinced that the 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.610
 families will end up seeing it under their 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.250
 point of view and it is not shown 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.139
 worried however starts to 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.240
 worry when they talk about the 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:08.120
 release of tommy vercetti one of his 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.949
 old thugs are I do not consider it

 good for business so decide 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:13.340
 get rid of him 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.410
 the idea is to send it to vice city so that 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.419
 start the business there then what 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.699
