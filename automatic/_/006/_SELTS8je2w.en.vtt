00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.500
 second phase the full of maloqueiro night 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.150
 What does that yellow these attempts to 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.760
 imitate the knights of the zodiac who 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.620
 The tired of lady have failed these roles. 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.410
 in a year in the middle of the screen reminded me of a 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.450
 scenery of mortal kombat same thing by 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.330
 radio everyone but you have 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.360
 full freedom of the flying punch kick 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.120
 in an impressive frequency this game 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.400
 beast is intriguing is to see how the phases 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.520
 vary a lot in phase 3 you are already 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.459
 to love with several new enemies like 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.820
 This woman whip people is the layer of 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.880
 gold insists that killing the saga alone 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.810
 boss looks like a robbery goes to phase 4 in 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.820
 bridge 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.709
 this time the teams decided to wear 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.130
 black because it will be 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.170
 it will be because they type here just outside the elite 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.630
 I went to see and what here this crazy is 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.850
 juggling psychopaths mota 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.840
 the chief focus is that when the son of 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.540
 bitch said agreement that average almost 5 in 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.300
 ship together everything that is most sacred 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.760
 phase is fucking very appealing and nothing more 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.670
 to say you are in the 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.069
 The factory is the knight Diogo went purple 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.620
 now I do not know why they tried to change the 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.819
 enemy color for middletown player 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.950
 only 1 23 lucas hulk pib because it's up to one 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.319
 previous stage head cup and goal 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.819
 common enemy of the game will by now in 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.810
 hell and the boss 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.209
 are two normal normal blond men at 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.340
 next stage begins a shipowner who lives 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.950
 only it is but I'm afraid to do it 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.230
 so I do not know why it gives me a 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.920
 fact that they have little space but seeing the 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.920
 attacks 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:14.030
 after long with two punches and kicks 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.859
 you arrive in the last phase of the game you 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.870
 nothing less than invading the 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.729
 headquarters mapfre that touched land in 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.639
 the enemies of this stage have a 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.160
 very gay style of fighting type chang sung 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.710
 mortal kombat as one might expect hamas 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.050
 pants with barbed wire that the pulp is 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.090
 blind in the last phase all enemies of the 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.070
 game will practically fall on 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.010
 It's up to you, boy or no, my son. 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.620
 ready final boss the boss of the gang 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.690
 there sat on the throne there is just like 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.090
 shao khan already imitated the knights of the 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.099
 zodiac the rambo and now want to escape 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.500
 after the show the singer will take in the fear 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.820
 but before frying it will see several 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.160
 enemies in you 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.680
 killing them the boss gets up and still 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.110
 remains on the enemies is the game not 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.789
 it's easy to rain, it's already nine but with a lot 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.220
 you just knock it down 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:04.570
 finalizing this legendary game with a 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.870
 photo shoot and the background music 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.490
 times that do not come back 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.580
 worthy of a game that marked my 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.580
 childhood 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.340

 and the son is getting funk guys if 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.000

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.490
