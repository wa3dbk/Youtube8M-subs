00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
right now but that kind of mixture is is

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.050 
right now but that kind of mixture is is
very<00:01:41.640> good<00:01:41.880> too<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.330> base<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.700> go<00:01:44.700> ahead<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
very good too as a base to go ahead and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.480 
very good too as a base to go ahead and
put<00:01:45.240> some<00:01:45.450> moisture<00:01:45.900> well<00:01:46.650> that<00:01:46.830> is<00:01:46.980> moisture

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
put some moisture well that is moisture

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.880

but<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:48.570> hair<00:01:48.810> definitely<00:01:49.110> felt<00:01:49.710> softer<00:01:50.130> and

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
but the hair definitely felt softer and

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.070 
but the hair definitely felt softer and
moisturised<00:01:52.890> after<00:01:53.310> i<00:01:53.340> did<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.790> quick<00:01:54.180> thing

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
moisturised after i did this quick thing

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.440 
moisturised after i did this quick thing
here<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.590> basically<00:01:56.430> i<00:01:56.760> just<00:01:56.850> did<00:01:57.150> enough

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
here and basically i just did enough

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.750 
here and basically i just did enough
twists<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.440> that<00:01:58.650> it<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.890> hold<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.310> moisture

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
twists so that it can hold a moisture

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.360 
twists so that it can hold a moisture
and<00:01:59.970> I<00:02:00.360> could<00:02:00.570> still<00:02:00.900> kind<00:02:01.800> of<00:02:01.860> put<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.100> into<00:02:02.340> a

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
and I could still kind of put it into a

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.450 
and I could still kind of put it into a
style<00:02:02.730> two<00:02:03.240> ponytails<00:02:03.600> out<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.230> door<00:02:04.410> which<00:02:05.310> I

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
style two ponytails out the door which I

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.530 
style two ponytails out the door which I
could<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.760> away<00:02:05.850> with<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.630> anyways

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
could get away with that but anyways

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.130 
could get away with that but anyways

focused on was the ends the the shaft of
her<00:02:32.740> here<00:02:33.160> took<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.360> moisture<00:02:34.780> easily<00:02:35.260> the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
her here took the moisture easily the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.500 
her here took the moisture easily the
ends<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:35.980> her<00:02:36.130> here<00:02:36.370> even<00:02:36.700> though<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:36.880> have<00:02:37.270> been

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
ends of her here even though I have been

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.210 
ends of her here even though I have been
cutting<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:38.080> trimming<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.620> cutting<00:02:38.980> and

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
cutting and trimming and cutting and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.790 
cutting and trimming and cutting and
trimming<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.640> that's<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.940> whole<00:02:40.180> nother<00:02:40.800> video

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
trimming and that's a whole nother video

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.070 
trimming and that's a whole nother video
in<00:02:42.340> regards<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:42.970> why<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.150> had<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.390> do<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:43.810> but

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
in regards to why I had to do that but

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.280 
in regards to why I had to do that but
she's<00:02:44.320> got<00:02:46.080> clean<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:49.270> don't<00:02:49.959> know<00:02:50.110> what

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
she's got clean and so I don't know what

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.540 
she's got clean and so I don't know what
goes<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:51.340> probably<00:02:52.209> something<00:02:52.810> with<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.020> pH

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
goes on I probably something with the pH

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.990 
goes on I probably something with the pH
but<00:02:54.550> her<00:02:55.150> ends<00:02:55.840> or<00:02:56.050> natural<00:02:56.890> here<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.459> it's

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
but her ends or natural here and it's

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.229 
but her ends or natural here and it's
really<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.959> tough<00:02:59.430> you<00:03:00.430> know<00:03:00.550> tough<00:03:00.940> thing<00:03:01.209> to

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
really a tough you know tough thing to

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.530 
really a tough you know tough thing to
moisturize<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.410> made<00:03:03.310> sure<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.640> focus<00:03:04.239> on<00:03:04.420> the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
moisturize so I made sure I focus on the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.870 
moisturize so I made sure I focus on the
ends<00:03:04.959> waited<00:03:05.770> a<00:03:05.860> little<00:03:05.980> while<00:03:06.130> for<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.640> water

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
ends waited a little while for the water

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.229 
ends waited a little while for the water
to<00:03:07.020> absorb<00:03:08.020> by<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.320> hair<00:03:08.620> shop<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.220> then<00:03:09.880> put

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
to absorb by the hair shop and then put

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.550 
to absorb by the hair shop and then put
the<00:03:11.550> little<00:03:12.550> Asik<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.180> pee<00:03:13.360> on<00:03:13.390> there<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.080> it

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
the little Asik you pee on there and it

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.590 
the little Asik you pee on there and it
definitely<00:03:14.830> made<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> difference<00:03:15.550> when<00:03:16.330> I<00:03:16.360> did

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
definitely made a difference when I did

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.970 
definitely made a difference when I did
the<00:03:16.690> twist<00:03:16.959> I<00:03:17.170> could<00:03:17.350> see<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.739> was

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
the twist I could see that it was

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.830 
the twist I could see that it was
moisturize<00:03:18.730> but<00:03:18.940> I<00:03:18.970> just<00:03:19.180> we<00:03:19.420> just<00:03:19.600> had<00:03:19.720> to

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
moisturize but I just we just had to

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.400 
moisturize but I just we just had to
wait<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.019> little<00:03:20.200> bit<00:03:20.410> for<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.830> absorb<00:03:21.190> um

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
wait a little bit for it to absorb um

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.460 
wait a little bit for it to absorb um
you<00:03:23.410> know<00:03:23.560> what<00:03:23.820> natural<00:03:24.820> here<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:26.200> task

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
you know what natural here the task

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.170 
you know what natural here the task
seems<00:03:26.920> daunting<00:03:27.190> when<00:03:27.700> you<00:03:27.820> look<00:03:27.970> at<00:03:28.090> the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
seems daunting when you look at the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.150 
seems daunting when you look at the
whole<00:03:28.330> head<00:03:28.600> because<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.709> know<00:03:29.769> her<00:03:30.040> as

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
whole head because I know her as

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.210 
whole head because I know her as
definitely<00:03:30.760> does<00:03:31.200> but<00:03:32.200> when<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.410> once<00:03:33.010> it's

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
definitely does but when it once it's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.240 
definitely does but when it once it's
separated<00:03:34.090> it's<00:03:34.360> it<00:03:34.690> totally<00:03:35.320> complies<00:03:36.220> with

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
separated it's it totally complies with

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.039 
separated it's it totally complies with
anything<00:03:37.030> you're<00:03:37.180> trying<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.600> do<00:03:37.720> with<00:03:37.900> it

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
anything you're trying to do with it

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.310 
anything you're trying to do with it
really<00:03:38.709> it's<00:03:39.700> not<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.030> difficult<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:41.049> just

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
really it's not that difficult to just

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.340 
really it's not that difficult to just
looks<00:03:41.590> daunting<00:03:41.860> because<00:03:42.190> it's<00:03:42.549> so<00:03:42.760> thick<00:03:43.350> and

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
looks daunting because it's so thick and

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.300 
looks daunting because it's so thick and
so<00:03:44.790> her<00:03:45.790> here<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:46.630> took<00:03:46.840> me<00:03:46.900> about<00:03:47.310> 20

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
so her here this took me about 20

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.890 
so her here this took me about 20
minutes<00:03:48.489> max<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.150> that<00:03:49.450> was<00:03:49.570> because<00:03:49.630> I<00:03:49.810> was

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
minutes max and that was because I was

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.350 
minutes max and that was because I was
messing<00:03:50.140> around<00:03:50.290> with<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.590> camera<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.880> this

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
messing around with the camera so this

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.080 
messing around with the camera so this
is<00:03:52.390> definitely<00:03:52.750> something<00:03:53.170> that<00:03:53.530> can<00:03:53.860> be<00:03:53.890> done

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
is definitely something that can be done

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.240 
is definitely something that can be done
you<00:03:55.090> know<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.239> just<00:03:55.480> had<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.870> step<00:03:56.230> back<00:03:56.500> look<00:03:57.040> at

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
you know I just had to step back look at

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.970 
you know I just had to step back look at
the<00:03:57.370> bigger<00:03:57.549> picture<00:03:58.260> separate<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.410> hair<00:03:59.739> and

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
the bigger picture separate the hair and

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.130 
the bigger picture separate the hair and
tackle<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.760> section<00:04:01.150> by<00:04:01.209> section<00:04:01.360> I<00:04:01.810> did<00:04:01.989> like

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
tackle it section by section I did like

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.420 
tackle it section by section I did like
about<00:04:02.170> probably<00:04:03.010> six<00:04:03.370> sections<00:04:05.070> so<00:04:06.070> with<00:04:06.280> the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
about probably six sections so with the

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.340 
about probably six sections so with the
weather<00:04:06.670> changing<00:04:07.299> we<00:04:07.480> have<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:07.810> change<00:04:08.049> our

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
weather changing we have to change our

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.520 
weather changing we have to change our
hair<00:04:08.709> care<00:04:08.980> regimen<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:10.630> ensure<00:04:10.930> maximum

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
hair care regimen to ensure maximum

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.509 
hair care regimen to ensure maximum
moisture<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.880> moisture<00:04:13.630> retention<00:04:14.519> so

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
moisture and moisture retention so

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.420 
moisture and moisture retention so
definitely<00:04:16.030> something<00:04:16.540> to<00:04:16.630> keep<00:04:16.780> in<00:04:17.019> mind

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
definitely something to keep in mind

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.300 
definitely something to keep in mind
