00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.430 

all<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:05.670> right<00:00:05.879> there

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.440 
all that right there

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.350 
all that right there
I'd<00:00:07.440> say<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> lot<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:08.040> photographers<00:00:08.790> spend

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
I'd say a lot of photographers spend

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.379 
I'd say a lot of photographers spend
their<00:00:10.019> entire<00:00:10.139> lives<00:00:10.889> trying<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.790> create<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
their entire lives trying to create the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.070 
their entire lives trying to create the
perfect<00:00:12.870> picture<00:00:13.110> there's<00:00:14.009> no<00:00:14.160> such<00:00:14.370> thing

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
perfect picture there's no such thing

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.300 
perfect picture there's no such thing
the<00:00:16.080> only<00:00:16.199> thing<00:00:16.500> that's<00:00:16.710> perfect<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the only thing that's perfect is the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.920 
the only thing that's perfect is the
moment<00:00:21.590> in<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.710> beginning<00:00:23.250> one<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
moment in the beginning one of the

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.200 
moment in the beginning one of the
reservations<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.050> had<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.619> digital<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
reservations I had with digital was the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.429 
reservations I had with digital was the
capture<00:00:27.449> mode<00:00:27.900> slow<00:00:28.890> as<00:00:29.039> molasses<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.939> delay

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
capture mode slow as molasses that delay

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.410 
capture mode slow as molasses that delay
they<00:00:31.439> fixed<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.579> size<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> files

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
they fixed that the size of the files

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.750 
they fixed that the size of the files
they<00:00:33.840> fixed<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.489> me<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
they fixed that and then for me the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.760 
they fixed that and then for me the
longest<00:00:36.120> period<00:00:36.300> stretch<00:00:36.719> now<00:00:37.050> has<00:00:37.469> been<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
longest period stretch now has been the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.740 
longest period stretch now has been the
software<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.850> post-production

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
software for post-production

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.410 
software for post-production
I<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:40.530> aperture<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> quantum<00:00:41.820> leap<00:00:42.059> in

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
I think aperture is a quantum leap in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.410 
I think aperture is a quantum leap in
the<00:00:43.260> direction<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:44.010> where<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.670> thought<00:00:45.210> we

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the direction of where we all thought we

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.389 
the direction of where we all thought we
could<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.620> initially<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> thought

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
could be you know initially I thought

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.190 
could be you know initially I thought
maybe<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> application<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.480> designed

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
maybe the application was designed

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.500 
maybe the application was designed
strictly<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:49.710> professional<00:00:49.890> photographers

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
strictly for professional photographers

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.389 
strictly for professional photographers
while<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> may<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:51.870> been<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.920> user

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
while it may have been it is user

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.790 
while it may have been it is user
friendly<00:00:53.730> enough<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> think<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.020> amateur

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
friendly enough that I think the amateur

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.650 
friendly enough that I think the amateur
is<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.340> love<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.910> program<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.600> what

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
is going to love this program and what

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.420 
is going to love this program and what
it<00:00:57.719> will<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.079> them<00:00:58.440> right<00:00:59.039> there<00:00:59.250> right

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
it will do for them right there right

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.529 
it will do for them right there right
there<00:00:59.609> right<00:00:59.640> there<00:00:59.910> on<00:00:59.940> them<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.480> that

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
there right there on them just like that

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.160 
there right there on them just like that
yes<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.920> can't<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.059> pure<00:01:03.329> photo<00:01:03.660> journalist

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
yes I can't be the pure photo journalist

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.450 
yes I can't be the pure photo journalist
that<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.350> lot<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.589> people<00:01:04.920> claim<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.430> are

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that a lot of people claim they are

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.140 
that a lot of people claim they are
that's<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.270> who<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.540> am<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.080> interact<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:07.979> my

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
that's not who I am I interact with my

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:16.340 
that's not who I am I interact with my
brides<00:01:09.150> my<00:01:09.600> grooms<00:01:09.930> using<00:01:10.920> both<00:01:11.100> hands<00:01:15.170> it's<00:01:16.170> a

people<00:01:21.000> trust<00:01:21.240> me<00:01:21.420> they<00:01:21.630> open<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.290> books

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
people trust me they open up like books

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.450 
people trust me they open up like books
to<00:01:22.770> me<00:01:23.060> when<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> used<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.600> show<00:01:25.020> my<00:01:25.560> proofs<00:01:26.159> was

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
to me when I used to show my proofs was

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.060 
to me when I used to show my proofs was
to<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.880> hand<00:01:27.090> him<00:01:27.240> off<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> client<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
to just hand him off to the client and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.440 
to just hand him off to the client and
they<00:01:29.189> would<00:01:29.340> take<00:01:29.490> him<00:01:29.700> home<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.180> bring<00:01:30.329> him

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
they would take him home and bring him

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.190 
they would take him home and bring him
back<00:01:30.479> later

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
back later

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.230 
back later
now<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> aperture<00:01:32.220> what<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.729> could<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.119> is

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
now with the aperture what I could do is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.200 
now with the aperture what I could do is
set<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> two<00:01:33.810> 30<00:01:34.110> inch<00:01:34.380> screens<00:01:34.909> set<00:01:35.909> a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
set up the two 30 inch screens set a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.410 
set up the two 30 inch screens set a
slideshow<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.799> music<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.790> they<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.030> sit<00:01:39.270> and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
slideshow to music and they can sit and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.300 
slideshow to music and they can sit and
relive<00:01:39.600> their<00:01:39.990> way

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.030 

that<00:01:44.060> I<00:01:44.090> love<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.990> way<00:01:45.110> I<00:01:45.140> used<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:45.560> deal<00:01:46.009> with

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
that I love the way I used to deal with

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.280 
that I love the way I used to deal with
the<00:01:46.399> proofs<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:46.970> lay<00:01:47.119> it<00:01:47.299> out<00:01:47.420> for<00:01:47.990> an<00:01:48.110> album

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
the proofs and lay it out for an album

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.499 
the proofs and lay it out for an album
or<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.710> design<00:01:49.100> is<00:01:49.700> that<00:01:49.880> what<00:01:50.000> laid<00:01:50.149> him<00:01:50.240> out<00:01:50.360> on

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
or a design is that what laid him out on

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.480 
or a design is that what laid him out on
a<00:01:50.540> coffee<00:01:50.840> table<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:51.829> would<00:01:51.979> look<00:01:52.100> at<00:01:52.310> them

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
a coffee table and I would look at them

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.950 
a coffee table and I would look at them
and<00:01:52.579> move<00:01:52.789> them<00:01:52.820> around<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.450> say<00:01:53.570> okay<00:01:53.810> maybe

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
and move them around and say okay maybe

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.950 
and move them around and say okay maybe
these<00:01:54.259> two<00:01:54.530> work<00:01:54.770> well<00:01:55.009> together<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:56.750> feature

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
these two work well together the feature

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.350 
these two work well together the feature
that<00:01:57.380> aperture<00:01:57.799> has<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.549> that<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:58.789> can<00:01:58.939> lay

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
that aperture has is that you can lay

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.320 
that aperture has is that you can lay
this<00:01:59.539> out<00:01:59.720> on<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.049> screen<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.830> do<00:02:01.670> exactly

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
this out on the screen and do exactly
