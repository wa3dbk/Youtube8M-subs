00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello to the viewers of my channel 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.790
 today, as always, I continue together 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.480
 with you to prepare your simple and useful 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.880
 recipes will cook today simple 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.810
 lunch and for lunch I will have stew 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.800
 cabbage with red rice as you understand 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.449
 most stewed cabbage is not particularly 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.150
 so I think rice makes our dish 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.310
 more nutritious I will say honestly red 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.800
 I never cooked rice 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.230
 tried not even know what he looked like 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.290
 I guess he's very useful. 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.870
 yes and you ask why I already which 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.870
 nothing liquid 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.399
 I will explain that the time has come 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.980
 body and we just have a husband with children 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:54.090
 overeat universities we buy every day 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:59.989
 Probably 7 6 kg watermelon 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:04.320
 it bought music so it was clearer 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.290
 25 cents per kilo bought greens 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.770
 bought peaches local peaches 9 hryvnia 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.110
 kilogram for some reason we have them dear I 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.900
 there were such peaches in transnistria 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.600
 4 rubles a kilo that is almost 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.320
 two and back to our today's 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.619
 dish and see what is useful red 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.140
 rice to be honest under my sign 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.439
 questions and as always help me 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.070
 internet and so in short we read this one 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.100
 of the most useful rice varieties so so 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.430
 so elevated antioxidants 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.200
 and dietary fiber makes it better 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.840
 The basis of a healthy diet is soft 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.119
 the shell of this rice is easily digested 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.020
 what allows not to grind grains of rice 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.710
 maximum saving 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.840
 vitamins and nutrients understandable 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.719
 Why so expensive 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.060
 the use of red rice is characterized 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.189
 high in dietary fiber then 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.030
 have fiber these fibers regulate 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:09.459
 work of the intestine improves microflora 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.879
 colon helps to eliminate 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.709
 cholesterol decrease even weight is about 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:19.599
 blood sugar normalizes us 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.340
 detoxification of the body as a whole in the fight 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.750
 overweight invaluable food with great 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.269
 the amount of fiber slower 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.700
 absorbed give a feeling of saturation on 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:35.650
 longer time contains 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.769
 antioxidants so so so too 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.540
 is a good source of vitamin b1 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:45.190
 and riboflavin b2 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:48.129
 fiber iron and calcium yes this is my 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.980

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.200
 will like it so need for 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.239
 today's dish is of course 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.049
 white cabbage 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:02.170
 I'll take two carrots I love when in 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.950
 stewed cabbage or rice a lot 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.549
 carrots 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.220
 further onion also take 2 onions 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:14.350
 his wife peeled sweet peaches 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:17.500
 2 tomatoes and one from red 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.410
 colors and also will add or but also in 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.579
 the very end of the finished dish to 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.489
 increase the beneficial properties of our lunch 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.109
 I will tell you now such a time that 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.230
 food manufacturers just 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:35.260
 understood that 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.650
 products are in demand now and it is 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.079
 therefore, prices are rising precisely on 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:46.299
 some organic products on the same 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:47.250
 red rice it stands like further even 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.980
 meat 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.500
 but this is not our topic and in general I think 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.690
 that since healthy eating should not 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.660
 save 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.570
 surviving its super new fashionable car is not 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.940
 you will fill the gasoline of poor quality 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:08.640
 also our body does not need it 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.950
 slagged unnecessary things sorry for 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.700
 compared but many mistresses are very 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.250
 care about the cleanliness of your toilet 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.320
 do not care about cleanliness 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.810
 your body so with cabbage a 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.210
 cracked down on to other vegetables 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.480
 imposed onions and carrots as you see not 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.780
 much mile chela I do not like when vegetables 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.360
 too finely chopped hall pepper 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.169
 Tomatoes do not even peel this time. 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.510
 peel i dont like if you want you 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.669
 can clear 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:46.230
 I love when in cabbage there is this 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:48.090
 sour tomato vegetables we cut 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.800
 now go to the stove 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:55.169
 I'll cook the dish in a roasting tin if 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.630
 You have Kazan Chk and you can in kazachki 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.910
 because the fact that vegetables tastes best 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.700
 Still, I primarily in Kazan for 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:08.960
 vegetable oil and fry carrots and 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:11.910
 onion is now a line of pepper and tomato 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.750
 registration immediately after them I add 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:20.070
 cabbage cabbage I pre-salted 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.190
 deeds and from as not my strength 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.000
 allowed 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:29.840
 stack nothing scary if you 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.730
 I get a full form like mine 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:38.880
 because our cabbage is very fast 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:42.090
 limp and here I add half a cup 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.300
 clean water and now ours to piece 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.330
 I cover with a lid literally for 20 minutes 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:52.770
 so she reduced the size gave us 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:56.060
 juice passed literally 15 minutes how are you 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:00.990
 see our cabbage has become much 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:03.300
 softer and less and she started to juice + 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.560
 about the water we added and 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.410
 do mean not such a hole and there 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:17.419
 I add 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:17.419
 I will cover a little cup of our rice 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:26.600
 make a little little fire and 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:29.490
 I cover with the lid until readiness I bring 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.160
 to be honest I won't add much 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:36.210
 maybe at the end I will add hops-suneli again 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:40.350
 do dinner with us children so food is not 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.600
 must be strongly spicy all covered 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:49.110
 cover do less fire and up 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:51.690
 readiness and so our them ready honestly 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.550
 I say it turned out very tasty in 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.030

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:59.550
