00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
you can see here there is some

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:32.910 
you can see here there is some
difference<00:01:24.340> let's<00:01:25.340> try<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:25.640> get<00:01:25.730> a<00:01:25.790> fitness

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
same as the D s but instead it there now

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.770 
same as the D s but instead it there now
a<00:02:32.170> whitish<00:02:32.950> gray<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.670> they<00:02:33.970> have<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.480> little

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
a whitish gray and they have a little

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.449 
a whitish gray and they have a little
bit<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.140> right<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:35.799> little<00:02:36.220> bit<00:02:36.430> here

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
bit to the right this little bit here

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.550 
bit to the right this little bit here
which<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.599> purely<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.079> stop<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.500> from

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
which is purely to stop you from

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.009 
which is purely to stop you from
inserting<00:02:39.069> them<00:02:39.160> into<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.400> deer's<00:02:39.840> no<00:02:40.840> no<00:02:40.900> I

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
inserting them into a deer's no no I

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.449 
inserting them into a deer's no no I
would<00:02:41.230> actually<00:02:41.470> do<00:02:41.590> anything<00:02:41.799> to<00:02:42.040> your<00:02:42.129> DNS

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
would actually do anything to your DNS

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.860 
would actually do anything to your DNS
but<00:02:43.290> yeah<00:02:44.290> things<00:02:44.560> just<00:02:44.769> more<00:02:44.950> obvious<00:02:45.660> in<00:02:46.660> ten

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
but yeah things just more obvious in ten

00:02:46.870 --> 00:03:33.750 
but yeah things just more obvious in ten
dogs<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.980> then<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.280> also<00:02:54.459> got<00:03:30.900> some<00:03:31.900> people<00:03:32.760> be

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
dogs and then I also got some people be

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.229 
dogs and then I also got some people be
damaged<00:03:34.150> easily<00:03:34.620> more<00:03:35.620> easy<00:03:35.799> anyway<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:37.180> she

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
damaged easily more easy anyway so she

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.860 
damaged easily more easy anyway so she

unboxing<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.550> up<00:04:14.640> which<00:04:14.760> would<00:04:14.880> be<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.000> little

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
unboxing it up which would be a little

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.349 
unboxing it up which would be a little
bit<00:04:15.300> more<00:04:15.480> interesting<00:04:15.900> by<00:04:16.200> forward<00:04:17.120> she<00:04:18.120> just

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
bit more interesting by forward she just

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.680 
bit more interesting by forward she just
do<00:04:18.480> this<00:04:18.600> for<00:04:18.750> now<00:04:18.930> just<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:20.329> use<00:04:21.329> some<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.600> my

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
do this for now just to use some of my

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.830 
do this for now just to use some of my
spare<00:04:22.019> time<00:04:22.280> okay<00:04:23.280> so<00:04:23.340> hopefully<00:04:23.910> they'll<00:04:24.810> be

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
spare time okay so hopefully they'll be
