 restructured mind absolute novelty and it is 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.120
 it was also divided in a way 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.860
 depending on the needs of the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.090
 hosts 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.699

 dynamic leg professional duties 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.769
 so it was absolutely beautiful 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.930
 report you used particular materials 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.190
 and had one we tried to 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.310
 let's say more importance has precisely 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.040
 the floors and the materials chosen a somewhat 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.649
 quality dress then the fabrics 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:24.500
 materials the bill was taken care of in 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.250
 minimum details and we have chosen a 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.080
 French oak parquet flooring 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.330
 oil treated and all this 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.250
 eh yes a in the exterior exterior that 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.970
 inside the apartment 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.240
 to not give any kind of detachment from the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.490
 outdoor 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.170
 inside then we'll see which ones to make us 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.610
 gentlemen are sensational crazy 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.320
 practically villa torlonia there 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.350
 We drink into the house completely 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.090
 the casino of the owls we can these 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.810
 c call them farms renewal are the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.310
 American anpas of fo that yes 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.250
 they found in the times like 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.040
 protectors we say and here we have them 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.120
 used to protect the house are 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.120
 of a good omen 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.790
 beautiful these couch every type this is 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.160
 a choice was made to be able to 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.680
 enjoy adding from this lady 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.510
 central you put all of you 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.269
 together in the evening to see the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.549
 nice television so with purple cause 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.099
 Exactly here I continue precisely the path 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.519
 of the living area we have as ever 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.780
 created two different and a little bit is 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:43.080
 it was this central body that it is 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.140
 stable and therefore was we say important 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.769
 it was the center of the whole 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.420
 representation eventually became 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.450
 light you almost lose it just for 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.090
 this talk of mirrors by reflex 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.280
 all in all they cancel this effect 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.230
 the heavy of is beautiful seemed to seem 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.099
 many beautiful with so much to return the truth 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.099
 deforming 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.240
 but here we have a dining table for 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.970
 external so we can practically 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.040
 do any this is let's say the area 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.450
 where they can eat barbecue 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.370
 peperino yes 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.220
 these lamps these suspensions are 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.660
 in fiberglass they are from outside the light is 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.200
 very nice in the evening because the music 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.550
 another therefore is not a light that this is 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.319
 the only part of the terrace area that is 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.269
 covered that recco patients 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.110
 deleted that the carmina was chosen 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.269
 the little dog so we say precisely for 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.770
 warm up this environment 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.870
 often in 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.450
 Roman terraces these there announces it 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.830
 Also to try to give a bit of 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.310
 warm and cool senses in summer 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:04:00.460
 there is a sort of shading that gives you 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.460
 now we need it now no
