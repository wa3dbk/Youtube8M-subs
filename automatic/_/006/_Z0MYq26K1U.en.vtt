over<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.159> not<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.970> it's

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
over it so it's not like it's just it's

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.480 
over it so it's not like it's just it's
going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.600> glued<00:01:54.899> not<00:01:55.619> only<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
going to be glued not only with the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.789 
going to be glued not only with the
cloth<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:57.000> here<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.810> also<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.259> really<00:01:58.500> heavy

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
cloth on here but also this really heavy

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.469 
cloth on here but also this really heavy
tape<00:01:59.159> which<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.700> like<00:02:00.030> hundred-mile-an-hour

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
tape which is like hundred-mile-an-hour

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.440 
tape which is like hundred-mile-an-hour
erasers<00:02:01.229> tape<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.729> this<00:02:02.729> will<00:02:02.939> hold<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
erasers tape and this will hold it and

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.510 
erasers tape and this will hold it and
will<00:02:03.570> never<00:02:03.719> come<00:02:03.930> apart<00:02:04.049> again<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.770> you

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
will never come apart again and you

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.479 
will never come apart again and you
notice<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> headliner<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.509> actually<00:02:07.020> just

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
notice the headliner is actually just

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:09.859 
notice the headliner is actually just
this<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.879> filk<00:02:09.179> roll<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.720> it's

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
this is just a filk roll that it's

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.190 
this is just a filk roll that it's
attached<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.700> it's<00:02:11.700> probably

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
attached to it's probably

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.380 
attached to it's probably
so<00:02:13.530> din<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.890> couple<00:02:14.190> spots<00:02:14.490> it's<00:02:14.849> got<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> bolt

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
so din a couple spots it's got a bolt

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.240 
so din a couple spots it's got a bolt
it's<00:02:15.720> not<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.930> big<00:02:16.170> deal<00:02:16.410> actually<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.860> take<00:02:17.069> out

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it's not a big deal actually to take out

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.790 
it's not a big deal actually to take out
this<00:02:17.400> top<00:02:17.730> it's<00:02:18.630> not<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.989> difficult<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.620> do

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
this top it's not that difficult to do

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.650 
this top it's not that difficult to do
takes<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.310> all<00:02:20.430> day<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.270> why<00:02:21.390> we<00:02:21.540> want

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
takes you all day but it's why we want

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.630 
takes you all day but it's why we want
to<00:02:21.720> do<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.050> rather<00:02:22.620> fix<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.160> because<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:23.520> too

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
to do it rather fix it because it's too

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.970 
to do it rather fix it because it's too
much<00:02:23.670> labor<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.360> do<00:02:24.870> everything<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.380> my<00:02:25.410> own<00:02:25.530> so

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
much labor I do everything on my own so

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.920 
much labor I do everything on my own so
anyway<00:02:26.940> I'll<00:02:27.780> be<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.140> just<00:02:29.600> scratched<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.840> up

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
anyway I'll be I just scratched it up

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.250 
anyway I'll be I just scratched it up
with<00:02:31.140> some<00:02:31.380> emery<00:02:31.739> paper<00:02:31.770> here<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:33.260> you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
with some emery paper here and you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.140 
with some emery paper here and you
starting<00:02:34.739> fluid<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.130> was<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.370> starting<00:02:35.819> fluid

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
starting fluid I was you starting fluid

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.030 
starting fluid I was you starting fluid
to<00:02:36.270> clean<00:02:36.780> stuff<00:02:37.050> off<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.709> works<00:02:37.860> pretty

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
to clean stuff off and it works pretty

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.210 
to clean stuff off and it works pretty
well<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:39.470> I'm<00:02:40.470> going<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.680> scratch<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.130> with

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
well and I'm going to scratch it with

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.920 
well and I'm going to scratch it with
the<00:02:41.310> screwdriver<00:02:41.610> well<00:02:42.030> actually<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.300> knife<00:02:42.569> a

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the screwdriver well actually a knife a

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.290 
the screwdriver well actually a knife a
knife<00:02:43.440> should<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.459> pretty<00:02:44.640> good<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.180> get

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
knife should do it pretty good to get

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.380 
knife should do it pretty good to get
some<00:02:45.510> scratch<00:02:45.840> marks<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.470> glass<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.700> because

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
some scratch marks in a glass so because

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.190 
some scratch marks in a glass so because
it's<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.290> glue<00:02:49.590> sticks<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.239> side<00:02:51.900> real

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
it's the glue sticks to this side real

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.949 
it's the glue sticks to this side real
good<00:02:52.470> where<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.670> cloth<00:02:54.120> oh<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.840> only

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
good where it's the cloth oh it only

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.140 
good where it's the cloth oh it only
sticks<00:02:55.350> there<00:02:55.590> real<00:02:55.769> good<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.640> problem<00:02:56.880> is

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
sticks there real good the problem is

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.600 
sticks there real good the problem is
the<00:02:57.269> glass<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.160> notice<00:02:59.160> where<00:02:59.489> it's

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
the glass and you notice where it's

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.729 
the glass and you notice where it's
stuck<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.180> four<00:03:00.690> years<00:03:00.930> ago<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.410> was<00:03:01.560> out

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
stuck it on four years ago that was out

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.130 
stuck it on four years ago that was out
in<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.890> weather<00:03:02.120> it's<00:03:03.120> never<00:03:03.360> came<00:03:03.600> apart<00:03:03.900> and

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
in the weather it's never came apart and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.949 
in the weather it's never came apart and
never<00:03:04.470> came<00:03:04.680> apart<00:03:04.980> for<00:03:05.310> years<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:05.819> once<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.900> do

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
never came apart for years so once I do

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.479 
never came apart for years so once I do
this<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.440> will<00:03:07.650> be<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.190> so

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
this this will be on here so

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.370 
this this will be on here so
how<00:03:08.819> long<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.390> top<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.840> last<00:03:10.049> I'll<00:03:10.200> probably

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
how long the top and last I'll probably

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.440 
how long the top and last I'll probably
changing<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.010> but<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.910> always<00:03:12.180> have<00:03:12.299> this

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
changing it but I always have this

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.090 
changing it but I always have this
superstition<00:03:13.140> every<00:03:13.319> time<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.650> change<00:03:13.920> and

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
superstition every time you change and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.520 
superstition every time you change and
put<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> new<00:03:14.370> top<00:03:14.640> on<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.810> we<00:03:15.900> sticks<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.319> knife<00:03:16.470> in

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
put a new top on so we sticks a knife in

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.099 
put a new top on so we sticks a knife in
it<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.489> ain't<00:03:17.820> too<00:03:18.090> keen<00:03:18.390> on<00:03:18.510> changing<00:03:18.989> I'd

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
it so I ain't too keen on changing I'd

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.140 
it so I ain't too keen on changing I'd
rather<00:03:19.320> have<00:03:19.980> somebody<00:03:20.160> stick<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.549> knife<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:21.030> an

I'm<00:03:37.380> going<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.560> cut<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:38.070> tape<00:03:38.340> after<00:03:39.030> this<00:03:39.450> is

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
I'm going to cut the tape after this is

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.599 
I'm going to cut the tape after this is
dry<00:03:39.900> because<00:03:40.709> this<00:03:40.859> way<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.160> tape<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.579> going

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
dry because this way the tape is going

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.880 
dry because this way the tape is going
to<00:03:41.790> hold<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.180> very<00:03:42.390> tight<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.109> glass<00:03:43.410> on

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
to hold it very tight to the glass on

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.840 
to hold it very tight to the glass on
both<00:03:44.400> sides<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.630> I'm<00:03:45.840> going<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:45.989> cut<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.320> tape

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
both sides and I'm going to cut the tape

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.340 
both sides and I'm going to cut the tape
about<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:48.180> half<00:03:48.540> inch<00:03:48.780> from<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.079> end<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
about a half inch from the end of the

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.490 
about a half inch from the end of the
glass<00:03:49.880> this<00:03:50.880> this<00:03:51.450> way<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:52.019> gives<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.380> little

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
glass this this way it gives it a little

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.370 
glass this this way it gives it a little
more<00:03:52.620> support<00:03:53.250> because<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.940> top<00:03:54.239> has<00:03:54.570> shrunk

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
more support because this top has shrunk

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.650 
more support because this top has shrunk
a<00:03:55.530> little<00:03:55.769> bit<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.790> puts<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.090> lot<00:03:57.239> of<00:03:57.269> strain

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
a little bit and it puts a lot of strain

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.380 
a little bit and it puts a lot of strain
on<00:03:57.720> his<00:03:58.019> joint<00:03:58.440> so<00:03:58.829> it's<00:03:59.609> going<00:03:59.819> to<00:03:59.910> have<00:04:00.150> an

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
on his joint so it's going to have an

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.870 
on his joint so it's going to have an
extra<00:04:00.750> piece<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:00.989> tape<00:04:01.410> here<00:04:01.440> that's<00:04:02.430> glued

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
extra piece of tape here that's glued

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.490 
extra piece of tape here that's glued
with<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.120> gorilla<00:04:03.390> glue<00:04:03.720> all<00:04:03.959> just<00:04:04.140> got<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.380> do

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
with a gorilla glue all just got to do

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.670 
with a gorilla glue all just got to do
is<00:04:05.040> take<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.609> small<00:04:06.359> sliver<00:04:07.019> off<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.410> here<00:04:07.560> with

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
is take a small sliver off of here with

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.520 
is take a small sliver off of here with
a<00:04:07.709> razor<00:04:07.980> blade<00:04:08.359> when<00:04:09.359> it's<00:04:09.510> done<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:10.019> get<00:04:10.410> the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
a razor blade when it's done and get the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.099 
a razor blade when it's done and get the
opposite<00:04:10.980> side<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.639> there<00:04:12.150> cut<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.900> small

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
opposite side on there cut a small

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.840 
opposite side on there cut a small
sliver<00:04:13.590> spread<00:04:13.920> is<00:04:14.040> going<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.220> be<00:04:14.310> sandwiched

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
sliver spread is going to be sandwiched

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.129 
sliver spread is going to be sandwiched
besides<00:04:15.810> being<00:04:16.320> glued<00:04:16.970> with<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.600> cloth<00:04:18.810> top

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
besides being glued with the cloth top

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.250 
besides being glued with the cloth top
to<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.530> glass<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.280> it<00:04:20.430> does<00:04:20.609> last<00:04:21.080> it's<00:04:22.080> going

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
to the glass and it does last it's going

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.960 
to the glass and it does last it's going
to<00:04:22.320> be<00:04:22.440> sandwiched<00:04:22.860> between<00:04:23.070> two<00:04:23.760> of<00:04:23.880> these

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
to be sandwiched between two of these

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.420 
to be sandwiched between two of these
tapes<00:04:24.360> which<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.229> very<00:04:25.440> heavy<00:04:25.710> tape<00:04:26.039> it's<00:04:26.250> not

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
tapes which is very heavy tape it's not

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.990 
tapes which is very heavy tape it's not
a<00:04:26.460> no

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
a no

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.230 
a no
area<00:04:28.700> tight<00:04:29.700> it's<00:04:29.910> it's<00:04:30.180> a

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
area tight it's it's a

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.790 
area tight it's it's a
hundred-mile-an-hour<00:04:30.630> racer<00:04:31.260> tape<00:04:31.530> actually

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
hundred-mile-an-hour racer tape actually

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.800 
hundred-mile-an-hour racer tape actually
that's<00:04:32.160> what<00:04:32.280> they<00:04:32.400> call<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.790> but<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.660> going

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
that's what they call it but it's going

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.480 
that's what they call it but it's going
to<00:04:33.930> have<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.140> gorilla<00:04:34.440> glue<00:04:34.800> underneath<00:04:35.280> it

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
to have the gorilla glue underneath it

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.750 
to have the gorilla glue underneath it
too<00:04:35.730> on<00:04:36.270> both<00:04:36.750> sides<00:04:37.110> but<00:04:37.950> it's<00:04:38.220> got<00:04:38.460> a<00:04:38.490> little

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
too on both sides but it's got a little

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.520 
too on both sides but it's got a little
extra<00:04:39.180> tape<00:04:39.420> on<00:04:39.660> it<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:39.930> also<00:04:40.050> got<00:04:40.230> to<00:04:40.320> do<00:04:40.410> is

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
extra tape on it so I also got to do is

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.440 
extra tape on it so I also got to do is
cut<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.770> little<00:04:41.010> sliver<00:04:41.310> off<00:04:41.550> of<00:04:41.790> this<00:04:41.910> after<00:04:42.330> it

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
cut a little sliver off of this after it

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.710 
cut a little sliver off of this after it
dries<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:42.990> that'll<00:04:43.260> be<00:04:43.350> it

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
dries and that'll be it

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.300 
dries and that'll be it
again<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.870> can<00:04:45.990> see<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.410> tape<00:04:46.860> that's<00:04:47.100> up

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
again you can see the tape that's up

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.070 
again you can see the tape that's up
here<00:04:47.550> so<00:04:47.880> I'm<00:04:48.120> actually<00:04:48.330> going<00:04:48.540> to<00:04:48.600> cut<00:04:48.870> this

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
here so I'm actually going to cut this

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.920 
here so I'm actually going to cut this
with<00:04:50.040> a<00:04:50.100> knife<00:04:50.340> after<00:04:51.090> all<00:04:51.210> this<00:04:51.330> glue<00:04:51.630> dries

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
with a knife after all this glue dries

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.330 
with a knife after all this glue dries
just<00:04:52.230> like<00:04:52.350> sandwiched<00:04:52.800> between<00:04:52.920> two<00:04:53.310> pieces

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
just like sandwiched between two pieces

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.330 
just like sandwiched between two pieces
of<00:04:53.700> tape<00:04:53.940> because<00:04:54.410> this<00:04:55.410> top<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.920> shrunk<00:04:56.190> a

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
of tape because this top is shrunk a

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.700 
of tape because this top is shrunk a
little<00:04:56.370> bit<00:04:56.730> and<00:04:59.600> but<00:05:00.600> you<00:05:00.780> know<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:01.260> bottom

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
little bit and but you know the bottom

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.070 
little bit and but you know the bottom
the<00:05:02.160> bottom<00:05:02.370> held<00:05:02.760> has<00:05:03.030> held<00:05:03.270> for<00:05:03.540> four<00:05:03.810> years

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
the bottom held has held for four years

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.600 
the bottom held has held for four years
I'm<00:05:04.290> sure<00:05:04.500> it<00:05:04.620> is<00:05:04.710> tops<00:05:04.980> going<00:05:05.220> to<00:05:05.310> hold<00:05:05.490> this

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
I'm sure it is tops going to hold this

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.490 
I'm sure it is tops going to hold this
for<00:05:05.880> as<00:05:06.120> long<00:05:06.270> as<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.510> top<00:05:06.720> lasts

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
for as long as the top lasts

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.250 
for as long as the top lasts
now<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:07.950> other<00:05:08.280> thing<00:05:08.580> is<00:05:08.780> make<00:05:09.780> sure<00:05:09.810> in<00:05:10.200> the

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
now the other thing is make sure in the

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.170 
now the other thing is make sure in the
front<00:05:10.560> and<00:05:10.710> keep<00:05:10.890> some<00:05:11.160> tension<00:05:11.370> off<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:11.940> top

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
front and keep some tension off the top

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.960 
front and keep some tension off the top
so<00:05:12.390> you<00:05:12.480> can<00:05:12.630> see<00:05:12.810> I<00:05:13.050> got<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:13.980> latches<00:05:14.430> open<00:05:14.790> in

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
so you can see I got the latches open in

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.690 
so you can see I got the latches open in
here<00:05:15.530> you<00:05:16.530> don't<00:05:16.680> want<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:16.950> put<00:05:17.100> tension<00:05:17.340> on<00:05:17.640> it

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
here you don't want to put tension on it

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.520 
here you don't want to put tension on it
you<00:05:18.060> got<00:05:18.150> to<00:05:18.300> give<00:05:18.390> this<00:05:18.510> stuff<00:05:18.720> about<00:05:19.020> 24

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
you got to give this stuff about 24

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.280 
you got to give this stuff about 24
hours<00:05:19.680> of<00:05:19.919> dry<00:05:20.130> but<00:05:20.970> it<00:05:21.060> does<00:05:21.270> last<00:05:21.600> it<00:05:22.050> does

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
hours of dry but it does last it does
