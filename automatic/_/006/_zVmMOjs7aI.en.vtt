00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.759
 Today there is a specialist video and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.700
 Although to my pc I have everything in it 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.070
 have what i have installed why i what 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.080
 have taken and so what i like as well 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.480
 think bad and it is for me 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.720
 very special pc this is the first pc 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.460
 has installed with a water cooling 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.920
 as a housing I have the cool master 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.320
 storm strider a beautiful housing 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.480
 I have the whole in white but also 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.090
 available in black the difference 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.010
 The storm stryker had windows around 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.379
 at the storm trooper the black box 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.989
 you have to do the fifth in addition 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.070
 order at the housing one has standard 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.690
 Connections two usb 2.0 usb 3.0 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.660
 Microphone input microphone output and a 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.070
 on off switch as well as 1 1 on button here 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.140
 a bit crazy but that was 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.399
 his guilt was such a narrow one 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.620
 stairs and I have 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.280
 slept where i am at the gamescom in 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.660
 Cologne was 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.820
 here you can see now the time to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.920
 turn off something exactly and if you are 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.600
 already looks down are three buttons 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.159
 the first special thing about the housing 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.619
 on the one hand is the fan control that 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.810
 is the plus and minus and you can do that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.500
 Light the fan in the housing on and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.060
 turn off 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.150
 By default, the housing has two 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.560
 Fans are lit at the front 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.000
 we have the next special feature the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.439
 I really liked it too 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.450
 my purchase decision has contributed 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.220
 namely the possibility ssd cards 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.869
 just to stick one 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.009
 take out and then go somewhere 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.880
 and connect there 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.970
 through this ssd-hard drive slot 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.650
 the front of the fan control re 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.380
 one of the best fan control i have 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.500
 I ever had a case masters office 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.329
 from skype and the special of 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.460
 fan control i can handle the six 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.259
 measure temperatures over the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.790
 temperature sensors that are there I can 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.320
 set six fans and thus 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.689
 all the fans with the tax 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.250
 water cooling and there are 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.810
 me an alarm sound when a fan 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.759
 stops and I have the case 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.619
 my water cooling the pump with at the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.079
 fan control connected thereby 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.659
 a beep war if you stand 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.490
 should stay 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.729
 then both companies do a lot 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.200
 normal card reader nothing special 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.810
 the only special thing is that 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.120
 that's why a ssd is hidden since i have the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.370
 permanently needed in the 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.379
 plug in and at night, this can 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.239
 synonymous right in screw because 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.160
 that's why his second one goes with a water tank 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.900
 and in blu ray burner blu-ray burner 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.239
 stop by lg nix special 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.430
 the water container it has many of these 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.709
 reserve I do not like you I am full 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.250
 It is easy to fill on it looks 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.989
 good 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.790
 well my water has no consequences though 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.950
 Still, she has to water that herself 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.379
 moved it must under water cooling 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.049
 not super in the unhealthy next 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.209
 Take along is, so to speak, installation of the lifts 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.110
 whom you see is not really so 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.099
 participate in but I have installed so 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.379
 just the hard drive a bit 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.760
 get more air and brand homemade 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.190
 is really in the case brand 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.930
 homemade because I have here in the recipe 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.420
 from the attitude of the hard disks 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.310
 just such a small piece of metal roos 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.680
 born and then put in a ventilator and 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.569
 on the other side two small pieces 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.000
 the hose out of the water cooling 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.380
 put something against it pushes the bottom 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.079
 the small subject is actually there for it 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.430
 to put in your toolbox with yours 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.139
 whole screws and holders 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.780
 I could not do it in that case 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.609
 because there is a radiator in there 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.950
 That's why this blind is just 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.790
 nothing at all looks like that then 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.739
 marseille 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.870
 Lighting was very important to me 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.450
 that i have the components of each other 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.530
 disconnect that is completely blue came for 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.569
 not in question 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.540
 and here at the gc already wise fan 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.519
 are I have a basic color white 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.299
 that means the interior lighting is through 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.849
 the fans are white illuminated 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.690
 slightly white so it gives it 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.430
 thoroughly and the hoses of the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.230
 water cooling which are blue 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.120
 what then has the water cooling bit 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.419
 highlights and then of course the 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.910
 Logo of the graphics card geforce gtx 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.250
 in green which stands out very well and 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.819
 really looks very good as a networker 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.799
 I installed a 6 860 from Corsair 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.780
 First of all , several reasons remain 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.250
 Certificate because it is important 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.129
 that the components are installed 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.049
 are also efficient and it is modular 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.180
 which just makes sure that 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.090
 needless to install unnecessary cables and 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.789
 So cable salad prevents and more space 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.160
 for other cables has the whole cable 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.720
 can organize better on the right 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.169
 side one would then have the first radiator 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.830
 in 240 mm radiator with two 120 mm 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.690
 I fan radio 4.5 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.550
 centimeter is high because there was unfortunately 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.979
 just cool from aqua 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.840
 Unfortunately, radiator is just as good 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.639
 like alpha cool and that's why I have 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.550
 two radiators of two different ones 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.610
 Manufacturer in the housing with two radiators 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.360
 to 1 240 mm radially around with two 120 mm 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.820
 fans 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.850
 this was alpha cool only 13 meters 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.560
 Thick radiator would be different kings loading 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.960
 He with the fans on scoreboard 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.430
 get there always soundcard course 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.009
 also an external installed and that the 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.990
 creative sound blaster z with special 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.490
 not just that I'm the red one 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.440
 I've disconnected the LEDs 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.910
 Actually , though, I'm looking at something 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.400
 but been pretty inappropriate here 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.900
 yes, the processor would be here 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:21.530
 overclocked the easy 3770 to 4.7 gg 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.870
 originally cooled the water 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.330
 Graphics card and processor water cooled 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.650
 but since I have the new video card 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.780
 I left that away because I suddenly 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.150
 wanted to wait whether the leak because 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.759
 special feature here is that the fan 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.069
 on the back of the housing is turned over 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.620
 he can not stay outside 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.990
 So he blows out of the processor 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.610
 brings in air was I have to yes from 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.639
 Processes do not blow air away 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.160
 so now bring in clean for the 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.180
 radiators and for the graphics card and 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.220
 if we already have a graphics card 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.470
 are there right here in the 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.970
 always share a geforce gtx from 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.199
 Emediate lures absolute splendor 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.449
 Brutal this graphics card what you 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.970
 accomplish and I desperately wanted in 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.500
 reference design have because of the green 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.819
 Lettering because we do not have to go sometime 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.259
 water cool block then I want too 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:10.690
 have the lettering and the fan 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.340
 works perfectly 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.660
 which are now the maintenance costs 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.730
 for the hard disks here always the 2 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.680
 three terabyte hard drives from the right 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.310
 cooled to the left the ssd is stuck 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.960
 in it 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.550
 theoretically one could here six 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.710
 mooring disks here we see 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.360
 now the water pump this whole 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.340
 supplied with water and it was so through 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.530
 In addition, the flow gives rise to a precursor 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.570
 and here is the hidden ssd disk 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.370
 and i have to say the water pumps like that 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.170
 pretty much the loud star in the system 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.600
 they would have been humming so easily 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.650
 really look that the pump from 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.770
 Housing decoupled 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.930
 that 's it for my system no 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.400
 to say is 16 gigabytes at the moment 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.710
 Memory in it actually pay 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.900
 30 but I mean second margins 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.680
 computer on since stuck now currently 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.770
 in it 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.750
 I do not know if I still 32 gb 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.190
 but I'll think for sure 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.250
 am i getting somewhere konrad i'll get 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.390
 me with 2 8 gb otherwise I can only 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.890
 say you had thumbs thumb 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:10.210
 up if not thumb down 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:12.070
 and that was it so far with my pc 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:16.440
 if there are updates i will do a video 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.440
 to make and still enjoy the senses
