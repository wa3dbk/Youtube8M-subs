which you can resize it this is

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.319 
which you can resize it this is
something<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.770> couldn't<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.610> custom<00:02:03.090> roms

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
something you couldn't do on custom roms

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
you can actually resize the window so

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.010 
you can actually resize the window so
you<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.939> width<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.420> ninety-five

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
you can see the width is ninety-five

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.990 
you can see the width is ninety-five
percent<00:02:07.229> will<00:02:07.649> pull<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:07.920> down<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.310> around<00:02:08.399> 60

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
percent will pull this down to around 60

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.260 
percent will pull this down to around 60
if<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.840> then<00:02:10.020> activate<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.830> window<00:02:11.270> you'll

pretty cool that you can you can

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.030 
pretty cool that you can you can
customize<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.230> will<00:02:16.380> leave<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.560> back<00:02:16.890> at

turn this on you can actually resize the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.610 
turn this on you can actually resize the
window<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.360> fly<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:33.960> a<00:02:34.050> little<00:02:34.290> bit<00:02:34.440> kind

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
window on the fly it's a little bit kind

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.500 
window on the fly it's a little bit kind
of<00:02:34.830> weird<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.220> get<00:02:35.460> used<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.090> does<00:02:36.270> work

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
of weird to get used to but it does work

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.510 
of weird to get used to but it does work
you<00:02:36.720> can<00:02:36.840> see<00:02:37.050> once<00:02:37.740> that's<00:02:37.980> turned<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.400> you

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
you can see once that's turned on you

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.280 
you can see once that's turned on you
can<00:02:38.610> actually<00:02:38.730> move<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.210> around<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.840> if<00:02:40.200> you

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
can actually move this around and if you

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.390 
can actually move this around and if you
tap<00:02:40.530> these<00:02:40.800> sides<00:02:41.840> it's<00:02:42.840> kind<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.890> tricky<00:02:44.160> to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
tap these sides it's kind of tricky to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.330 
tap these sides it's kind of tricky to
do<00:02:44.550> but<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.320> there<00:02:46.320> we<00:02:46.410> go<00:02:46.530> resize<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.310> and

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
do but you can there we go resize it and

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.980 
do but you can there we go resize it and
you<00:02:47.460> can<00:02:47.610> see<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.820> can<00:02:47.940> get<00:02:48.090> kind<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.390> half<00:02:48.780> the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
you can see you can get kind of half the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.600 
you can see you can get kind of half the
screen<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.350> can<00:02:49.440> use<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.710> other<00:02:49.830> half<00:02:50.100> for

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
screen you can use the other half for

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.890 
screen you can use the other half for
something<00:02:50.970> else<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.540> pretty<00:02:51.780> cool

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
something else so that is pretty cool

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.980 
something else so that is pretty cool
there<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.760> yeah<00:02:53.760> now<00:02:54.209> what<00:02:54.630> you're<00:02:54.780> probably

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990

wondering<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.680> where's<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.250> little<00:02:56.400> bubble

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
wondering is where's the little bubble

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.280 
wondering is where's the little bubble
and<00:02:56.970> how<00:02:57.120> do<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.360> get<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.660> because<00:02:57.840> that's<00:02:57.930> one

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
and how do you get it because that's one

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.230 
and how do you get it because that's one
of<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.440> main<00:02:58.620> things<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:59.070> halo<00:02:59.400> now<00:02:59.940> what

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
of the main things to halo now what

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.940 
of the main things to halo now what
you'll<00:03:00.390> need<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.110> application<00:03:01.260> called

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
you'll need is the application called

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.890 
you'll need is the application called
floating<00:03:02.280> notifications<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.390> works<00:03:03.630> in

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
floating notifications and it works in

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.380 
floating notifications and it works in
conjunction<00:03:04.230> with<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.640> module<00:03:06.060> we<00:03:06.180> just

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
conjunction with that module we just

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.060

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
pretty much anything you could with the

pretty much anything you could with the
normal<00:04:25.050> gallery<00:04:25.350> app<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.830> then<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.280> can<00:04:26.430> go

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
back to twitter so i thought i'd just

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.450 
back to twitter so i thought i'd just
test<00:04:28.290> this<00:04:28.380> out<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.710> game<00:04:28.890> to<00:04:29.040> see<00:04:29.220> if<00:04:29.250> the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
test this out and a game to see if the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.220 
test this out and a game to see if the
application<00:04:30.180> in<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.419> background<00:04:30.870> actually

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230
