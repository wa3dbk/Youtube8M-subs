if<00:00:15.949> you<00:00:16.100> don't<00:00:16.219> got<00:00:16.339> a<00:00:16.369> puller<00:00:16.550> I<00:00:16.759> was<00:00:16.910> going<00:00:17.029> to

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
show you guys a short way to buy take it

show you guys a short way to buy take it
up<00:00:19.550> this<00:00:20.419> rod<00:00:20.720> right<00:00:20.900> here<00:00:21.140> you're<00:00:21.619> going<00:00:21.740> to

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
up this rod right here you're going to

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.409 
up this rod right here you're going to
bend<00:00:21.949> it<00:00:22.130> if<00:00:22.460> you<00:00:22.640> want<00:00:22.759> to<00:00:22.849> take<00:00:22.939> it<00:00:23.060> off<00:00:23.179> but

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
bend it if you want to take it off but

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:24.939 
bend it if you want to take it off but
realistically<00:00:24.169> you<00:00:24.320> can't<00:00:24.560> take<00:00:24.740> it<00:00:24.830> off

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
unless you get fly off so I just bent it

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.229 
unless you get fly off so I just bent it
just<00:00:29.990> a<00:00:30.079> little<00:00:30.289> bit<00:00:30.439> okay<00:00:31.099> it's<00:00:31.220> got<00:00:31.369> a<00:00:31.579> pry

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
just a little bit okay it's got a pry

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.549 
just a little bit okay it's got a pry
bar<00:00:32.530> sitting<00:00:33.530> right<00:00:33.649> here<00:00:33.680> underneath<00:00:33.980> and
