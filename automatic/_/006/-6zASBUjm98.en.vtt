super rock-solid of throwing them in

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.900 
super rock-solid of throwing them in
places<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.100> shouldn't<00:03:29.340> have<00:03:29.520> done<00:03:29.700> really

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
places I shouldn't have done really

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.510 
places I shouldn't have done really
dropped<00:03:30.300> them<00:03:30.560> crawled<00:03:31.560> in<00:03:31.770> them<00:03:31.950> dented<00:03:32.340> them

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
dropped them crawled in them dented them

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.940 
dropped them crawled in them dented them
and<00:03:32.700> they<00:03:32.970> still<00:03:33.240> work<00:03:33.510> absolutely<00:03:34.080> perfectly

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
and they still work absolutely perfectly

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.550 
and they still work absolutely perfectly
so<00:03:35.820> with<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.360> eyepieces<00:03:36.690> fully<00:03:37.050> extended

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
so with the eyepieces fully extended

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.699 
so with the eyepieces fully extended
that's<00:03:38.370> roughly<00:03:38.760> what<00:03:38.850> we<00:03:39.090> play<00:03:39.270> with<00:03:39.540> now<00:03:40.380> as

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
that's roughly what we play with now as

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.220 
that's roughly what we play with now as
you<00:03:41.250> can<00:03:41.340> see<00:03:41.400> these<00:03:41.760> look<00:03:41.970> more<00:03:42.000> stylish<00:03:42.600> for

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
you can see these look more stylish for

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.040 
you can see these look more stylish for
them<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.440> lot<00:03:43.560> more<00:03:43.590> angular<00:03:44.780> so<00:03:45.780> they're<00:03:45.930> as

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
them a lot more angular so they're as

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.330 
them a lot more angular so they're as
you<00:03:46.140> like<00:03:46.350> for<00:03:46.590> like<00:03:46.940> like<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.740> zeiss<00:03:50.480> 10<00:03:51.480> by<00:03:51.630> 45

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
you like for like like a zeiss 10 by 45

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.140 
you like for like like a zeiss 10 by 45
10<00:03:53.340> by<00:03:53.520> 42<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:55.290> they're<00:03:55.440> not<00:03:55.560> too<00:03:55.860> dissimilar

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
10 by 42 so they're not too dissimilar

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.510 
10 by 42 so they're not too dissimilar
the<00:03:57.150> like<00:03:57.330> is<00:03:57.510> way<00:03:57.720> in<00:03:57.930> at<00:03:58.140> 950<00:03:59.100> grams<00:03:59.190> they

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
just under a kilo the zeiss 995 there's

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.350 
just under a kilo the zeiss 995 there's

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
to minus 25 that sounds pretty Cobras

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.379 
to minus 25 that sounds pretty Cobras
minus<00:05:43.629> 14<00:05:44.020> BC<00:05:44.469> last<00:05:44.710> year<00:05:45.099> and<00:05:46.000> I<00:05:46.060> was<00:05:46.180> glad

that the equipment I had have been

that the equipment I had have been

I<00:05:50.620> don't<00:05:50.830> think<00:05:51.099> I'm<00:05:51.159> minus<00:05:51.460> 25<00:05:51.940> as<00:05:52.120> a

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
I don't think I'm minus 25 as a

I don't think I'm minus 25 as a

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
limitation on the product itself I think

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.990 
limitation on the product itself I think
it's<00:05:53.770> probably<00:05:53.979> more<00:05:54.190> likely<00:05:54.460> to<00:05:54.759> be<00:05:54.879> the

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
it's probably more likely to be the

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.149 
it's probably more likely to be the
battery<00:05:55.389> because<00:05:56.110> it<00:05:56.169> minus<00:05:56.440> 25<00:05:56.800> a<00:05:56.830> lot<00:05:57.069> of

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
battery because it minus 25 a lot of

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.249 
battery because it minus 25 a lot of
batteries<00:05:57.430> do<00:05:57.580> freezer<00:05:58.080> it's<00:05:59.080> also

00:05:59.249 --> 00:05:59.259

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
waterproof down to five meters now

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.869 
waterproof down to five meters now
clearly<00:06:03.009> we're<00:06:03.129> not<00:06:03.250> going<00:06:03.430> to<00:06:03.490> be<00:06:03.550> using

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
clearly we're not going to be using

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:05.369 
clearly we're not going to be using
underwater<00:06:04.180> unless<00:06:04.599> I'm<00:06:04.750> really<00:06:04.930> unlucky<00:06:05.169> and

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379 
underwater unless I'm really unlucky and

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:08.490 
underwater unless I'm really unlucky and
lose<00:06:05.560> my<00:06:05.710> footing<00:06:06.150> but<00:06:07.150> that<00:06:07.419> means<00:06:07.719> that<00:06:08.139> it

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
lose my footing but that means that it

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.290 
lose my footing but that means that it
will<00:06:08.620> withstand<00:06:08.830> the<00:06:09.400> weight<00:06:09.669> and<00:06:10.029> the

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
will withstand the weight and the

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.779 
will withstand the weight and the
pressure<00:06:10.629> of<00:06:10.810> water<00:06:11.110> on<00:06:11.469> the<00:06:12.129> joints<00:06:12.610> so

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
pressure of water on the joints so

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.519 
pressure of water on the joints so
you're<00:06:13.690> not<00:06:13.750> going<00:06:13.870> to<00:06:13.960> get<00:06:14.050> water<00:06:14.229> ingress

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:14.529 
you're not going to get water ingress

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:16.649 
you're not going to get water ingress
into<00:06:15.009> the<00:06:15.159> mechanism<00:06:15.729> or<00:06:15.909> into<00:06:16.569> the

into the mechanism or into the

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
rangefinder so that's another really

resistant<00:06:21.610> but<00:06:22.389> totally<00:06:22.719> waterproof<00:06:23.639> so
