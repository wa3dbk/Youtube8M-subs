you get steady aim pro and makes it

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.530 
you get steady aim pro and makes it
easier<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.009> hip<00:01:09.310> fire<00:01:09.580> with<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.880> shotgun<00:01:10.119> and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
easier to hip fire with the shotgun and

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.260 
easier to hip fire with the shotgun and
also<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.560> m16<00:01:12.220> because<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:12.970> could<00:01:13.119> be

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
also the m16 because that could be

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.969 
also the m16 because that could be
really<00:01:13.630> good<00:01:13.869> for<00:01:13.990> acquiring<00:01:14.350> if<00:01:14.649> you<00:01:14.800> really

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
really good for acquiring if you really

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.380 
really good for acquiring if you really
get<00:01:15.130> it<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:17.259> equipment<00:01:17.740> um<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
get it that and for equipment um the

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.480 
get it that and for equipment um the
semtex<00:01:19.630> is<00:01:19.960> probably<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.290> best<00:01:20.500> it's<00:01:21.250> like<00:01:21.399> a

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
semtex is probably the best it's like a

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.840 
semtex is probably the best it's like a
frag<00:01:21.789> grenade<00:01:22.090> but<00:01:22.300> it<00:01:22.450> could<00:01:22.569> stick<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
frag grenade but it could stick the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.200 
frag grenade but it could stick the
semtex<00:01:25.119> grenade<00:01:25.720> yeah<00:01:26.319> those<00:01:26.679> are<00:01:26.860> faster<00:01:27.369> so

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
semtex grenade yeah those are faster so

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.150 
semtex grenade yeah those are faster so
you<00:01:28.869> can't<00:01:29.140> really<00:01:29.170> throw<00:01:29.500> it<00:01:29.679> as<00:01:29.800> far<00:01:29.830> as<00:01:30.100> you

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
you can't really throw it as far as you

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.029 
you can't really throw it as far as you
can<00:01:30.250> throw<00:01:30.310> frag<00:01:30.759> grenade<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:32.740> the

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
know

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.500 
know
me<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:10.310> thermo<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:10.940> just<00:02:11.090> makes<00:02:11.240> a<00:02:11.360> lot

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
me and the thermo it just makes a lot

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.540 
me and the thermo it just makes a lot
easier<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.900> find<00:02:12.170> targets<00:02:12.680> especially<00:02:13.520> on

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
easier to find targets especially on

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.850 
easier to find targets especially on
come<00:02:14.030> over<00:02:14.300> pass<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.290> pass<00:02:15.530> where<00:02:15.800> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
come over pass on the pass where the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.280 
come over pass on the pass where the
fuck<00:02:16.100> that's<00:02:16.310> called<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:17.330> we<00:02:17.870> can<00:02:18.020> grassy

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
fuck that's called that we can grassy

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.430 
fuck that's called that we can grassy
map<00:02:18.590> with<00:02:18.830> what<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:20.290> yeah<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.410> just

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
map with what it is and yeah it just

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.100 
map with what it is and yeah it just
makes<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.800> easier<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.160> find<00:02:22.430> people<00:02:23.110> secondary

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
makes it easier to find people secondary

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.220 
makes it easier to find people secondary
I<00:02:24.230> like<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.530> pp-2000<00:02:25.870> unless<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.020> have<00:02:27.110> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
I like the pp-2000 unless you have the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.990 
I like the pp-2000 unless you have the
models<00:02:27.680> that's<00:02:28.010> really<00:02:28.250> getting<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.550> snipers

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
models that's really getting the snipers

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.150 
models that's really getting the snipers
going<00:02:29.330> if<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.020> don't<00:02:30.290> which<00:02:30.739> most<00:02:30.980> people

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
going if you don't which most people

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.900 
going if you don't which most people
don't<00:02:31.870> peavey<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.020> thousands<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.470> best

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
don't peavey to thousands the best

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.740 
don't peavey to thousands the best
submachine<00:02:34.910> guns<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.239> give<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.480> sniper

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
submachine guns to give the sniper

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.410 
submachine guns to give the sniper
classes<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:37.250> get<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.489> little<00:02:37.790> bit<00:02:37.910> more<00:02:38.090> closer

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
classes you get a little bit more closer

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.900 
classes you get a little bit more closer
range<00:02:38.810> yeah<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.860> people<00:02:40.040> Charles<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:40.580> really

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
range yeah and people Charles is really

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.360 
range yeah and people Charles is really
strong<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.540> also<00:02:42.170> like<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.500> put<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.920> sound<00:02:43.160> sir

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
strong I also like to put the sound sir

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.390 
strong I also like to put the sound sir
on<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.610> p2000<00:02:44.360> because<00:02:45.319> if<00:02:46.040> you're<00:02:46.370> a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
on the p2000 because if you're a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.820 
on the p2000 because if you're a
stationary<00:02:47.150> sniper<00:02:47.420> like<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.410> just<00:02:48.560> camp

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
stationary sniper like to just camp

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.259 
stationary sniper like to just camp
somewhere<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:49.370> then<00:02:49.459> snap<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.730> enemies<00:02:50.150> from

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
somewhere and then snap the enemies from

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.000 
somewhere and then snap the enemies from
there<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:51.019> sounds<00:02:51.350> are<00:02:51.470> good<00:02:51.709> because<00:02:51.860> you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
there the sounds are good because you

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.270 
there the sounds are good because you
won't<00:02:52.190> pick<00:02:52.310> up<00:02:52.430> on<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.670> radar<00:02:52.850> I<00:02:54.160> don't<00:02:55.160> know

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
won't pick up on the radar I don't know

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.740 
won't pick up on the radar I don't know
this<00:02:55.459> will<00:02:55.580> be<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.700> little<00:02:55.880> accuracy<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.540> much

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
this will be a little accuracy that much

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.150 
this will be a little accuracy that much
you're<00:02:57.140> not<00:02:57.260> really<00:02:57.410> going<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.650> assume<00:02:57.890> long

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
you're not really going to assume long

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.949 
you're not really going to assume long
range<00:02:58.400> with<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.790> because<00:02:59.209> obviously<00:02:59.510> had<00:02:59.840> this

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
range with it because obviously had this

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.860 
range with it because obviously had this
knife<00:03:00.200> for<00:03:00.410> self<00:03:00.620> doesn't<00:03:01.280> matter<00:03:01.569> first<00:03:02.569> perk

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
knife for self doesn't matter first perk

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.840 
knife for self doesn't matter first perk
I<00:03:03.019> like<00:03:03.170> bling<00:03:03.440> pro<00:03:03.769> you<00:03:04.430> don't<00:03:04.580> really<00:03:04.730> run

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
I like bling pro you don't really run

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.300 
I like bling pro you don't really run
out<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.090> ammo<00:03:05.299> so<00:03:06.049> you<00:03:06.470> don't<00:03:06.620> need<00:03:06.739> scavenger

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
out of ammo so you don't need scavenger

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.120 
out of ammo so you don't need scavenger
unless<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.480> have<00:03:08.510> like<00:03:08.959> really<00:03:09.560> shitty<00:03:09.980> aim

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
unless you have like really shitty aim

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.330 
unless you have like really shitty aim
oh<00:03:10.400> yeah<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.930> bling<00:03:12.260> pro<00:03:12.530> let's<00:03:13.010> use<00:03:13.220> the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
oh yeah so bling pro let's use the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.960 
oh yeah so bling pro let's use the

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
got the thermal so you can smoke them

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.020 
got the thermal so you can smoke them
fairly<00:03:47.989> easily<00:03:48.230> unless<00:03:49.220> they<00:03:49.400> whole<00:03:49.640> ass<00:03:49.820> out

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
can use any pistol you want but I think

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.130 
can use any pistol you want but I think
magnums<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.860> best<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.480> or<00:04:54.480> you<00:04:54.660> can<00:04:54.810> even<00:04:54.990> use

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
magnums the best and or you can even use

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.960 
magnums the best and or you can even use
a<00:04:55.260> shotgun<00:04:55.560> sound<00:04:56.250> stores<00:04:56.580> are<00:04:56.670> probably<00:04:56.880> the

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
a shotgun sound stores are probably the

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.060 
a shotgun sound stores are probably the
best<00:04:57.210> but<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:57.930> really<00:04:58.260> reduces<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.740> range<00:04:58.950> of

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
best but I really reduces the range of

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.550 
best but I really reduces the range of
them<00:04:59.220> like<00:04:59.670> the<00:04:59.790> m1014<00:05:00.180> Down<00:05:00.840> Goes<00:05:01.170> the<00:05:01.200> sound

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560
