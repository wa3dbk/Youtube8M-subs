00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.399
 hello youtube friends here I bring a 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.799
 very good news for the owners of 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:13.019
 samsung galaxy s3 and is that we already have 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.879
 Android version 421 if it looked like a lie 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.070
 but here we have it to android jelly 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:23.880
 bean 4.2.1 there is 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.800
 from the hand they knew today in mod 10.1 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.410
 here we see all the information that we 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.860
 it may be necessary we see that really 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.430
 it's about the samsung galaxy s3 by gt 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.940
 and 9,300 android version 4 21 as I've 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.550
 said the radio the same one I had for 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.850
 installed and has a cyanogenmod kernel 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.530
 10.1 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.539
 here we see it the channel kernel 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.339
 experimental work by code works and 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.820
 the version of either do not have mod 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:00.410
 as I said is the 10.1 good so here 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.580
 we have a very good news 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.900
 and as for aesthetics of course not 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.610
 we can be in front of something else we see 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.950
 that aesthetics is the same as always 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.140
 simple aesthetics but very careful 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.110
 a very fast operating system very 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.240
 stable and very light occupies very little 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.120
 can occupy perfectly 5 times less 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.610
 that the stock versions say that 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.840
 this version is not final is not stable 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.390
 our considered as stable 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.670
 then all those that you want 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.990
 try it, I warn you in advance 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.060
 is a final version can contain 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.220
 mistakes I 've tried it like that over 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.220
 for several hours I was testing 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.640
 Well, the typical no wifi camera 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.550
 bluetooth 3g and good more or less 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.040
 everything works but I'm not saying I can not 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.500
 give failures in fact you have to give them not 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.020
 because if it is not the final version has 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.450
 that give some failure that sure and good 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.450
 as news I say it is very good 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.490
 we have the option of the white keyboard as 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.070
 we see 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.420
 very good also news always 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.380
 news with this new system 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.569
 operative the gallery of course the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.810
 will also bring where these gallery where 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.810
 these 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.100
 well we take a picture 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:27.930
 and we see it there it's good perfect good 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.630
 Well, as I say, we are not going to develop 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.150
 this reason or to see it thoroughly but if the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.890
 news as news is very good 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.750
 know that we already have in the samsung 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.400
 galaxy s3 such an advanced version of 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.510
 so innovative that it's the last one there 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.690
 Android now living 4.2.1 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.860
 from the hand of cyanogenmod 10.1 by 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.410
 course the next video will be 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.600
 explain from where you can 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.070
 download how you can try but for 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.350
 Of course I always notice that it is not 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.480
 final version or considered version 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.030
 stable with which may contain 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.920
 mistakes and I notice that good 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.050
 I am not responsible for what I can 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.340
 happen but well I equally in the 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.050
 video because you already know that I like it 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.959
 always have the latest and the most 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.090
 Novelty good, here's the news 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.650
