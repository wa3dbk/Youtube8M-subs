00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.230
 hello installer 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.379
 in this video you will learn how to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.410
 locate and connect the hood wires and 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.760
 trunk of positron alarms not 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.160
 here in brazil imagine this not here 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.160
 It happens but I've already seen installer 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.830
 do not put the bag door switch 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.430
 monitoring only by the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.590
 ultrasound hence a beautiful day without this 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.780
 your client discovers that the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.030
 steppe and never again there 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.520
 Ever thought we'll go there before any 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.800
 thing you need to do some tests 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.450
 and have a brothers multimeter 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.180
 place the multimeter dial on the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.399
 20 volt direct current scale 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.770
 depending on the meter model this 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.530
 scale will be identified by this 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.140
 symbol or by cv registration 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.199
 then check that the vehicle has light 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.149
 in the trunk and switch on the hood 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.369
 otherwise it may be that you have 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.650
 who install switches apart 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.200
 It's worth remembering that the film 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.659
 positron alarms only works 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.680
 switches with negative sign 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.240
 Ok let's start with the trunk of the trunk. 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.400
 locates the switch of the trunk 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.770
 which may be in the articulation of the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.290
 hinge or lock 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.750
 if you prefer you can take the test 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.030
 directly in the door light 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.070
 for this do the following 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.600
 port lantern bags 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.030
 touch the red tip of the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.390
 multimeter at a point with 12 volts 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.840
 constant and black flashlight wires 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.210
 one of them will indicate 12 volts and another 0 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.240
 keep the tip on the one who made the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.250
 time to indicate 12 volts. 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.619
 switch to see if a multimeter 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.740
 started to indicate 0 volts 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.750
 If yes, connect it to the alarm. 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.030
 in this movie person I had 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.219
 forgotten field switch is not 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.649
 forgot not I'll tell you one thing 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.619
 way to test it and how it works 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.619
 It is very similar to the trunk but 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.410
 the light connected to it if the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.200
 vehicle does not have this switch on the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.940
 prevents you from installing a separate case 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.110
 you have questions about how to run 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.300
 this step 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.880
 see the dedicated videos or 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.240
 technical information we have prepared for 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.240
 you
