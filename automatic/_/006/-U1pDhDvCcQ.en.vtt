they're<00:02:08.950> great<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.280> sprinkle<00:02:09.700> on<00:02:09.850> top<00:02:09.910> of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
they're great to sprinkle on top of

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.700 
they're great to sprinkle on top of
anything<00:02:10.869> they're<00:02:11.860> lightweight<00:02:12.520> so<00:02:12.910> they

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
anything they're lightweight so they

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.260 
anything they're lightweight so they
aren't<00:02:14.710> as<00:02:14.800> costly<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.310> ship<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.790> course<00:02:16.060> I'm

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
aren't as costly to ship of course I'm

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.840 
aren't as costly to ship of course I'm
the<00:02:16.390> kind<00:02:16.570> of<00:02:16.600> person<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.960> gets<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.490> free

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
the kind of person that gets to the free

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.280 
the kind of person that gets to the free
order<00:02:19.290> value<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.710> shipping<00:02:21.070> anyway<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:21.460> I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
order value of shipping anyway so I

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.020 
order value of shipping anyway so I
guess<00:02:23.290> they're<00:02:23.710> lightweight<00:02:24.160> easy<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.820> ship

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
guess they're lightweight easy to ship

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:33.960 
guess they're lightweight easy to ship
might<00:02:25.210> be<00:02:25.360> more<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.750> manufacturer<00:02:26.500> issue<00:02:32.970> we

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
might be more of a manufacturer issue we

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.930 
might be more of a manufacturer issue we
think<00:02:34.000> Bubba<00:02:34.600> is<00:02:34.810> pretty<00:02:35.140> good<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.800> also<00:02:36.610> like

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
that you know no wheat or anything like

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.310 
that you know no wheat or anything like
that<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.520> hundred<00:02:42.970> percent<00:02:43.120> pure<00:02:43.810> salmon

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
that it is a hundred percent pure salmon

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.600 
that it is a hundred percent pure salmon
freeze-dried<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:47.410> also<00:02:47.590> have<00:02:47.980> got<00:02:48.160> the

review on these probably next week and I
like<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.730> give<00:03:03.940> Charlie<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.690> trig<00:03:04.959> different

like to give Charlie and trig different
kinds<00:03:06.459> of<00:03:06.550> protein<00:03:07.110> because<00:03:08.250> I've<00:03:09.250> read<00:03:10.180> that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420
