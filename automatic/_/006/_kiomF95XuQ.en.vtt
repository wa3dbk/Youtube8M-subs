video down below so yeah today was a bit

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.720 
video down below so yeah today was a bit
more<00:00:54.030> loose<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.780> um<00:00:54.930> oh<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.340> curl<00:00:56.579> my<00:00:56.610> hair

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
more loose but um oh and I curl my hair

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.069 
more loose but um oh and I curl my hair
with<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.289> infinity<00:00:59.660> 1<00:01:00.660> by<00:01:00.690> cold

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
with that it's the infinity 1 by cold

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.170 
with that it's the infinity 1 by cold
air<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.649> don't<00:01:01.980> really<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.820> way<00:01:03.000> my

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
air but I don't really like the way my

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.609 
air but I don't really like the way my
hair<00:01:03.390> looks<00:01:03.600> when<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.589> I

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
hair looks when it's like that so I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.429 
hair looks when it's like that so I
probably<00:01:04.949> won't<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.790> often<00:01:05.939> because

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
probably won't do it that often because

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.160 
probably won't do it that often because
it's<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.680> really<00:01:07.890> what<00:01:08.040> I'm<00:01:08.130> looking<00:01:08.460> for

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
it's not really what I'm looking for

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.270 
it's not really what I'm looking for
especially<00:01:10.170> today<00:01:10.380> knives<00:01:10.680> looks<00:01:10.950> kind<00:01:11.220> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
especially today knives looks kind of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.190 
especially today knives looks kind of
fine<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:11.670> today<00:01:11.880> didn't<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.840> how<00:01:13.140> it

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
fine but today didn't really like how it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.010 
fine but today didn't really like how it
looked<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.189> prefer<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.670> bigger<00:01:15.270> ways<00:01:15.570> just

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
looked so I prefer just bigger ways just

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.940 
looked so I prefer just bigger ways just
with<00:01:16.140> animal<00:01:17.130> curling<00:01:17.549> iron<00:01:17.729> um<00:01:18.740> yeah<00:01:19.740> it's

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
with animal curling iron um yeah it's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.380 
with animal curling iron um yeah it's
more<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.280> Victoria's<00:01:20.700> Secret<00:01:20.970> style<00:01:21.210> this

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
more like Victoria's Secret style this

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.440 
more like Victoria's Secret style this
is<00:01:21.450> more<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:21.930> beachy<00:01:22.470> waves<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.640> yeah<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.270> know

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
is more like beachy waves so yeah I know

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.960 
is more like beachy waves so yeah I know
so<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.439> guess<00:01:25.710> I'll<00:01:26.220> try<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.490> show<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.729> how<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
so I guess I'll try to show you how to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.090 
so I guess I'll try to show you how to
look<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.960> comes<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:28.829> tie

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
look so it comes with like a little tie

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.760 
look so it comes with like a little tie
but<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> size<00:01:30.420> large<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:30.869> it's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
but this is a size large so it's

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.170 
but this is a size large so it's
probably<00:01:32.100> not<00:01:32.220> supposed<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.670> fit<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.000> this

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
probably not supposed to fit like this

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.620 
probably not supposed to fit like this
but<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.780> me<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.920> long<00:01:35.250> tunic<00:01:35.630> but

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
but on me it's kind of a long tunic but

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.960 
but on me it's kind of a long tunic but
um<00:01:36.810> yeah<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.770> think<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.310> more<00:01:38.490> meant<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.939> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
um yeah I think it's more meant to be a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.170 
um yeah I think it's more meant to be a
shirt<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.600> whatever<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.670> my<00:01:41.820> leggings
