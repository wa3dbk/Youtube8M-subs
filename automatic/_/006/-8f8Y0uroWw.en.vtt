00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.799
 For two years, Lars Boom has been going to it 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.730
 lived this day he is the too 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.109
 knock man 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.760
 the belgian front try the tree 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.980
 first to destroy mentally 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.630
 that did not work but in the race the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.580
 Belgians do not even have to do much effort 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.320
 to make the tree small 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.060
 niels albert went early to the only one 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.590
 was able to follow the checks up that mountain 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.330
 appropriate distance 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.890
 boom did not change his bike satisfied 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.930
 about the tire pressure and then already know 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.460
 well on that you cycle her donut and that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.650
 happened but boom was at that time 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.269
 have long been out of sight even it 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.759
 chasing group went too fast 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.350
 him and so it is the Belgians who 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.329
 partying and driving eyes 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.460
 niels albert he's going to win in here 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.140
 you will learn his first World Cup with the elites 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.610
 turn to the rainbow 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.640
 ski bar comes second on the finish line 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.219
 for Nys and far far behind that only 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.930
 lars boom as 20th but who in broken 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.120
 man thinks to meet who has the knife 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.579
 If this scenario I had in mind 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.930
 held by billions of indented room 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.579
 it could be more new in thinking 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.680
 you do wind and especially on such a turn 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.090
 but was good today but not good 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.370
 enough to win 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.840
 how can this have an explanation for this 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.090
 to everyone and want an explanation 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.090
 good if you are not super on his day 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.039
 and 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.920
 yes one the other and there are better and 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.700
 especially to be running then yes it can 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.259
 also happen 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.210
 the pressure and tension on you that was 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.409
 nice staged almost inhuman 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.229
 it too much of you 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.609
 I think the hand won't do anything with it 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.979
 his day should not you want many people 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.360
 and not or other many things 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.100
 against that or parkour and happen 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.200
 I have not done that and I have 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.969
 comma your course and if you are not right then 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.859
 are it's just really too bad 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.359
 on the other hand you are also beaten by one 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.049
 good collective Belgians because they had 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.909
 the direction 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.649
 that there is no other after me 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.380
 I try to start a yes 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.210
 male standing and cda parker 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.340

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.030
 shoes does beautiful sermon and drives away and 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.229
 if if you're good then then it doesn't matter 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.060
 how Belgium is about or 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.259

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.039
 the crap and severely disappointed 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.289
 but that does not require one 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.670
 drink a beer and continue 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.360
