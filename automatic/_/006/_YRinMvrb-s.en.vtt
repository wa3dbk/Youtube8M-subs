00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 James everyone and we're back with a 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.490
 new video as you are watching in the background 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.799
 This picture was posted last night by Michael 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.719
 condrey on his official twitter what do you want 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.910
 say this well, it's going to be the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.469
 game of souls soon to what 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.210
 it would be the van warfare collectivity 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.680
 We are waiting for it for quite some time 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.869
 time you already know that before 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.880
 come out the game had already been announced 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.859
 that we would have to play more infected 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.390
 once the game came out only 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.060
 it was infected what it would be because the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.800
 from the games of bets like 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.330
 they have been called previously in others 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.690
 four marmosets because he was only 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.760
 infected then just last night 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.980
 as I say at dawn put this picture 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.750
 and this makes us see that we are going to have the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.370
 weapon game coming shortly and 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.590
 I put you alfaro when they are going to put 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.559
 that did not say it just put the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.090
 image and little more then what yes that 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.149
 I think that once you've put in the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.590
 I do not think it takes much longer in 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.230
 announce it well put it I think for 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.360
 next week or something like that I think that 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.850
 they will throw it so we can play it now 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.430
 I do not know if they're going to do it first 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.320
 only on xbox one and on xbox 360 and 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.150
 you know they have priority these 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.720
 platforms and do not take almost everything as a 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.910
 month 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.520
 before for these platforms and then 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.380
 I do not think they do this for the others 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.260
 so I think that being a game mode 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.460
 they will put it for all because as I say 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.750
 that is a game mode I do not think this 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.160
 they are going to do it that way they do it with 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.770
 the times with weapons and the 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.590
 camouflages so I do not think they're going to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.820
 do it that way by being a mode of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.580
 I play like I say but good, I'll keep 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.530
 investigating to see if something else comes out 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.520
 to see if they give any news the truth 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.870
 that I already have enough desire that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.610
 put this game mode for those 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.590
 that you do not know what it is that 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.450
 we have, I suppose there will be about 18 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.979
 20 souls we started with a gun and 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.540
 we are increasing for each lower that 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.340
 let's go doing we are changing the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.950
 soul and the truth that this gameplay 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.840
 he needs a lot in the vanguard 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.729
 since it would make it a lot more 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.170
 fun then what would that be 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.240
 selection of games we have in this 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.490
 section that as you know is infected 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.259
 Then there's the one shot and I think 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.880
 that also does it quite lack like that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.930
 that nothing like I say this will continue 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.820
 investigating to see if it's coming out 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.080
 something else subsist streep on behalf of 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.860
 no video and see you in next 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.860
 see you later
