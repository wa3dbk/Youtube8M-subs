00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
you've done enough I started getting to

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.289 
you've done enough I started getting to
the<00:00:13.740> say<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.280> know<00:00:14.370> stage<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.969> know<00:00:15.089> what

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
the say you know stage of you know what

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.240 
the say you know stage of you know what
is<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.660> next<00:00:15.870> step<00:00:15.990> how<00:00:16.470> we<00:00:16.529> still<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.190> to

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
is the next step how we still going to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.370 
is the next step how we still going to
have<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.460> family<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.270> think<00:00:18.960> there's<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.170> lot<00:00:19.320> of

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
have a family I think there's a lot of

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.620 
have a family I think there's a lot of
reasons<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.100> people<00:00:20.279> end<00:00:20.760> up<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.539> into

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
reasons that people end up going into

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.420 
reasons that people end up going into
adoption<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.710> think<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.130> it's<00:00:23.310> really

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
adoption and I think that it's really

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.269 
adoption and I think that it's really
helpful<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.480> people<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.320> acknowledge<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.890> want

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
helpful for people to acknowledge I want

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.400 
helpful for people to acknowledge I want
this<00:00:26.430> child<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.970> want<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.660> me<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.260> my

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
this child I want this for me for my

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.800 
this child I want this for me for my
family<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.970> doesn't<00:00:30.359> mean<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.689> I'm

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
family and that doesn't mean that I'm

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.290 
family and that doesn't mean that I'm
doing<00:00:30.990> something<00:00:31.410> that's<00:00:32.130> bad<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> world

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
doing something that's bad in the world

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.630 
doing something that's bad in the world
or<00:00:33.660> hurtful<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.620> people<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:35.130> just<00:00:35.160> means<00:00:35.520> that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
or hurtful to people it just means that

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
or hurtful to people it just means that
I<00:00:35.940> also<00:00:36.270> recognize<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.590> an

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
I also recognize that I have an

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.709 
I also recognize that I have an
investment<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:39.180> I'm<00:00:39.390> getting

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
investment in this and that I'm getting

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.840 
investment in this and that I'm getting
something<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.290> need<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.250> primarily

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
something that I need it was primarily

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.639 
something that I need it was primarily
selfish<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.590> wanted<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.090> mother

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
selfish because I wanted to be a mother

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.700 
selfish because I wanted to be a mother
period<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:47.160> needed<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> family<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.960> my

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
period we needed to be a family in my

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.689 
period we needed to be a family in my
mind<00:00:50.420> that's<00:00:51.420> why<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:53.070> didn't<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.489> anything

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
mind that's why it didn't have anything

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.459 
mind that's why it didn't have anything
to<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.239> providing<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.840> home<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> little

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
to do with providing a home for a little

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.880 
to do with providing a home for a little
lost<00:00:55.710> soul<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.520> was<00:00:56.820> about<00:00:57.410> me<00:00:58.410> when<00:00:58.620> people

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
lost soul it was about me when people

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.160 
lost soul it was about me when people
wonder<00:00:59.340> about<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.760> selfish<00:01:00.239> means<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.960> terms

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
wonder about what selfish means in terms

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.560 
wonder about what selfish means in terms
of<00:01:01.379> adoption<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:02.100> think<00:01:02.760> they<00:01:02.879> tend<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.329> take<00:01:03.510> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
of adoption I think they tend to take a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.740 
of adoption I think they tend to take a
very<00:01:04.549> limited<00:01:05.549> perspective<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.450> what<00:01:06.600> that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
very limited perspective of what that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.570 
very limited perspective of what that
term<00:01:06.990> means<00:01:07.020> they<00:01:07.560> think<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> selfish<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.400> good

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
term means they think of selfish is good

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.149 
term means they think of selfish is good
or<00:01:08.700> bad<00:01:08.850> any<00:01:09.750> words<00:01:10.110> they<00:01:10.350> sort<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.860> look<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.130> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
or bad any words they sort of look at it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.910 
or bad any words they sort of look at it
as<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> pejorative<00:01:12.320> kind<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.409> term<00:01:13.619> that's<00:01:13.830> used

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
as a pejorative kind of term that's used

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.109 
as a pejorative kind of term that's used
to<00:01:14.130> describe<00:01:14.490> someone<00:01:14.729> who's<00:01:14.909> doing

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
to describe someone who's doing

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.390 
to describe someone who's doing
something<00:01:15.450> bad<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.200> no<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.040> would<00:01:17.280> ever

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
something bad and that no one would ever

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.880 
something bad and that no one would ever
want<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:17.970> described<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.509> selfish<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
want to be described as selfish and the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.039 
want to be described as selfish and the
difficulty<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.909> doing<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.840> that

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
difficulty with doing that is that

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.859 
difficulty with doing that is that
whenever<00:01:22.799> we<00:01:23.040> try<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.400> resist<00:01:23.850> real<00:01:24.570> terms

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
whenever we try and resist real terms

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
whenever we try and resist real terms
that<00:01:25.170> really<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.619> describe<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:26.939> we're<00:01:27.090> doing

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
that really do describe what we're doing

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.160 
that really do describe what we're doing
we've<00:01:28.049> also<00:01:28.290> decided<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.100> deny<00:01:29.630> parts<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.810> our

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
we've also decided to deny parts of our

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.460 
we've also decided to deny parts of our
feelings<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.860> our<00:01:32.689> hopes<00:01:33.689> our<00:01:33.930> dreams<00:01:33.990> our

and all for the better so in that way
you<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.079> perhaps<00:01:43.320> selfish<00:01:44.360> but<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.380> a
