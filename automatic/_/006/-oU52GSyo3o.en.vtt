designed myself it's a holding a
collapsible<00:00:19.070> drop<00:00:19.430> trap<00:00:19.760> and<00:00:20.180> I'm<00:00:20.300> just<00:00:20.420> going

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
collapsible drop trap and I'm just going

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.740 
collapsible drop trap and I'm just going
to<00:00:20.630> demonstrate<00:00:20.810> how<00:00:21.199> to<00:00:21.230> open<00:00:21.349> it

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
to demonstrate how to open it

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.170 
to demonstrate how to open it
this<00:00:23.290> traffic<00:00:23.680> you<00:00:23.770> just<00:00:23.980> take<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.310> bungee

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
this traffic you just take the bungee

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:32.300 
this traffic you just take the bungee
cords<00:00:25.480> off<00:00:25.660> this<00:00:25.900> way<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:27.700> it<00:00:27.880> opens<00:00:28.300> up

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.250 

as<00:00:32.490> long<00:00:32.670> as<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.910> remember<00:00:33.330> to<00:00:33.360> put<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.960> class

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
as long as you remember to put the class

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.779 
as long as you remember to put the class
down

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
down

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.000 
down
so<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> track<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.839> secure<00:00:37.379> that<00:00:37.589> so<00:00:37.739> when<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
so the track is secure that so when it

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.150 
so the track is secure that so when it
falls<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.850> doesn't<00:00:39.230> bow<00:00:40.230> tie<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
falls it doesn't bow tie in and then the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.130 
falls it doesn't bow tie in and then the
cat<00:00:41.339> will<00:00:41.519> get<00:00:41.640> loose<00:00:44.570> just<00:00:45.570> make<00:00:45.780> sure<00:00:45.989> you're

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
cat will get loose just make sure you're

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.860 
cat will get loose just make sure you're
careful<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.979> all<00:00:47.399> four<00:00:47.460> clasps<00:00:48.390> done<00:00:48.690> up

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
careful to have all four clasps done up

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.509 
careful to have all four clasps done up
and<00:00:49.190> then<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:51.510> way<00:00:51.659> we<00:00:51.690> use<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.229> trap<00:00:52.589> is<00:00:53.159> we

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
and then the way we use this trap is we

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.040 
and then the way we use this trap is we
set<00:00:53.729> it<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.119> a<00:00:54.469> post<00:00:55.469> like<00:00:56.039> this

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.560 

and<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.680> Rope<00:00:59.890> runs<00:01:00.250> out<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:00.970> wherever<00:01:01.210> you

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
and the Rope runs out to wherever you

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.219 
and the Rope runs out to wherever you
can<00:01:01.750> hide<00:01:02.070> effectively<00:01:03.070> without<00:01:03.220> the<00:01:03.550> cat

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.120 

and<00:01:06.320> then<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:07.030> trapdoors<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.329> sliding<00:01:08.810> door<00:01:09.130> we

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
and then the trapdoors a sliding door we

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.740 
and then the trapdoors a sliding door we
take<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.640> food<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.030> we<00:01:11.090> put<00:01:11.299> it<00:01:11.390> in<00:01:11.509> dead

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
take the food and we put it in dead

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.490 
take the food and we put it in dead
