 love applause as long as it's in the moment 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.430
 right 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.890
 For example, I'm going to tell you a good joke. 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.260
 People I had a chick to 'face' 10 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.060
 But I did not even mention that the chick had 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.650
 a mouth is sensational great 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.139
 I'm really original, and I found the 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.799
 car with a simple photo gave omit 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:07.200
 I had to spend my hand that 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.040
 viewer is the very spectator. 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.109
 common in theaters than the spectator 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.099
 tuberculosis 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.590

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.510
 pharmacy so buy pills or pulled 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.220
 of candidate I'm going to get in there is more or 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:32.340
 The less I tell a joke 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:34.139
 good people are good 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.030
 the viewer himself is very similar 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.900
 with the tuberculous only that it uses of a 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.970
 other medium than the technological spectator 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.299
 the first thing he does it 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:51.000
 disrupts our almost blind vision 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:56.180
 people with flash and not happy when 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.180
 We least expect it from nowhere. 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:10.430
 friend is my friend there the water're not here 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.810
 it 's your fault 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.130
 then you think he mentioned the agent 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:20.630
 continuous sound of speech now mother is not in the 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.510

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.150
 It's only natural that he learned that 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.650
 the second time that obviously but then he 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.460
 comes with a stroke of mercy in bed 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.730

 working shows i can not talk now 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:49.040
 but the viewer himself thinks more 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.060
 inconvenience is still very common in 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.920

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:01.400
 inconvenient it does not have 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:05.650
