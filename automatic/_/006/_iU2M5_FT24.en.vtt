00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
to do right now how we're fitting

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.380 
to do right now how we're fitting
howling<00:03:41.380> physically<00:03:41.770> and<00:03:41.980> he<00:03:42.820> just<00:03:43.090> practice

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
howling physically and he just practice

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.510 
howling physically and he just practice
accordingly<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:44.860> know<00:03:44.950> we<00:03:45.130> come<00:03:45.280> out<00:03:45.310> we

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
accordingly so you know we come out we

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.100 
accordingly so you know we come out we
put<00:03:45.670> in<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.790> hard<00:03:45.940> work<00:03:46.030> then<00:03:46.750> we<00:03:46.840> go<00:03:46.960> in<00:03:47.080> we

put in the hard work then we go in we

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.050 
put in the hard work then we go in we
regenerate<00:03:47.710> so<00:03:48.130> I<00:03:48.430> think<00:03:48.550> it's<00:03:48.790> been<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:48.940> good

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060
