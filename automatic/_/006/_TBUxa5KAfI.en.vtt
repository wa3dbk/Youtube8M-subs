00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
have a gimmick in this mode you just

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.500 
have a gimmick in this mode you just
take<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.720> front<00:01:40.110> two<00:01:40.410> legs<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.460> spread<00:01:42.330> them

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
apart and then you get you can see that

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:56.390 
apart and then you get you can see that
mandibular<00:01:46.070> chewing<00:01:47.070> action

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.480

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.010 

transformation<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.760> is<00:02:03.119> very<00:02:03.450> simple<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.960> is

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
transformation is is very simple this is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.300 
transformation is is very simple this is
going<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.409> very<00:02:04.530> quick<00:02:05.600> basically<00:02:07.310> we're

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
going to be very quick basically we're

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
just flip it up this way like so and you

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.960 
just flip it up this way like so and you
can<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:16.830> your<00:02:16.980> chest<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.430> her<00:02:17.520> head<00:02:17.670> has<00:02:17.790> been

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
can see your chest in her head has been

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.910 
can see your chest in her head has been
revealed<00:02:18.300> we're<00:02:18.600> going<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.780> rotate<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.290> 180

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
revealed we're going to rotate that 180

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.570 
revealed we're going to rotate that 180
degrees<00:02:21.350> then<00:02:22.550> these<00:02:23.550> two<00:02:24.500> spider<00:02:25.500> legs<00:02:25.800> will

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
degrees then these two spider legs will

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.229 
degrees then these two spider legs will
combine<00:02:27.420> their<00:02:27.930> there<00:02:28.319> in<00:02:28.470> halves<00:02:29.120> there<00:02:30.120> eat

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
combine their there in halves there eat

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.930 
combine their there in halves there eat
they<00:02:30.420> form<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.840> half<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.700> robot<00:02:32.700> legs

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
they form a half of the robot legs

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.130 
they form a half of the robot legs
they're<00:02:33.600> all<00:02:33.750> pegs<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.010> posts<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.459> ports<00:02:36.140> in

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
they're all pegs and posts and ports in

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.590 
they're all pegs and posts and ports in
the<00:02:37.200> foot<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.160> leg<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:39.300> will<00:02:39.420> put

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
the foot and in the leg that will put

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.330 
the foot and in the leg that will put
together<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:41.030> then<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.769> rotate<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:44.130> down

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
together and then just rotate it down

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.870 
together and then just rotate it down
and<00:02:44.790> flip<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.269> foot<00:02:45.480> up<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.550> then<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.670> same

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
and flip the foot up and then the same

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.199 
and flip the foot up and then the same
with<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.150> other<00:02:48.180> side<00:02:49.610> just<00:02:50.610> kind<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:50.850> line<00:02:51.030> up

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
with the other side just kind of line up

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.949 
with the other side just kind of line up
all<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.660> little<00:02:52.400> posts<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.519> ports<00:02:56.780> push<00:02:57.780> them

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
all the little posts and ports push them

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.690 
all the little posts and ports push them
together<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:59.450> then<00:03:00.450> get<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:01.069> leg<00:03:02.069> rotated

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
together and then get that leg rotated

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.479 
together and then get that leg rotated
down<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.950> foot<00:03:05.160> flipped<00:03:05.519> up<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:08.310> then

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
down and the foot flipped up and then

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.920 
down and the foot flipped up and then
that's<00:03:08.730> pretty<00:03:08.940> much<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.480> just<00:03:09.630> gotta

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
that's pretty much it you just gotta

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.229 
that's pretty much it you just gotta
rotate<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.040> arms<00:03:11.310> around<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.610> position<00:03:12.030> as

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
rotate the arms around in position as

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.780 
rotate the arms around in position as
you<00:03:12.390> like<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:13.320> problem<00:03:14.160> with<00:03:14.310> mine<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.549> don't

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
you like a problem with mine I don't

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.370 
you like a problem with mine I don't
know<00:03:14.940> if<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.150> everyone's<00:03:15.720> or<00:03:15.959> just<00:03:16.200> mine

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
know if this is everyone's or just mine

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.229 
know if this is everyone's or just mine

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
but these little claws here or they're

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.259 
but these little claws here or they're
supposed<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.720> they're<00:03:19.440> actually<00:03:19.829> on<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:20.269> sort

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
supposed to they're actually on a sort

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.880 
supposed to they're actually on a sort
of<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.390> hinge<00:03:21.600> there<00:03:21.840> they're<00:03:22.470> supposed<00:03:22.769> to

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
of a hinge there they're supposed to

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.770 
of a hinge there they're supposed to
move<00:03:23.070> but<00:03:23.430> Mine<00:03:23.459> just<00:03:23.880> don't<00:03:24.090> with<00:03:24.329> with

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
move but Mine just don't with with

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.900 
move but Mine just don't with with
pretty<00:03:25.049> pretty<00:03:25.860> good<00:03:26.070> force<00:03:26.310> on<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.730> don't

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
pretty pretty good force on it I don't

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.190 
pretty pretty good force on it I don't
want<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.090> force<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.420> too<00:03:27.540> much<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.900> break<00:03:28.019> them

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
want to force it too much and break them

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.420 
want to force it too much and break them
off<00:03:28.370> but<00:03:29.370> they're<00:03:29.549> supposed<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.940> move<00:03:30.150> anyway

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
off but they're supposed to move anyway

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.729 
off but they're supposed to move anyway
so<00:03:32.430> those<00:03:32.609> are<00:03:32.640> her<00:03:32.910> hands<00:03:33.500> probably<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> lot<00:03:34.650> of

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
so those are her hands probably a lot of

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.160 
so those are her hands probably a lot of
people<00:03:34.980> won't<00:03:35.130> like<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:36.750> isn't<00:03:37.019> very

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
people won't like that it isn't very

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.380 
people won't like that it isn't very
attractive<00:03:37.650> for<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> fembot<00:03:38.310> like<00:03:38.820> I<00:03:38.850> must<00:03:39.239> say

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
attractive for a fembot like I must say

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.830 
attractive for a fembot like I must say
that<00:03:39.570> but<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.489> what<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:41.820> also<00:03:42.540> what<00:03:42.810> I

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
that but it is what it is also what I

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.660 
that but it is what it is also what I
didn't<00:03:43.140> show<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.350> yet<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.130> little<00:03:44.400> visor

didn't show you yet is the little visor

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.500 
didn't show you yet is the little visor
over<00:03:45.060> her<00:03:45.180> eyes<00:03:45.359> to<00:03:45.720> lift<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.079> up<00:03:47.359> and<00:03:48.359> you

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
over her eyes to lift that up and you

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.770 
over her eyes to lift that up and you
can<00:03:48.690> see<00:03:48.840> your<00:03:48.930> face<00:03:50.390> articulation<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.540> pretty

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
can see your face articulation is pretty

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.500 
can see your face articulation is pretty
good<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:53.010> only<00:03:53.190> thing<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.730> head<00:03:53.940> when<00:03:54.390> you

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
good the only thing is the head when you

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.970 
good the only thing is the head when you
turn<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:54.780> because<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.350> hair<00:03:55.590> in<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.829> back

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
turn it because of the hair in the back

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.349 
turn it because of the hair in the back
if<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.340> turn<00:03:56.519> it<00:03:56.609> to<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.760> left<00:03:56.820> or<00:03:57.060> right<00:03:57.090> she

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
if you turn it to the left or right she

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.039 
if you turn it to the left or right she
has<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.660> look<00:03:57.750> down<00:03:58.670> both<00:03:59.670> ways<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.900> does

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
has to look down both ways and it does

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.509 
has to look down both ways and it does
rotate<00:04:01.230> 360<00:04:03.079> so<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.530> hair<00:04:04.769> kind<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.100> limits

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
rotate 360 so the hair kind of limits

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.260 
rotate 360 so the hair kind of limits
the<00:04:05.930> where<00:04:06.930> she<00:04:07.170> can<00:04:07.350> face<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.370> look<00:04:08.489> around

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
the where she can face and look around

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.490 
the where she can face and look around
other<00:04:10.480> than<00:04:10.630> that<00:04:10.840> all<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.350> other

other than that all the other

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.040 
other than that all the other
articulation<00:04:12.310> is<00:04:12.430> pretty<00:04:13.030> pretty<00:04:13.510> good<00:04:13.720> very

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
articulation is pretty pretty good very

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.210 
articulation is pretty pretty good very
poseable<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.880> knees<00:04:16.090> ankles<00:04:16.540> hips<00:04:17.220> shoulders

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.600 

probably<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:43.270> major<00:04:44.310> thing<00:04:45.310> with<00:04:45.490> this

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
probably the the major thing with this

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.480 
probably the the major thing with this
figure<00:04:45.939> is<00:04:46.120> that<00:04:46.150> she's<00:04:46.479> got<00:04:46.629> a<00:04:46.659> big<00:04:47.490> bubble

one of my favorite black Arachnia is but
it<00:05:03.490> is<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:03.640> good<00:05:03.730> i<00:05:03.910> do<00:05:04.090> like<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.390> alt<00:05:04.660> mode<00:05:04.900> is<00:05:05.230> i

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
it is a good i do like the alt mode is i

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.260 
it is a good i do like the alt mode is i
think<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.830> highlight<00:05:06.010> of<00:05:06.190> this<00:05:06.400> figure<00:05:06.840> and<00:05:08.250> i

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270
