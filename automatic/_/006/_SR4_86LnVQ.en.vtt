00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello everybody is that the law reads alright 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.540
 in this video you will see how to do the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.849
 his own scorer 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.430
 the first material to dare 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.740
 It's going to be a toothpick that's very 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.140
 good to use in place of scorer 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.779
 You can make balls well. 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.970
 small or depending on how much 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.699
 you press or depending on how much 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.480
 enamel accumulate on the tip of the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.250
 tooth 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:40.710
 Can you make bigger balls? 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:42.930
 It's also the second one I'm going to show. 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.450
 For you, it 's a stick to stick a toothpick. 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.730
 of simple nails that works more or 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.890
 less like a toothpick 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.260
 You can make balls from 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.260
 little to medium 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:20.420
 Here I am going to use a pen cap. 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:23.450
 bic to make big balls and here 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.880
 I'm going to use that other pen pen that 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.479
 You do not use more staff, it's a great 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:37.820
 tip for you to make polka dots 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:40.190
 averages a lot of dollars this tip here and I 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.270
 I have the back of it. You can use it. 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.220
 to make a big ball 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.320
 other material is also very good for 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.710
 make small balls of small to 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.530
 Averages is a mechanical pencil too. 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.200
 sure is to Crow and another 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.830
 tip to make big balls is that the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.960
 back of a squeeze pen. 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.929
 now finally I will make it for you 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.239
 some balls with my scorers 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:15.170
 My goalscorers I bought here in 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.500
 United States by amazon site but 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.690
 I believe that here in Brazil already have in 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.700
 perfumeries in beauty catalogs 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.100
 I do not believe it's so hard to 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.920
 find out if this tool is the 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.290
 scorer tells you what the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.989
 difference does not give you personal because it 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.880
 very perfect and those materials that 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.330
 people used are materials that you have 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.080
 materials that are easy to find 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.780
 My favorites are the toothpick 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.560
 and the nail stick that I think are the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.660
 best for you replaces the scorer 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.580
 so this is personal if you like 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.890
 do not forget to give a 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.690
 young man had and subscribe to channel I 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.690
 I'll see you in the next video a super kiss
