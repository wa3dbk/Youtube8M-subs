 become the official supplier of all 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.289
 greedy the internship design 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.960
 was based on the rationalization of 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.070
 work whether in pastries and 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.199
 finally the pastries 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.730
 let's say that I revisited the beautiful stock 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.279
 of bostock what is it 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.960
 unsold brioche on which we are going 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.450
 work carefully with rum syrup 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.350
 either kirsch syrup and we will add 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.900
 an almond cream 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.180
 we worked different fillings of 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.149
 flavored crème brûlée for example 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.820
 ichi coffee I like partner and the 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.390
 soft texture and also the crunchy 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.620
 the trac years so we had for example 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.699
 a creme brulee with a crumble 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.920
 speculoos we had a crème brûlée with 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.120
 a gelled palate we had different 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.039
 textures with caramelized almonds 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.320
 we also worked shoulder 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.350
 and fruit so everything at a range of 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.700
 different fillings with brioche or 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.040
 croissant dough puff pastry 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.550
 of course robert for a better 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.550
 taste quality 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.570
 compared to pines so we worked 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.340
 French tradition bread 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.050
 we also worked the door of 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.730
 Saint-Cloud Waves Over Hard Wine 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.680
 also sourdough bread hard on 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.590
 which was we worked forms a 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.880
 little specific with stencils so at 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.230
 visual level we have something that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.130
 attracts the eye that makes you want to 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.960
 savor 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.760
 we will play with poppy will play that 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.460
 flour can we want flour and so 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.010
 wheat flour but possibly flour 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.950
 rye to bring a little side 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.570
 rustic on the Sebastian product 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.260
 knight an expert in breads and 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.420
 pastries 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.750
 but not only sébastien chevallier 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.640
 someone who is very open-minded 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.170
 professionals already firstly set 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.509
 share the side we'll say but a worker 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.700
 de France but also someone very 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.979
 friendly and who give without counting 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.509
 then obviously compared to the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.280
 product diversity as much desire 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.710
 noizet clan bakery and let's say 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.600
 productions at 6 but revisited which 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.670
 allows today to advance to the point of 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.890
 view 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.569
 we will say commercial of the bakery 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.050
 because it's good to make good 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.250
 products 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.020
 it's good to be technically good 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.000
 but you have to know how to sell them 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.590
 more of these basins 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.420
 that he really brings insulted road or 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.430
 both technical and commercial so 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.440
 visually the crbee we will say in 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.239
 shop we want to eat everything from 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.069
 following the level of very good taste 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.770
 atmosphere was really great sent 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.730
 and that allowed us to get out a table 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.190
 really very stupid 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.110
 a friendly internship so where everyone could 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.350
 deepen or revisit one's own 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.350
 knowledge
