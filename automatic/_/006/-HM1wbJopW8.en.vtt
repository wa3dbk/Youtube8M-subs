00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
you so if you take that particular verse

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.350 
you so if you take that particular verse
and<00:00:29.710> you<00:00:30.190> look<00:00:30.400> at<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.670> difference<00:00:31.060> of<00:00:31.180> that

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
and you look at the difference of that

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.170 
and you look at the difference of that
punctuation<00:00:31.930> makes<00:00:32.290> you'll<00:00:32.920> see<00:00:33.190> that<00:00:33.550> gun<00:00:33.850> is

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
punctuation makes you'll see that gun is

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.650 
punctuation makes you'll see that gun is
actually<00:00:34.750> making<00:00:35.020> a<00:00:35.230> statement<00:00:35.500> about<00:00:35.800> death

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
actually making a statement about death

actually making a statement about death
so<00:00:37.710> one<00:00:38.710> of<00:00:38.740> the<00:00:38.950> translations<00:00:39.670> for<00:00:39.880> example

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
so one of the translations for example

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.590 
so one of the translations for example
will<00:00:40.600> have<00:00:40.840> death<00:00:41.320> capitalized<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:43.329> of<00:00:43.450> them

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
will have death capitalized one of them

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.280 
will have death capitalized one of them
will<00:00:43.780> have<00:00:44.020> death<00:00:44.470> not<00:00:45.250> capitalized<00:00:46.030> or<00:00:46.450> John

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
will have death not capitalized or John

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.979 
will have death not capitalized or John
Donne<00:00:47.620> will<00:00:47.890> have<00:00:48.130> a<00:00:48.579> semicolon<00:00:49.270> where

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
Donne will have a semicolon where

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.700 
Donne will have a semicolon where
there's<00:00:50.290> comma<00:00:51.220> in<00:00:51.730> another<00:00:52.630> translation<00:00:53.110> so

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
there's comma in another translation so

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.440 
there's comma in another translation so
the<00:00:54.190> phrase<00:00:54.489> that<00:00:54.700> I<00:00:54.820> really<00:00:55.120> want<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:55.390> to
