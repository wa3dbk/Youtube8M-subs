it's<00:03:23.040> probably<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.400> one<00:03:23.490> after<00:03:23.700> now<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:29.040> my

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
it's probably the one after now so my

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.800 
it's probably the one after now so my
budget<00:03:29.430> went<00:03:29.730> down<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.120> actually<00:03:30.300> released

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
budget went down so I actually released

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.780 
budget went down so I actually released
some<00:03:30.990> players<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:34.470> going<00:03:34.920> for<00:03:35.100> them<00:03:35.250> this

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790
