00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
cookie cutter in here we're going to use

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.079 
cookie cutter in here we're going to use
this<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:11.389> help<00:00:12.469> hold<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.620> shape<00:00:14.070> while<00:00:14.820> we're

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
this to help hold the shape while we're

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.480 
this to help hold the shape while we're
grouting<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.410> want<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.710> just<00:00:16.859> tape<00:00:17.220> that

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
grouting and you want to just tape that

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.900 
grouting and you want to just tape that
in<00:00:17.789> with<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> little<00:00:18.690> masking<00:00:19.260> tape<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.910> the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
in with a little masking tape and the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.019 
in with a little masking tape and the
cookie<00:00:21.300> cutter<00:00:21.539> will<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> shield<00:00:23.160> for

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
cookie cutter will be like a shield for

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.929 
cookie cutter will be like a shield for
the<00:00:24.090> grout<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:25.410> little<00:00:25.980> space<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.670> nicely

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
the grout and a little space it nicely

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.509 
the grout and a little space it nicely
and<00:00:27.269> evenly<00:00:27.570> all<00:00:28.019> around<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.949> we'll<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.099> tape

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
and evenly all around so we'll just tape

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.030 
and evenly all around so we'll just tape
that<00:00:29.699> all<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> way<00:00:30.300> around<00:00:30.679> with<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> little

bit of masking tape and then you want to

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.510 
bit of masking tape and then you want to
check<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.140> position<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.149> see<00:00:39.149> if<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.520> in

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
check the position and see if it's in

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.090 
check the position and see if it's in
the<00:00:42.030> right<00:00:42.210> place<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.379> want<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.920> that

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.580 

and<00:01:19.170> we're<00:01:19.650> trying<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> get<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.280> consistency<00:01:21.210> of

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
and we're trying to get a consistency of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
consistency and add a little bit of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.950 
consistency and add a little bit of
water<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> time<00:01:28.970> because<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.479> add<00:01:30.659> too

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
water at a time because you can add too

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.560 
water at a time because you can add too
much<00:01:31.140> water<00:01:31.520> easily<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.210> end<00:01:33.360> up

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570

color into it until you're happy with

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.770 
color into it until you're happy with
the<00:02:16.710> shade<00:02:16.980> now<00:02:17.220> when<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.790> dries<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.180> usually

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
the shade now when it dries it usually

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.230 
the shade now when it dries it usually
dries<00:02:19.020> lighter<00:02:19.800> than<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.760> color<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.180> you

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
dries lighter than the color that you

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.900 
dries lighter than the color that you
see<00:02:21.330> when<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:21.900> wet<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:23.220> keep<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.550> in<00:02:23.760> mind

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
see when it's wet so keep that in mind

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.330 
see when it's wet so keep that in mind
when<00:02:24.480> you're<00:02:24.660> doing<00:02:25.260> your<00:02:25.290> color<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:26.040> also<00:02:26.190> a

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
when you're doing your color it's also a

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.900 
when you're doing your color it's also a
good<00:02:26.550> idea<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:28.620> try<00:02:29.070> out<00:02:29.459> when<00:02:29.790> you're
