but what he has left it's just a movie

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.970 
but what he has left it's just a movie
that<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.359> a<00:03:43.630> little<00:03:43.989> slow<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.470> not<00:03:44.650> as<00:03:44.769> funny

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
that is a little slow and not as funny

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.560 
that is a little slow and not as funny
as<00:03:45.070> you<00:03:45.250> would<00:03:45.340> expect<00:03:45.430> certainly<00:03:46.209> from<00:03:46.390> South

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
maybe the romance in the movie is

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.479 
maybe the romance in the movie is
supposed<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.750> fill<00:03:55.959> in<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.170> blanks<00:03:56.560> but<00:03:57.250> the

MacFarlane to like her and I felt kind

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.940 
MacFarlane to like her and I felt kind
of<00:04:04.720> bad<00:04:04.930> for<00:04:05.230> her<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.530> made<00:04:05.650> me<00:04:05.769> not<00:04:05.920> like

of bad for her and it made me not like
Seth<00:04:06.280> MacFarlane<00:04:06.820> as<00:04:06.970> much<00:04:07.150> uh<00:04:07.450> he<00:04:07.840> just

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
Seth MacFarlane as much uh he just

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.690 
Seth MacFarlane as much uh he just
seemed<00:04:08.200> like<00:04:08.290> not<00:04:08.620> as<00:04:08.769> nice<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:08.980> carry<00:04:09.370> any<00:04:09.549> guy

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.009 
seemed like not as nice a carry any guy
I<00:04:09.730> think<00:04:10.060> he's<00:04:10.150> he<00:04:10.239> wanted<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.570> come<00:04:10.720> across

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
and I think for a romance to work you

and I think for a romance to work you
have<00:04:12.820> to<00:04:12.850> be<00:04:12.970> rooting<00:04:13.359> for<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.810> at<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.049> end

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
have to be rooting for it and at the end

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.900 
have to be rooting for it and at the end
of<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.380> day<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.739> thought<00:04:15.130> they<00:04:15.340> both<00:04:15.519> could<00:04:15.820> do

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
better and at the very least they didn't

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.650 
better and at the very least they didn't
actually<00:04:17.530> like<00:04:17.859> each<00:04:17.979> other<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.220> much<00:04:18.660> and

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
Seyfried but the real standouts were

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.610

Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman they

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.620 
Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman they
were<00:04:31.710> phenomenal<00:04:32.220> they<00:04:32.970> did<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.240> best<00:04:33.420> with

were phenomenal they did the best with

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.970 
were phenomenal they did the best with
their<00:04:33.810> material<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.470> think<00:04:34.620> they<00:04:34.680> had<00:04:34.830> some

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
their material and I think they had some

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.980 
their material and I think they had some
of<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.160> best<00:04:35.310> jokes<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:36.540> almost<00:04:36.720> would

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
of the best jokes and I almost would

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.330 
of the best jokes and I almost would
have<00:04:37.080> preferred<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.440> see<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.800> film<00:04:38.010> be<00:04:38.160> about

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
have preferred to see the film be about

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.890 
have preferred to see the film be about
them<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:38.940> thought<00:04:39.300> their<00:04:39.480> characters<00:04:39.870> were

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
them I thought their characters were

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.660 
them I thought their characters were
much<00:04:40.140> more<00:04:40.320> interesting<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.010> unique<00:04:41.160> and

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
much more interesting and unique and

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.430 
much more interesting and unique and
they<00:04:41.880> weren't<00:04:42.120> bogged<00:04:42.360> down<00:04:42.540> by<00:04:42.870> this<00:04:42.930> romance

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
they weren't bogged down by this romance

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.100 
they weren't bogged down by this romance
as<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:43.770> said<00:04:44.010> just<00:04:44.460> didn't<00:04:45.030> work<00:04:45.300> although

as I said just didn't work although
somebody<00:04:46.470> who<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.650> didn't<00:04:46.920> like<00:04:47.070> in<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.310> film

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
somebody who I didn't like in the film

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.920 
somebody who I didn't like in the film

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.400

disturbing<00:04:51.390> like<00:04:51.570> he<00:04:51.690> has<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.810> force<00:04:52.170> himself

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
I know actors are supposed to have range

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.160 
I know actors are supposed to have range
but<00:04:59.520> it's<00:04:59.640> like<00:04:59.790> seeing<00:05:00.030> Jimmy<00:05:00.600> Stewart<00:05:00.960> try

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
but it's like seeing Jimmy Stewart try

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.450 
but it's like seeing Jimmy Stewart try
and<00:05:01.290> rape<00:05:01.440> somebody<00:05:01.710> you're<00:05:02.040> just<00:05:02.220> kind<00:05:02.400> of

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
and rape somebody you're just kind of

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.540 
and rape somebody you're just kind of
like<00:05:02.690> what<00:05:03.690> Liam<00:05:04.470> Neeson<00:05:04.860> would<00:05:05.100> never<00:05:05.310> do

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
like what Liam Neeson would never do

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.750 
like what Liam Neeson would never do
that<00:05:05.700> under<00:05:05.850> any<00:05:06.060> circumstances<00:05:06.870> I'm<00:05:07.110> sad<00:05:07.760> so

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.760 
that under any circumstances I'm sad so
I<00:05:09.030> think<00:05:09.150> casting<00:05:09.630> him<00:05:09.720> in<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:09.960> role<00:05:10.080> didn't

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
I think casting him in that role didn't

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.910 
I think casting him in that role didn't
work<00:05:11.130> um<00:05:11.970> let's<00:05:12.540> see<00:05:12.720> that<00:05:13.290> okay<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:13.680> that's

that's<00:05:14.100> my<00:05:14.280> thoughts<00:05:14.490> on<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:14.760> film<00:05:14.880> I<00:05:15.150> think

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
that's my thoughts on the film I think

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.540 
that's my thoughts on the film I think
if<00:05:15.630> you're<00:05:15.750> a<00:05:15.810> MacFarlane<00:05:16.620> fan<00:05:16.920> you

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
if you're a MacFarlane fan you

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.160 
if you're a MacFarlane fan you
definitely<00:05:18.060> want<00:05:18.270> to<00:05:18.360> see<00:05:18.540> it<00:05:18.630> at<00:05:18.720> some<00:05:18.750> point

this<00:05:49.080> is<00:05:49.230> something<00:05:49.410> you<00:05:49.500> could<00:05:49.590> watch<00:05:49.740> in

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
this is something you could watch in

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.190 
this is something you could watch in
pieces<00:05:50.790> because<00:05:51.180> you<00:05:51.750> don't<00:05:51.870> have<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.050> watch
