know you have peppermints all over the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.370 
know you have peppermints all over the
place<00:04:44.750> especially<00:04:44.870> in<00:04:45.170> things<00:04:45.260> like

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
place especially in things like

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.370 
place especially in things like
toothpaste<00:04:46.010> and<00:04:46.220> chewing<00:04:46.490> gum<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.990> you<00:04:48.260> mean

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
toothpaste and chewing gum that you mean

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.360 
toothpaste and chewing gum that you mean
you<00:04:48.470> probably<00:04:48.680> don't<00:04:48.830> even<00:04:48.980> think<00:04:49.160> about<00:04:49.220> it

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
you probably don't even think about it

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.150 
you probably don't even think about it
but<00:04:49.820> it's<00:04:50.000> very<00:04:50.360> strong<00:04:50.870> most<00:04:51.590> places<00:04:51.740> this<00:04:52.010> is

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
but it's very strong most places this is

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160 
but it's very strong most places this is
just<00:04:52.430> this<00:04:52.910> is<00:04:53.120> kind<00:04:53.420> of<00:04:53.510> subtle<00:04:53.720> although<00:04:54.080> it

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
just this is kind of subtle although it
