 ways the open world game 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.170
 The game world is wonderful 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.170
 gigantic and varied 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.740
 a satirical and immense version of 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.070
 modern south california 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.400
 with seas and mountains luxury shops and 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.980
 shopping centers urban decadence and 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.450
 virgin nature beaches and areas 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.790
 isolated the sublime and the ridiculous 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.970
 greed and hypocrisy 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.320
 what will be careful explain tuyÃº white 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.320
 edition of war 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.560
 for the first time the game does not have 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.720
 a single aspiring hero but with 3 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.670
 maikel in his day a successful robber of 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.820
 banks and today a not so successful father of 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.820
 family 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.570
 franklin a street hustler 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.570
 convinced to be surrounded by imbeciles 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.539
 and then this truce 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.539
 The less I say about him the better 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.700
 thanks to the three protagonists 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.130
 they remodel both the narration in a 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.740
 interlaced history as the structure 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.600
 of individual missions 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.570
 players can alternate between 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.649
 perspectives and move on from an instant 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.649
 dizzying to another 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.640
 and he knew 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.560
 this allows missions to acquire 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.560
 new levels of diversity and intensity 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.900
 outside of a mission the use of three 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.830
 protagonists also allows adding a 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.110
 touch of voyeurism since you can 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.209
 find out when you want in 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.209
 that your new friends have been involved 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.440
 the world is not only huge but it is 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.780
 full of things to see and do 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.920
 customize cars 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:43.240
 pilot aircraft buy clothes to do 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.780
 sport go in search of the nirvana to dive 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.870
 in the ocean watching animals hunt and 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.640

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.720

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.550
 time and good gwynn jr holden and ching 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.340
 There has also been a lot of emphasis on 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.200
 game mechanics for all their 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.920
 aspects are so fun and fluid 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.920
 as broad 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.590
 everything has already been conducted and shoot 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.280
 or tennis and riding a bike results 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.470
 fun and interactive 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.660
 however in addition to engaging in leisure 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.850
 people should also address their 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.130
 business for all your pretensions 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.130
 These men are dangerous thieves 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.040
 and to survive they have to plan 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.220
 and perform a series of blows each 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.620
 more audacious times 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.140
 are the players plan for themselves 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.950
 themselves and then decide how and with whom 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.950
 execute them 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.989
 of the loot you decide what to spend the 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.519
 money from sensible investments like 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.519
 tattoos and fast cars 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.210
 to risky projects like actions and 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.750
 properties in the saints 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.740
