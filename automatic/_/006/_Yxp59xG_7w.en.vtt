simply from this dot pattern they have
over<00:00:21.359> here<00:00:21.480> it's<00:00:21.660> very<00:00:21.840> subtle<00:00:22.170> yet<00:00:22.769> at<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
over here it's very subtle yet at the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.710 
over here it's very subtle yet at the
same<00:00:23.010> time<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.580> does<00:00:23.760> give<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> better<00:00:24.269> grip

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
same time it does give you a better grip

on<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> actual<00:00:25.410> iPad<00:00:25.680> case<00:00:25.920> itself<00:00:26.250> or<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.029> I

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
on the actual iPad case itself or so I

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.120 
on the actual iPad case itself or so I
feel<00:00:27.480> like<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.810> does<00:00:27.990> compared<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.590> holding<00:00:28.980> it

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
feel like it does compared to holding it

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.820 
feel like it does compared to holding it
on<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.580> side<00:00:29.849> now<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.630> see<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> very<00:00:31.500> subtle

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
on this side now you see a very subtle

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.479 
on this side now you see a very subtle
Belkin<00:00:32.610> logo<00:00:32.880> there<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.690> does<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
magnetized click there which is really

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.959 
magnetized click there which is really
nice<00:00:36.960> as<00:00:37.140> far<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.380> keeping<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.219> actual<00:00:38.579> iPad

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
nice as far as keeping the actual iPad

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.110 
nice as far as keeping the actual iPad
case<00:00:39.239> together<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.960> closed<00:00:40.950> now<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> back

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
here you do have more of that dot brain

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.240 
here you do have more of that dot brain
there<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.899> pattern<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.530> really<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.039> that

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
actually used to where you flip the case

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.660 
actually used to where you flip the case
over<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.140> simply<00:00:56.010> lock<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.460> in

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670

there for different viewing angles and
we'll<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:58.890> more<00:00:59.010> than<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.309> one's<00:00:59.489> actually

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
nice compared to have any hard plastic

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.669 
nice compared to have any hard plastic
frame<00:01:49.360> which<00:01:49.600> could<00:01:49.810> you<00:01:50.049> know<00:01:50.170> potentially

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
frame which could you know potentially

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.410 
frame which could you know potentially
scratch<00:01:50.829> the<00:01:51.070> iPad<00:01:51.369> now<00:01:52.030> I<00:01:52.060> don't<00:01:52.270> know<00:01:52.329> if

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
scratch the iPad now I don't know if

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.580 
scratch the iPad now I don't know if
you'll<00:01:52.509> be<00:01:52.630> able<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:52.840> tell<00:01:52.990> from<00:01:53.140> this<00:01:53.320> video

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
you'll be able to tell from this video

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.010 
you'll be able to tell from this video
but<00:01:54.280> these<00:01:54.579> grommets<00:01:54.909> is<00:01:55.360> actually<00:01:55.689> hold<00:01:55.929> the

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
but these grommets is actually hold the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.410 
but these grommets is actually hold the
iPad<00:01:56.200> in<00:01:56.500> place<00:01:56.740> are<00:01:57.039> very<00:01:57.100> nice<00:01:57.759> one<00:01:58.179> they're

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
iPad in place are very nice one they're

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.760 
iPad in place are very nice one they're
built<00:01:58.630> into<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:58.990> frame<00:01:59.200> itself<00:01:59.500> it's<00:01:59.709> not

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
built into the frame itself it's not

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.770 
built into the frame itself it's not
like<00:01:59.950> a<00:01:59.979> separate<00:02:00.399> piece<00:02:00.610> but<00:02:01.209> there<00:02:01.360> is<00:02:01.509> also

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
like a separate piece but there is also

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.929 
like a separate piece but there is also
a<00:02:01.990> very<00:02:02.470> deep<00:02:02.770> groove<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.310> actually<00:02:03.340> locks

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
a very deep groove that actually locks

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.179 
a very deep groove that actually locks
the<00:02:04.179> iPad<00:02:04.539> in<00:02:04.780> there's<00:02:05.350> an<00:02:05.500> edge<00:02:05.679> on<00:02:05.950> there

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
the iPad in there's an edge on there

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.859 
the iPad in there's an edge on there
unlike<00:02:06.700> most<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.209> them<00:02:07.330> that<00:02:07.450> have<00:02:07.569> a<00:02:07.600> very

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
unlike most of them that have a very

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.809 
unlike most of them that have a very
subtle<00:02:08.140> edge<00:02:08.350> this<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:08.619> actually<00:02:09.069> fairly<00:02:09.369> deep

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
subtle edge this is actually fairly deep

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.759 
subtle edge this is actually fairly deep
so<00:02:10.360> this<00:02:10.569> is<00:02:10.720> gonna<00:02:10.840> sit<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:11.200> top<00:02:11.349> you're<00:02:11.590> right

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
so this is gonna sit on top you're right

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.280 
so this is gonna sit on top you're right
but<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:12.849> my<00:02:12.970> opinion<00:02:13.120> that's<00:02:13.660> nice<00:02:13.959> when<00:02:14.230> you

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
but in my opinion that's nice when you

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.050 
but in my opinion that's nice when you
have<00:02:14.440> these<00:02:14.620> type<00:02:14.799> of<00:02:14.830> frames<00:02:15.220> now<00:02:15.670> we<00:02:15.790> make

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
have these type of frames now we make

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.970 
have these type of frames now we make
sure<00:02:16.269> your<00:02:16.450> iPad<00:02:16.810> itself<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.410> not<00:02:17.709> going<00:02:17.890> to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
sure your iPad itself is not going to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.320 
sure your iPad itself is not going to
fall<00:02:18.160> out<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.849> will<00:02:19.000> show<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.209> the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
fall out of that that will show you the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.440 
fall out of that that will show you the
inside<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.560> front<00:02:21.250> flap<00:02:21.580> it's<00:02:22.000> still<00:02:22.239> made

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
inside of the front flap it's still made

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.440 
inside of the front flap it's still made
of<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:22.690> very<00:02:22.989> soft<00:02:23.519> velvet<00:02:24.519> suede<00:02:24.670> material

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
of that very soft velvet suede material

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.479 
of that very soft velvet suede material
and<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.959> know<00:02:26.080> most<00:02:26.380> your<00:02:26.590> cases<00:02:27.010> actually

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
and you know most your cases actually

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.819 
and you know most your cases actually
have<00:02:27.690> indentions<00:02:28.690> or<00:02:28.840> grooves<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.470> hold<00:02:29.680> the

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
have indentions or grooves that hold the

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.280 
have indentions or grooves that hold the
iPad<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.340> place<00:02:30.820> when<00:02:31.660> you're<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:31.930> different

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
iPad in place when you're in different

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.900 
iPad in place when you're in different
landscape<00:02:32.650> modes<00:02:32.859> but<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.190> one<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.489> actually

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
landscape modes but this one is actually

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.720 
landscape modes but this one is actually
you<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:34.780> tell<00:02:34.930> there<00:02:35.200> it's<00:02:35.350> actually<00:02:35.730> flush

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
you can tell there it's actually flush

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.060 
you can tell there it's actually flush
across<00:02:37.180> there<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:38.410> they're<00:02:38.650> very<00:02:38.680> subtle

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
across there and they're very subtle

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.400 
across there and they're very subtle
lines<00:02:39.400> built<00:02:39.670> into<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.329> will<00:02:40.900> show<00:02:41.049> you<00:02:41.109> how

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
lines built into it I will show you how

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.110 
lines built into it I will show you how
well<00:02:41.739> that<00:02:41.890> works<00:02:42.220> once<00:02:42.579> we<00:02:42.700> actually<00:02:42.940> get<00:02:43.030> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
well that works once we actually get the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.150 
well that works once we actually get the
iPad<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:43.690> case<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:44.620> with<00:02:44.739> that<00:02:44.829> being<00:02:45.010> said

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
iPad in the case so with that being said

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.220 
iPad in the case so with that being said
let's<00:02:45.730> go<00:02:45.880> ahead<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.269> snap<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.900> as<00:02:47.079> you

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
let's go ahead and snap this in as you

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.319 
let's go ahead and snap this in as you
can<00:02:47.380> see<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:48.069> does<00:02:48.310> fall<00:02:48.579> back<00:02:48.850> like<00:02:48.880> that

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
can see it does fall back like that

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.590 
can see it does fall back like that
let's<00:02:49.870> go<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.170> get<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.410> iPad<00:02:50.890> into<00:02:51.130> place

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
let's go and get this iPad into place

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.809 
let's go and get this iPad into place
again<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.959> start<00:02:53.260> off<00:02:53.380> one<00:02:53.620> side<00:02:53.920> usually<00:02:54.670> the

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
again you start off one side usually the

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.860 
again you start off one side usually the
rocker<00:02:55.090> switch<00:02:55.420> side<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.590> simply<00:02:56.859> snap

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
rocker switch side and you simply snap

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.990 
rocker switch side and you simply snap
it<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:58.959> place

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
it in place

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.699 
it in place
fortunately<00:03:01.000> with<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:01.420> case<00:03:01.750> it's<00:03:02.290> not<00:03:02.530> one

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
fortunately with this case it's not one

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.349 
fortunately with this case it's not one
of<00:03:02.739> those<00:03:02.859> deals<00:03:03.160> where<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.819> can<00:03:04.090> literally

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
of those deals where you can literally

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.630 
of those deals where you can literally
just<00:03:04.510> snap<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.079> in<00:03:05.170> place<00:03:05.410> it's<00:03:05.680> actually

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
just snap it in place it's actually

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.559 
just snap it in place it's actually
difficult<00:03:08.040> obviously<00:03:09.040> put<00:03:09.340> my<00:03:09.460> iPad<00:03:09.819> in<00:03:10.180> there

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
difficult obviously put my iPad in there

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.780 
difficult obviously put my iPad in there
upside-down<00:03:10.900> but<00:03:11.260> that's<00:03:11.500> okay<00:03:11.890> but<00:03:12.670> they

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
upside-down but that's okay but they

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.490 
upside-down but that's okay but they
will<00:03:12.970> just<00:03:13.120> snap<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.569> place<00:03:13.810> there<00:03:14.110> okay<00:03:14.380> I'm

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
will just snap in place there okay I'm

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.680 
will just snap in place there okay I'm
go<00:03:14.590> ahead<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:14.890> put<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.100> iPad<00:03:15.459> in<00:03:15.700> there<00:03:15.910> just

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
go ahead and put the iPad in there just

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.780 
go ahead and put the iPad in there just
to<00:03:16.780> show<00:03:16.930> you<00:03:16.990> it's<00:03:17.170> already<00:03:17.410> in<00:03:17.530> there<00:03:17.740> so<00:03:17.980> we

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
to show you it's already in there so we

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.830 
to show you it's already in there so we
got<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.209> turn<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.510> show<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.720> those

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
got that in turn and show you those

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.750 
got that in turn and show you those
different<00:03:20.260> viewing<00:03:20.500> angles<00:03:20.950> what<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.520> do<00:03:21.640> is

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
different viewing angles what you do is

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.810 
different viewing angles what you do is
simply<00:03:21.910> fold<00:03:22.240> the<00:03:22.390> case<00:03:22.569> back<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.580> just

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
simply fold the case back and you just

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.590 
simply fold the case back and you just
literally<00:03:25.350> put<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.530> place<00:03:26.709> like<00:03:26.920> that

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
literally put it in place like that

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.820 
literally put it in place like that
it's<00:03:28.600> got<00:03:28.750> pretty<00:03:28.900> good<00:03:29.020> stability<00:03:29.380> right

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
it's got pretty good stability right

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.310 
it's got pretty good stability right
there<00:03:30.040> it's<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:30.970> good<00:03:31.120> viewing<00:03:31.360> angle<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.020> next

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
there it's a good viewing angle the next

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.470 
there it's a good viewing angle the next
one<00:03:32.730> same<00:03:33.730> thing<00:03:35.790> it's<00:03:36.790> got<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:36.970> lot<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.150> variety

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
one same thing it's got a lot of variety

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.250 
one same thing it's got a lot of variety
you<00:03:37.810> know<00:03:37.930> it's<00:03:38.080> got<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:40.290> total<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:42.810> five<00:03:43.810> spots

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
you know it's got a total of five spots

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.790 
you know it's got a total of five spots
where<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.530> can<00:03:44.650> actually<00:03:44.800> do<00:03:45.130> this<00:03:46.530> last<00:03:47.530> one

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
where you can actually do this last one

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.770 
where you can actually do this last one
which<00:03:48.459> I<00:03:48.610> guess<00:03:48.790> would<00:03:48.940> be<00:03:48.970> your<00:03:49.150> typing<00:03:49.480> angle

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
which I guess would be your typing angle

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.750 
which I guess would be your typing angle
is<00:03:49.870> not<00:03:50.050> very<00:03:50.380> good<00:03:50.650> as<00:03:51.070> you<00:03:51.250> can<00:03:51.370> see<00:03:51.489> it's<00:03:51.640> not

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
is not very good as you can see it's not

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.850 
is not very good as you can see it's not
very<00:03:51.820> stable<00:03:52.300> I<00:03:52.690> guess<00:03:53.019> if<00:03:53.200> you<00:03:53.320> actually<00:03:53.470> left

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
very stable I guess if you actually left

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.640 
very stable I guess if you actually left
it<00:03:54.070> alone<00:03:54.250> there<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:55.390> might<00:03:55.570> be<00:03:55.690> all<00:03:55.810> right<00:03:56.019> but

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
it alone there it might be all right but

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.509 
it alone there it might be all right but
it's<00:03:56.800> gonna<00:03:56.920> do<00:03:57.100> that<00:03:57.220> all<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.400> time

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
it's gonna do that all the time

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.390 
it's gonna do that all the time
unfortunately<00:03:58.390> most<00:03:59.200> of<00:03:59.560> your<00:03:59.769> cases<00:04:00.220> like

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
unfortunately most of your cases like

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.850 
unfortunately most of your cases like
this<00:04:00.730> or<00:04:01.000> doing<00:04:01.810> this<00:04:02.019> on<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:02.440> market<00:04:02.620> that

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
this or doing this on the market that

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.400 
this or doing this on the market that
I've<00:04:03.010> seen<00:04:03.220> at<00:04:03.400> least<00:04:03.580> so<00:04:04.269> again<00:04:04.750> not<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.200> big

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
I've seen at least so again not a big

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.040 
I've seen at least so again not a big
deal<00:04:05.650> but<00:04:06.160> if<00:04:06.370> you<00:04:06.550> want<00:04:06.790> another<00:04:07.510> typing

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
deal but if you want another typing

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.030 
deal but if you want another typing
angle<00:04:08.320> you<00:04:08.890> can<00:04:09.070> lock<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.459> in<00:04:09.580> back<00:04:09.790> here<00:04:10.180> and

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
angle you can lock it in back here and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.340 
angle you can lock it in back here and
simply<00:04:12.040> do<00:04:12.160> that<00:04:12.480> fold<00:04:13.480> this<00:04:13.630> little<00:04:13.930> tab<00:04:14.140> up

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
simply do that fold this little tab up

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.990 
simply do that fold this little tab up
underneath<00:04:14.739> there<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.250> you<00:04:16.239> have<00:04:16.560> an<00:04:17.560> iPad

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.700 

much<00:04:22.000> like<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.300> would<00:04:22.419> get<00:04:22.600> with<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.410> Smart

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710

or<00:04:24.250> any<00:04:24.580> other<00:04:24.820> case<00:04:25.150> for<00:04:25.419> that<00:04:25.540> matter<00:04:27.150> yeah

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
or any other case for that matter yeah

you<00:04:28.479> don't<00:04:28.600> really<00:04:28.720> want<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.110> do<00:04:29.169> that

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.330 

I<00:04:34.319> sleep<00:04:35.319> and<00:04:35.530> wait<00:04:35.650> function

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
I sleep and wait function

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.820 
I sleep and wait function
I<00:04:36.509> actually<00:04:37.509> don't<00:04:37.840> think<00:04:37.960> I<00:04:38.199> have<00:04:38.379> this<00:04:38.560> turn

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
I actually don't think I have this turn

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.909 
I actually don't think I have this turn
on<00:04:39.009> this<00:04:39.250> iPad<00:04:39.699> I<00:04:39.729> have<00:04:39.910> it<00:04:40.120> on<00:04:40.240> my<00:04:40.330> other<00:04:40.360> iPad

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
on this iPad I have it on my other iPad

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.619 
on this iPad I have it on my other iPad
but<00:04:42.750> it<00:04:43.750> does<00:04:44.050> work<00:04:44.319> I<00:04:44.560> did<00:04:44.770> test<00:04:45.039> it<00:04:45.190> out<00:04:45.280> on<00:04:45.759> my

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
but it does work I did test it out on my

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.409 
but it does work I did test it out on my
iPad<00:04:47.289> so<00:04:47.740> that<00:04:48.009> is<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.310> function<00:04:48.729> that<00:04:48.970> does

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
iPad so that is a function that does

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.290 
iPad so that is a function that does
work<00:04:49.780> properly<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.669> probably<00:04:52.000> would<00:04:52.150> help

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
work properly and a probably would help

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.960 
work properly and a probably would help
if<00:04:52.479> I<00:04:52.569> had<00:04:52.680> on<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.800> right<00:04:54.009> side<00:04:54.340> but

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
if I had on the right side but
