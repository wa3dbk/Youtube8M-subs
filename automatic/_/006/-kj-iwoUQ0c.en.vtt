and how I made it better is I made it
one<00:00:10.230> apart<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:10.800> now<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:11.010> has<00:00:11.130> blocks<00:00:11.519> in

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
one apart so now it has blocks in

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.810 
one apart so now it has blocks in
between<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.160> items<00:00:14.549> don't

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
between so that the that the items don't

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.390 
between so that the that the items don't
fall<00:00:15.000> over<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> other<00:00:15.630> ones<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.400> that's

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
fall over to the other ones and that's

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.250 
fall over to the other ones and that's

would work like this and you would have

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.650 
would work like this and you would have
a<00:00:29.910> fully<00:00:30.210> loaded<00:00:31.910> dispenser<00:00:32.910> over<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.329> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
do that unless you're mentally

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090 
do that unless you're mentally
challenged<00:00:42.440> when<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.770> change<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
have to wait five minutes before you can

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.549 
have to wait five minutes before you can
try<00:01:02.430> again<00:01:02.730> which<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.899> security<00:01:04.320> measure

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
try again which is a security measure

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.960 
try again which is a security measure
which<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.430> intended<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.360> shut<00:01:06.900> up<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
which was intended so shut up and if you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.520 
which was intended so shut up and if you
put<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> wrong<00:01:09.420> password<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.409> example

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
put the wrong password in for example

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.270 
put the wrong password in for example
this<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.830> then<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.070> will<00:01:14.159> also

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
this this and this then you will also

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.710 
this this and this then you will also
have<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> wait<00:01:14.610> five<00:01:14.880> minutes<00:01:15.090> before<00:01:15.360> those

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
have to wait five minutes before those

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.020 
have to wait five minutes before those
items<00:01:15.930> despawn<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.799> try<00:01:16.979> again<00:01:17.250> so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
items despawn and you can try again so

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.920 
items despawn and you can try again so
yeah<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> think<00:01:18.810> that's<00:01:19.080> all<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.930> I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
yeah I think that's all for this and I

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.719 
yeah I think that's all for this and I
tutorial<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:22.950> not<00:01:23.070> needed<00:01:23.280> i<00:01:23.460> mean<00:01:23.580> it's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
tutorial it's not needed i mean it's

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.440 
tutorial it's not needed i mean it's
pretty<00:01:24.240> basic<00:01:25.280> I'll<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.520> kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:26.970> over<00:01:27.180> over

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
pretty basic I'll just kind of over over

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.289 
pretty basic I'll just kind of over over
and<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> guys<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:28.020> pause<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:29.060> just<00:01:30.060> make

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and you guys can pause it and just make

and you guys can pause it and just make
it<00:01:30.680> so<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.130> motor<00:01:32.340> stable<00:01:32.729> circuit

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it so this is a motor stable circuit

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.640 
it so this is a motor stable circuit
over<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:35.720> okay<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.810> that's<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.380> all
