this<00:00:08.389> big<00:00:08.679> 300-pound<00:00:09.679> guy<00:00:09.969> had<00:00:10.969> the<00:00:11.119> ball<00:00:11.299> and

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:11.539 
this big 300-pound guy had the ball and

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.230 
this big 300-pound guy had the ball and
came<00:00:12.169> running

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
came running

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.279 
came running
at<00:00:13.330> me<00:00:13.510> anyone<00:00:14.320> horribly<00:00:14.679> wrong<00:00:14.920> I

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
at me anyone horribly wrong I

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.400 
at me anyone horribly wrong I
immediately<00:00:17.289> realized<00:00:17.860> well<00:00:18.689> III<00:00:19.689> haven't

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
immediately realized well III haven't

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.750 
immediately realized well III haven't
broken<00:00:20.710> face<00:00:20.980> because<00:00:21.279> my<00:00:21.310> jaw<00:00:21.640> was<00:00:21.880> over<00:00:22.509> here

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.519 

it<00:00:28.760> was<00:00:29.030> so<00:00:29.330> serious<00:00:29.779> they<00:00:30.230> didn't<00:00:30.470> know

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
it was so serious they didn't know

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:41.240 
it was so serious they didn't know
whether<00:00:30.740> an<00:00:31.010> der<00:00:31.130> would<00:00:31.340> survive<00:00:31.760> the<00:00:32.180> stroke

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.459 

well<00:00:42.250> we<00:00:42.489> were<00:00:42.579> fearful<00:00:42.879> that<00:00:43.510> we<00:00:43.840> might<00:00:44.110> never

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
well we were fearful that we might never

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.139 
well we were fearful that we might never
hear<00:00:44.769> our<00:00:44.920> son's<00:00:45.160> voice<00:00:45.280> again<00:00:45.820> or<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:46.030> he

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
hear our son's voice again or that he

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.970 
hear our son's voice again or that he
might<00:00:46.360> not<00:00:46.510> ever<00:00:46.660> be<00:00:46.780> able<00:00:46.989> to<00:00:47.079> walk<00:00:47.289> again<00:00:47.530> or

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
might not ever be able to walk again or

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.600 
might not ever be able to walk again or
use<00:00:48.219> his<00:00:49.120> hand<00:00:49.690> or<00:00:49.930> arm<00:00:50.110> if<00:00:51.039> somebody<00:00:51.430> has<00:00:51.579> a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
use his hand or arm if somebody has a

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.270 
use his hand or arm if somebody has a
high-level<00:00:52.030> stroke<00:00:52.750> injury<00:00:53.219> probability<00:00:54.219> of

high-level stroke injury probability of

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.819 
high-level stroke injury probability of
improvement<00:00:54.850> is<00:00:55.059> less<00:00:55.360> than<00:00:55.540> ten<00:00:55.719> percent<00:00:56.110> his

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
improvement is less than ten percent his

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.149 
improvement is less than ten percent his

recovery<00:01:00.879> if<00:01:01.449> Angela<00:01:01.989> joy<00:01:02.170> rehab<00:01:02.649> 10-15<00:01:03.579> years

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
recovery if Angela joy rehab 10-15 years

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.899 
recovery if Angela joy rehab 10-15 years
ago<00:01:04.560> expectation<00:01:05.560> would<00:01:05.740> be<00:01:05.799> that<00:01:05.979> most

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
ago expectation would be that most

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.969 
ago expectation would be that most
likely<00:01:07.090> his<00:01:07.509> arm<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:08.049> hand<00:01:08.289> function<00:01:08.500> will<00:01:08.799> not

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
likely his arm a hand function will not

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.010 
likely his arm a hand function will not
improve

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.120 

you

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.830 

so<00:01:22.130> first<00:01:22.310> we<00:01:22.460> are<00:01:22.520> doing<00:01:22.700> this<00:01:22.970> knowledge<00:01:23.390> and

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
so first we are doing this knowledge and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.090 
so first we are doing this knowledge and
again<00:01:24.079> let<00:01:24.229> me<00:01:24.350> know<00:01:24.439> when<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:24.649> first<00:01:24.799> start

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
again let me know when you first start

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.210 
again let me know when you first start
feeling<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:27.100> ready<00:01:28.100> yeah<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:30.740> basically

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
feeling that ready yeah a so basically

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.130 
feeling that ready yeah a so basically
with<00:01:31.369> function<00:01:31.789> electrical<00:01:32.240> stimulation<00:01:32.720> we

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
with function electrical stimulation we

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.039 
with function electrical stimulation we
are<00:01:33.229> retraining<00:01:33.979> function<00:01:34.640> one<00:01:35.390> component<00:01:35.780> of

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
are retraining function one component of

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.020 
are retraining function one component of
the<00:01:36.170> signal<00:01:36.590> goes<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.070> muscle<00:01:37.520> but<00:01:37.789> at<00:01:37.939> the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
the signal goes to the muscle but at the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.910 
the signal goes to the muscle but at the
same<00:01:38.240> time<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:38.630> are<00:01:38.720> also<00:01:38.899> sending<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.679> signal

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
same time we are also sending a signal

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.679 
same time we are also sending a signal
to<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.369> brain<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.939> movement<00:01:41.509> that's

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
to the brain of the movement that's

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.410 
to the brain of the movement that's
being<00:01:41.929> executed<00:01:42.759> they<00:01:43.759> were<00:01:43.850> saying<00:01:44.119> that<00:01:44.270> it

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
being executed they were saying that it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.080 
being executed they were saying that it
would<00:01:44.720> train<00:01:45.049> muscle<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.770> aim<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.670> my<00:01:46.850> brain

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
would train muscle and aim of my brain

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.730 
would train muscle and aim of my brain
would<00:01:47.270> obviously<00:01:47.659> connect<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.500> pathway

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
would obviously connect that pathway

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.190 
would obviously connect that pathway
within<00:01:49.640> modest<00:01:50.090> we<00:01:50.240> could<00:01:50.420> see<00:01:50.600> improvement

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
within modest we could see improvement

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.510 
within modest we could see improvement
very<00:01:52.270> encouraging<00:01:53.270> like<00:01:53.569> like<00:01:53.840> Mesa<00:01:54.170> hope<00:01:54.520> now

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
very encouraging like like Mesa hope now

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.430 
very encouraging like like Mesa hope now
with<00:01:55.850> technology<00:01:56.810> that<00:01:56.959> we<00:01:57.080> have<00:01:57.259> developed

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
with technology that we have developed

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.919 
with technology that we have developed
actually<00:01:58.369> all<00:01:58.520> these<00:01:58.789> patients<00:01:59.330> have<00:01:59.479> a

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
actually all these patients have a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.990 
actually all these patients have a
chance<00:02:00.289> of<00:02:00.470> improvement<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:01.340> creates<00:02:01.880> a

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
chance of improvement it creates a

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.880 
chance of improvement it creates a
transformational<00:02:02.780> change<00:02:03.080> you<00:02:03.679> have<00:02:03.860> a

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
transformational change you have a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.180 
transformational change you have a
patient<00:02:04.130> who<00:02:04.549> depends<00:02:05.149> on<00:02:05.240> others<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:05.690> then

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
patient who depends on others and then

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.520 
patient who depends on others and then
40<00:02:07.190> sessions<00:02:07.640> later<00:02:07.789> they're<00:02:08.780> able<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.110> do<00:02:09.410> it

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
40 sessions later they're able to do it

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.460 
40 sessions later they're able to do it
independently<00:02:09.799> i<00:02:10.429> went<00:02:11.090> from<00:02:11.269> paralysis<00:02:11.989> in

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
independently i went from paralysis in

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.800 
independently i went from paralysis in
my<00:02:12.590> work<00:02:12.739> right<00:02:12.920> arm<00:02:13.130> tool<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:14.150> moving<00:02:14.660> my

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
my work right arm tool to moving my

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.979 
my work right arm tool to moving my
finger<00:02:15.170> then<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.220> was<00:02:16.400> completely<00:02:17.150> amazed<00:02:17.750> by

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
finger then I was completely amazed by

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.860 
finger then I was completely amazed by
it<00:02:18.489> increasing<00:02:19.489> patient<00:02:19.700> independence<00:02:20.690> with

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
it increasing patient independence with

it increasing patient independence with
the<00:02:20.959> help<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.290> fes<00:02:21.769> is<00:02:22.359> directly<00:02:23.359> related<00:02:23.570> to

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
the help of fes is directly related to

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.229 
the help of fes is directly related to
reducing<00:02:24.470> burden<00:02:24.950> off<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.190> their<00:02:25.640> caregivers

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
reducing burden off of their caregivers

cost associated or tender care are in

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.090 
cost associated or tender care are in
millions<00:02:32.959> of<00:02:33.200> homes<00:02:33.519> if<00:02:34.519> one<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:35.239> able<00:02:35.269> to<00:02:36.100> help

millions of homes if one is able to help
patients<00:02:37.310> regain<00:02:37.880> hand<00:02:38.570> function<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.590> they

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
patients regain hand function so they
