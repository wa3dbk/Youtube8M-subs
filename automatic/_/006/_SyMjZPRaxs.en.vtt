because<00:01:50.550> of<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.760> campus<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.480> know<00:01:51.660> I<00:01:51.870> want<00:01:52.200> to

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
because of the campus you know I want to

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.800 
because of the campus you know I want to
try<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.800> know<00:01:52.950> basically<00:01:53.580> keep<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.540> from

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
try to you know basically keep you from

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.450 
try to you know basically keep you from
camping<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.320> buildings<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.950> getting

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
camping and buildings and getting

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.770 
camping and buildings and getting
comfortable<00:01:56.820> because<00:01:57.150> a<00:01:57.300> lot<00:01:57.480> of<00:01:57.510> times

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
comfortable because a lot of times

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.840 
comfortable because a lot of times
that's<00:01:57.930> what<00:01:58.140> people<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.830> lot<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.490> fum

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that's what people do a lot of fum

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.820 
that's what people do a lot of fum
usually<00:02:00.390> people<00:02:00.660> holed<00:02:00.840> up<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.140> buildings<00:02:01.560> and

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
usually people holed up in buildings and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.110 
usually people holed up in buildings and
you<00:02:02.010> won't<00:02:02.190> be<00:02:02.280> able<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.550> get<00:02:02.610> indian<00:02:02.910> you

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
you won't be able to get indian you

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.880 
you won't be able to get indian you
gotta<00:02:03.270> constantly<00:02:03.630> fight<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.590> there

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
gotta constantly fight to get in there

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.310 
gotta constantly fight to get in there
and<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.580> annoying<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> best<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.230> know

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
and it's annoying so the best you know

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.840 
and it's annoying so the best you know
the<00:02:07.470> way<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.620> deal<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.550> use<00:02:08.700> an

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
the way I deal with it just use an

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.160 
the way I deal with it just use an
engineering<00:02:09.210> class<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.660> blow<00:02:09.810> them<00:02:09.990> out<00:02:10.110> of

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
engineering class and blow them out of

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.350 
engineering class and blow them out of
it<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:11.040> that's<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.490> best<00:02:11.700> way<00:02:11.820> I<00:02:11.880> do<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.150> in

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
it and that's the best way I do it in

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.610 
it and that's the best way I do it in
right<00:02:12.570> here<00:02:12.600> I<00:02:12.750> should<00:02:12.960> just<00:02:13.170> stood<00:02:13.410> here

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
right here I should just stood here

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.740 
right here I should just stood here
reloaded<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.610> waited<00:02:15.030> for<00:02:15.060> them<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.270> come<00:02:15.420> up

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
reloaded and waited for them to come up

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.120 
reloaded and waited for them to come up
the<00:02:15.930> stairs<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.440> probably<00:02:16.650> got<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.980> better

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
the stairs and I probably got a better

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.000 
the stairs and I probably got a better
shot<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.580> them<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.420> didn't<00:02:18.630> work<00:02:18.660> out<00:02:20.930> TDM

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
shot on them but it didn't work out TDM

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.350 
shot on them but it didn't work out TDM
how<00:02:23.010> do<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.220> say<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.550> like<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.060> know<00:02:24.120> I'm<00:02:24.330> probably

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
how do I say it like I know I'm probably

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.960 
how do I say it like I know I'm probably
like<00:02:24.840> rambling<00:02:25.350> all<00:02:25.470> over

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
like rambling all over

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.540 
like rambling all over
right<00:02:26.150> now<00:02:26.300> for<00:02:26.480> like<00:02:26.570> TDM<00:02:27.080> it's<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.310> way<00:02:28.490> you

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
right now for like TDM it's the way you

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.030 
right now for like TDM it's the way you
spawn<00:02:29.090> off<00:02:29.360> into<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.050> game<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:30.620> like

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
spawn off into the game it's like

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.450 
spawn off into the game it's like
headquarters<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.120> quality<00:02:32.600> because<00:02:33.590> um<00:02:33.920> you

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
headquarters in quality because um you

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.190 
headquarters in quality because um you
know<00:02:34.580> they<00:02:35.180> do<00:02:35.240> it<00:02:35.510> with<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.720> same<00:02:35.870> kind<00:02:36.170> of

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
know they do it with the same kind of

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.350 
know they do it with the same kind of
concept<00:02:36.380> as<00:02:36.800> like<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.760> know<00:02:37.790> your<00:02:38.060> team's

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
concept as like you know your team's

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.150 
concept as like you know your team's
phones<00:02:38.690> on<00:02:38.810> one<00:02:38.960> side<00:02:39.230> their<00:02:39.470> teams<00:02:39.740> more<00:02:39.980> than

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
phones on one side their teams more than

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.250 
phones on one side their teams more than
another<00:02:40.400> but<00:02:40.700> if<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.420> realize<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:41.960> you

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
another but if you realize that you

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.840 
another but if you realize that you
spawned<00:02:42.560> away<00:02:42.770> from<00:02:42.980> your<00:02:43.100> team<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.760> that

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
spawned away from your team and that

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.760 
spawned away from your team and that
means<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.180> spawn<00:02:44.450> next<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.930> them<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.260> they<00:02:45.620> have

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
means you spawn next to them I they have

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.470 
means you spawn next to them I they have
those<00:02:45.950> two<00:02:46.190> Rams<00:02:46.460> phones<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.270> are<00:02:47.360> like

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
those two Rams phones that are like

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.270 
those two Rams phones that are like
right<00:02:47.900> next<00:02:48.050> to<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.290> enemy<00:02:48.620> team<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.190> gets

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280

building boom so the blast radius goes

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.250 
building boom so the blast radius goes
forward<00:03:25.340> instead<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.760> backward<00:03:26.240> so<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.900> shoot

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
forward instead of backward so you shoot
