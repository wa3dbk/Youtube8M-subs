00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.120
 we will work from a photo 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.190
 we will draw a picture 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.410
 essentially based on values 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.850
 that is, how to translate the shadow and 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.520
 light with flat areas thanks to our 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.079
 charcoal and a gum bread crumbs 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.620
 we will work on a support 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.510
 when 180 touch here a gray background that has 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.710
 well make it appear the contrasts 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.649
 we will use charcoal in 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.659
 branches that very nice to use and 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.949
 I advise you not to use it 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:51.019
 like a pencil like these is 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.199
 to use in the hand at the end of 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.030
 charcoal your gesture will be much more 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.579
 flexible and you will be able to make 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.829
 extremely fine traits we're going 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.260
 start our composition with 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:11.630
 outline our tree in the middle 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:15.290
 make it look with fine lines 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.090
 our horizon that will punctuate the 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.560
 composition once your composition 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.450
 executed quickly fine and fluid 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.480
 we will work from different 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.010
 charcoal manners you can 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.050
 work in this way 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.960
 a succession of traits that 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.540
 overlap to darken our 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.950
 object try to make appear 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.830
 the object darker and darker 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.510
 gradually on what's called a 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.420
 scale of the grids of the most clear 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.210
 up to the darker you can dimmed 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.700
 with the finger and the support lend themselves to it 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.090
 very well to get a material 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.390
 velvety fluid you can add the 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.980
 traits to bring up the shadow on 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.380
 the tree 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.610
 use your charcoal you can 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.700
 the case is also 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.280
 take a little bit and you can 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.470
 use with flat areas to cover 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.260
 larger areas than you can 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:18.080
 leave as is or again 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:20.330
 worked blured you can use 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.910
 your fuser in different ways reg 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.070
 back to sketch a tree and you 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.280
 have different renderings depending on your 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.890
 likes 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.110
 charcoal marks very quickly so barely 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.710
 you press and you get blacks 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.090
 intense admits of esteem on your 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.700
 grid scale where you must have 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.440
 darker areas and key areas 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.690
 when I look at this picture I see that 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.480
 for example the horizon is going to be a lot 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.730
 more much softer less clear 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.120
 so I can afford for the bottom 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.550
 to do less details and the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.170
 melt more foregrounds them 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.300
 will be much sharper 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.160
 see the difference in texture between 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.140
 something that appears off that is 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.870
 blurred and something that is not 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.970
 not in more defined areas anymore 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.920
 dark to be able to create a contrast 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.709
 is a different rhythm in your 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.060
 drawing always squinting eyes 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.459
 this way as if you were 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.590
 boiled by the sun at that time and 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.080
 detail disappear and we do not see 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.570
 that the big masses appear the 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.650
 shadows and lights 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.410
 for now we have not used 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.209
 still gum I advise you 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.130
 strongly not to use an eraser 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.530
 white that will not erase well the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.709
 charcoal take a piece of eraser from 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.290
 bread 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.050
 it's a little square eraser take a 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.350
 little tip and you knead it into your 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.890
 fingers 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.150
 this eraser live thanks and will recover 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:49.070
 the material used I make appear 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:50.570
 light on my object other 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.700
 example of using the range of 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.890
 breads I want to bring up 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.750
 small leaves on the tree that little 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.510
 this way bring up areas 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.890
 clear in a very localized way 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.630
 it's very useful to show up 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.590
 especially reflections on a bottle 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.239
 on a glass as the paper is dark 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.549
 do not have to put charcoal 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.450
 everywhere this quality there of a paper 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.660
 colored 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.030
 will create a uniform background in your 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.030
 composition can make appear if 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.160
 you want in the landscape a few 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.550
 clearer points to pace your 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.289
 funds 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.229
 after doing the big masses little 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.750
 as I go on doing more 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.039
 details in the branches in the 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.710
 decor in the leaves 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.860
 when you want faded areas 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.860
 very precisely you can use 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.069
 a print in this form could 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.750
 faded locally a small area thanks 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.330
 at this tool you can dimmed very 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.759
 precisely in certain places so 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.949
 to have the ranks of the sweetest more 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.949
 delicate with the fingers or a rag 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.440
 here are two drawings made according to a 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.969
 plaster here a sketched drawing here we 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.879
 did a succession of small 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:08.520
 traits like work with pencil 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:12.979
 but here with charcoal this frame is going 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.979
 allow to obtain very soft modeling
