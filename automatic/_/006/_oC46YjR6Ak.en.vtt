from our own d-train 3303 of lost

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.590 
from our own d-train 3303 of lost
Phoenix<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.700> almost<00:00:35.700> right<00:00:36.000> away<00:00:36.180> there's

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
Phoenix and almost right away there's

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.630 
Phoenix and almost right away there's
just<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.079> many<00:00:37.230> things<00:00:37.620> going<00:00:37.950> wrong<00:00:38.280> right

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
just so many things going wrong right

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.520 
just so many things going wrong right
here<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.390> we're<00:00:39.629> gonna<00:00:39.719> need<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.079> freeze<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
here that we're gonna need to freeze the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.490 
here that we're gonna need to freeze the
frame<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.010> break<00:00:41.250> them<00:00:41.430> down<00:00:41.610> one<00:00:41.969> at<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> time

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
frame and break them down one at a time

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.470 
frame and break them down one at a time
now<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.559> primary<00:00:44.100> problem<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:45.360> is

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
now the primary problem I see here is

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.119 
now the primary problem I see here is
the<00:00:45.570> fact<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.559> dragons<00:00:47.039> that

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the fact that all of the dragons that

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.400 
the fact that all of the dragons that
pretty<00:00:47.430> much<00:00:47.550> bunched<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.180> together<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
pretty much bunched up together at the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.709 
pretty much bunched up together at the
very<00:00:49.649> top<00:00:49.980> end<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.640> base<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
very top end of this base and the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.209 
very top end of this base and the
problem<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> leads<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.860> they're<00:00:53.070> not

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
problem that leads to is they're not

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.709 
problem that leads to is they're not
going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.789> taking<00:00:54.210> out<00:00:54.270> those<00:00:54.480> air

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
going to be taking out those air

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.350 
going to be taking out those air
defenses<00:00:54.780> right<00:00:55.500> away<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.039> as<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:57.059> air

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
defenses right away and as we know air

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.500 
defenses right away and as we know air
defenses<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.440> absolute<00:00:59.039> arch<00:00:59.640> enemy<00:01:00.329> of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
defenses are the absolute arch enemy of

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.979 
defenses are the absolute arch enemy of
dragons<00:01:01.280> also<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> problem<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.629> two

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
dragons also we have the problem of two

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.990 
dragons also we have the problem of two
multi<00:01:04.439> targeting<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.070> ferno's<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.790> will<00:01:05.909> be

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
multi targeting and ferno's that will be

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.850 
multi targeting and ferno's that will be
facing<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.570> pack<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.810> dragons<00:01:07.409> at<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> same

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
facing this pack of dragons at the same

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.130 
facing this pack of dragons at the same
time<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.430> mention<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.540> two<00:01:09.750> wizard

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
time not to mention the two wizard

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
time not to mention the two wizard
towers<00:01:10.500> right<00:01:10.650> there<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.610> Queen<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
towers right there and the Queen and the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.760 
towers right there and the Queen and the
clan<00:01:12.479> castle<00:01:12.720> troops<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.290> are<00:01:13.409> headed<00:01:13.619> their

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
clan castle troops that are headed their

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.850 
clan castle troops that are headed their
way<00:01:13.950> as<00:01:14.070> well<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:15.240> I'm<00:01:15.479> no<00:01:15.810> dragon<00:01:16.290> expert<00:01:16.680> but

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
way as well now I'm no dragon expert but

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.200 
way as well now I'm no dragon expert but
I<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.159> don't<00:01:17.310> understand<00:01:17.939> what<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
I just don't understand what the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.149 
I just don't understand what the
affinity<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.200> these<00:01:19.350> dragon<00:01:19.740> attackers

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
affinity is that these dragon attackers

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.980 
affinity is that these dragon attackers
have<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.670> coming<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.090> from<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> top<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
have for coming in from the top of a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
have for coming in from the top of a
base<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.610> look<00:01:23.790> down<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
base like this if you look down to the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.630 
base like this if you look down to the
lower<00:01:24.570> left<00:01:24.990> where<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.530> left<00:01:25.860> Inferno<00:01:26.369> is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
lower left where that left Inferno is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.969 
lower left where that left Inferno is
you<00:01:27.180> could<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.630> easily<00:01:27.689> freeze<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.770> left

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
you could very easily freeze the left

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.310 
you could very easily freeze the left
Inferno<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.240> air<00:01:30.450> defense<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> same

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
Inferno and that air defense at the same

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.980 
Inferno and that air defense at the same
time<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.400> freeze<00:01:33.000> spell<00:01:33.360> whereas<00:01:33.869> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
time with one freeze spell whereas you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.990 
time with one freeze spell whereas you
can't<00:01:34.320> achieve<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.770> coming<00:01:35.400> from<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.700> north

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
can't achieve that coming from the north

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.210 
can't achieve that coming from the north
and<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:37.020> attacker<00:01:37.350> ends<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.770> having<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.189> use

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
and this attacker ends up having to use

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.580 
and this attacker ends up having to use
his<00:01:38.520> free<00:01:38.790> spells<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.810> freeze<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.380> air

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
his free spells to freeze the air

his free spells to freeze the air

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
dragons turn on the defending King and

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.929 
dragons turn on the defending King and
burn<00:01:51.899> him<00:01:52.200> down<00:01:52.470> while<00:01:53.159> he's<00:01:53.340> harmless

burn him down while he's harmless

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.090 
burn him down while he's harmless
but<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.479> infernos<00:01:54.990> finished<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> dragons

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
but the infernos finished the dragons

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.999 
but the infernos finished the dragons

can see that he's already up to 35% as

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.490 
can see that he's already up to 35% as
opposed<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.340> 22%<00:03:49.940> from<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.569> last<00:03:50.780> attack<00:03:51.199> and

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
target-rich environment and it's just a

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.960 
target-rich environment and it's just a
matter<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:56.060> time<00:03:56.389> before<00:03:56.419> he<00:03:57.290> gets<00:03:57.430> 50%<00:03:58.430> and

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
matter of time before he gets 50% and

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.670 
matter of time before he gets 50% and
saves<00:03:59.419> the<00:03:59.659> attack<00:03:59.959> from<00:04:00.260> being<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.769> fail<00:04:02.680> so

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
saves the attack from being a fail so

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.619 
saves the attack from being a fail so

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
the first attack we saw now I think the

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.890 
the first attack we saw now I think the
difference<00:05:13.910> there<00:05:14.180> was<00:05:14.360> the<00:05:14.570> fact<00:05:14.780> that

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
difference there was the fact that

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.900

to the outside of the base and dealt
with<00:05:18.680> him<00:05:18.889> there<00:05:19.250> rather<00:05:19.910> than<00:05:20.270> dealing<00:05:20.510> with

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
with him there rather than dealing with
