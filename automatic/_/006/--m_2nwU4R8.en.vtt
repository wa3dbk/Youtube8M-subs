00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It may be troubled when shooting a train.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.500
I want to take the train run scene from the beginning.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.000
But a train may not appear by tunnel.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.000
Approach of a train will be known if there is level crossing alarm.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.500
If it is not so.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.500
For example, like this place,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.500
Fields and in the mountains, in some cases there is no level crossing alarm.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.500
May not notice the approach of a train for it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Have you ever failed to shoot the train?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
At that time, there is a very useful item.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000
This receiver.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000
It is sold at Akihabara.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
A switch turn on.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500
[Outbound train approaching...]

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Can you hear?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
[Outbound train approaching...]

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.500
She said "Outbound train approaching."

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.000
It is proof that outbound train approaching.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500
[Outbound train approaching...]

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.500
A voice become clear if a train approaches.
21
00:01:06,500 --&gt; 00:00:08,500
[Outbound train approaching...]

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And now, train is coming soon.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
[Outbound train approaching...]

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.500
Oh! Sound has been heard.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.000
Voice changed.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
[Inbound &amp; outbound train approaching...]

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.500
Inbound &amp; outbound train approaching.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
[Inbound &amp; outbound train approaching...]

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.500
The train passed now and another train pass each other at Inawashiro Station.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.500
And it is proof that inbound train coming soon.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
[Inbound train approaching...]

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.500
Voice changed to inbound train.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
[Inbound train approaching...]

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.500
I think that inbound train is coming in about two minutes.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.500
[Inbound train approaching...]

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500
[Inbound train approaching...]

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.500
[Inbound train approaching...]

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.500
This electric wave exists for the safety of people who do tracklaying.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
It is also useful to the shooting railway enthusiast.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.000
If it is snowing in the mountains, the sound of the train will be drowned out.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You may not notice a train approach.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.500
It is convenient if you carry for safety.
