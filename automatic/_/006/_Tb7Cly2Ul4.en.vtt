contacts in so totally to the six gold
contacts<00:01:06.119> there<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:06.840> two<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.320> them<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:08.220> either

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
contacts there but two of them on either

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.719 
contacts there but two of them on either
side<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.810> these<00:01:09.990> first<00:01:10.290> three<00:01:10.729> completely

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
side of these first three completely

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.380 
side of these first three completely
flattened<00:01:12.210> down<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.560> looks<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:14.390> damage

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
flattened down so it looks like damage

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
flattened down so it looks like damage
has<00:01:15.869> happened<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.619> some<00:01:16.950> way<00:01:18.799> to<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.950> card

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
has happened in some way to the card

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.310 
has happened in some way to the card
reader<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:21.869> we're<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.229> is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
reader so what we're going to do is

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.800 
reader so what we're going to do is
replace<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:23.040> once<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.119> replaced<00:01:24.509> we'll

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
replace this once it's replaced we'll

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.080 
replace this once it's replaced we'll
get<00:01:24.960> testing<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.939> working

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
get testing to see if it's working

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.390 
get testing to see if it's working
properly<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.259> then<00:01:28.500> we'll<00:01:28.740> move<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.040> all

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
properly and then we'll move on all

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.039 
properly and then we'll move on all
right<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> sim<00:01:30.659> card<00:01:30.689> reader

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
right this is the sim card reader

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.960 
right this is the sim card reader
kornhaus<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:32.310> we're<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.729> really

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
kornhaus now we're going to be really

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.510 
kornhaus now we're going to be really
careful<00:01:33.170> with<00:01:34.170> getting<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> sim<00:01:35.070> card<00:01:35.100> reader

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
careful with getting the sim card reader

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880 
careful with getting the sim card reader
off<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.909> reason<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.450> because<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.619> way<00:01:37.740> it's

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
off the reason is because the way it's

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.640 
off the reason is because the way it's
held<00:01:38.040> down<00:01:38.130> by<00:01:38.549> being<00:01:39.479> soldered<00:01:40.079> down<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.530> he

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
held down by being soldered down so he

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.200 
held down by being soldered down so he
gets<00:01:40.829> one<00:01:41.670> side<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.240> first<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.149> I'm

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
gets one side up first and then what I'm

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.450 
gets one side up first and then what I'm
going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.540> next<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.439> remove<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.280> rest

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
going to do next is just remove the rest

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.030 
going to do next is just remove the rest
of<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.759> part<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.600> then<00:01:49.140> desalting<00:01:49.890> it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
of this part of it and then desalting it

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.730 
of this part of it and then desalting it
the<00:01:50.250> other<00:01:50.369> side<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.820> metal<00:01:51.180> cover<00:01:51.740> once

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the other side of this metal cover once

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.630 
the other side of this metal cover once
we've<00:01:52.950> done<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.159> we'll<00:01:53.460> clean<00:01:53.759> up<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.090> area

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
we've done that we'll clean up the area

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.210 
we've done that we'll clean up the area

fine it just isn't showing the network
is<00:03:48.730> connected<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.209> because<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.959> this<00:03:50.080> reason

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
is connected to because of this reason

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.039 
is connected to because of this reason
