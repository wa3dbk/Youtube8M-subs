00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello love or unity friends of over 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.050
 you need ii.de I'll show you today 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.179
 was called real fan of tde i show you 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.519
 today a comparison between 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.080
 different led lamps 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.630
 I now have two rows of 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.770
 where the lamps are built 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.470
 I can now mass up here 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.090
 see the video 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.750
 on the far left, starting in the first one 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:33.270
 i have the philips master soon 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:36.690
 LED lamp which has 806 lumens at 12 watts 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.770
 Consumption is a very yellow glowing 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.700
 lamp also has 2700 kelvin 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:49.140
 Color temperature and this consumption 12 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:51.750
 I had 806 flowers that had this one 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.840
 special heat sink and lights up 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.609
 so then on the yellow sst of all the lamps 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:05.030
 comes in the middle of a easy as sy 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:07.290
 806 lumens 60 watt led lamp what the here 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:13.229
 such a packaging in one 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.619
 plastic packaging hilbert this 10 watt 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:26.360
 had and then right here comes the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:28.250
 osram lamp classic a 40 with 7 watt 4 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.909
 170 lumens 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.220
 you realize that there a little 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.670
 It is darker when you look at yourself 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.140
 look does not know if it is here now 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.840
 video come out we can still here 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.649
 Zoom out a bit 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.720
 maybe we would see you lead 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.000
 then it might be better so now to 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.369
 in a row 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.360
 there we have on the far left as you can see 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.570
 even that's a bit darker 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.159
 is a philips 6 watt 350 lumens lamp 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.439
 So you can see something here in the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.960
 Unfortunately, the camera's automatic focus 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.119
 It did not come out so well 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.580
 do not know if you have it sees that they 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.560
 for example, a bit darker is yes 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.560
 the white shining on the wall will not 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:23.880
 too high that was a philips 6 watt 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:27.209
 350 lumens lamp corresponds to 32 normal 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:35.209
 incandescent or in the middle back 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:37.770
 We have a LED lamp which has seven watts 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:48.810
 75 watt and one speaks for me 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:53.400
 Waist light bulb and has 170 lumens because 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:03:02.850
 who now have it here and on the right 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:09.090
 we had a livorno lamp which had 810 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:11.130
 flowers and 10 watt consumption corresponds 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.400
 after 60 watt incandescent lamp so you can 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.780
 So assume that's about 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:26.160
 always with led bulbs and 4,800 lumens 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:30.230
 by corresponding 60 watt bulb 470 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:34.820
 So nearly 500 lumens correspond to Vienna 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:43.860
 40w incandescent and 350 lumens 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:48.709
 correspond to 32 watt bulb so if 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:51.150
 So you have a 100 watt bulb after 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:56.160
 arm real with a led bulb then has to 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:59.489
 you already have over 1000 lumens of blogger 12 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.200
 1300 lumens was equivalent to about 100 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.590
 watt bulb so you have it here 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.260
 not the learned lamps so we come 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.190
 again to a test how fast the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.840
 now turn the lights on and off 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.760
 We'll do the color temperature now 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.500
 how fast are the lamps turned on and the test 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.940
 switch off so i just hold it now 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.070
 time out 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.740
 of course, turn off quickly so 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.210
 Bartmann instantly and now easy 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.400
 the lamps of the world you see this 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.550
 on the far left front, take a good look at it 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.060
 the philips master led always needs 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:37.880
 It's sometimes about half a second 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:40.020
 when it's cold to turn on 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.460
 actually quite fast I do 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.990
 Normally , sometimes you can press the 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.100
 switch if it's just when it's cool 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.970
 somehow that takes a half 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.660
 second 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.970
 Now it 's a bit faster here 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.760
 but there you think the lamp is broken 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.770
 or as a human being old each effect so 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.190
 that's a bit annoying about this philips 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.140
 lamp yes, because of course not now 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.990
 have tested whether to dim the lamps 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.530
 It can not really work for me now 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:14.700
 so of significance since I almost always 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:17.360
 Great user for me is important 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.610
 so far we are little 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.280
 Power consumption can be power consumption 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.410
 you also aim with those you me 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.820
 massive before that will soon switch off 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.180
 from joop a few more videos 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.790
 yes you can see here now reasonably 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.320
 again so the color temperature so pure 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.530
 from my taste so I have with 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.180
 me in brno in any case one like that 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.490
 a philips lamp is always on here 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:46.500
 I gave this more yellowish 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.530
 I do not like that kind of lamp 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.740
 that are so glaring are not so good 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:57.510
 for eye leads so it should now too 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:00.240
 lamps come out the 2200 kelvin 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:05.160
 have color temperature with these lamps 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.660
 Can you then yes they are still much 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.840
 better for the eye at the stop more 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.500
 yellowish so I like it yes 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.630
 not so bright of course always on it 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.810
 if you want to do something with it 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.520
 or you more natural couple more 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.280
 wants to have daylight or more like that 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.120
 little yellow arm but mood 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.570
 wants 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.060
 So here he behaves this yellowish 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.740
 but it may be light again 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.470
 different so wait first of 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.090
 me here for watching and in the 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.650
 next video shows you again 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.069
 few other led lamp league too 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.699
 have 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.699
 Thank you
