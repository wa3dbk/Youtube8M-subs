he asked how do you make a your
character<00:00:41.309> Crouch<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> made<00:00:42.930> him<00:00:43.020> crouched

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
make them crowd okay so what I have two

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.500 
make them crowd okay so what I have two
sprites<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.670> let<00:01:02.670> me<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.910> open<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.359> up

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
sprites is let me just open this up

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.350 
sprites is let me just open this up
there's<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.409> crouching<00:01:05.010> right<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.760> crouching

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
there's a crouching right and crouching

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.810 
there's a crouching right and crouching
left<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.350> when<00:01:07.650> he's<00:01:07.770> facing<00:01:08.159> right<00:01:08.400> he<00:01:08.580> crouch

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
left so when he's facing right he crouch

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.640 
left so when he's facing right he crouch
and<00:01:08.970> he<00:01:09.119> crashes<00:01:09.420> down<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.110> when<00:01:10.200> he's<00:01:10.290> facing

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and he crashes down and when he's facing

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.590 
and he crashes down and when he's facing
right<00:01:10.890> left<00:01:11.430> he<00:01:11.610> crouches<00:01:11.970> down<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.360> press

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
right left he crouches down and press

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.270 
right left he crouches down and press
and<00:01:12.750> Brady<00:01:12.960> crushed<00:01:13.260> blah<00:01:13.500> blah<00:01:13.650> blah<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
and Brady crushed blah blah blah and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
and Brady crushed blah blah blah and
then<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> opposite<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.930> when<00:01:16.080> he

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
then you have the opposite so when he

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.190 
then you have the opposite so when he
rises<00:01:16.380> up<00:01:16.590> which<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:18.799> where<00:01:19.799> he<00:01:19.890> gets<00:01:20.009> up

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
rises up which is where he gets up

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.609 
rises up which is where he gets up
right<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:21.680> need<00:01:21.799> that<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:22.460> say<00:01:23.030> when<00:01:23.390> he<00:01:23.659> gets

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
right you need that so say when he gets

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.590 
right you need that so say when he gets
up<00:01:24.799> from<00:01:24.920> crouching<00:01:25.490> it's<00:01:26.030> basically<00:01:26.360> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
up from crouching it's basically the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.480 
up from crouching it's basically the
reverse<00:01:26.720> of<00:01:27.080> crouching<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:27.950> instead<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.220> going

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
reverse of crouching so instead of going

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.270 
reverse of crouching so instead of going
like<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:29.060> it's<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.990> reverse<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.830> know<00:01:30.950> you

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
like that it's the reverse you know you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.410 
like that it's the reverse you know you
should<00:01:31.460> understand<00:01:31.820> what<00:01:31.939> I<00:01:31.970> mean

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
should understand what I mean

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.020 
should understand what I mean
so<00:01:32.930> basically<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.920> these<00:01:34.430> two<00:01:34.790> other

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
so basically this is the these two other

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.350 
so basically this is the these two other
Crouch<00:01:36.340> animation<00:01:37.340> sprites<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:37.970> these<00:01:38.119> two

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
Crouch animation sprites and these two

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.350 
Crouch animation sprites and these two
I'll<00:01:38.539> be<00:01:39.159> standing<00:01:40.159> up<00:01:40.250> animation<00:01:40.789> sprite<00:01:41.180> so

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
I'll be standing up animation sprite so

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.950 
I'll be standing up animation sprite so
when<00:01:41.539> he<00:01:41.600> gets<00:01:41.690> up<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.110> crouching

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
when he gets up and crouching

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.920 
when he gets up and crouching
so<00:01:45.070> what<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:46.159> also<00:01:46.280> want<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.700> do<00:01:46.909> is<00:01:47.240> when<00:01:47.720> you

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
so what you also want to do is when you

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.999 
so what you also want to do is when you
um<00:01:48.170> stand<00:01:49.130> up<00:01:50.140> he<00:01:51.140> doesn't<00:01:51.439> jump<00:01:51.680> if<00:01:51.860> he's

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
um stand up he doesn't jump if he's

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.230 
um stand up he doesn't jump if he's
crouching<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:53.060> if<00:01:53.149> he<00:01:53.300> is<00:01:53.509> then<00:01:53.929> he<00:01:54.530> does<00:01:54.710> jump

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
crouching but if he is then he does jump

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.380 
crouching but if he is then he does jump
so<00:01:56.240> at<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.050> very<00:01:57.229> start<00:01:57.789> if<00:01:58.789> there<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.360> a

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
so at the very start if there is a

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.510 
so at the very start if there is a
collision<00:01:59.720> a<00:02:00.020> position<00:02:00.560> blah<00:02:00.950> blah<00:02:01.100> blah<00:02:01.250> only

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
collision a position blah blah blah only

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.960 
collision a position blah blah blah only
solid<00:02:03.159> y1<00:02:04.159> relative<00:02:04.729> or<00:02:05.060> any<00:02:05.270> solid<00:02:06.970> created

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
solid y1 relative or any solid created

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.699 
solid y1 relative or any solid created
started<00:02:08.630> blocking<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.229> block<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.619> in

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
started blocking in the block and in

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.320 
started blocking in the block and in
between<00:02:09.830> put<00:02:10.280> vertical<00:02:10.549> speed<00:02:10.910> -5<00:02:11.709> else

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.200 

his<00:02:16.330> sprite<00:02:16.690> index<00:02:17.260> is<00:02:17.590> equal<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.880> character

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
his sprite index is equal to character

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.820 
his sprite index is equal to character
stop<00:02:19.420> left<00:02:21.120> jump<00:02:22.410> basically<00:02:23.410> these<00:02:23.560> are<00:02:23.740> all

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
stop left jump basically these are all

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.430 
stop left jump basically these are all
the<00:02:23.950> jump<00:02:24.250> sprites

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
the jump sprites

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.130 
the jump sprites
now<00:02:26.440> if<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.740> sprite<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.280> equal<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:28.140> crouching

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
now if the sprite is equal to crouching

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.330 
now if the sprite is equal to crouching
character<00:02:29.860> Crouch<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:31.090> got<00:02:31.210> then<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.620> set

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
character Crouch you got then you set

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.390 
character Crouch you got then you set
the<00:02:33.370> vertical<00:02:33.850> speed<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.240> zero<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:35.400> change

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
the vertical speed to zero and change

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.390 
the vertical speed to zero and change
sprite<00:02:36.760> into<00:02:37.120> character<00:02:37.600> rise<00:02:37.810> left<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.530> do

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
sprite into character rise left and do

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.260 
sprite into character rise left and do
the<00:02:39.490> same<00:02:39.700> thing<00:02:39.910> for<00:02:40.090> character<00:02:40.480> rise<00:02:41.010> right

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
the same thing for character rise right

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.850 
the same thing for character rise right
so<00:02:43.270> basically<00:02:43.450> what<00:02:43.930> you're<00:02:44.020> saying<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.500> to

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
so basically what you're saying the to

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.880 
so basically what you're saying the to
the<00:02:45.010> game<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.670> if<00:02:46.660> this<00:02:46.900> sprite<00:02:47.200> egg<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.560> equal

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
the game is if this sprite egg is equal

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.130 
the game is if this sprite egg is equal
to<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.070> crouching<00:02:48.520> sprite<00:02:49.030> then<00:02:49.750> he<00:02:49.990> will<00:02:50.110> just

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
to a crouching sprite then he will just

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.530 
to a crouching sprite then he will just
stand<00:02:50.410> up<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.800> won't<00:02:50.980> jump<00:02:51.280> but<00:02:51.910> if<00:02:52.000> it's<00:02:52.360> not

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
stand up you won't jump but if it's not

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.220 
stand up you won't jump but if it's not
then<00:02:53.200> he'll<00:02:53.470> jump<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:55.360> we<00:02:55.810> create<00:02:56.080> our

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
then he'll jump so we create our

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.690 
then he'll jump so we create our
realistic<00:02:56.620> effect<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:57.100> when<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.310> crouch<00:02:57.550> and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
realistic effect so when you crouch and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.700 
realistic effect so when you crouch and
you<00:02:57.850> get<00:02:58.000> up<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.240> don't<00:02:58.420> jump<00:02:58.780> from<00:02:59.110> crouching

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
you get up you don't jump from crouching

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.700 
you get up you don't jump from crouching
you<00:02:59.860> just<00:03:00.100> stand<00:03:00.310> up<00:03:00.600> okay<00:03:01.600> so<00:03:01.660> when<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.530> press

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
you just stand up okay so when you press

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.630 
you just stand up okay so when you press
down<00:03:03.150> basically<00:03:04.290> if<00:03:05.290> everything<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.220> equal

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
down basically if everything is equal

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.390 
down basically if everything is equal
anything<00:03:07.330> if<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.990> sprite<00:03:08.200> index<00:03:08.560> say<00:03:08.770> I<00:03:09.040> have

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
anything if the sprite index say I have

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.340 
anything if the sprite index say I have
the<00:03:09.490> running<00:03:09.790> animation<00:03:09.910> stopping<00:03:10.870> animation

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
the running animation stopping animation

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.290 
the running animation stopping animation
everything<00:03:11.950> down<00:03:12.130> there<00:03:12.340> it's<00:03:12.850> equal<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.150> that

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
everything down there it's equal to that

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.000 
everything down there it's equal to that
change<00:03:13.750> if<00:03:13.990> it's<00:03:14.200> equal<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.530> running<00:03:14.830> left

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
change if it's equal to running left

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.680 
change if it's equal to running left
change<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.640> Crouch<00:03:15.850> left<00:03:16.180> if<00:03:16.360> people<00:03:16.600> it's

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
change it to Crouch left if people it's

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.180 
change it to Crouch left if people it's
running<00:03:17.020> right<00:03:17.170> change<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.680> Crouch<00:03:17.890> right

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
running right change it to Crouch right

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.810 
running right change it to Crouch right
and<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.150> do<00:03:19.300> that<00:03:19.450> for<00:03:19.510> every<00:03:19.840> single<00:03:20.680> sprite

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
and you do that for every single sprite

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.970 
and you do that for every single sprite
that's<00:03:22.390> not<00:03:22.690> related<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.410> Crouch<00:03:23.620> except

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
that's not related to the Crouch except

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.370 
that's not related to the Crouch except
for<00:03:24.130> rise<00:03:24.370> don't<00:03:24.820> do<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.150> for<00:03:25.390> rise<00:03:25.600> that's<00:03:26.230> a

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
for rise don't do it for rise that's a

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.360 
for rise don't do it for rise that's a
pretty

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370

normal and same for the character stop
character<00:04:15.410> rise<00:04:15.590> bright<00:04:15.980> change<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:16.489> to

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
character rise bright change it to

character rise bright change it to
character<00:04:16.940> stop<00:04:17.180> right<00:04:17.440> ok<00:04:18.440> so<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.709> get<00:04:18.889> that

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
character stop right ok so you get that
