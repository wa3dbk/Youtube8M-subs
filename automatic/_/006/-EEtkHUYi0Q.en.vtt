00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
this kind of schedule but I still feel

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.560 
this kind of schedule but I still feel
driven<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.469> keep<00:00:34.710> going<00:00:35.130> with<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.270> mind

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
driven to keep going with that in mind

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.810

however<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.170> was<00:00:37.530> feeling<00:00:37.950> rather<00:00:38.100> distressed

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
however I was feeling rather distressed

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.580 
however I was feeling rather distressed
when<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> began<00:00:39.450> noticing<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.379> no

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
when I began noticing that I was no

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650 
when I began noticing that I was no
longer<00:00:40.620> able<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.280> keep<00:00:41.579> making<00:00:42.000> four<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.420> five

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
longer able to keep making four to five

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.540 
longer able to keep making four to five
videos<00:00:43.110> every<00:00:43.440> week<00:00:43.680> even<00:00:44.190> though<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> was

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
videos every week even though I was

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.459 
videos every week even though I was
still<00:00:44.789> uploading<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.539> many<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> channel

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
still uploading that many to the channel

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.830 
still uploading that many to the channel
it<00:00:47.010> used<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.760> had<00:00:48.059> at<00:00:48.239> least<00:00:48.390> 10

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it used to be that I had at least 10

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.260 
it used to be that I had at least 10
videos<00:00:49.320> ready<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.770> go<00:00:49.950> at<00:00:50.160> any<00:00:50.280> given<00:00:50.579> time<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
videos ready to go at any given time and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.049 
videos ready to go at any given time and
now<00:00:51.480> I'm<00:00:51.660> down<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> only<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:52.649> two<00:00:52.680> my<00:00:53.670> first

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
now I'm down to only one or two my first

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
now I'm down to only one or two my first
thought<00:00:54.329> was<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.750> hadn't<00:00:55.079> been<00:00:55.170> putting

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
thought was that I hadn't been putting

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.200 
thought was that I hadn't been putting
in<00:00:55.620> enough<00:00:55.890> time<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> keep<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> channel<00:00:57.000> going

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
in enough time to keep the channel going

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.270 
in enough time to keep the channel going
especially<00:00:58.140> since<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.469> used<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.039> able<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
especially since I used to be able to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
especially since I used to be able to
make<00:00:59.520> as<00:00:59.699> many<00:00:59.820> as<00:00:59.969> 6<00:01:00.359> videos<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.960> week

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
make as many as 6 videos in a week

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.619 
make as many as 6 videos in a week
rather<00:01:01.410> easily<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:02.640> when<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> took<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.270> deeper

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
rather easily but when I took a deeper

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.050 
rather easily but when I took a deeper
look<00:01:03.840> into<00:01:04.140> how<00:01:04.320> I'm<00:01:04.500> using<00:01:04.769> my<00:01:05.070> time<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.729> began

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
look into how I'm using my time I began

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.460 
look into how I'm using my time I began
to<00:01:06.210> notice<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.540> I'm<00:01:06.750> actually<00:01:07.020> spending

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
to notice that I'm actually spending

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.350

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
others have written these days rather

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.649 
others have written these days rather

despite my dedication I don't think that

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.809 
despite my dedication I don't think that
I'm<00:02:37.290> reaching<00:02:37.709> Twilight<00:02:38.340> levels<00:02:38.700> of

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
I'm reaching Twilight levels of

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.860 
I'm reaching Twilight levels of
overworking<00:02:39.300> myself<00:02:39.739> at<00:02:40.739> least<00:02:41.010> not<00:02:41.400> yet<00:02:41.870> but

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
overworking myself at least not yet but

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.690 
overworking myself at least not yet but
I'm<00:02:42.989> still<00:02:43.349> feeling<00:02:43.590> rather<00:02:43.980> drained<00:02:44.489> at

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
I'm still feeling rather drained at

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.759 
I'm still feeling rather drained at
times<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.420> occasionally<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.019> start<00:02:46.350> wondering

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
times and occasionally I start wondering

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.460 
times and occasionally I start wondering
about<00:02:46.830> how<00:02:47.190> long<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:47.910> keep<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.239> going<00:02:48.470> but

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
about how long I can keep this going but

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.650 
about how long I can keep this going but
then<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.800> remember<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.550> how<00:02:50.850> much<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.269> enjoy

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
then I remember just how much I enjoy

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.570 
then I remember just how much I enjoy
hearing<00:02:52.080> about<00:02:52.410> how<00:02:52.709> my<00:02:52.980> videos<00:02:53.160> are

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580

talking about how MLP has affected them

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.320 
talking about how MLP has affected them
on<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.080> more<00:03:07.290> personal<00:03:07.590> level<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:08.760> has<00:03:08.940> been<00:03:09.150> my

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
on a more personal level it has been my

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.000 
on a more personal level it has been my
intention<00:03:09.810> from<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.230> beginning<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.860> create

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
intention from the beginning to create

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.650 
intention from the beginning to create
an<00:03:11.280> understanding<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.209> welcoming

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
an understanding and welcoming

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.259 
an understanding and welcoming
environment<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.530> thus<00:03:14.220> far<00:03:14.519> it<00:03:14.730> seems<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.180> be

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
environment and thus far it seems to be

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.330 
environment and thus far it seems to be
working<00:03:15.630> pretty<00:03:15.780> well<00:03:16.080> but<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.010> doesn't

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
working pretty well but that doesn't

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.039 
working pretty well but that doesn't
