00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.240
 very good to all boys and girls who 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.640
 I have I'm not good in this video as 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.450
 you are looking in the background, if we are 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.689
 in the gta vice city is worth but molado in 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.880
 gta 5 is worth later in gta 5 we are in 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.009
 gta 5 of pc worth I've gotten in this way 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.689
 to try it and such to see it as it was 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.510
 and all that and the truth that is quite 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 well recreated I've visited quite a bit 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.710
 the only bad thing is that you have to go 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.780
 walking and well let's put a figure of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.460
 500 lake if you want a tutorial worth and 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.010
 burst over all the law button if 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.719
 you want a tutorial for how to power 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.420
 do this the truth that goes pretty 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.030
 well the only bad thing is that as I do not 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.039
 you can or well yes I think you can 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.469
 put vehicles but I did not know the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.210
 way to put it so good the truth 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.070
 that is pretty pretty done what are you going 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.079
 to see around especially if you look at a 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.760
 mini map will not be the same voucher or 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.580
 it is not going to be the one of vince cities but 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.920
 that is going to be the normal gta is worth the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.140
 gta 5 normal but the truth is 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.210
 practically everything from vice city that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.400
 yes they are improving it I have been reading 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.930
 that is still a version let's say 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.550
 test and they are improving 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.770
 the textures as you see the textures are 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.420
 they look pretty blurry and you're going to see more 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.820
 forward some palm trees that look without 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.070
 textures and that and all that were 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.520
 improving, you know how to put myself in the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.380
 comments if you want it to go up when 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.840
 leave the improvement is worth it when it comes out 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.729
 the improvement as I will upload it can be 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.310
 go to both places of the city and 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.170
 you know as you already know in the vice city 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.610
 it's worth in the gta vice city so 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.020
 you have to do is unblock it worth 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.940
 doing missions to be able to go from 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.160
 one city to another because in this case and 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.869
 you can go from one place to another 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.610
 I'm going to go here to show you the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.280
 Main frank floor is worth the one 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.320
 we appear say in vice city 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.240
 It's worth it if you've gone past the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.000
 instinct and that I had it for psp and 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.590
 for play 2 if I remember correctly and the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.899
 I really do not get everything quite tainted 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.250
 this here as you see I tried to invoke a 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.350
 car but it did not work no no no no and good 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.239
