of<00:00:50.430> being<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> water<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> all<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.300> would

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
of being in the water so all I would

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.920 
of being in the water so all I would
recommend<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.440> use<00:00:56.219> gloves<00:00:56.899> clearly<00:00:57.899> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
recommend is just use gloves clearly I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.619 
recommend is just use gloves clearly I
wasn't<00:00:58.350> using<00:00:58.500> gloves<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.239> when<00:01:00.239> like

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
wasn't using gloves and when like

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.490 
wasn't using gloves and when like
yesterday<00:01:01.109> by<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.640> was<00:01:03.359> using<00:01:03.690> gloves<00:01:03.809> they

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
yesterday by I was using gloves they

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.039 
yesterday by I was using gloves they
wouldn't<00:01:04.739> look<00:01:04.830> like<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.280> yeah<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.720> they<00:01:06.990> do

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
wouldn't look like this yeah if they do

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.660 
wouldn't look like this yeah if they do
look<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.860> cuz<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.280> weren't<00:01:08.520> using

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670

look like this cuz you weren't using
gloves<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.330> would<00:01:09.510> recommend<00:01:09.900> don't<00:01:10.110> do

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
gloves and I would recommend don't do

anything<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.610> maybe<00:01:12.390> ten<00:01:12.810> minutes<00:01:12.960> until

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
anything for maybe ten minutes until

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.030 
anything for maybe ten minutes until

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
since my nails are really thick this is

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.290 
since my nails are really thick this is
the<00:04:42.780> one<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:42.900> got<00:04:43.140> and<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:44.370> says<00:04:44.640> that<00:04:44.880> it's

I know people would watch their little
things<00:04:50.220> but<00:04:50.730> I<00:04:50.760> guess<00:04:51.060> they<00:04:51.240> do<00:04:51.300> this<00:04:51.930> one<00:04:52.110> is
