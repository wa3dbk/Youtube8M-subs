advantage for Hardy and you got that
Nexus<00:01:44.020> up<00:01:44.140> just<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.380> smidgen<00:01:45.100> sooner<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:45.969> Hardy

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
Nexus up just a smidgen sooner and Hardy

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.060 
Nexus up just a smidgen sooner and Hardy
has<00:01:46.689> the<00:01:46.780> corner<00:01:47.140> bass<00:01:47.289> here<00:01:47.590> but<00:01:47.770> that's<00:01:47.860> not

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
has the corner bass here but that's not

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.249 
has the corner bass here but that's not
really<00:01:48.219> gonna<00:01:48.340> matter<00:01:48.549> because<00:01:49.259> jinchuuriki

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
really gonna matter because jinchuuriki

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.200 
really gonna matter because jinchuuriki
isn't<00:01:50.500> below<00:01:50.710> him<00:01:50.860> or<00:01:50.979> anything<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:51.549> this<00:01:52.030> game

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
isn't below him or anything so this game

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.999 
isn't below him or anything so this game
gonna<00:01:52.390> be<00:01:52.479> pretty<00:01:52.630> fair<00:01:52.899> and<00:01:53.229> jinchuuriki

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
gonna be pretty fair and jinchuuriki

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.590 
gonna be pretty fair and jinchuuriki
getting<00:01:54.250> his<00:01:54.399> Nexus<00:01:54.759> right<00:01:55.030> directly<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:55.539> the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
getting his Nexus right directly in the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.669 
getting his Nexus right directly in the
middle<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:55.929> that<00:01:55.960> suggests<00:01:56.229> that<00:01:56.560> he's

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
middle so that suggests that he's

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.190 
middle so that suggests that he's
probably<00:01:56.890> not<00:01:57.130> gonna<00:01:57.250> go<00:01:57.429> for<00:01:57.549> a<00:01:57.640> triple<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.200> I

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
probably not gonna go for a triple and I

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.690 
probably not gonna go for a triple and I
see<00:01:59.590> yeah<00:01:59.950> he's<00:02:00.100> getting<00:02:00.159> to<00:02:00.340> eight<00:02:00.429> ways<00:02:00.549> now

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
see yeah he's getting to eight ways now

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.969 
see yeah he's getting to eight ways now
but<00:02:01.210> Hardy<00:02:01.569> has<00:02:01.719> this<00:02:01.869> nexus<00:02:02.170> offset<00:02:02.710> so<00:02:02.860> it

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
but Hardy has this nexus offset so it

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.169 
but Hardy has this nexus offset so it
means<00:02:03.130> he<00:02:03.250> could<00:02:03.399> be<00:02:03.429> going<00:02:03.700> for<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:03.880> triple

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
means he could be going for a triple

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.149 
means he could be going for a triple
right<00:02:04.299> here<00:02:04.509> getting<00:02:05.500> those<00:02:05.619> gateways<00:02:05.799> first

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
right here getting those gateways first

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.859 
right here getting those gateways first
though<00:02:06.340> he<00:02:06.460> went<00:02:06.610> for<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.729> +1<00:02:07.210> for<00:02:07.509> Gateway

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
though he went for the +1 for Gateway

though he went for the +1 for Gateway

he really likes to scout up above right

a mere build here the plus one and then
four<00:02:24.220> gateways<00:02:24.549> Oba<00:02:24.910> Hardy<00:02:25.239> getting<00:02:25.420> his

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
four gateways Oba Hardy getting his

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.120 
four gateways Oba Hardy getting his
triple<00:02:25.690> down<00:02:25.870> right<00:02:26.049> away<00:02:26.140> he<00:02:26.739> hasn't<00:02:27.010> seen

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
triple down right away he hasn't seen

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.289 
triple down right away he hasn't seen
anything<00:02:27.190> yet<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:27.790> he<00:02:27.880> thinks<00:02:28.090> he'd<00:02:28.180> probably

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
anything yet so he thinks he'd probably

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.360 
anything yet so he thinks he'd probably
have<00:02:28.480> considered<00:02:29.019> so<00:02:29.590> he's<00:02:29.709> in<00:02:29.799> he<00:02:30.010> knows<00:02:30.160> he's

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
have considered so he's in he knows he's

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.530 
have considered so he's in he knows he's
probably<00:02:30.519> safe<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.880> get<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.090> third<00:02:31.239> Nexus

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
probably safe to get that third Nexus

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.670 
probably safe to get that third Nexus
but<00:02:31.630> little<00:02:31.810> does<00:02:31.870> he<00:02:31.930> know<00:02:31.989> his<00:02:32.260> opponent<00:02:32.620> his

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
but little does he know his opponent his

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.520 
but little does he know his opponent his
Protoss<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.099> it's<00:02:33.610> but<00:02:34.390> see<00:02:34.569> see<00:02:34.900> how<00:02:34.989> Basil's

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
real name in old life look how its

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.039 
real name in old life look how its
gateways<00:02:39.970> for<00:02:40.000> morphing<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.780> little<00:02:40.930> bit

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
gateways for morphing in a little bit

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.170 
gateways for morphing in a little bit
faster<00:02:41.410> than<00:02:41.530> Shin<00:02:41.709> shriek<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.340> one<00:02:42.670> that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
faster than Shin shriek is that one that

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.990 
faster than Shin shriek is that one that
one<00:02:43.450> sure<00:02:43.780> makes<00:02:44.079> the<00:02:44.739> once<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.489> say<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.700> drone

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
one Pro makes such a big difference yeah

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.599 
one Pro makes such a big difference yeah
look<00:02:49.299> at<00:02:49.359> Hardy's<00:02:50.019> Nexus<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.500> about<00:02:50.709> 40%<00:02:51.160> done

you<00:02:54.190> know<00:02:54.280> 20%<00:02:54.670> done<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:55.920> Hardy<00:02:56.920> definitely

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
you know 20% done so Hardy definitely

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.069 
you know 20% done so Hardy definitely
with<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.880> advantage<00:02:58.359> in<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.630> game<00:02:58.690> and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
pretty much every facet both players

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.490 
pretty much every facet both players
Tony's<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:01.660> now<00:03:01.810> they're<00:03:01.989> gonna<00:03:02.049> be<00:03:02.200> surprised

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
Tony's so now they're gonna be surprised

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.780 
Tony's so now they're gonna be surprised
when<00:03:02.530> they<00:03:02.769> see<00:03:02.889> their<00:03:03.100> opponents<00:03:03.489> told<00:03:03.670> on<00:03:03.760> us

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
when they see their opponents told on us

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.670 
when they see their opponents told on us
they<00:03:04.000> were<00:03:04.090> not<00:03:04.299> expecting<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.139> now

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
they were not expecting that and now

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.990 
they were not expecting that and now
it's<00:03:05.859> gonna<00:03:05.980> be<00:03:06.130> interesting<00:03:06.310> because<00:03:06.549> these

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
it's gonna be interesting because these

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.449 
it's gonna be interesting because these
players<00:03:07.319> probably<00:03:08.319> don't<00:03:08.829> play<00:03:09.040> Protoss<00:03:09.280> a
