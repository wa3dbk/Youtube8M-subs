00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 how about lady how are we doing well 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.740
 As you can see, this is not done with lake 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.870
 because the two that had got doors 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.340
 a little dead there are in the jungle in the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.320
 jungle in costa rica on coast or 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.240
 challenge ' good are not dead 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.300
 definitely I still have a little 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.250
 la la la the illusion that they are going to relive 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.500
 because they were two I need them very 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.080
 strongly what happened to those two then 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.240
 that instead of taking them to repair as 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.830
 this is worth what I have done is what 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.539
 what I always do when something goes wrong 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.830
 electronic and try it at home which is a 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.050
 remedy of the grandmother but sometimes 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.550
 it works that is what you take what you put in 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.920
 rice and leave it there are a few days 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.329
 rest on rice chicken on rice without making 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.399
 that is, do not put it in the pan that 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.989
 then you have just lost it good 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.550
 I hope that the thing returns to 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.260
 work with what just happened in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.039
 the last days of in costa rica I am 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.750
 making the blog with the sony xperia z 1 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.190
 there you told me that the thing had gone 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.110
 it looked good it sounded good 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.250
 although of a problem and to see if you know 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.989
 how to solve it and leave me here in 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.920
 comments I suppose you are seeing it 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.920
 now sometimes suddenly 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.530
 good means automatic juice and 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.380
 then autofocus forgiveness 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.330
 then suddenly it looks like 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.510
 autofocus if you know how to 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.979
 it takes away to warn me good many you have me 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.470
 asked how you've done these days 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.080
 to recover or how are you going to do to 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.550
 recover from the side adems good to see 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.650
 first of all it has to be a 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.869
 recovery but this change of hands 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.490
 that I am hurting myself and have to 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.009
 be active recovery because of course 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.890
 now I have another challenge and could not 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.990
 get me to recover 100% without doing anything 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.119
 this means old recovery 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.440
 point 1 man ko running I'm not 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.060
 running these days first because 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.590
 had the plants fucked and second 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.050
 because I'm up to the running balls 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.970
 through the jungle so to a week without 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.729
 run that I do instead of running then 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.830
 bicycle things spinning type and things 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.080
 the style bicycle on the road 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.580
 and then swim that are two things that I eat 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.350
 also in the month of May there the ironman 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.850
 from lanzarote and I had these two 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.470
 disciplines a little forgotten because in 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.119
 both for the road and for bed 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.220
 the shawl in alone he had to train 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.840
 more was to run because Asia is doing well 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.250
 therefore not run but first thing 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.509
 train the other two 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.700
 they charge me - also 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.140
 the second very important thing also 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.970
 I have also disconnected from the videos 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.640
 You see, I have not gone up two days 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.260
 fucking video or miracle because there in 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.959
 costa rica I stressed many you know that 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.180
 to me what I like even more so 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.920
 that sport is to be able to document it 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.870
 mount videos give him the tune 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.120
 transmit it and so on 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.590
 and there in costa rica it cost a lot was 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.680
 very difficult I had to record the video 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.080
 many times reduce size take away 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.909
 compress what quality and at the end 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.519
 then I could not even upload it and 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.370
 that could not sleep between stage and stage 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.709
 so for two days zero videos 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.450
 worth second thing this is more for 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.950
 mentally recover that does not stop 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.970
 physically recover next thing that 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.640
 I will use to recover not done 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.430
 still visit here in jordi pairs home 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.280
 of those disparate in the navy so that 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.950
 do that to me already you know that 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.959
 octopus that serves me very well and I 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.510
 leave all legs all the way back 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.400
 everything in the cervicals and everything pointed 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.780
 then visit jordi peers who do not 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.970
 only part of the octopus will do 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.530
 but after a challenge like this in 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.329
 the one that physically and also mentally 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.909
 you're a little fucked up 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:25.010
 let's do that kind of I do not know how 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:26.780
 it's called good quantum resonance 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.609
 those things that put me chips and such 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.769
 I do not know why and ask me as I am 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.180
 force energy such and as a result of that I 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.660
 they end up taking some flowers of bach 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.060
 in 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.710
 dt says and they give them depending on if you 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.200
 it takes a little more energy if you 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.400
 it takes a little more than 50 things that 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.140
 I do not know how to explain very well but when 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.660
 I'm going away, they always do it to me and they 're going 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.250
 very well this accompanied because this 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.860
 important that you do it a 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.900
 blood test when you come from a 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.760
 thing where a country change you change 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.190
 of vaccine continent for some things 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.200
 and also accepted this thing so so 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.940
 Hero and physically and mentally as 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.620
 It is convenient to make a good analysis to see 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.260
 how are you all of all the values 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.970
 if there is any organ that has suffered if 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
 there's something that you're under if 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.190
 you have to compensate in some way 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.280
 etcetera and finally and record resource 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.710
 raised not so much has helped with these 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.500
 analysis I get the catalan 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.000
 to visit to get stronger as 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.190
 you know, they are bringing me the subject of 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.140
 nutrition and even diet subject 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.940
 to see what fuck these things lost 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.320
 quite a few kilos of these days there are in the 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.570
 jungle then to see that he has not lost 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.460
 quite too many or to see that all 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.710
 it's okay to go find what good 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.600
 Well the isotonic as always but 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.520
 also maybe or some vitamin or some 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.480
 muscle recuperator in the case that 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.460
 I needed 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.530
 as I was saying all this has always 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.570
 backed now think about the word 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.000
 by the analyzes to see that everything is going 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.780
 well and that after a stranger like 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.330
 these 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.250
 everything is in its place so you're more 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.460
 or less recovery a little bit of 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.980
 recover legs a little recover 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.540
 with disconnect a bit of recover with 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.490
 description of here disconnection also 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.770
 of running and then the most part of 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.200
 health go through get stronger but 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.580
 the analyzes go through amaina and yet 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.110
 this together see that everything is ready 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.270
 because in two months it's a 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.190
 challenge that again is by stages that another 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.900
 there are many kilometers and it is 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.640
 wind that cross the desert goes like you 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.900
 he said leave here in comments to see 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.900
 if you know what this challenge is
