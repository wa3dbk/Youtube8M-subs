 Hello guys, I have not seen you for a long time 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.830
 while I can say and basically 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.680
 lesson I want to talk about how 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.189
 fix error when not running 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.330
 any game and he writes something that doesn't 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:22.970
 lack of any file exactly 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:27.740
 as you can see, I myself play dota to all my son 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.550
 and so on and I got a mistake then 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.920
 what's missing so here's a file ready 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.640
 exactly what to do next 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.420
 asked around from friends and found out all the kravets 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.020
 it was very very easy to give them 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:49.070
 valid dota 2 files missing 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.769
 and it doesn't start we go 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.870
 I like to bake 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:01:00.210
 two right- click properties and 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:05.159
 go here tour's local wigs and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.759
 click to check the integrity of the cache but 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:18.930
 not full shells know how to manifest 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:22.979

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.649

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.149

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.149
