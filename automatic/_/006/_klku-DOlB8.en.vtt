00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.120
 I present you a new cydia tweak 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.259
 which is called touch bar and who will we 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.870
 enable or disable 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.010
 very quickly some settings there by 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.850
 example I press the points of 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.230
 network and hop 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.060
 look I went immediately in 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.890
 airplane mode and vice versa if I laugh 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.420
 leaning on the little plane if I would have 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.599
 properly support it I miss it 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.160
 it's not going to work I'm going back 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.779
 in normal mode so it's small 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.279
 disadvantage it must be precise 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.899
 correctly in the right place 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.399
 there for example with the battery that 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.719
 shows me the percentage even though I have 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.860
 not activated in the settings and in 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.850
 pressing on them that shows me 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 clock application 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.600
 so that's the principle you can 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.219
 to enable or disable some 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.039
 system settings without going through the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.180
 settings directly by pressing 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.410
 then if we go to the settings 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.210
 and caen goes down all the way down the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.559
 tweak touch bar section 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.780
 find some small options of 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.789
 personalization my first method 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.020
 activation that through an active gesture 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.520
 wrongly will allow us to do 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.210
 to appear another small menu of 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.010
 quick setting 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.030
 I choose a slip towards the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.680
 left on the status bar and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.220
 watch what happens when I do 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.320
 this movement 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.390
 hop I slip and sail what appears 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.979
 a very fast access bar still a 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.840
 times to some system settings for 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.400
 easily enable or disable them 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.600
 we can slide to the right or to 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 the left to make them all appear 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.460
 and we also have control of the music 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.710
 we have for example the wifi localization 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.150
 the bluetooth the torch a lot of things 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.680
 that we normally find in fact in 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.750
 ayo control center and 7 except 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.310
 that there you have many more these 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.840
 shortcuts precisely you find them 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.850
 here in the configuration panel of 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.829
 touch bar and you will be able to them 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.780
 organize in the order that you like there 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.979
 for example their mind neg you see 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.479
 received first position 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.100
 so you can choose the order and 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.869
 then bring up this menu from 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.479
 anywhere thanks to your active action 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.979
 wrongly and change the settings so 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.240
 that's how it all works 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.310
 you are interested you go on 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.979

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.750
 like these it costs $ 1 available 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.290
 on the source of big boss and can you 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.329
 and set 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.740
 with him so you can a little bit 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.659
 in the manner of what is already proposed 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.100
 control center of a bone 7 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.600
 iv or disable very easily 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.340
 some system settings through this 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.259
 menu or so directly by pressing 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.849
 above from anywhere springboard 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.709
 applications and same screen 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.480
