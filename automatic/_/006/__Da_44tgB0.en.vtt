bet<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:49.120> look<00:02:49.480> at<00:02:49.630> this<00:02:49.810> Phil<00:02:50.200> lays<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.680> down

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.080 

you<00:02:55.840> can't<00:02:56.140> blame<00:02:56.500> him<00:02:56.650> if<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.370> adjusted<00:02:57.880> had

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
you can't blame him if it adjusted had

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.630 
you can't blame him if it adjusted had
up<00:02:58.239> or<00:02:58.450> three<00:02:58.690> handed<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.200> start<00:02:59.530> he<00:03:00.459> would

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
up or three handed to start he would

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.070 
up or three handed to start he would
have<00:03:00.760> paid<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.090> off<00:03:01.239> there<00:03:01.540> but<00:03:01.690> when<00:03:01.870> eight

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
have paid it off there but when eight

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.440 
have paid it off there but when eight
people<00:03:02.350> come<00:03:02.739> in<00:03:03.040> it's<00:03:03.580> just<00:03:03.850> really<00:03:04.060> hard<00:03:04.330> to

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
people come in it's just really hard to

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.610 
people come in it's just really hard to
believe<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.900> someone<00:03:05.170> didn't<00:03:05.470> make

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
believe that someone didn't make

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.930 
believe that someone didn't make
something<00:03:06.010> when<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.220> six<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.519> Hearts<00:03:06.700> came

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
something when the six of Hearts came

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.150 
something when the six of Hearts came
off
