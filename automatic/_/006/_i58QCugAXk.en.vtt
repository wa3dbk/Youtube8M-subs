00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.080
 Hello everyone today, we will look at 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:11.969
 anti-recoil mechanism 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.820
 it means you need to reduce returns when 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.100
 well, in our case, that is 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.100
 if consider spout 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.029
 the house is just like an effect shot and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:30.060
 generally looks very cool now 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:32.090
 I'll show you how our gun works 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.750
 not a frog the detail is just 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.760
 plastic part 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:44.190
 from the gun it seems what the hell not 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:48.710
 who am i using tape avenue flew like that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.710
 so look at the gun 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.960
 that is, that's when the hour was 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:08.509
 here you can in different ways here this thing and 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:13.979
 you can hang around quickly you can slowly 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:21.750
 Here there is quickly more accurately this average on 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:25.220
 so now we will slowly do this 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:30.470
 Now I will explain in more detail 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.470
 means 6 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.430
 then below we have a styling platform 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.540
 will be 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:49.500
 and on it, too, strange as it may be laying 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:52.110
 but there should be a platform 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.620
 Circuit to hook 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:03.210
 here it is the gun to cling to us 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:04.910
 so here it means it is stretched on with 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.009
 rubber band 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:14.430
 so on top 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:21.450
 gun here it is touch and now this 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.440
 the gun we already pull the bottom first 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.950
 a platform 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:34.080
 Here she pulls on the bottom means us 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:38.330
 more correct part well, then the length of 4 there are three 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.350
 that is, they must be different in length 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:46.250
 It surely comb at the same time 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.920
 lower and upper platform work 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.400
 it means that we are inserting and 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:58.280
 fixed we now stretch 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:03.640
 top platform and here also fix 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.730
 now when we clean here with us 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.110
 first back gun 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.909
 Now here's a further pull and now forward 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.909
 I think you understand the mechanism 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.980
 here 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.170
 Grandma is not doing very well 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.069
 everything looks 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:34.000
 Means cons of course there is this the fact that 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:37.390
 very big mechanism but by the way i am 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.810
 did a smaller version but so he and 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.330
 will look 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:50.040
 communities here gum take something from me 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.040
 lack of rezininka tighten in the usa 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:17.830
 wait a bit now 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:23.990
 You can rewind if you want and then 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:27.320
 Now stretch the means to our gun well 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.280
 Unfortunately this colorful life I ask 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.520
 no more such details are black or 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.750
 dark green means the same mechanism 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.780
 Only he have less meaning it here 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.730
 fits in a smaller tank so 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.320
 it means that we have a part that 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.380
 will fix 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:55.790
 we have to move a little bit and because 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.700
 here we have a gap between these 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:03.310
 holes we have books whether adam was 4 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.310
 that is , there should be three 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.150
 so I can not stretch 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:21.710
 so here is the nail 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:26.260
 comfortable very well and now up here 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:29.510
 everything can still work a little bit 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.830
 shoot, you can write caliber change 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:36.860
 different well, that is 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:38.449
 the barrel can be well let's put this 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.460
 let's say 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:44.440
 thinner can 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.440
 by the way, you can have such an account 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:53.040
 Now such we had a can in his stead 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.040
 such to become that in general howitzers such was 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.750
 by the way about the tanks 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:08.060
 about olega tank will not go out because 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:11.660
 that my computer broke down and I kind of 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:18.580
 did tanks for pics on the Internet then 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:23.660
 There is in the pictures I was looking for not myself of course 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:26.620
 Memory like well tanks online 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:33.590
 pictures to 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:38.060
 back here it is necessary equally 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:40.610
 who writes here to make well e 100 or mouse 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:45.650
 well and I will not do them yet because 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:49.040
 I do not have wide wheels here but a caterpillar 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:53.290
 i'm too short i mean well not 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.290
 details yet still not enough yet 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:04.330
 and about t-34 there panther 4 or sherman 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:08.550
 well, I won't do them either yet because 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:11.320
 well, there are already a lot of them who did this first 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.710
 secondly, I just do not have such 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.380
 parts and third well i want them 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:20.770
 leave for later when I have 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:23.680
 nice details there is a caterpillar and want them 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.930
 very high quality to do because well 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:32.050
 it's like a massive tank from very 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:35.950
 famous think I said yesterday therefore 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:38.220
 Thank you all for your attention. Good luck to everyone. 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.220
 until
