hello<00:00:02.560> amal<00:00:03.279> so<00:00:04.000> i<00:00:04.029> think<00:00:04.120> this<00:00:04.359> is<00:00:04.420> going<00:00:04.689> to

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:04.779 
hello amal so i think this is going to

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.059 
hello amal so i think this is going to
be<00:00:04.870> one<00:00:05.020> of<00:00:05.050> the<00:00:05.140> few<00:00:05.350> updates<00:00:05.560> that<00:00:06.040> have

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:06.069 
be one of the few updates that have

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:08.070 
be one of the few updates that have
actually<00:00:06.549> interested<00:00:07.390> in<00:00:07.419> me<00:00:07.509> in<00:00:07.810> a<00:00:07.870> while

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
actually interested in me in a while

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.750 
actually interested in me in a while
that's<00:00:08.350> because<00:00:08.620> this<00:00:08.920> update<00:00:09.309> has<00:00:09.580> the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
that's because this update has the

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.699 
that's because this update has the
potential<00:00:10.090> to<00:00:10.240> be<00:00:10.480> good<00:00:10.809> but<00:00:11.230> it<00:00:11.440> kind<00:00:11.680> of

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:11.709 
potential to be good but it kind of

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.160 
potential to be good but it kind of
depends<00:00:12.070> on<00:00:12.219> how<00:00:12.549> it's<00:00:12.760> executed<00:00:13.389> and<00:00:13.570> if<00:00:14.020> it's

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
depends on how it's executed and if it's

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.410 
depends on how it's executed and if it's
balanced<00:00:14.709> or<00:00:14.859> not<00:00:15.010> so<00:00:15.609> what<00:00:15.879> the<00:00:15.940> update<00:00:16.180> is

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
balanced or not so what the update is

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.909 
balanced or not so what the update is
it's<00:00:16.779> going<00:00:16.900> to<00:00:16.960> be<00:00:17.050> falling<00:00:17.320> in<00:00:17.440> the<00:00:17.500> gaps<00:00:17.710> for

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:17.919 
it's going to be falling in the gaps for

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.400 
it's going to be falling in the gaps for
certain<00:00:18.310> patches<00:00:18.789> which<00:00:19.240> are<00:00:19.599> oh<00:00:20.019> I'm<00:00:20.169> talking

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
certain patches which are oh I'm talking

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.870 
certain patches which are oh I'm talking
about<00:00:20.439> farming<00:00:20.890> by<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.039> way<00:00:21.189> like<00:00:21.400> certain

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
about farming by the way like certain

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.790 
about farming by the way like certain
farming<00:00:22.210> patches<00:00:22.570> that<00:00:22.810> pretty<00:00:23.439> much<00:00:23.589> just

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
farming patches that pretty much just

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.130 
farming patches that pretty much just
stopped<00:00:24.189> at<00:00:24.460> like<00:00:24.609> level<00:00:25.060> 50<00:00:25.509> ish<00:00:25.630> and<00:00:25.869> there's

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
stopped at like level 50 ish and there's

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.779 
stopped at like level 50 ish and there's
nothing<00:00:26.380> past<00:00:26.769> that<00:00:26.949> level<00:00:27.249> so<00:00:27.429> they're<00:00:27.609> just

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
nothing past that level so they're just

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.460 
nothing past that level so they're just
going<00:00:27.909> to<00:00:28.029> add<00:00:28.119> more<00:00:28.359> higher<00:00:28.599> level<00:00:28.960> items<00:00:29.079> for

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
going to add more higher level items for

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.409 
going to add more higher level items for
that<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:30.039> it<00:00:30.159> could<00:00:30.279> be<00:00:30.369> used<00:00:30.609> for<00:00:30.789> various

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
that and it could be used for various

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.729 
that and it could be used for various
things<00:00:31.659> so<00:00:31.839> there's<00:00:31.989> going<00:00:32.169> to<00:00:32.259> be<00:00:32.290> like<00:00:32.529> 10

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
things so there's going to be like 10

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.370 
things so there's going to be like 10
new<00:00:32.920> seeds<00:00:33.280> and<00:00:33.550> you<00:00:34.210> should<00:00:34.360> get<00:00:34.450> d<00:00:34.870> seats<00:00:35.170> by

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
new seeds and you should get d seats by

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.990 
new seeds and you should get d seats by
there's<00:00:36.010> a<00:00:36.100> few<00:00:36.340> ways<00:00:36.430> there's<00:00:36.730> like

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
there's a few ways there's like

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.240 
there's a few ways there's like
pickpocketing<00:00:37.720> like<00:00:37.960> level<00:00:38.350> 70<00:00:38.620> thieving<00:00:39.040> for

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
pickpocketing like level 70 thieving for

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.190 
pickpocketing like level 70 thieving for
pickpocketing<00:00:39.970> a<00:00:40.150> paladin<00:00:40.720> then<00:00:40.990> there's

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
pickpocketing a paladin then there's

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.020 
pickpocketing a paladin then there's
like<00:00:41.350> mobilizing<00:00:41.890> army<00:00:42.220> as<00:00:42.400> well<00:00:42.610> as<00:00:42.790> mine

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
like mobilizing army as well as mine

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.150 
like mobilizing army as well as mine
sweeper<00:00:43.450> oh<00:00:43.690> I'm<00:00:44.260> sorry<00:00:44.410> I<00:00:44.530> mean<00:00:44.830> buying

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
sweeper oh I'm sorry I mean buying

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.320 
sweeper oh I'm sorry I mean buying
sweeper<00:00:45.580> I<00:00:45.640> think<00:00:45.850> that's<00:00:46.000> what<00:00:46.150> it's<00:00:46.270> called

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
sweeper I think that's what it's called

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.110 
sweeper I think that's what it's called
so<00:00:47.110> these<00:00:47.410> are<00:00:47.620> just<00:00:47.770> higher<00:00:48.100> level<00:00:48.460> seats<00:00:48.670> to

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
so these are just higher level seats to

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.750 
so these are just higher level seats to
you<00:00:50.110> know<00:00:50.200> just<00:00:50.440> add<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:50.650> like<00:00:51.130> allotments

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
you know just add to like allotments

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.090 
you know just add to like allotments
there's<00:00:51.970> cacti<00:00:52.450> and<00:00:52.480> bushes<00:00:53.110> flowers<00:00:53.650> hops

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
there's cacti and bushes flowers hops

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.590 
there's cacti and bushes flowers hops
crops<00:00:54.520> that<00:00:54.820> kind<00:00:55.060> of<00:00:55.090> stuff<00:00:55.240> pretty<00:00:55.420> much

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
crops that kind of stuff pretty much

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.720 
crops that kind of stuff pretty much
anything<00:00:55.930> besides<00:00:56.470> trees<00:00:56.950> four<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.580> those

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
anything besides trees four of those

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.640 
anything besides trees four of those
seats<00:00:58.090> will<00:00:58.330> be<00:00:58.360> used<00:00:58.810> to<00:00:58.900> produce<00:00:59.050> herb<00:00:59.410> lore

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
seats will be used to produce herb lore

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.010 
seats will be used to produce herb lore
or<00:00:59.710> summoning<00:01:00.580> supplies<00:01:00.910> so<00:01:01.330> for<00:01:01.540> example<00:01:01.570> you

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
or summoning supplies so for example you

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.750 
or summoning supplies so for example you
can<00:01:02.170> see<00:01:02.320> here<00:01:02.650> that<00:01:02.680> for<00:01:03.190> sure<00:01:03.220> we're<00:01:03.730> going

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
can see here that for sure we're going

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.310 
can see here that for sure we're going
to<00:01:03.910> have<00:01:04.059> a<00:01:04.089> snake<00:01:04.360> grass<00:01:04.600> seed<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.049> it's

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
to have a snake grass seed and it's

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.959 
to have a snake grass seed and it's
probably<00:01:05.470> gonna<00:01:05.710> look<00:01:05.950> like<00:01:06.100> this<00:01:06.340> and<00:01:06.609> be

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:06.969 
probably gonna look like this and be

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:09.690 
probably gonna look like this and be
used<00:01:07.210> in<00:01:07.450> allotment<00:01:08.229> although<00:01:08.710> for<00:01:09.039> the<00:01:09.340> other

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
used in allotment although for the other

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.940 
used in allotment although for the other
possible<00:01:10.359> choices<00:01:10.630> I<00:01:10.840> look<00:01:11.200> through<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.439> lot<00:01:11.829> of

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
possible choices I look through a lot of

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.950 
possible choices I look through a lot of
them<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.280> none<00:01:12.909> of<00:01:12.939> them<00:01:13.149> really<00:01:13.390> makes<00:01:13.719> sense

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
them and none of them really makes sense

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.359 
them and none of them really makes sense
like<00:01:14.200> I<00:01:14.320> looked<00:01:14.530> at<00:01:14.619> something<00:01:14.950> I<00:01:15.009> can't<00:01:15.219> see

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
like I looked at something I can't see

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.219 
like I looked at something I can't see
anything<00:01:15.759> that<00:01:16.240> makes<00:01:16.450> sense<00:01:16.719> that<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.020> can

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
anything that makes sense that you can

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.260 
anything that makes sense that you can
farm<00:01:17.499> but<00:01:17.710> I<00:01:17.829> guess<00:01:18.009> I'll<00:01:18.369> be<00:01:18.700> proven<00:01:19.060> wrong

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
farm but I guess I'll be proven wrong

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.239 
farm but I guess I'll be proven wrong
when<00:01:19.539> they<00:01:19.689> eventually<00:01:19.810> make<00:01:20.319> it<00:01:20.469> unless

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
when they eventually make it unless

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:22.709 
when they eventually make it unless
they're<00:01:21.490> making<00:01:21.909> a<00:01:21.939> new<00:01:21.969> pouch<00:01:22.299> but<00:01:22.539> that's

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
they're making a new pouch but that's

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.469 
they're making a new pouch but that's
kind<00:01:23.049> of<00:01:23.140> unlikely<00:01:23.950> so<00:01:24.609> like<00:01:24.999> I<00:01:25.119> said<00:01:25.179> there's

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
kind of unlikely so like I said there's

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.300 
kind of unlikely so like I said there's
going<00:01:25.719> to<00:01:25.780> be<00:01:25.840> 10<00:01:26.079> new<00:01:26.229> scenes<00:01:26.499> for<00:01:26.890> what's

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
going to be 10 new scenes for what's

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.980 
going to be 10 new scenes for what's
going<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.460> be<00:01:27.579> related<00:01:27.999> to<00:01:28.030> like<00:01:28.420> making

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
going to be related to like making

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.020 
going to be related to like making
secondaries<00:01:29.710> or<00:01:29.920> whatever<00:01:30.280> for<00:01:30.609> herb<00:01:30.819> lore

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
secondaries or whatever for herb lore

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.969 
secondaries or whatever for herb lore
and<00:01:31.240> something<00:01:31.509> supplies<00:01:31.899> another<00:01:32.469> 4<00:01:32.799> will<00:01:32.950> be

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
and something supplies another 4 will be

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.219 
and something supplies another 4 will be
used<00:01:33.369> to<00:01:33.490> give<00:01:33.609> skill<00:01:33.909> boost<00:01:34.149> of<00:01:34.299> some<00:01:34.479> sort<00:01:34.749> so

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
used to give skill boost of some sort so

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.230 
used to give skill boost of some sort so
so<00:01:35.380> far<00:01:35.530> as<00:01:35.619> I<00:01:35.710> was<00:01:35.859> eight<00:01:36.039> of<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.520> 10<00:01:36.759> new

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
so far as I was eight of the 10 new

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.450 
so far as I was eight of the 10 new
seeds<00:01:37.569> so<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.229> last<00:01:38.409> two<00:01:38.710> one<00:01:39.069> of<00:01:39.159> them<00:01:39.280> is

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
seeds so the last two one of them is

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.819 
seeds so the last two one of them is
going<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:39.729> be<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:39.999> God<00:01:40.149> seeds<00:01:40.539> which<00:01:41.319> will<00:01:41.590> make

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
going to be to God seeds which will make

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.499 
going to be to God seeds which will make
the<00:01:41.979> gut<00:01:42.130> grapes<00:01:42.429> and<00:01:42.729> for<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.030> wording<00:01:43.299> of<00:01:43.359> it

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
the gut grapes and for the wording of it

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.300 
the gut grapes and for the wording of it
it<00:01:43.630> sounds<00:01:43.960> like<00:01:44.109> there's<00:01:44.439> only<00:01:44.649> one<00:01:45.009> gutsy

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
it sounds like there's only one gutsy

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.849 
it sounds like there's only one gutsy
which<00:01:45.999> will<00:01:46.270> produce<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.899> sarahs<00:01:47.259> a<00:01:47.439> me<00:01:47.499> and

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
which will produce to sarahs a me and

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:49.949 
which will produce to sarahs a me and
gothics<00:01:48.340> grapes<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:49.209> it<00:01:49.479> seems<00:01:49.600> like<00:01:49.810> it's

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
gothics grapes so it seems like it's

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.809 
gothics grapes so it seems like it's
more<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.319> universal<00:01:50.920> seed<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.340> looking<00:01:51.729> at

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
more of a universal seed and looking at

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.160 
more of a universal seed and looking at
the<00:01:51.909> grapevine<00:01:52.329> to<00:01:52.509> get<00:01:52.659> totally<00:01:52.929> seed

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
the grapevine to get totally seed

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.770 
the grapevine to get totally seed
there's<00:01:53.409> a<00:01:53.499> red<00:01:53.829> white<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.549> blue<00:01:54.880> great<00:01:55.299> so<00:01:55.749> I

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
there's a red white and blue great so I

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.539 
there's a red white and blue great so I
guess<00:01:55.899> red<00:01:56.109> for<00:01:56.289> Sammy<00:01:56.469> wait<00:01:56.829> for<00:01:57.009> gothics<00:01:57.340> and

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
guess red for Sammy wait for gothics and

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.510 
guess red for Sammy wait for gothics and
blue<00:01:57.729> for<00:01:57.969> Sarah<00:01:58.299> and<00:01:58.450> as<00:01:59.289> well<00:01:59.679> grapes<00:02:00.100> grapes

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
blue for Sarah and as well grapes grapes

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.929 
blue for Sarah and as well grapes grapes
mix<00:02:00.969> wine<00:02:01.299> and<00:02:01.600> zemra<00:02:02.469> quantaray<00:02:03.100> exists<00:02:03.729> but

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
mix wine and zemra quantaray exists but

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.699 
mix wine and zemra quantaray exists but
it's<00:02:04.149> introducing<00:02:04.779> this<00:02:04.990> are<00:02:05.170> dumb<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:05.499> wine

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
it's introducing this are dumb and wine

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.550 
it's introducing this are dumb and wine
and<00:02:06.069> the<00:02:06.279> gothics<00:02:06.609> one<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.090> if<00:02:07.359> you<00:02:08.259> look<00:02:08.410> at

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
and the gothics one and if you look at

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.289 
and the gothics one and if you look at
the<00:02:08.649> video<00:02:08.890> there's<00:02:09.130> even<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.520> super<00:02:09.879> zemerik

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
the video there's even a super zemerik

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.509 
the video there's even a super zemerik
wine<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:10.780> maybe<00:02:10.959> there<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.319> super<00:02:11.769> serum<00:02:12.159> in

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
wine so maybe there is a super serum in

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:13.520 
wine so maybe there is a super serum in
wine<00:02:12.760> and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
wine and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.400 
wine and
for<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.860> effect<00:02:14.100> i<00:02:14.220> don't<00:02:14.880> really<00:02:15.150> know<00:02:15.410> one

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
for the effect i don't really know one

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.470 
for the effect i don't really know one
thing<00:02:16.590> they<00:02:16.770> did<00:02:17.040> not<00:02:17.250> mention<00:02:17.459> was<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.060> temp

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
thing they did not mention was the temp

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.270 
thing they did not mention was the temp
seed<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.260> I'm<00:02:19.410> actually<00:02:19.530> glad<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.010> they

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
seed and I'm actually glad that they

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.860 
seed and I'm actually glad that they
didn't<00:02:20.610> tell<00:02:20.760> us<00:02:20.790> because<00:02:20.940> if<00:02:21.360> they<00:02:21.540> explained

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
didn't tell us because if they explained

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.930 
didn't tell us because if they explained
everything<00:02:22.260> now<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:23.010> what's<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> point<00:02:23.520> of

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
everything now like what's the point of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.660 
everything now like what's the point of
actually<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.690> update<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.130> do<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:26.340> an

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
actually going to update so I do have an

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.790 
actually going to update so I do have an
idea<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.030> what<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.420> 10th<00:02:27.660> seed<00:02:28.050> maybe<00:02:28.530> I'm

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
idea of what the 10th seed maybe I'm

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.130 
idea of what the 10th seed maybe I'm
thinking<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.580> kind<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.180> one<00:02:30.420> as<00:02:30.660> this

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
thinking it's kind of this one as this

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.720 
thinking it's kind of this one as this
wasn't<00:02:31.530> really<00:02:31.739> identified<00:02:32.250> as<00:02:32.430> anything

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
wasn't really identified as anything

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.660 
wasn't really identified as anything
else<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.720> looks<00:02:34.020> rather<00:02:34.620> unique<00:02:35.250> so

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
else and it looks rather unique so

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.490 
else and it looks rather unique so
that's<00:02:36.030> all<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.360> information<00:02:36.690> given<00:02:37.200> from

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
that's all the information given from

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500 
that's all the information given from
the<00:02:37.560> BTS<00:02:38.100> video<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.610> few<00:02:38.790> observation<00:02:39.420> I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
the BTS video but a few observation I

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.420 
the BTS video but a few observation I
wanted<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.870> know<00:02:40.020> was<00:02:40.350> what<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.040> Venus

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
wanted to know was what is this Venus

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.940 
wanted to know was what is this Venus
flytrap<00:02:42.209> thing<00:02:42.450> if<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.290> one<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.770> ones

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
flytrap thing if this is one of the ones

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.710 
flytrap thing if this is one of the ones
used<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.520> herb<00:02:44.670> lore<00:02:44.850> or<00:02:45.030> something<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.480> can't

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
used for herb lore or something I can't

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.000 
used for herb lore or something I can't
really<00:02:45.840> think<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.200> what<00:02:46.350> kind<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.560> secondary

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
really think of what kind of secondary

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.310 
really think of what kind of secondary
it<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.000> I'm<00:02:48.390> pretty<00:02:48.540> much<00:02:48.720> assuming<00:02:49.170> that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
it is and I'm pretty much assuming that

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.860 
it is and I'm pretty much assuming that
this<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.830> barbary<00:02:50.190> bushes<00:02:50.610> with<00:02:51.030> like<00:02:51.570> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
this is the barbary bushes with like the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.870 
this is the barbary bushes with like the
thing<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.200> left<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.800> right<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.220> when

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
thing on the left to the right and when

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.610 
thing on the left to the right and when
harvesting<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.570> seems<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.110> jump<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
harvesting it seems like you jump and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.170 
harvesting it seems like you jump and
grab<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.980> bearing<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.430> top<00:02:56.700> avoiding

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
grab the bearing on the top avoiding

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.790 
grab the bearing on the top avoiding
spikes<00:02:57.570> from<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.840> plant<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:58.380> I'm<00:02:58.440> kind<00:02:58.739> of

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
spikes from the plant but I'm kind of

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.229 
spikes from the plant but I'm kind of
confused<00:02:58.980> as<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.580> kind<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.760> looks<00:02:59.940> like<00:03:00.030> your

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
confused as it kind of looks like your

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.120 
confused as it kind of looks like your
player<00:03:00.630> avatar<00:03:01.230> seems<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.650> eat<00:03:01.830> something

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130

and the bush seems like there's nothing
left<00:03:09.300> behind<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:09.840> it's<00:03:10.019> gone<00:03:10.260> like<00:03:10.560> there's

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
left behind like it's gone like there's

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.380 
left behind like it's gone like there's
nothing<00:03:11.100> left<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:11.580> normally<00:03:12.060> when<00:03:12.269> you

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
nothing left like normally when you

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.120 
nothing left like normally when you
harvest<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.810> bush<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.319> just<00:03:13.530> set<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.739> return<00:03:13.980> in

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
harvest a bush you just set to return in

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.520 
harvest a bush you just set to return in
a<00:03:14.280> few<00:03:14.430> hours<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:14.970> I'll<00:03:15.330> grow<00:03:15.630> back<00:03:15.959> whereas

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
a few hours and I'll grow back whereas

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.229 
a few hours and I'll grow back whereas
it<00:03:16.980> doesn't<00:03:17.370> look<00:03:17.430> like<00:03:17.610> anything's<00:03:18.030> there

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
it doesn't look like anything's there

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.509 
it doesn't look like anything's there
and<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:19.019> last<00:03:19.200> thing<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.590> note<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:20.010> if<00:03:20.370> you're

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
and the last thing to note is if you're

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.220 
and the last thing to note is if you're
going<00:03:20.760> for<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:20.940> grapes<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.660> seems<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.079> like

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
going for the grapes it seems to like

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.229 
going for the grapes it seems to like
you'll<00:03:22.470> need<00:03:22.739> 5<00:03:23.040> plates<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.549> make<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.820> trellis

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
you'll need 5 plates to make the trellis

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.789 
you'll need 5 plates to make the trellis
and<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.540> trellis<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.320> artificial

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
and the trellis is the artificial

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.289 
and the trellis is the artificial
support<00:03:26.130> system<00:03:26.459> for<00:03:26.489> grace<00:03:26.880> which<00:03:27.150> is

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
support system for grace which is

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.479 
support system for grace which is
basically<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.440> support<00:03:28.769> system<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.400> I'm

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
basically the support system so I'm

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.539 
basically the support system so I'm
pretty<00:03:29.670> much<00:03:30.000> looking<00:03:30.390> forward<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:30.930> as

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
pretty much looking forward to this as

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.610 
pretty much looking forward to this as
much<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.150> previous<00:03:33.540> up<00:03:33.690> they<00:03:33.810> have<00:03:34.079> seemed

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
much of the previous up they have seemed

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.120 
much of the previous up they have seemed
and<00:03:34.920> significant<00:03:35.700> or<00:03:35.850> just<00:03:36.350> uninteresting<00:03:37.350> so

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
and significant or just uninteresting so

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.350 
and significant or just uninteresting so
I'm<00:03:38.190> kind<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.430> interested<00:03:38.610> in<00:03:38.940> what<00:03:39.180> kind<00:03:39.329> of

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360
