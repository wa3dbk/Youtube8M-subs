00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.680
 the people of youtube how are I 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.950
 carlos ann or also known as 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:12.330
 snacks and we're in a new video on the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.350
 today's video as you will see we have an apple 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.510
 watch demo 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.580
 on a website this is the website 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.950
 as you can see 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.350
 this is the page 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.340
 and now we are going to test a bit 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.439
 as you can see 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.100
 you can not give it but 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.100
 and we can 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.899
 or 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 error 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.990
 it's like the home stop button 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.750
 and then we can see instagram 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.750
 messages or time 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.320
 or not 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.570
 here we can observe as if he did not know 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.870
 I found a song 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.470
 Y 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.810
 phone 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.869
 and we can put a song 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.360
 going up obviously serves us since this 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.360
 it's a demo 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.360
 we will find 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.540
 I think 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:42.770
 we can see this that it's like a call 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.770
 what will be in the whatsapp 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.539
 we can also find the clock and 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.210
 we can see that it is very beautiful 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:56.830
 we will raise the brightness of our ipad 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.870
 it is not here 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.190
 so you can observe it better there what 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.930
 you can see 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.930
 and what else can we observe 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.670
 instagram 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.530
 but then obviously it's not instagram anymore 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.850
 that as I say this is a demo 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.830
 and we can see what would come 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.260
 health the application that would be linked with 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.600
 the application of our devices 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.030
 mobile mail 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.950
 here we could see the emails that we 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.480
 they have arrived maybe not all complete 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.250
 but if a small detail of them 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.400
 its weather 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.890
 san francisco as you can see now is 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.890
 that the bag is very good 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.410
 as well 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.130
 settings 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.920
 if you realize this it seems as if 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.610
 go android 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.650
 Android on smart watch and good to me 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.650
 I figure clash of plants 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.960
 I do not understand how to play class 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.020
 klinz here but 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.660
 Well this is it and that 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.840
 and then already maps that maybe we can 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.110
 serve as gps exactly if it's like 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.500
 you can see here the route of a 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.690
 point to another 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.670
 and well I think that has been all already 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:41.130
 sanz and haberos is not that 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.460
 I would like to change the background to this to 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.370
 clock 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.610
 to the water but I've realized that 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.340
 it may be possible good people if you 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.150
 they want 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.629
 see this apple watch in a web version 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.489
 in a demo like here it says it just 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.879
 that's how I can not put the link to the 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:06.690
 page for copyright reasons but 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:08.879
 this is so write down the triple w demo 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.129
 dotcom watch 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.290
 it is very easy neither diagonal nor 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.320
 nothing of that and I hope that what 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.010
 enjoy and if it is working 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.799
 well thank you people this has been all 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.409
 until now 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.069
 soon I do not know if it goes up first 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:29.690
 to the video of the mini ipads review or 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.400
 the one with the dust 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.680
 I think this will go up but I hope that 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.960
