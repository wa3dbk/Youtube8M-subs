the<00:05:28.090> Hall<00:05:28.270> of<00:05:28.300> Fame<00:05:28.419> and<00:05:28.780> I<00:05:28.840> can't<00:05:29.020> remember

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
the Hall of Fame and I can't remember

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.070

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
what number I said was angle but I think

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.020 
what number I said was angle but I think
if<00:05:32.200> he<00:05:32.380> was<00:05:32.680> closer<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:33.580> his<00:05:33.760> date<00:05:33.940> of

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
if he was closer to his date of

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.400 
if he was closer to his date of
retirement<00:05:34.300> he<00:05:34.630> would<00:05:34.810> be<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.050> guy<00:05:35.169> going

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
retirement he would be the guy going

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.930 
retirement he would be the guy going
into<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.740> Hall<00:05:35.890> of<00:05:35.950> Fame<00:05:36.220> because<00:05:36.460> I<00:05:36.730> can't

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
into the Hall of Fame because I can't

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
think of anybody else that really

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.640 
think of anybody else that really

they that was the highest peak and I

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.930 
they that was the highest peak and I
