00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 So I put because covers report 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.410
 before you want because it whether lower 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.570
 pot minecraft mods have it 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.730
 really really wanted more 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.710
 people and of course I do that 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.830
 then for you and after the intro 's 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.830
 Come on 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.189
 now generally tech report for a 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.470
 new dimension with new opsource and 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.270
 some other no but in the 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.059
 super world is also inserted and what 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:41.629
 Although this is the dect repeater 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:44.120
 drove in the ear when you break that down and 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.400
 melting cook you get to gretchen 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.260
 charts and from this war in black 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.190
 you can make armor like 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.260
 you see and a tool but what else 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.040
 we can not do that special 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.219
 have sticks 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.170
 That's why I come to it later but one 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.110
 may be out of this copy protection too 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.869
 make blocks and get four copies of chance 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.780
 you get two bloggers and from these 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.149
 blocks can then make a portal 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.619
 but also come the same and you can 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.649
 also from four carport 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.539
 whole block will cost the portal 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.960
 you look like a normal male portal 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.490
 only by this war charts one can 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.890
 it is not a style shotguns 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.069
 kindling so long needs a war 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.200
 in start and then but already the 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:31.610
 portal ready 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.819
 otherwise lesson a bit and we are 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.920
 already in the new world what you to the 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.020
 World can say it is a self 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.420
 constructive world that means you can here 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.020
 live without always in the upper world too 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.420
 because there is wood stone here 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.610
 food and yes besides that is the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.500
 whole world not destructible by tnt 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.570
 that means you can not do anything with it 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.340
 to block explosives 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.640
 we come to the rocks to rock out of the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.109
 Wood can be as usual 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.360
 wooden boards make out of the board and 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.039
 sticks and from these sticks you can 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.170
 now finally the tool 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.849
 make the motto what I already you 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.879
 I have shown what I have to do before 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.980
 namely power could out of the stone 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.830
 is very cool you can also easter 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.569
 and make a tool that works you stop 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.180
 How to normally direction and 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.920
 makes tool and yes out of the wood can 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.420
 Of course you can also make tools 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.760
 Clearly now to the doctors there 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.010
 three new doctors in the world and that 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.380
 the first is always the same as what you get 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.510
 also in the Upper world from which he had 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.730
 have also made the portal then 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.640
 you can feel that then they will work 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.620
 there's a photo murder that's a kind of coal 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.450
 you can do it as a torch and 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.450
 It is also a fuel who sows and 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.519
 Then there is the timor this can be 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.160
 Burn yourself then you get 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.360
 the system can also be a tool 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.220
 and make armor 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.720
 now we come to the exclusive 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.459
 dinner there are three blocks of decks 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.440
 can serve once the epic ripper 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.690
 dynamite the script star nikola team squad 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.489
 It costs to be reporter you get 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.739
 out of these blocks that's a kind 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.470
 Monastery I find you expect me in this 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.950
 world a whole block then I have 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.900
 already showed at the beginning of the models and 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.700
 Settlement vaporizer man 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.489
 Unfortunately, I have no idea always that 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.889
 vigorously have the internet too 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.049
 nothing found if they know the 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.420
 comments what makes us catch 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.849
 right with that, that's really cool 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.599
 kilometers it can even be this world 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.359
 to destroy 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.959
 although he is not influenced by tnt 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:42.840
 is and that's why it means to go away 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.769
 Green is to me from the group 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.230
 voluntarily reported 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.609
 there are tenth what 1 group bit 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.609
 has larger spring radius 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.480
 a longer ignites and cds already a 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.230
 pretty big spring radios under 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.519
 camcorder blog do you think that one 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.500
 small tnt what directly explodes it 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.470
 Of course there are also decorations left 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.379
 as well as doors half- steps or so 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.239
 tricks how to use the forces of awg clear 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.250
 just like in the upper world has only with 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.079
 the other materials as here now 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.540
 for example, from these four kriebstein 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.120
 So klitschko briggs is coming 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.949
 to say nothing else there is also 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.870
 three new pugs in this murder and 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.130
 twice the neutral inspector the kripo 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.860
 knight and the crew baku 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.320
 the neutral creepers even tied babies 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:40.110

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:42.210
 Only fan attacked the credits at the 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.190
 it is the same as it does nothing except you 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.229
 because then he does catch himself 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.039
 There is a lot of German bank traffic going on 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:52.560
 fell out because he was a bit different 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.690
 and yes the kripo is normal cow again 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.789
 Actually, that's where the food is 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.620
 you can get that world 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:03.479
 Watch this 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.130
 Of course you can advise it and 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.740
 then you bought everything , which of course 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.240
