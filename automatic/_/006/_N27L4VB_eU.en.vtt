00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.310
 a beautiful good morning 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.950
 this seal on a special occasion he had 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.609
 the 250 on the bond market 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:12.609
 For that reason, not even waiting times 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.299
 NRW are located 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.939
 on the forearms 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.300
 The bank has made its way home 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.609
 Some 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.029
 leave some 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.749
 with our way "This is the place German foreign policy needs to age 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.689
 Berlin better that way 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.159
 behind the scenes looks from a 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.090
 similar to the show 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.410
 I just wanted to show her how it looks so easy in 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.090
 Germany 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.520
 The main hall took care of me 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.650
 that's how she looks from safe 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.760
 also in my opinion the largest single project that now here 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.240
 the hall is 90 percent units high in fame but it actually seems 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.990
 just go 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.210
 for one bank they drive smeared locks secured the whole area 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.210
 Good people will come to have access 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.400
 So those torch burns then the part is occupied on the legs around one 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.510
 strand 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.380
 Percent she admits to having seen the slacklines was on most of the time 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.380
 Here you can get by elevator with test runs 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.810
 then we have a built-in now and continue here 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.990
 how does it continue if you put the lever here 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.110
 At the same time that makes the light on the other side that means in the trade 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.890
 and you still can not give 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.430
 Memories then you would have the animal with a right numbers coach 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.860
 or are it for fuel it must of course be the right order 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.960
 come 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.030
 The bank rescue is important, the result is a well-known 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.520
 Test torn ligament times 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.440
 Actually, theme art would have to enter code and then we'll see each other again 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.380
 it just happened on there is also threatened that is 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.150
 now must be within the next 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
 they act as a pretty big one 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.439
 the once Cassano 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:09.999
 that's it 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.329
 I sit down 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.919
 the system is designed that way 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:15.989
 In the main role 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.449
 with this entry to his subject 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:22.419
 I will try my best that can be the descent at a right 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.189
 the system is a fortress based grabbing advantage Federer 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.919
 Analysts go 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.719
 another topic here 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.389
 to pay in advance 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.419
 unfortunately not quite open group does not have them but as it is natural 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:37.609
 also very cool 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.609
 so that's my subject 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.180
 Kamke expects to show the door the children put even when the tracks 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.810
 are 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.559
 how can you send money back? 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.559
 So you do not come when you are as others 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.369
 on the rails on purpose 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.389
 Century something else these cats should 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.069
 I'll go in for one 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.969
 is here after the foul
