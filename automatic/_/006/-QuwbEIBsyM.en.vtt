Galaxy gear VR is something obviously

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.980 
Galaxy gear VR is something obviously
it's<00:01:08.460> my<00:01:08.580> first<00:01:08.820> time<00:01:08.970> using<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.840> have

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it's my first time using it and I have

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.590 
it's my first time using it and I have
to<00:01:10.140> say<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:10.799> really<00:01:11.250> weird<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.970> cool<00:01:12.330> at

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
to say it was really weird and cool at

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.640 
to say it was really weird and cool at
the<00:01:12.720> same<00:01:12.990> time<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.250> was<00:01:14.430> kind<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.060> like

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
the same time so it was kind of like

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.770 
the same time so it was kind of like
obviously<00:01:16.650> virtual<00:01:17.220> reality<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.270> kind

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
obviously virtual reality so it's kind

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.420 
obviously virtual reality so it's kind
of<00:01:18.869> real<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.409> basically<00:01:19.799> eight<00:01:20.150> 360<00:01:21.150> degrees

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
of real it's basically eight 360 degrees

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.340 
of real it's basically eight 360 degrees
screen<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:24.000> obviously<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.080> put<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
screen so obviously you have to put the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.980 
screen so obviously you have to put the
Samsung<00:01:25.710> Galaxy<00:01:26.070> Note<00:01:26.100> 4<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.509> front<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 at the front and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.380 
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 at the front and
that<00:01:28.229> will<00:01:28.290> act<00:01:28.619> as<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.979> screen<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:30.360> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
that will act as the screen and then you

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.240 
that will act as the screen and then you
kind<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.900> wear<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.290> VR<00:01:31.619> over<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.040> head

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
kind of just wear the VR over your head

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.640 
kind of just wear the VR over your head
as<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.299> guys<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.600> see<00:01:33.750> my<00:01:33.900> dad<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.409> video

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
as you guys can see my dad in the video

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.039 
as you guys can see my dad in the video
he<00:01:35.490> actually<00:01:35.820> used<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.180> while<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.360> filmed<00:01:36.840> him

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
he actually used it while I filmed him

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.469 
he actually used it while I filmed him
and<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.100> put<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> VR<00:01:38.729> headset<00:01:39.150> over

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
and so you just put the VR headset over

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.330 
and so you just put the VR headset over
your<00:01:39.630> head<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.140> you're<00:01:40.350> basically<00:01:40.890> entered

into<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.329> virtual<00:01:42.540> reality<00:01:43.290> world<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:44.189> can

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
into the virtual reality world you can

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.819 
into the virtual reality world you can
look<00:01:44.549> at<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:45.030> 360<00:01:45.780> degrees<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.590> you're

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
look at like 360 degrees and you're

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.609 
look at like 360 degrees and you're
basically<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.970> game<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:49.049> also<00:01:49.200> 3d

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.230 
ever seen before and I'm pretty sure the
oculus<00:02:00.240> rift<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:01.100> exact<00:02:02.100> same<00:02:02.280> as<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.850> is

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
oculus rift is exact same as that it is

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.649 
oculus rift is exact same as that it is
sponsored<00:02:03.780> by<00:02:03.990> oculus<00:02:04.799> rift<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.189> think<00:02:05.659> I

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
sponsored by oculus rift so I think I

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.660 
sponsored by oculus rift so I think I
think<00:02:07.500> there's<00:02:07.649> some<00:02:07.770> pop<00:02:07.890> killers<00:02:08.190> rig<00:02:08.369> parts

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
think there's some pop killers rig parts

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.180 
think there's some pop killers rig parts
in<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.629> virtual<00:02:10.020> reality<00:02:10.379> headset<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
in the virtual reality headset and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.890 
in the virtual reality headset and
obviously<00:02:11.730> oculus<00:02:12.209> rift<00:02:12.480> are<00:02:12.629> very<00:02:12.870> popular

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
can't remember the name but it was a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.160 
can't remember the name but it was a
simple<00:02:21.670> arcade<00:02:22.239> game<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.750> had<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> little

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
simple arcade game it had a little

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.690 
simple arcade game it had a little
character<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.950> he<00:02:24.220> was<00:02:24.340> just<00:02:24.430> kind<00:02:24.640> of

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
character and he was just kind of

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.990 
character and he was just kind of
running<00:02:25.060> forward<00:02:25.659> collecting<00:02:26.230> coins<00:02:27.000> but

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
running forward collecting coins but

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.210 
running forward collecting coins but
when<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.510> kind<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.840> jumped<00:02:29.349> towards<00:02:29.980> yourself

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
when you kind of jumped towards yourself

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.149 
when you kind of jumped towards yourself
it<00:02:30.879> looks<00:02:31.090> as<00:02:31.659> if<00:02:31.810> he's<00:02:32.049> coming<00:02:32.409> towards<00:02:32.950> you
