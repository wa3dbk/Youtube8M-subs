00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
top to make a little crease you see how

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.850 
top to make a little crease you see how
that's<00:02:41.569> starting<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:41.990> separate<00:02:42.319> it<00:02:42.470> into<00:02:42.590> two

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
that's starting to separate it into two

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.860 
that's starting to separate it into two
halves<00:02:43.130> just<00:02:43.580> like<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:43.910> that's<00:02:44.480> kind<00:02:44.780> of

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
halves just like that that's kind of

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.020 
halves just like that that's kind of
shallow<00:02:45.110> let's<00:02:45.440> keep<00:02:45.620> going<00:02:45.980> I'm<00:02:46.130> pressing<00:02:46.940> it

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
shallow let's keep going I'm pressing it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.360 
shallow let's keep going I'm pressing it
here<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.510> won't<00:02:47.630> get<00:02:47.780> too<00:02:48.050> wide<00:02:48.349> and<00:02:48.800> I'm

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
here so it won't get too wide and I'm

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.729 
here so it won't get too wide and I'm
going<00:02:49.520> to<00:02:49.550> put<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:49.880> tool<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.780> add<00:02:51.440> more

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739

holding it right at the end and I'm just

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.509 
holding it right at the end and I'm just
bending<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:35.780> that<00:03:35.930> now<00:03:36.110> it's<00:03:36.980> got<00:03:37.220> just<00:03:37.400> a

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
bending it so that now it's got just a

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.280 
bending it so that now it's got just a
little<00:03:37.700> hook<00:03:37.850> you<00:03:38.209> see<00:03:38.360> that<00:03:38.569> it's<00:03:39.170> like

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
little hook you see that it's like

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.470 
little hook you see that it's like
you're<00:03:39.410> fishing<00:03:39.590> for<00:03:39.920> tiny<00:03:40.160> minnows<00:03:40.489> now<00:03:41.390> I'm

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
you're fishing for tiny minnows now I'm

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.940 
you're fishing for tiny minnows now I'm
going<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.690> hold<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:41.930> just<00:03:42.170> above<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:42.500> and

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
going to hold it just above that and

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.270 
going to hold it just above that and
bend<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:43.819> over<00:03:43.880> my<00:03:44.120> thumb<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:45.530> now<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.709> have<00:03:46.040> a

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
bend it over my thumb so now I have a

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.420 
bend it over my thumb so now I have a
little<00:03:47.000> shepherd's<00:03:47.450> crook<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.930> hook<00:03:48.799> will

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
little shepherd's crook that hook will

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.740 
little shepherd's crook that hook will
embed<00:03:49.730> into<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.090> clay<00:03:50.269> when<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.570> clay

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
embed into the clay when the clay

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.780 
embed into the clay when the clay
hardens<00:03:51.019> around<00:03:51.470> it<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:52.010> will<00:03:52.160> keep<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.579> wire

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
hardens around it it will keep that wire

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.160 
hardens around it it will keep that wire
from<00:03:53.060> pulling<00:03:53.329> out<00:03:53.450> because<00:03:53.750> wire<00:03:53.959> doesn't

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
from pulling out because wire doesn't

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.050 
from pulling out because wire doesn't
stick<00:03:54.470> to<00:03:54.590> polymer<00:03:54.890> clay<00:03:55.010> has<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.640> be<00:03:55.730> helped<00:03:56.000> a

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
stick to polymer clay has to be helped a

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.940 
stick to polymer clay has to be helped a
little<00:03:56.180> bit<00:03:56.470> usually<00:03:57.470> you'll<00:03:57.590> have<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.739> little

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
little bit usually you'll have a little

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
bit of a tail left over that you don't

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.780 
bit of a tail left over that you don't
need<00:03:59.660> trim<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:00.410> off<00:04:00.470> please<00:04:01.220> don't<00:04:01.459> aim<00:04:01.609> at

your<00:04:01.910> eyes<00:04:02.030> when<00:04:02.269> you<00:04:02.359> do<00:04:02.450> that<00:04:02.630> keep<00:04:02.900> that

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
your eyes when you do that keep that

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.990 
your eyes when you do that keep that
away<00:04:03.260> from<00:04:03.320> yourself<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.890> others<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.370> now

away from yourself and others and now
we're<00:04:05.180> ready<00:04:05.299> to<00:04:05.420> add<00:04:05.630> it<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.140> clay<00:04:06.670> all

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
we're ready to add it to the clay all

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.759 
we're ready to add it to the clay all
you've<00:04:07.970> got<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.239> do<00:04:08.390> is<00:04:08.600> press<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:08.930> in<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:09.380> I

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
you've got to do is press it in and I

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.199 
you've got to do is press it in and I
only<00:04:09.920> made<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.130> hook<00:04:10.310> on<00:04:10.400> one<00:04:10.579> side<00:04:10.850> because

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
only made a hook on one side because

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.670 
only made a hook on one side because
polymer<00:04:11.540> is<00:04:11.690> very<00:04:11.840> lightweight<00:04:12.049> so<00:04:12.470> it's<00:04:12.590> very

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
polymer is very lightweight so it's very

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.560 
polymer is very lightweight so it's very
easy<00:04:12.799> to<00:04:13.070> wear<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.459> don't<00:04:13.880> need<00:04:14.120> hooks<00:04:14.390> on

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
easy to wear you don't need hooks on

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.210 
easy to wear you don't need hooks on
both<00:04:14.750> sides<00:04:14.989> to<00:04:15.200> keep<00:04:15.350> it<00:04:15.470> in<00:04:15.590> one<00:04:15.620> is<00:04:15.980> enough

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
both sides to keep it in one is enough

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.819 
both sides to keep it in one is enough
all<00:04:16.850> right<00:04:17.150> soften<00:04:17.959> any<00:04:18.049> areas<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:18.530> got<00:04:18.799> a

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
all right soften any areas that got a

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.110 
all right soften any areas that got a
little<00:04:19.039> weird<00:04:19.250> from<00:04:19.489> putting<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.760> hook<00:04:19.910> in

you're ready to embellish that's where

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.120 
you're ready to embellish that's where
your<00:04:23.240> molds<00:04:23.539> come<00:04:23.720> in<00:04:23.870> this<00:04:24.410> is<00:04:24.440> a<00:04:24.620> silicon

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
your molds come in this is a silicon

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.800 
your molds come in this is a silicon
mold<00:04:25.340> it's<00:04:25.610> very<00:04:25.789> rubbery<00:04:26.210> it's<00:04:26.600> very

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
mold it's very rubbery it's very

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.990 
mold it's very rubbery it's very
flexible<00:04:27.140> all<00:04:27.770> you've<00:04:28.250> got<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.550> do<00:04:28.669> is<00:04:28.789> take<00:04:28.970> a

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
flexible all you've got to do is take a

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.540 
flexible all you've got to do is take a
little<00:04:29.300> ball<00:04:29.479> of<00:04:29.660> clay<00:04:29.890> press<00:04:30.890> it<00:04:31.070> into<00:04:31.310> the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
little ball of clay press it into the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.000 
little ball of clay press it into the
mold<00:04:31.780> smoosh<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:32.810> hard<00:04:33.140> because<00:04:33.650> nothing

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
mold smoosh it hard because nothing

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.890 
mold smoosh it hard because nothing
sticks<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.430> silicon<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:35.390> you<00:04:35.450> really<00:04:35.660> have<00:04:35.780> to

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
sticks to silicon so you really have to

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.240 
sticks to silicon so you really have to
make<00:04:36.020> sure<00:04:36.080> you<00:04:36.289> hang<00:04:36.440> on<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:36.860> because<00:04:37.100> see

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
make sure you hang on to it because see

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.159 
make sure you hang on to it because see
how<00:04:37.400> easy<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:37.700> comes<00:04:37.910> off<00:04:38.090> which<00:04:38.840> is<00:04:38.990> good

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
how easy it comes off which is good

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.830 
how easy it comes off which is good
because<00:04:39.560> now<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:39.770> can<00:04:40.039> put<00:04:40.190> that<00:04:40.370> piece<00:04:40.610> right

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
because now I can put that piece right

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.320 
because now I can put that piece right
onto<00:04:41.840> my<00:04:41.960> heart<00:04:42.229> surface<00:04:42.729> you<00:04:43.729> press<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.150> just

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
onto my heart surface you press it just

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.240 
onto my heart surface you press it just
enough<00:04:44.630> for<00:04:44.810> it<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:44.930> grab<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:45.979> can<00:04:46.130> use

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
enough for it to grab and you can use

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.610 
enough for it to grab and you can use
your<00:04:46.370> thumb<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:47.120> kind<00:04:47.300> of<00:04:47.360> drag<00:04:47.840> that<00:04:48.289> clay<00:04:48.560> so

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
your thumb to kind of drag that clay so

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.050 
your thumb to kind of drag that clay so
doesn't<00:04:49.039> it<00:04:49.130> look<00:04:49.310> like<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.580> heart<00:04:49.760> just<00:04:49.789> went

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
doesn't it look like the heart just went

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.450 
doesn't it look like the heart just went
and<00:04:50.240> popped<00:04:50.840> out<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.050> flourish<00:04:51.470> now<00:04:52.220> I<00:04:52.280> made<00:04:52.430> a

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
and popped out a flourish now I made a

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.610 
and popped out a flourish now I made a
few<00:04:52.700> more<00:04:52.940> when<00:04:53.090> you<00:04:53.150> weren't<00:04:53.270> looking

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
few more when you weren't looking

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.160 
few more when you weren't looking
those<00:04:54.770> on<00:04:54.980> there<00:04:55.160> too<00:04:55.930> pressing<00:04:56.930> with<00:04:57.050> my

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
those on there too pressing with my

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.890 
those on there too pressing with my
fingers<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.820> the<00:04:58.820> nice<00:04:59.000> thing<00:04:59.270> about<00:04:59.330> molds

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
fingers and the nice thing about molds

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.400 
fingers and the nice thing about molds
is<00:05:00.100> I'm<00:05:01.100> using<00:05:01.520> bits<00:05:01.970> and<00:05:02.180> pieces<00:05:02.420> from<00:05:02.810> this

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
is I'm using bits and pieces from this

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.230 
is I'm using bits and pieces from this
whole<00:05:03.590> mold<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:04.070> used<00:05:04.280> some<00:05:04.430> flowers<00:05:04.850> here<00:05:05.210> a

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
whole mold I used some flowers here a

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.330 
whole mold I used some flowers here a
flourish<00:05:05.660> there<00:05:05.930> I'm<00:05:06.290> not<00:05:06.560> using<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:07.070> molds

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
flourish there I'm not using the molds

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.490 
flourish there I'm not using the molds
as<00:05:07.430> they<00:05:07.550> were<00:05:07.610> intended<00:05:08.300> I'm<00:05:08.480> using<00:05:09.080> bits<00:05:09.350> and

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
as they were intended I'm using bits and

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.010 
as they were intended I'm using bits and
pieces<00:05:09.650> as<00:05:09.920> it<00:05:10.220> amuses<00:05:10.670> me<00:05:10.700> so<00:05:11.330> just<00:05:11.600> know<00:05:11.780> your

pieces as it amuses me so just know your
molds<00:05:12.320> can<00:05:12.500> be<00:05:12.620> used<00:05:12.860> for<00:05:13.010> many<00:05:13.130> purposes<00:05:13.370> like

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
molds can be used for many purposes like

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.670 
molds can be used for many purposes like
that<00:05:14.000> you<00:05:14.510> don't<00:05:14.690> have<00:05:14.900> to<00:05:15.110> follow<00:05:15.230> the<00:05:15.470> rules

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
all right so now see what I've done is

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.990 
all right so now see what I've done is
I've<00:05:18.320> added<00:05:18.470> a<00:05:18.800> number<00:05:19.010> of<00:05:19.220> little<00:05:19.400> flourishes

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
I've added a number of little flourishes

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.700 
I've added a number of little flourishes
and<00:05:20.180> some<00:05:20.720> of<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:20.870> edges<00:05:21.200> are<00:05:21.320> sticking<00:05:21.620> up

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
and some of the edges are sticking up

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.290 
and some of the edges are sticking up
polymer<00:05:22.160> is<00:05:22.220> okay<00:05:22.520> with<00:05:22.670> that<00:05:22.820> it<00:05:23.270> looks

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
polymer is okay with that it looks

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.660 
polymer is okay with that it looks
terrific<00:05:23.720> this<00:05:24.410> can<00:05:24.740> be<00:05:24.860> done<00:05:25.040> just<00:05:25.250> like<00:05:25.370> this

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670
