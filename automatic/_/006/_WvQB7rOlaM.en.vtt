00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:09.599
 dear friends hello my name is 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:12.450
 igor borah I 'm on the lake now 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.960
 what the Chelyabinsk region 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.960
 this is exactly the lake Taupo kill and 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.330
 which has recently literally been learned 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.720
 from here most of it has fallen yet 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:34.969
 in winter, well, now it's already 8. 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.969
 Here we were driving here the wind is blowing 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:49.340
 okay today i want to show you here 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:55.730
 this lake and now show fell in this 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:01:00.320
 direction here is my toe 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.769
 Now here's how the camera does not allow 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.680
 close so close and here somewhere here in 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.080
 this direction he fell here who is closer 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.890
 so I'll show bedding closer to that 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:17.030
 the government promised to put the bank there 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:21.350
 fight to be seen where he fell but for now 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:26.119
 I don't see him as if in 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.479
 intent in the winter maybe we can 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.860
 we will ride on a snowmobile I will give you this place for 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:37.580
 take off the video and show, I think that in the winter 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.649
 already something there will be installed and will be seen 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.189
 where exactly where did he fall 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:47.689
 coordinates this is his remained so here 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:51.130
 friends here is what the lake looks like 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.130
 now will show panoramic 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.830
 here it is a stone flower resort 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.830
 other shore of this lake 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:08.700
 I show him in such a beach of course for 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:13.580
 the gun is already but the scale of the lake I can give you 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:17.819
 show around the perimeter lake somewhere it 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.780
 about forty kilometers around the perimeter 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.840
 that is, as if a large lake is considered 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:30.120
 Well, here in the area about 5-6 lakes 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:33.769
 it's literally there in 700 800 meters 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.890
 another lake it is called spruce 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:41.519
 so here the edge of the lakes is nature of course 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:47.000
 here are gorgeous guys we just have 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.000
 I'll show you how rocky 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.810
 In the summer I go to swim right here with 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.750
 stones dives at the coke club at her 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:01.960
 from this pebble right on the row immediately 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:04.480
 something goes deep this year 's fish 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.690
 pecked and but in the past on this lake 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.230
 fish factory is located does not look like fish factory 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.440
 him there all pulled out and so here it is 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.580
 the lake which became famous but where 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.580
 specifically fell meteorite 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.660
 here and of course I am interested in the winter 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.930
 I probably about the food, I will definitely look 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.020
 I'll take that place where I fell 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.290
 approximately in this direction now I hold 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.870
 camera up to your own that's about that direction 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.880
 closer to that bank a meteorite fell 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.410
 thank god that of course no one 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.780
 hurt meteorite in chelyabinsk i in this 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.760
 time was in chelyabinsk flying on my 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.560
 eyes 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.980
 impressions of the guys I will tell you very 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.400
 chic 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:00.760
 silently silently all this happened 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.280
 he flew silently bright flash very 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.480
 beautifully flown very i'll tell you beautiful 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.000
 the tail was bright at one moment lit up 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.400
 when here's the brightest flash and 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.940
 just for a few seconds I lost 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.280
 vision 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.530
 that is, I kind of stopped seeing 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.609
 when you look at welding about 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.550
 something such it was here and then he 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.770
 further flew in front of my eyes and exploded 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.680
 scattered into different pieces at all 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.770
 silently literally that is, I stood it 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.840
 looked for took off on a mobile phone 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.780
 but not as he flew of course did not have time 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.390
 and the trace that was left of him I filmed 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.220
 on mobile phone 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.190
 here and then calmly forces already in the car 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.910
 gone and only then only 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.530
 these few explosions rang out 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.870
 here is this meteorite that is explosive 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:59.430
 the wave only then came to a sound 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.520
 but the spectacular glass popped up 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.960
 at least where I live 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.180
 glass fluttered especially balconies 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.670
 which were glazed with iron frames 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.100
 here in them flew euro packages resisted 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:16.830
 but closer to where aside 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.140
 how do you explain where the empty houses were 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.310
 in the wastelands of people and broke even 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.500
 plastic windows 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.080
 Now imagine what force had been 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.300
 blast wave that is straight plastic 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.790
 the windows broke someone in them a ball of some kind 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.730
 flew flying plastic windows 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:36.360
 frame straight bent there inside the inside 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:40.830
 inside the apartments so here are the expensive ones 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:47.190
 friends are already nearing sunset 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:49.530
 yeah i'm taking you out the sun didn't have time 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.070
 I take off when there was a clear sky 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:57.350
 beautiful it was the sun wanted to take off the sunset and 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:00.030
 here came small points and 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.630
 the breeze blew therefore apparently clouds 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.470
 come running 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:07.290
 so guys take off winter video 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.920
 I will definitely show you this place to 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.710
 specifically meteorite fell on a doedem 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.090
 snowmobile 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:20.690
