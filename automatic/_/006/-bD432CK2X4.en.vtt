00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.789
 hello it's time to resume 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.210
 the work of the channel and get right to the point 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.210
 Today we have a comparison of Chinese 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.660
 gibson pickups 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.300
 against the gibson themselves we have such 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.649
 unique opportunity to listen 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.360
 two identical function sets 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.690
 pickups but conditionally two 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.059
 identical sets in exactly the same 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.280
 conditions with the promise of my 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.710
 today's video is not 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.970
 to raise or lower some 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.060
 brand of some manufacturer and I just 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.760
 I suggest you compare how much 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.340
 the sound will change and what will change in it when 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.670
 replacing pickups for starters 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.620
 let's measure purely physically and their not 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.509
 he is significant because my 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.210
 measure anything at home 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.210
 besides resistance we can not let 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.759
 measure at least him by results 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.340
 gauging you see what resistance 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.469
 pickups are not the same 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.859
 surely will certainly affect the sounds 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:24.679
 but let's see how it affects 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:27.350
 sound well and all comparisons we will 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.719
 hold on my stratocaster and hull 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.060
 which is made of marsh ash 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.469
 the neck is made of maple with rosewood 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.159
 overlay 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.819
 before the test, the strings were replaced by dio 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.869
 darijo 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:43.759
 X-El 117 to better distinguish 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.819
 the difference is the sound we will all be 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.479
 listen through the glue start with the bridge 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.479
 positions 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.040
 but 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.880
 no one position 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.670
 no one position 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:25.900
 breeches vaio position all listened to you 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.670
 Now the material was recorded without 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.530
 any lotions that is it 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.460
 the purest signal 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.710
 electric guitars 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.230
 well now let's hear how it is 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.100
 sounds distorted 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.100
 breeches vaio position 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.520
 well and as you probably guessed it 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.310
 pure signal that was recorded 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.949
 pre-passed through the guitar rig well 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:40.139
 now let's check out the sounds with 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.139
 the habit of mt2 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.430
 Here is a comparison of the sound I have 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.880
 I intentionally did not become 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:40.389
 overlay every double bass guitar tracks 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.160
 drums do a comparison in mix because 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:45.880
 that all this will be anyway 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:48.850
 distract from the main goal the main goal 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:52.300
 it is to hear the difference the difference after all 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:55.240
 there is quite noticeable 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.780
 but according to the results of this test, you already 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:02.169
 for yourself you can decide what is for you 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:05.550
 better, but that's all for new meetings 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.550
 and may the force be with you
