because I think that's the thing that's

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.990 
because I think that's the thing that's
missed<00:00:28.199> when<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.039> wouldn't<00:00:29.369> miss<00:00:29.490> diseases

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
is and I think that's because no one

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.979 
is and I think that's because no one
steps<00:00:39.870> out<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.410> behalf<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:41.100> people<00:00:41.730> who<00:00:42.660> suffer

steps out on behalf of people who suffer

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.229 
steps out on behalf of people who suffer
from<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.860> received<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.120> me

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
from it to do it received like to me

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.410 
from it to do it received like to me
like<00:00:45.270> no<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.170> cares<00:00:46.730> has<00:00:47.730> cared<00:00:48.030> enough<00:00:48.270> about
