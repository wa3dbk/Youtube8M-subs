this is an amazing kind of variety of

this is an amazing kind of variety of
types<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.159> spaces<00:01:46.490> but<00:01:47.000> I<00:01:47.270> would<00:01:47.540> say<00:01:47.690> probably

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
types of spaces but I would say probably

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.050 
types of spaces but I would say probably
the<00:01:48.440> most<00:01:48.590> important<00:01:49.130> role<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.880> rec

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
the most important role that the rec

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.450 
center plays on campus
is<00:01:51.999> the<00:01:52.450> main<00:01:52.630> social<00:01:52.960> space<00:01:53.439> that<00:01:54.310> really

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
is the main social space that really

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.580 
is the main social space that really
supports<00:01:55.090> an<00:01:55.270> active<00:01:55.719> student<00:01:56.109> life<00:01:56.259> on

issue<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.209> fitting<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:22.870> much<00:02:23.080> program<00:02:23.560> into

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
issue of fitting that much program into

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.240 
issue of fitting that much program into
that<00:02:24.670> site<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.329> staying<00:02:26.019> within<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.590> context

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
that site and staying within the context

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.809 
that site and staying within the context
and<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.489> scale<00:02:27.879> of<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.180> campus<00:02:28.690> not<00:02:28.870> having<00:02:29.379> a

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
and the scale of the campus not having a

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.750 
and the scale of the campus not having a
60<00:02:30.870> 70<00:02:31.870> foot<00:02:32.260> tall<00:02:32.560> building<00:02:33.099> adjacent<00:02:33.280> to

60 70 foot tall building adjacent to

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.000 
60 70 foot tall building adjacent to
much<00:02:34.000> much<00:02:34.329> lower<00:02:34.510> buildings<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:35.230> that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
much much lower buildings and that

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.890 
much much lower buildings and that
wouldn't<00:02:36.519> have<00:02:36.579> been<00:02:36.670> possible<00:02:36.819> without<00:02:37.720> a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
wouldn't have been possible without a

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.860 
wouldn't have been possible without a
really<00:02:38.440> carefully<00:02:39.430> integrated

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
really carefully integrated

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.500 
really carefully integrated
architectural<00:02:40.870> structural<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.950> mechanical

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
architectural structural and mechanical

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.199 
architectural structural and mechanical
solution<00:02:45.780> we<00:02:46.780> were<00:02:47.489> considered<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.609> commuter

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
solution we were considered a commuter

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.330 
solution we were considered a commuter
campus<00:02:49.239> because<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.140> majority<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.829> our

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
campus because the majority of our

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.690 
campus because the majority of our
students<00:02:51.819> drive<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.540> campus<00:02:52.750> but<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:54.069> lot<00:02:54.670> of

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
students drive to campus but a lot of

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.690 
students drive to campus but a lot of
them<00:02:54.970> now<00:02:55.120> come<00:02:55.540> back<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.200> campus<00:02:56.650> or<00:02:57.099> stay<00:02:57.489> on

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
them now come back to campus or stay on

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.759 
them now come back to campus or stay on
campus<00:02:57.940> longer<00:02:58.690> in<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.049> evening<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.620> come

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
campus longer in the evening and come

it's good students love technology they
want<00:04:33.979> everything<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.280> be<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.729> know<00:04:34.820> state<00:04:35.120> of

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
want everything to be you know state of

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.240 
want everything to be you know state of
the<00:04:35.240> art<00:04:35.389> so<00:04:35.870> this<00:04:35.960> Lutron<00:04:36.500> lighting<00:04:36.530> system

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
the art so this Lutron lighting system

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.340 
the art so this Lutron lighting system
that<00:04:37.280> we<00:04:37.490> have<00:04:37.669> here<00:04:37.880> that<00:04:38.060> actually<00:04:38.229> you<00:04:39.229> know

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
that we have here that actually you know

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.140 
that we have here that actually you know
senses<00:04:39.889> and<00:04:40.040> harvesters<00:04:40.430> amount<00:04:40.729> of<00:04:40.790> daylight

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
senses and harvesters amount of daylight

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.400 
senses and harvesters amount of daylight
that<00:04:41.300> we're<00:04:41.479> getting<00:04:41.570> in<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.900> building<00:04:42.080> and

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
that we're getting in the building and

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.469 
that we're getting in the building and
therefore<00:04:42.800> decreases<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.729> production<00:04:43.850> from

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
therefore decreases the production from

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.270 
therefore decreases the production from
a<00:04:44.720> number<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.169> our<00:04:45.260> light<00:04:45.440> fixtures<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:45.890> kind

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
a number of our light fixtures and kind

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.310 
a number of our light fixtures and kind
of<00:04:46.310> balance<00:04:46.460> that<00:04:46.760> that's<00:04:47.120> out<00:04:47.360> balances<00:04:48.200> that

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
of balance that that's out balances that

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.080 
of balance that that's out balances that
out<00:04:48.500> is<00:04:48.650> really<00:04:48.950> neat<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.430> they're<00:04:49.880> just

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
out is really neat and they're just

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.219 
out is really neat and they're just
their<00:04:50.300> eyes<00:04:50.419> light<00:04:50.660> up<00:04:50.690> they're<00:04:50.870> like<00:04:50.990> wow<00:04:51.169> you

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.130 
ventilation system it was a combination
of<00:06:03.790> design<00:06:04.150> decisions<00:06:04.690> there<00:06:04.900> between

of design decisions there between

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.750 
architecture planning structural and
mechanical<00:06:07.870> that<00:06:08.860> really<00:06:09.160> allowed<00:06:09.490> the

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
mechanical that really allowed the

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.300 
mechanical that really allowed the
building<00:06:10.210> to<00:06:10.450> take<00:06:10.690> its<00:06:10.900> form<00:06:11.260> to<00:06:11.560> fit<00:06:11.860> on<00:06:12.100> that

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310

that is in scale and consistent with the

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.330 
that is in scale and consistent with the
rest<00:06:18.280> of<00:06:18.490> the<00:06:18.550> campus<00:06:19.440> when<00:06:20.440> we<00:06:20.590> first<00:06:20.890> started

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
rest of the campus when we first started

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.450 
rest of the campus when we first started
the<00:06:21.430> project<00:06:21.640> we<00:06:22.300> wanted<00:06:23.290> the<00:06:23.470> building<00:06:24.040> to<00:06:24.310> be

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
the project we wanted the building to be

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.280 
the project we wanted the building to be
in<00:06:24.670> a<00:06:24.760> different<00:06:24.970> place<00:06:25.330> but<00:06:25.870> we<00:06:26.020> didn't

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
in a different place but we didn't

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.440 
in a different place but we didn't
really<00:06:26.440> have<00:06:26.680> a<00:06:26.710> large<00:06:26.950> enough<00:06:27.130> footprint<00:06:27.880> to

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
really have a large enough footprint to

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.020 
really have a large enough footprint to
actually<00:06:29.200> achieve<00:06:29.530> what<00:06:29.800> we<00:06:29.950> wanted<00:06:30.280> to<00:06:30.340> so<00:06:30.910> we

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
actually achieve what we wanted to so we

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.930 
actually achieve what we wanted to so we
looked<00:06:31.330> at<00:06:31.480> alternate<00:06:32.130> locations<00:06:33.130> and<00:06:33.370> just

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
looked at alternate locations and just

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.000 
looked at alternate locations and just
having<00:06:34.240> that<00:06:34.270> integrated<00:06:34.630> design<00:06:35.230> allowed<00:06:35.740> us

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
having that integrated design allowed us

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.430 
having that integrated design allowed us
to<00:06:36.040> do<00:06:36.400> that<00:06:36.640> with<00:06:37.300> all<00:06:37.570> the<00:06:37.720> players<00:06:37.960> in<00:06:38.230> place

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
to do that with all the players in place

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.860 
to do that with all the players in place
at<00:06:38.650> the<00:06:38.890> very<00:06:39.070> beginning<00:06:39.520> of<00:06:39.580> the<00:06:39.700> process<00:06:39.940> the

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
at the very beginning of the process the

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.050 
at the very beginning of the process the
other<00:06:41.050> challenge<00:06:41.910> from<00:06:42.910> a<00:06:43.030> design

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
other challenge from a design

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.610 
other challenge from a design
perspective<00:06:44.460> was<00:06:45.460> the<00:06:45.910> length<00:06:46.270> and<00:06:46.630> size<00:06:47.110> of

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
perspective was the length and size of

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.890 
perspective was the length and size of
this<00:06:47.770> building<00:06:48.240> it's<00:06:49.240> longer<00:06:49.630> than<00:06:49.870> a

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
this building it's longer than a

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.230 
this building it's longer than a
football<00:06:50.140> field<00:06:50.320> so<00:06:51.250> if<00:06:51.520> you<00:06:51.670> look<00:06:51.910> at<00:06:52.090> that

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
football field so if you look at that

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.920 
football field so if you look at that
how<00:06:52.540> do<00:06:52.600> you<00:06:52.960> design<00:06:53.290> it<00:06:53.680> in<00:06:53.830> such<00:06:53.890> a<00:06:54.100> way<00:06:54.400> that

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
how do you design it in such a way that

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.050 
how do you design it in such a way that
it<00:06:55.930> is<00:06:56.170> still<00:06:56.440> aesthetically<00:06:57.340> pleasing<00:06:57.370> and

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
it is still aesthetically pleasing and

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.350 
it is still aesthetically pleasing and
functional<00:06:58.920> and<00:06:59.920> I<00:07:00.040> think<00:07:00.310> integrated<00:07:01.030> design

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
functional and I think integrated design

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.300 
functional and I think integrated design
in<00:07:01.600> LPA<00:07:02.340> was<00:07:03.340> able<00:07:03.640> to<00:07:03.760> achieve<00:07:03.880> that<00:07:04.330> for<00:07:04.630> us

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
in LPA was able to achieve that for us

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.530 
in LPA was able to achieve that for us
that<00:07:06.310> Northridge<00:07:06.700> Recreation<00:07:07.180> Center<00:07:07.450> is<00:07:07.510> a

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
that Northridge Recreation Center is a

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.070 
that Northridge Recreation Center is a
really<00:07:07.930> good<00:07:08.050> example<00:07:08.610> where<00:07:09.750> those<00:07:10.750> design

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
really good example where those design

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.630 
really good example where those design
decisions<00:07:11.560> rather<00:07:11.800> than<00:07:11.980> being<00:07:12.310> made<00:07:12.490> in

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:12.640 
decisions rather than being made in

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.090 
decisions rather than being made in
series<00:07:13.180> were<00:07:13.450> really<00:07:13.810> made<00:07:14.020> together

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
series were really made together

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.020 
series were really made together
so<00:07:15.460> decisions<00:07:16.210> about<00:07:17.340> how<00:07:18.340> the<00:07:18.400> massing<00:07:18.970> of

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030 
so decisions about how the massing of

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.840 
so decisions about how the massing of
the<00:07:19.180> building<00:07:19.570> would<00:07:19.750> come<00:07:19.930> together<00:07:20.310> and<00:07:21.310> how

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:21.850 
the building would come together and how

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.490 
the building would come together and how
the<00:07:21.910> structural<00:07:22.570> system<00:07:22.750> would<00:07:23.080> work<00:07:23.290> were

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
the structural system would work were

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.220 
the structural system would work were
made<00:07:23.740> in<00:07:23.950> conjunction<00:07:24.160> with<00:07:24.990> also<00:07:25.990> how<00:07:26.170> the

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.230 
made in conjunction with also how the

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.740 
made in conjunction with also how the
major<00:07:26.950> mechanical<00:07:27.340> systems<00:07:27.970> would<00:07:28.210> fit<00:07:28.510> into

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750 
major mechanical systems would fit into

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.480 
major mechanical systems would fit into
the<00:07:28.930> building<00:07:29.320> would<00:07:29.830> be<00:07:29.860> distributed

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:30.490 
the building would be distributed

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.540 
the building would be distributed
through<00:07:30.670> the<00:07:30.730> building<00:07:31.150> so<00:07:32.220> each<00:07:33.220> iteration

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:33.550 
through the building so each iteration

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.640 
through the building so each iteration
of<00:07:34.060> how<00:07:34.210> those<00:07:34.360> decisions<00:07:34.810> were<00:07:34.960> made<00:07:35.140> was

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:35.650 
of how those decisions were made was

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.280 
of how those decisions were made was
much<00:07:35.830> more<00:07:36.210> tightly<00:07:37.210> coordinated<00:07:37.720> and

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.290 
much more tightly coordinated and

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.800
