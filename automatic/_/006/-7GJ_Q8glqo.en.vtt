00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.860
 I did not expect all that 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.660
 or agent balkan is the location in senate 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.100
 so complicated that I pass it 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.680
 unfortunately can not explain 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.519
 it could be that my office was listening 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.500
 What I said earlier is true 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.630
 the senate convened a hearing 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.380
 to the approach of the special forces too 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.810
 investigate 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.850
 however, I did not know that yet 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.430
 the senator behind these acts 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.250
 is in truth a secret agent of the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.190
 imperium is the whole hearing 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.290
 one almost how is it possible that one 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.110
 agent of the empire elected to the senate 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.120
 It was not easy at all 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.579
 someone already bought a seat 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.070
 we had evidence for it 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.989
 his name is her, he represents one 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.750
 Tiny little rock amidst 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.899
 some very profitable trade routes 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.719
 with the help of the Imperial Secret Service 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.240
 senator has been slowly influencing you 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.689
 won and now sat him against us 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.909
 on 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.880
 this is just another attack of the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.740
 good old general advice to let her 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.080
 suspend the kaos squad with it 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.850
 tractors a respite has the war 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.689
 back in the desired tracks 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.630
 to steer 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.350
 how are we going to do it? 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.920
 to arrest 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.650
 Not quite the military is not 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.540
 empowered and if we hold on to it 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.090
 confirms that only his allegations 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.549
 that we abuse our influence 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.020
 I want you to go to the hearing 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.970
 as well as the senate wants it 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.220
 we can not risk that he 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.600
 Escape goes and behave yourself 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.490
 respectful 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.530
 if you have to testify in the series since 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.259
 presents the evidence of the sed 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.700
 the senate has collected then 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.320
 examine and we can do ours 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.420
 continue operations 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.659
 I will not comment on that in no time 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.700
 enlightened senator remembers her 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.310
 An will try at any price you 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.200
 as malicious to do 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.100
 nothing that will be used against you 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.119
 I could wait in my office 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.640
 report back to me as soon as the 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.640
 completed hearings is dismissed 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.580
 much fun major welcome we thank 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.780
 you that you take your time 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.590
 personally on our concerns 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.220
 please address please thank you 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.010
 very 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.200
 as many of you already know 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.120
 The chaos troupe is widely considered the best 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.580
 Infantry unit in the military 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.530
 republic by his reputation has become the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.019
 squad earned a lot of leeway 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.420
 even so much that he becomes a danger 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.180
 my name has changed for the republic 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.060
 We ask friends and colleagues 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.750
 what the chaos group actually day for 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.780
 day does 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.709
 I find it disturbing that nobody 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.230
 that knows so well 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.820
 We all remember each other like that 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.250
 last commander of the chaos squad 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.959
 I disappeared without a trace 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.070
 doubt that a crime took place 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.769
 that was covered up 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.680
 and then all the foolishness with the fist 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.540
 superweapon an outrageously expensive mission 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.489
 to a scientific project 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.549
 destroy its threat potential 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.109
 not even proven is the empire 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.000
 grabbed us for this reckless 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.670
 mission with full strength 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.280
 why was the senate not in the 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.230
 Decision involved in doing that 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.359
 all because of the imperium him for it 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.000
 I have paid proof 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.070
 that's unheard of you want this 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.609
 unfounded allegations really 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.459
 tolerate 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.230
 the commander of the chaos troop deserves 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.780
 that we listen to him 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.609
 that's absurd, I have these 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.890
 Hearing induces facts 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.090
 present and not paranoid 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.489
 delusions 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.410
 if you open your mouth again 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.099
 you will regret it to them 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.019
 please keep it calm I know 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.480
 no reason why we do this 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.310
 should not interrupt briefly to 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.160
 to examine new evidence 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.140
 guards regulates the area and leaves 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.010
 No one out until we are ready 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.010
 to get together again 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.500
 They must be based on the evidence 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.090
 cause the senats to be guards 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.419
 in custody for treason 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.470
 but that's crazy I am 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.780
 no traitor 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.860
 whatever you have seen it must 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.410
 to be a fake 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.470
 this is a military compliment please take 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.150
 our apologies to major i hope 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.290
 you understand that we are just good guys 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.750
 purposely 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.490
 it is your duty to make sure 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.520
 that we are in the interest of the republic 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.320
 Act that is it and you should know 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.389
 that you make your tireless efforts 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.430
 to defend the republic 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.169
 appreciate 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.180

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.220
 May General Gas as new assistant 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.560

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.110
 I am looking forward to learning from you 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.690
 Lieutenant is general 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.460
 Gaza had to talk to General Garza 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.770
 Unfortunately , an urgent emergency continued 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.780

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.729
 dilemma solved 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.000
 There are already reports about them 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.389
 as an extra income, that would have affected us 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.520
 if we can bury it 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.289
 would have come through if you have the zinal 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.130
 not convinced would have the evidence too 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.700
 check 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:43.340
 then we would have experienced well done 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.849
 I'm just glad that everything worked out well 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.110

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:51.139

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.130

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.229
 on the battlefield 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.160
 That's the opportunity we have 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.620
 have been waiting 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.699
