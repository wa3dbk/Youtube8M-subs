00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
vehicle and figure set I really like

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.840 
vehicle and figure set I really like
this<00:00:45.320> partly<00:00:46.320> because<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.670> whole

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
this partly because the the whole

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.799 
this partly because the the whole
ensemble<00:00:48.079> reminds<00:00:49.079> me<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:50.360> well<00:00:51.360> which<00:00:51.600> i

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
ensemble reminds me of the well which i

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.880 
ensemble reminds me of the well which i
think<00:00:52.309> is<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:54.000> actually<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> case<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.410> sort

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
think is is actually the case it is sort

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.110 
think is is actually the case it is sort
of<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> predecessor<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:58.789> walkers<00:00:59.789> on

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
of like a predecessor of the walkers on

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.799 
of like a predecessor of the walkers on
the<00:01:00.420> moon<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.629> Endor<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.160> Imperial

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
the moon of Endor that the Imperial

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.440 
the moon of Endor that the Imperial
troopers<00:01:03.949> using<00:01:04.949> as<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> Ewoks<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.970> The

Return<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> Jedi<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> very<00:01:08.970> reminiscent

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
Return of the Jedi so very reminiscent

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.390 
Return of the Jedi so very reminiscent
of<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> little<00:01:10.799> bit<00:01:10.890> more<00:01:11.040> it's

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
of that which is a little bit more it's

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.640 
of that which is a little bit more it's
bigger<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.659> fit<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> figures

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
bigger and you can fit the figures

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.039 
bigger and you can fit the figures
inside<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.460> more<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
inside this one is more of like a

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.649 
inside this one is more of like a
mechanized<00:01:16.049> horse<00:01:17.869> it's<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.990> basic<00:01:20.090> mold<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.360> am

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
mechanized horse it's a basic mold I am

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.550 
mechanized horse it's a basic mold I am
not<00:01:21.900> sure<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.950> was<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
not sure if this was a if this is the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.590 
not sure if this was a if this is the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
articulation the only the I guess the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.190 
articulation the only the I guess the
hip<00:01:53.460> joint<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:54.030> move<00:01:54.299> forward<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:54.990> backward

and the toes can go up and down and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.160 
and the toes can go up and down and
that's<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.829> which<00:01:59.390> that<00:02:00.390> that's<00:02:00.659> probably<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
that's it which that that's probably the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.200 
that's it which that that's probably the
only<00:02:01.200> thing<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.890> against<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.430> set<00:02:02.939> is

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
only thing I have against this set is

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.600 
only thing I have against this set is
the<00:02:03.840> limited<00:02:04.290> leg<00:02:04.560> motions<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> Walker

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the limited leg motions on the Walker

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.290 
the limited leg motions on the Walker
but<00:02:05.969> overall<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.590> very<00:02:07.619> very<00:02:08.399> nice

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
but overall it's a very very nice
