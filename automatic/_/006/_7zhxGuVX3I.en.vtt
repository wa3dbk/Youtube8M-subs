00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
xmen will show you and is how to make a

xmen will show you and is how to make a
snare<00:00:09.610> I<00:00:10.139> am<00:00:11.139> different<00:00:12.070> way<00:00:12.370> to<00:00:12.430> make<00:00:12.760> him

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
snare I am different way to make him

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.990 
snare I am different way to make him
this<00:00:13.180> is<00:00:13.360> a<00:00:13.390> basic<00:00:13.690> way<00:00:14.140> of<00:00:14.170> doing<00:00:14.769> it<00:00:14.890> and<00:00:15.070> the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
this is a basic way of doing it and the

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.760 
this is a basic way of doing it and the
tubular<00:00:16.599> normally<00:00:17.020> you<00:00:17.170> haven't<00:00:17.590> got<00:00:17.740> the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
tubular normally you haven't got the

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.769 
tubular normally you haven't got the
moment<00:00:18.310> so<00:00:18.520> as<00:00:18.670> you<00:00:18.820> can<00:00:18.939> see<00:00:19.210> this<00:00:19.420> stuff's

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
moment so as you can see this stuff's

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.499 
moment so as you can see this stuff's
like<00:00:20.680> some<00:00:21.010> bendy<00:00:21.460> flexible<00:00:22.060> stuff<00:00:22.329> you

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
like some bendy flexible stuff you

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.179 
like some bendy flexible stuff you
really<00:00:22.689> want<00:00:23.020> some<00:00:23.259> tubing<00:00:23.650> that's<00:00:23.800> a<00:00:23.980> little

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
really want some tubing that's a little

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.179 
really want some tubing that's a little
bit<00:00:24.340> more<00:00:24.489> rigid<00:00:25.029> than<00:00:25.060> this<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.560> don't<00:00:27.130> think

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
bit more rigid than this and don't think

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.569 
bit more rigid than this and don't think
it'll<00:00:27.520> all<00:00:27.730> fit<00:00:28.270> in<00:00:28.509> there<00:00:28.540> as<00:00:29.079> I've<00:00:29.259> a<00:00:29.290> lot<00:00:29.579> no

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
it'll all fit in there as I've a lot no

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.210 
it'll all fit in there as I've a lot no
anyway<00:00:31.329> this<00:00:31.869> is<00:00:32.020> about<00:00:32.230> a<00:00:32.290> meter<00:00:32.619> long<00:00:32.829> that

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
anyway this is about a meter long that

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.710 
anyway this is about a meter long that
I've<00:00:33.340> got<00:00:33.550> here<00:00:33.700> maybe<00:00:33.910> a<00:00:34.030> little<00:00:34.210> bit<00:00:34.480> longer

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
I've got here maybe a little bit longer

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.190 
I've got here maybe a little bit longer
and<00:00:35.790> there's<00:00:36.790> the<00:00:36.970> sorracchi<00:00:37.360> but<00:00:37.870> not<00:00:38.020> much

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
and there's the sorracchi but not much

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.850 
and there's the sorracchi but not much
bigger<00:00:38.380> than<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.740> straw<00:00:39.010> really<00:00:39.640> you<00:00:40.240> see<00:00:40.690> ya

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
bigger than the straw really you see ya

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.400 
bigger than the straw really you see ya
it's<00:00:41.860> not<00:00:41.980> that<00:00:42.040> thick<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:43.210> bought<00:00:43.780> like<00:00:44.170> say

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
it's not that thick and bought like say

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.110 
it's not that thick and bought like say
I'd<00:00:44.560> use<00:00:44.800> a<00:00:44.830> thicker<00:00:45.160> one<00:00:45.400> normally<00:00:45.940> this<00:00:46.060> is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
I'd use a thicker one normally this is

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.590 
I'd use a thicker one normally this is
just<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.540> bit<00:00:47.170> too<00:00:47.410> flexible<00:00:48.100> next<00:00:49.060> big<00:00:49.240> all<00:00:49.450> you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
just a bit too flexible next big all you

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.390 
just a bit too flexible next big all you
do<00:00:49.750> is<00:00:49.900> get<00:00:50.080> some<00:00:50.260> strimmer<00:00:50.680> cable<00:00:51.160> you<00:00:51.280> know

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
do is get some strimmer cable you know

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.920 
do is get some strimmer cable you know
on<00:00:51.460> them<00:00:51.640> garden<00:00:52.030> streamers<00:00:52.450> for<00:00:52.480> cutting<00:00:52.900> you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
on them garden streamers for cutting you

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.090 
on them garden streamers for cutting you
garden<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:54.550> you<00:00:54.730> do<00:00:54.880> then<00:00:55.680> maybe<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.920> limb

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
garden all you do then maybe the limb

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.450 
garden all you do then maybe the limb
for<00:00:57.250> you<00:00:57.310> cable<00:00:58.410> amazing<00:00:59.410> strimmer<00:00:59.860> doubled

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
for you cable amazing strimmer doubled

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.360 
for you cable amazing strimmer doubled
over<00:01:00.910> so<00:01:00.970> I've<00:01:01.360> folded<00:01:01.920> fold<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:03.190> in<00:01:03.340> half

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
over so I've folded fold that in half

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.149 
over so I've folded fold that in half
doubled<00:01:04.239> it<00:01:04.329> over<00:01:04.750> so<00:01:05.379> I've<00:01:05.530> got<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.740> limb<00:01:06.009> for

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
doubled it over so I've got the limb for

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.910 
doubled it over so I've got the limb for
this<00:01:06.280> cable<00:01:06.759> twice<00:01:07.180> now<00:01:07.990> yes<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:08.680> I've<00:01:08.770> got<00:01:08.890> the

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
this cable twice now yes so I've got the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.370 
this cable twice now yes so I've got the
stream<00:01:09.250> of<00:01:09.369> cable<00:01:09.850> but<00:01:10.479> then<00:01:10.600> for<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.840> tube<00:01:11.140> in

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
stream of cable but then for the tube in

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.840 
stream of cable but then for the tube in
twice<00:01:11.789> so<00:01:12.789> I<00:01:12.819> match<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.270> up<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.719> end<00:01:14.850> once

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
twice so I match that up to the end once

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.849 
twice so I match that up to the end once
I've<00:01:16.060> done<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.749> pull<00:01:17.079> the<00:01:17.229> end<00:01:17.380> out<00:01:17.649> and

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
I've done that I pull the end out and

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.370 
I've done that I pull the end out and
make<00:01:18.039> a<00:01:18.069> loop<00:01:18.429> whatever<00:01:19.119> ruff<00:01:19.749> sighs<00:01:20.109> I'm

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
make a loop whatever ruff sighs I'm

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.859 
make a loop whatever ruff sighs I'm
going<00:01:20.560> to<00:01:20.649> want<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.950> loop<00:01:21.130> so<00:01:21.460> let's<00:01:22.359> say<00:01:22.659> I

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
going to want the loop so let's say I

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.399 
going to want the loop so let's say I
want<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.289> lists<00:01:23.619> or<00:01:23.799> size<00:01:24.249> right<00:01:24.999> so<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.719> measure

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
want it lists or size right so I measure

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.629 
want it lists or size right so I measure
that<00:01:26.649> to<00:01:27.039> the<00:01:27.130> end<00:01:27.280> of<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.549> you've<00:01:27.819> been<00:01:29.639> yeah

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:30.639 
that to the end of it you've been yeah

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:33.149 
that to the end of it you've been yeah
just<00:01:30.969> show<00:01:31.210> you<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.569> so<00:01:32.259> there's<00:01:32.499> me<00:01:32.649> tubing

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
just show you that so there's me tubing

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.919 
just show you that so there's me tubing
that's<00:01:33.340> why<00:01:33.579> it's<00:01:33.729> finished<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.450> there's<00:01:34.780> me

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
that's why it's finished and there's me

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.770 
that's why it's finished and there's me
loop<00:01:35.139> sighs<00:01:35.499> yeah<00:01:35.889> all<00:01:36.759> you<00:01:36.969> do<00:01:37.149> then<00:01:37.420> because

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
loop sighs yeah all you do then because

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.270 
loop sighs yeah all you do then because
you<00:01:37.899> folded<00:01:38.409> this<00:01:38.850> stream<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:39.969> cable<00:01:40.359> in<00:01:40.509> half

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
you folded this stream of cable in half

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.109 
you folded this stream of cable in half
what<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.369> want<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.609> do<00:01:42.700> next<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.329> get<00:01:43.539> that

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
what you want to do next is get that

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.239 
what you want to do next is get that
fold<00:01:46.119> it<00:01:46.329> into<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.659> small<00:01:47.049> point<00:01:47.380> like<00:01:47.709> that<00:01:48.009> can

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
fold it into a small point like that can

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:50.219 
fold it into a small point like that can
you<00:01:48.340> see<00:01:48.520> that<00:01:48.759> once<00:01:49.509> you've<00:01:49.719> got<00:01:49.899> that<00:01:49.929> you

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
you see that once you've got that you

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.879 
you see that once you've got that you
push<00:01:50.439> that<00:01:50.649> into<00:01:50.829> the<00:01:51.069> hole<00:01:52.319> says<00:01:53.319> the<00:01:53.439> idis

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:53.889 
push that into the hole says the idis

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:56.309 
push that into the hole says the idis
bit<00:01:54.189> is<00:01:54.369> threading<00:01:55.029> this<00:01:55.240> through<00:01:55.630> so<00:01:56.020> I'm

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
bit is threading this through so I'm

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.489 
bit is threading this through so I'm
have<00:01:56.469> to<00:01:56.619> pause<00:01:57.039> this<00:01:57.429> because<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.810> starts<00:01:59.319> off

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
have to pause this because it starts off

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.639 
have to pause this because it starts off
like<00:02:00.039> really<00:02:00.700> easy<00:02:00.909> but<00:02:01.420> you'll<00:02:02.170> see<00:02:02.469> this

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
like really easy but you'll see this

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.730 
like really easy but you'll see this
going<00:02:02.950> in<00:02:03.279> if<00:02:03.399> it's<00:02:03.579> in<00:02:03.729> this<00:02:03.999> a<00:02:04.029> bit<00:02:04.329> it<00:02:04.990> soon

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
going in if it's in this a bit it soon

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.089 
going in if it's in this a bit it soon
starts<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.520> get<00:02:06.670> tired<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.270> push<00:02:07.479> through<00:02:07.840> I

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
starts to get tired to push through I

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.440 
starts to get tired to push through I
get<00:02:09.099> lucky<00:02:09.310> never<00:02:09.759> know<00:02:09.970> will<00:02:10.149> leave<00:02:10.300> your

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
get lucky never know will leave your

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.390 
get lucky never know will leave your
bowling<00:02:10.869> ball<00:02:10.899> soon<00:02:11.470> as<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.620> get<00:02:11.740> stuck<00:02:12.099> I'll

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
bowling ball soon as I get stuck I'll

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.070 
bowling ball soon as I get stuck I'll
pause<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.209> then<00:02:13.390> basically<00:02:13.660> what<00:02:14.020> you

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
pause it and then basically what you

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.300 
pause it and then basically what you
have<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.290> do<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.590> keep<00:02:14.770> jiggling<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.520> and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
have to do is keep jiggling it and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.530 
have to do is keep jiggling it and
twisting<00:02:18.310> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
twisting the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.720 
twisting the
cable<00:02:19.049> to<00:02:19.230> push<00:02:19.469> it<00:02:19.709> through<00:02:20.069> on<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.700> inside

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
cable to push it through on the inside

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.839 
cable to push it through on the inside
of<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.420> tube<00:02:21.659> in<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.920> street<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.609> get

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
of the tube in the street you get

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.899 
of the tube in the street you get
youtube<00:02:24.329> in<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:25.290> better<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:25.769> as<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.310> snare

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
youtube in the better it is as a snare

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:32.479 
youtube in the better it is as a snare
and<00:02:28.129> also<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.939> easier<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.599> is<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:31.489> push

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
and also the easier it is to push

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.429 
and also the easier it is to push
through<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.090> I'll<00:02:33.180> straighten<00:02:33.719> out<00:02:34.109> a<00:02:34.140> little

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
through so I'll straighten out a little

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:42.920 
through so I'll straighten out a little
bit<00:02:34.709> more<00:02:40.189> this<00:02:41.189> is<00:02:41.370> like<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.879> hardest<00:02:42.150> bit<00:02:42.689> of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
bit more this is like the hardest bit of

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.259 
bit more this is like the hardest bit of
the<00:02:43.409> whole<00:02:43.620> job<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.189> just<00:02:44.549> pushing<00:02:44.909> this

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
the whole job is just pushing this

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.740 
the whole job is just pushing this
through<00:02:45.689> I<00:02:46.400> can<00:02:47.400> feel<00:02:47.639> this<00:02:47.879> stick<00:02:48.299> in<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.569> bit

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
through I can feel this stick in a bit

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.330 
through I can feel this stick in a bit
now<00:02:50.629> might<00:02:51.629> have<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.900> pause<00:02:52.139> the<00:02:52.379> tape<00:02:52.620> I'm

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
now might have to pause the tape I'm

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.069 
now might have to pause the tape I'm
going<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.579> pause<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.030> tape<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.540> come<00:02:54.750> back<00:02:54.900> to

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
going to pause the tape and come back to

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.679 
going to pause the tape and come back to
you<00:02:55.139> once<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.470> thread<00:02:55.889> of<00:02:56.069> this<00:02:56.220> frame

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
you once a thread of this frame

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.179 
you once a thread of this frame
basically<00:02:57.689> all<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.989> doing<00:02:58.319> this<00:02:58.439> bit<00:02:58.709> by<00:02:58.919> bit

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
basically all you doing this bit by bit

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.149 
basically all you doing this bit by bit
pushing<00:02:59.819> that<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:01.590> because<00:03:01.919> it<00:03:02.040> hasn't

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
pushing that in and because it hasn't

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.270 
pushing that in and because it hasn't
got<00:03:02.510> anywhere<00:03:03.510> else<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.900> go<00:03:04.169> about<00:03:04.379> forward<00:03:05.040> it

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
got anywhere else to go about forward it

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.890 
got anywhere else to go about forward it
gradually<00:03:05.819> works<00:03:06.030> its<00:03:06.299> way<00:03:06.389> around<00:03:06.629> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
gradually works its way around the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.530 
gradually works its way around the
tubing<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.459> pause<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.909> tape<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.359> come

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
tubing and I pause the tape and come

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.899 
tubing and I pause the tape and come
back<00:03:09.689> when<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:09.959> weaved<00:03:10.169> it<00:03:10.409> through<00:03:10.709> okay<00:03:11.579> I've

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
back when it weaved it through okay I've

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.030 
back when it weaved it through okay I've
pushed<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.540> all<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.230> way<00:03:13.349> through<00:03:13.739> now<00:03:14.010> and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
pushed that all the way through now and

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.089 
pushed that all the way through now and
out<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.549> end<00:03:14.870> next<00:03:15.870> thing<00:03:16.139> we<00:03:16.349> do<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.650> get<00:03:17.069> a

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
out the end next thing we do is get a

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.520 
out the end next thing we do is get a
thicker<00:03:17.370> piece<00:03:17.639> of<00:03:17.819> tube<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.329> which<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.379> could

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
thicker piece of tube in which you could

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.199 
thicker piece of tube in which you could
actually<00:03:19.680> use<00:03:19.889> that<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.579> Ben<00:03:20.790> from<00:03:21.000> the

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
actually use that to you Ben from the

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.559 
actually use that to you Ben from the
off<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:22.620> thick<00:03:22.859> of<00:03:22.889> one<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.430> prefer<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.209> use<00:03:24.419> the

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
off the thick of one I prefer to use the

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.229 
off the thick of one I prefer to use the
thinner<00:03:24.840> one<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.379> then<00:03:26.370> pull<00:03:26.549> down<00:03:26.729> side<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
thinner one and then pull down side the

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.539 
thinner one and then pull down side the
thicker<00:03:27.479> one<00:03:27.750> feed<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.709> food<00:03:29.040> till<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.340> comes

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
thicker one feed that food till it comes

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.280 
thicker one feed that food till it comes
out<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.970> end<00:03:30.000> which<00:03:30.329> makes<00:03:30.599> it<00:03:30.780> nice<00:03:30.989> and

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
out the end which makes it nice and

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:38.899 
out the end which makes it nice and
rigid<00:03:35.599> and<00:03:36.599> once<00:03:36.900> that's<00:03:37.169> out<00:03:37.609> near<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.639> other

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
rigid and once that's out near the other

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.619 
rigid and once that's out near the other
end<00:03:40.909> pull<00:03:41.909> the<00:03:42.090> loop<00:03:42.299> if<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.959> snare<00:03:43.290> through

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
end pull the loop if you snare through

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.089 
end pull the loop if you snare through
show<00:03:45.629> you<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.900> end<00:03:46.019> wonder<00:03:46.409> scroll<00:03:46.829> back<00:03:47.069> a

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
show you the end wonder scroll back a

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.809 
show you the end wonder scroll back a
bit<00:03:47.400> again<00:03:47.819> that's<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.329> right<00:03:48.769> so<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.549> now<00:03:50.669> it

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
bit again that's it right so so now it

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.149 
bit again that's it right so so now it
comes<00:03:50.849> out<00:03:51.299> at<00:03:51.479> the<00:03:51.510> end<00:03:51.659> now<00:03:52.049> there's<00:03:52.949> the

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
comes out at the end now there's the

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.099 
comes out at the end now there's the
loop<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.609> you<00:03:53.729> measured<00:03:54.120> coming<00:03:54.840> out<00:03:54.989> the

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
loop that you measured coming out the

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.770 
loop that you measured coming out the
end<00:03:55.139> of<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.500> tubing<00:03:56.010> on<00:03:56.909> the<00:03:57.120> other<00:03:57.359> end<00:03:57.569> to

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
end of the tubing on the other end to

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.509 
end of the tubing on the other end to
stop<00:03:58.019> it<00:03:58.169> going<00:03:58.440> through<00:03:58.680> all<00:03:58.889> I've<00:03:59.129> done<00:03:59.370> with

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
stop it going through all I've done with

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.899 
stop it going through all I've done with
the<00:03:59.639> two<00:03:59.849> loose<00:04:00.120> ends<00:04:00.419> I've<00:04:01.379> just<00:04:01.669> tired<00:04:02.669> too

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
the two loose ends I've just tired too

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.460 
the two loose ends I've just tired too
little<00:04:03.150> key<00:04:03.329> rings<00:04:03.599> around<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:04.019> what<00:04:04.290> that

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
little key rings around it what that

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.649 
little key rings around it what that
does<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.889> stops<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.400> going<00:04:05.729> in<00:04:05.879> beyond<00:04:06.209> that<00:04:06.449> so

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
does it stops it going in beyond that so

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.210 
does it stops it going in beyond that so
you<00:04:06.720> know<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.079> mean<00:04:07.229> to<00:04:07.409> fish<00:04:07.620> these<00:04:07.859> pieces

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
you know I mean to fish these pieces

working you can see that a bit better
now<00:04:26.070> now<00:04:26.400> this<00:04:26.880> loop<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.389> you've<00:04:27.510> made<00:04:27.750> what

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
now now this loop that you've made what

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.600 
now now this loop that you've made what
I<00:04:27.960> normally<00:04:28.289> do<00:04:28.680> I'll<00:04:28.919> stretch<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.490> over

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
I normally do I'll stretch it over

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.119 
I normally do I'll stretch it over
something<00:04:30.270> preferably<00:04:30.719> circular

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:32.129 
something preferably circular

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.399 
something preferably circular
or<00:04:32.249> for<00:04:32.819> nails<00:04:33.089> in<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.360> piece<00:04:33.389> of<00:04:33.599> wood<00:04:33.899> and

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.409 
or for nails in a piece of wood and

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.350 
or for nails in a piece of wood and
stretch<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.459> way<00:04:35.699> it<00:04:35.909> keeps<00:04:36.119> this

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
stretch it that way it keeps this

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.479 
stretch it that way it keeps this
circular<00:04:36.989> shape<00:04:37.229> on<00:04:37.499> the<00:04:37.619> end<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:38.069> it's<00:04:38.309> always

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:38.489 
circular shape on the end so it's always

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:40.909 
circular shape on the end so it's always
ready<00:04:38.939> for<00:04:39.179> hooking<00:04:39.629> onto<00:04:39.779> stuff<00:04:40.139> when<00:04:40.800> you

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
ready for hooking onto stuff when you

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.919 
ready for hooking onto stuff when you
make<00:04:41.099> them<00:04:41.309> new<00:04:41.580> self<00:04:42.059> thin<00:04:42.360> that's<00:04:42.629> gone<00:04:42.899> now

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:42.929 
make them new self thin that's gone now

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:46.369 
make them new self thin that's gone now
released<00:04:43.649> it<00:04:44.360> that's<00:04:45.360> because<00:04:45.539> it's<00:04:45.719> new<00:04:45.959> if

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
released it that's because it's new if

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.499 
released it that's because it's new if
you<00:04:46.529> stretch<00:04:46.889> that<00:04:47.189> it<00:04:47.399> stays<00:04:47.729> as<00:04:47.969> an<00:04:48.089> open

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
you stretch that it stays as an open

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.749 
you stretch that it stays as an open
piece<00:04:48.749> so<00:04:49.199> it's<00:04:49.349> easier<00:04:49.739> to<00:04:49.919> hook<00:04:50.069> over<00:04:50.309> stuff

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
piece so it's easier to hook over stuff

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.509 
piece so it's easier to hook over stuff
oh<00:04:51.029> you<00:04:51.899> did<00:04:52.639> pull<00:04:53.639> that<00:04:53.819> end<00:04:53.969> piece<00:04:54.269> out<00:04:54.659> okay
