00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.440
 Brighter stars burn your eyes 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.160
 A thick hair color 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.960
 It seems that created Hell 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.660
 You're smart, but intelligent life is already 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160
 And at night instead of sleeping 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.460
 You're a war with acting 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.680
 Lightning blood repaid 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.540
 Antique game illuminated 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.840
 Formidable power returned 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.180
 Sage still become 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.640
 All people dream to serve? 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.160
 And they show the fist 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.600
 Some will get 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.420
 Ride a herd of dogs 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.540
 You better listen to me 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.040
 Give up on your dreams 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.720
 I sell worthless life 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.240
 And the fire didn't touch you 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.080
 wise fire 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.560
 And it doesn't need that 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.700
 The one who goes into the darkness 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.300
 Whose cold hand 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.400
 Lightning blood repaid 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.480
 Antique game illuminated 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.420
 Formidable power returned 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.660
 Sage still become 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.760
 The life of most runs in a dream 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.820
 Replace the dim reality of vivid dreams 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.420
 And the bigger the gap between them 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.540
 The easier it is to give up the battle 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.980
 Everyone has a choice 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.660
 leave or a 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.100
 Come back! 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.880
 After all, when a person is something that really wants 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.200
 it helps the whole universe! 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.880
 For the life of your back 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.380
 For the sake of the people for their own sake
