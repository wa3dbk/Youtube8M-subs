fabric<00:04:46.419> that<00:04:46.599> will<00:04:46.779> also<00:04:46.959> help<00:04:47.379> even<00:04:47.889> things

00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:48.309 
fabric that will also help even things

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:53.369 
fabric that will also help even things
out<00:04:49.830> so<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.919> pick<00:04:51.129> up<00:04:51.339> that<00:04:51.580> wrapped<00:04:52.059> stitch<00:04:52.959> on

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:53.379 
out so to pick up that wrapped stitch on

00:04:53.379 --> 00:05:05.820 
out so to pick up that wrapped stitch on
a<00:04:53.439> purl<00:04:53.889> side<00:04:56.069> it's<00:04:57.069> just<00:04:57.219> as<00:04:57.580> easy<00:05:04.709> and<00:05:05.709> I<00:05:05.800> have

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
a purl side it's just as easy and I have

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.359 
a purl side it's just as easy and I have
a<00:05:06.039> little<00:05:06.219> more<00:05:06.429> trouble<00:05:06.729> finding<00:05:08.099> the<00:05:09.099> wrap

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:09.369 
a little more trouble finding the wrap

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:13.559 
a little more trouble finding the wrap
on<00:05:09.929> purl<00:05:10.929> fabric<00:05:11.759> so<00:05:12.759> I<00:05:12.789> always<00:05:13.089> just<00:05:13.300> have<00:05:13.449> to

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
on purl fabric so I always just have to

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.419 
on purl fabric so I always just have to
try<00:05:13.749> to<00:05:13.809> remember<00:05:13.959> which<00:05:14.409> stitch<00:05:14.769> I<00:05:14.949> wrapped

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:17.429 

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:21.019 

okay<00:05:18.429> there<00:05:18.699> it<00:05:18.789> is<00:05:18.939> you<00:05:19.509> can<00:05:19.539> see<00:05:19.809> that<00:05:19.839> extra

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:21.029 
okay there it is you can see that extra

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.059 
okay there it is you can see that extra
strand<00:05:22.029> of<00:05:22.119> fabric<00:05:22.479> around<00:05:22.629> the<00:05:22.869> base<00:05:23.050> of<00:05:23.469> the

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
strand of fabric around the base of the

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.629 
strand of fabric around the base of the
stitch<00:05:24.659> and<00:05:25.659> I<00:05:26.229> find<00:05:26.559> it<00:05:26.709> easier<00:05:27.159> when<00:05:27.519> I'm

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
stitch and I find it easier when I'm

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.509 
stitch and I find it easier when I'm
picking<00:05:27.849> up<00:05:28.089> on<00:05:28.329> the<00:05:28.479> purl<00:05:28.749> side<00:05:29.050> if<00:05:29.379> I<00:05:29.559> grab

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:30.519 
picking up on the purl side if I grab

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:33.029 
picking up on the purl side if I grab
that<00:05:30.550> stitch<00:05:31.209> that's<00:05:31.869> wrapped<00:05:32.289> and<00:05:32.559> slide<00:05:32.860> it

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
that stitch that's wrapped and slide it

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.869 
that stitch that's wrapped and slide it
to<00:05:33.069> my<00:05:33.369> right<00:05:33.610> needle<00:05:33.819> and<00:05:34.349> then<00:05:35.550> pick<00:05:36.550> up<00:05:36.579> the

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
to my right needle and then pick up the

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:41.299 
to my right needle and then pick up the
wrap<00:05:37.559> like<00:05:38.559> that<00:05:38.860> with<00:05:39.309> my<00:05:39.459> left<00:05:39.639> needle<00:05:39.999> and

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:41.309 
wrap like that with my left needle and

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:47.929 
wrap like that with my left needle and
put<00:05:42.309> them<00:05:42.459> both<00:05:42.610> on<00:05:42.819> together<00:05:43.529> and<00:05:44.529> then

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:47.939 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:53.699 

purling<00:05:48.939> them<00:05:49.089> together<00:05:52.199> but<00:05:53.199> you<00:05:53.349> could<00:05:53.559> do

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:53.709 
purling them together but you could do

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:58.559 
purling them together but you could do
it<00:05:53.740> however<00:05:54.339> is<00:05:54.749> comfortable<00:05:55.749> for<00:05:55.809> you<00:05:57.569> and

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569 
it however is comfortable for you and

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:00.719 
it however is comfortable for you and
I'll<00:05:58.719> just<00:05:58.899> show<00:05:59.110> you<00:05:59.169> the<00:05:59.740> front<00:06:00.099> of<00:06:00.459> the

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
I'll just show you the front of the

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:06.000 
I'll just show you the front of the
fabric

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.520 

so<00:06:06.880> it<00:06:07.120> looks<00:06:07.270> a<00:06:07.390> little<00:06:07.510> weird<00:06:07.900> right<00:06:08.140> now<00:06:08.500> I

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
so it looks a little weird right now I

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.200 
so it looks a little weird right now I
don't<00:06:08.680> know<00:06:08.830> if<00:06:08.980> you<00:06:09.100> can<00:06:09.250> tell<00:06:09.490> on<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:10.180> camera

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
don't know if you can tell on the camera

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.320 
don't know if you can tell on the camera
that<00:06:10.690> little<00:06:10.980> bit<00:06:11.980> of<00:06:12.010> a<00:06:12.190> bump<00:06:12.430> but<00:06:12.730> that

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
that little bit of a bump but that

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.550 
that little bit of a bump but that
should<00:06:13.660> even<00:06:13.930> itself<00:06:14.530> out<00:06:15.510> as<00:06:16.510> you<00:06:17.110> continue

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
should even itself out as you continue

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.910 
should even itself out as you continue
knitting<00:06:18.090> so<00:06:19.090> that<00:06:19.300> is<00:06:19.630> on<00:06:19.990> stockinette

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
knitting so that is on stockinette

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.190 
knitting so that is on stockinette
fabric<00:06:20.950> if<00:06:21.520> you're<00:06:21.670> just<00:06:21.910> doing<00:06:22.200> garter

stitch<00:06:23.440> fabric<00:06:23.980> you<00:06:24.130> don't<00:06:24.370> have<00:06:24.610> to<00:06:24.820> pick<00:06:24.970> up

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
stitch fabric you don't have to pick up

stitch fabric you don't have to pick up
your<00:06:25.300> wraps<00:06:25.830> because<00:06:26.830> they're<00:06:27.010> going<00:06:27.160> to<00:06:27.280> be

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
your wraps because they're going to be

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.380 
your wraps because they're going to be
disguised<00:06:29.770> pretty<00:06:30.580> well<00:06:32.940> so<00:06:33.940> I<00:06:33.970> mean<00:06:34.180> you

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
disguised pretty well so I mean you

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.090 
disguised pretty well so I mean you
could<00:06:34.570> pick<00:06:34.810> them<00:06:34.990> up<00:06:35.080> on<00:06:35.260> garter<00:06:35.620> fabric<00:06:35.980> if

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.060 
could pick them up on garter fabric if
you<00:06:36.130> want<00:06:36.430> to<00:06:36.610> but<00:06:36.850> you<00:06:37.030> really<00:06:37.860> don't<00:06:38.860> have

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.070 
you want to but you really don't have

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.520 
you want to but you really don't have
anything<00:06:39.670> to<00:06:39.880> hide<00:06:40.180> on<00:06:40.450> garter<00:06:40.810> stitch<00:06:41.020> fabric

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
anything to hide on garter stitch fabric

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.290 
anything to hide on garter stitch fabric
with<00:06:41.680> those<00:06:41.860> wraps<00:06:42.160> they'll<00:06:42.760> just<00:06:42.940> kind<00:06:43.120> of

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
with those wraps they'll just kind of

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:49.110 
with those wraps they'll just kind of
hide<00:06:44.230> themselves<00:06:45.690> okay<00:06:46.690> so<00:06:46.750> there<00:06:47.170> is<00:06:47.970> what<00:06:48.970> my

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
hide themselves okay so there is what my

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.120 
hide themselves okay so there is what my
fabric<00:06:49.540> looks<00:06:49.750> like<00:06:50.020> after<00:06:50.710> doing<00:06:50.980> a<00:06:51.100> few

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
fabric looks like after doing a few

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:59.730 
fabric looks like after doing a few
short<00:06:51.610> rows<00:06:56.700> and<00:06:57.700> that's<00:06:57.880> it<00:06:58.170> for<00:06:59.170> wrap<00:06:59.500> and

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
short rows and that's it for wrap and

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.460 
short rows and that's it for wrap and
turn<00:06:59.860> short<00:07:00.280> rows
