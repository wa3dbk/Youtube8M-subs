several purposes

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.630 
several purposes
the<00:01:05.239> biggest<00:01:05.659> one<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.170> just<00:01:06.770> by<00:01:06.890> collapsing<00:01:07.490> it

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
the biggest one is just by collapsing it

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.490 
the biggest one is just by collapsing it
moves<00:01:08.120> to<00:01:08.240> different<00:01:08.570> positions<00:01:08.690> so<00:01:09.260> a

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
moves to different positions so a

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.650 
moves to different positions so a
shooter<00:01:10.070> can<00:01:10.280> set<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.640> length<00:01:10.970> of<00:01:11.180> pool<00:01:11.420> to

shooter can set the length of pool to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.750 
shooter can set the length of pool to
fit<00:01:11.930> them<00:01:12.170> which<00:01:12.770> helps<00:01:13.010> them<00:01:13.100> manage<00:01:13.250> recoil

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
fit them which helps them manage recoil

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.820 
fit them which helps them manage recoil
and<00:01:13.970> get<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.090> better<00:01:14.330> fit<00:01:14.660> for<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:14.960> gun<00:01:15.200> when

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
and get a better fit for the gun when

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.320 
and get a better fit for the gun when
it's<00:01:15.980> collapsed<00:01:16.460> all<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.670> way<00:01:16.760> down<00:01:16.970> it<00:01:17.180> also

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
it's collapsed all the way down it also

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.480 
it's collapsed all the way down it also
makes<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.750> easier<00:01:17.870> for<00:01:18.110> storage<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.070> for
