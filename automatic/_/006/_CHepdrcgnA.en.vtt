hello and welcome here we're gonna show
you<00:00:09.840> how<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.849> subtract<00:00:11.849> binary<00:00:12.509> number<00:00:13.519> if<00:00:14.519> we

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
you how to subtract binary number if we

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.599 
you how to subtract binary number if we
got<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.120> example<00:00:15.599> for<00:00:15.929> exam

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
got this example for exam

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.200 
got this example for exam
I'll<00:00:18.029> give<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.449> bit<00:00:18.890> refreshment<00:00:20.000> if<00:00:21.000> we

I'll give you a bit refreshment if we

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.929 
I'll give you a bit refreshment if we
get<00:00:21.390> like<00:00:23.119> 20<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:25.170> want<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.619> subtract<00:00:26.310> 8<00:00:28.939> so

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
get like 20 and we want to subtract 8 so

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.440 
get like 20 and we want to subtract 8 so
we<00:00:30.210> can't<00:00:33.739> 0-8<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:35.040> can't<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.270> we're

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
we can't 0-8 we can't do that so we're

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.430 
we can't 0-8 we can't do that so we're
gonna<00:00:36.829> borrow<00:00:37.829> from<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.930> it's<00:00:39.930> gonna<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.290> 1

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
gonna borrow from here it's gonna be 1

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.250 
gonna borrow from here it's gonna be 1
and<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.100> gonna<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.489> 10<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:43.590> 10<00:00:46.190> minus<00:00:47.190> 8<00:00:48.260> -

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and this is gonna be 10 so 10 minus 8 -

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.000 
and this is gonna be 10 so 10 minus 8 -
and<00:00:49.670> we're<00:00:50.670> gonna<00:00:50.789> cut<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.510> down<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.989> 1<00:00:52.199> so

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and we're gonna cut it down the 1 so

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.139 
and we're gonna cut it down the 1 so
gonna<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.550> 12<00:00:54.710> eat<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.039> same<00:00:56.309> thing<00:00:56.550> we're

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
gonna be 12 eat the same thing we're

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:06.789 
gonna be 12 eat the same thing we're
gonna<00:00:57.559> see<00:00:58.559> that<00:01:00.440> 1<00:01:01.440> minus<00:01:01.920> 1<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.719> 0<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.739> 0

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
gonna see that 1 minus 1 is 0 and 0

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.640 
gonna see that 1 minus 1 is 0 and 0
minus<00:01:07.799> 1<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.600> we're<00:01:10.530> gonna

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
minus 1 you can do that so we're gonna

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.740 
minus 1 you can do that so we're gonna
borrow<00:01:10.979> from<00:01:11.130> next<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:12.060> can't<00:01:12.299> borrow<00:01:12.540> from

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
borrow from next we can't borrow from

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.850 
borrow from next we can't borrow from
here<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.350> we're<00:01:13.500> gonna<00:01:13.650> borrow<00:01:13.950> from<00:01:14.220> here

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.850 
here so we're gonna borrow from here
it's<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.250> 0<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.710> is<00:01:19.710> gonna<00:01:19.890> be

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
it's going to be 0 and this is gonna be

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:31.069 
it's going to be 0 and this is gonna be

1 0 and we gonna borrow here I'm gonna

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.030 
1 0 and we gonna borrow here I'm gonna
take<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.590> 0<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:32.909> going<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.270> 0<00:01:33.720> 1<00:01:35.720> 0<00:01:36.720> 1

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
take this 0 so it's going to be 0 1 0 1

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:47.149 
take this 0 so it's going to be 0 1 0 1
minus<00:01:38.040> 1<00:01:38.750> equal<00:01:39.750> 1<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:42.649> 1<00:01:43.649> minus<00:01:44.130> 1<00:01:44.700> equals<00:01:45.420> 0<00:01:46.159> 0

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
minus 1 equal 1 and 1 minus 1 equals 0 0

00:01:47.159 --> 00:02:00.249 
minus 1 equal 1 and 1 minus 1 equals 0 0
minus<00:01:47.640> 0<00:01:47.670> equals<00:01:48.259> 0<00:01:49.520> 1<00:01:50.520> minus<00:01:50.970> 1<00:01:51.060> 0<00:01:52.009> 0<00:01:55.070> 1<00:01:56.070> 1<00:01:58.640> -<00:01:59.640> 0

equal<00:02:01.259> 1<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.299> 0<00:02:03.299> minus<00:02:03.750> 0<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:04.259> 0<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:06.509> make<00:02:06.659> sure

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
equal 1 and 0 minus 0 is 0 to make sure

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.430 
equal 1 and 0 minus 0 is 0 to make sure
we're<00:02:07.409> gonna<00:02:07.560> convert<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.789> first<00:02:09.060> number<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
we're gonna convert the first number to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.860 
we're gonna convert the first number to
a<00:02:10.470> decimal

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
a decimal

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.340 
a decimal
so<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:13.080> gonna<00:02:13.260> be<00:02:15.230> 89<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:18.450> number<00:02:18.720> to

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
so it's gonna be 89 and this number to

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.090 
so it's gonna be 89 and this number to
decimal<00:02:20.340> it's<00:02:20.970> gonna<00:02:21.240> be<00:02:22.010> 23<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:24.890> we<00:02:25.890> gonna

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
decimal it's gonna be 23 and we gonna

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:34.460 
decimal it's gonna be 23 and we gonna
subtract<00:02:26.790> them<00:02:30.170> 89<00:02:31.170> minus<00:02:31.860> 23

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
subtract them 89 minus 23

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.960 
subtract them 89 minus 23
the<00:02:34.830> answer<00:02:35.250> gonna<00:02:35.490> be<00:02:36.020> 66<00:02:37.250> which<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.520> this

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
the answer gonna be 66 which is this

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.930 
the answer gonna be 66 which is this
number

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.050 

thank<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.600> for<00:02:42.840> listening
