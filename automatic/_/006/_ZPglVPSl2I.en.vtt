00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 good i am is from books to read and today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.830
 I bring you a new unboxing on the channel 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.600
 it's going to be short and I'm really going to open 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.000
 a package that contains two books but 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.640
 of which only one is for me but 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.040
 I hope you like it equally 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.630
 the package that I'm going to open is this 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.340
 As you can see, it's quite big and good 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.530
 it contains a book here and another here 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.420
 not because you notice it's two books that 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.830
 I bought the same day one in the morning 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.570
 another at night and thanks to that I am 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.180
 premium in amazon because they reach me 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.619
 two days worth then I will proceed to 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.619
 open it and I'll show you what they are 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.060
 let 's see is that what I have many 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.010
 you win first the one that is not for me 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.650
 harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.230
 de jk rowling is a book that I bought him 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.750
 my boyfriend because I bet that 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.220
 before Christmas' the new shelves 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.620
 that I leave the video here for you 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.630
 you see them a little they would not be full 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.390
 according to my point of view I said is 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.400
 impossible that so many bookshelves 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.080
 meters of shelves are filled before 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.480
 Christmas and in effect relocating the 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.130
 My room's books got full worth 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.720
 He filled it whole and then I have to 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.370
 buy a book that is harry potter and 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.260
 the prisoner of azkaban in the edition 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.540
 pocket which is where you started to 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.640
 buy the first books that good 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.590
 Well, it's really a cuckoo and to me 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.850
 they like these editions and now comes the 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.860
 strong dish that this book that I 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.450
 I bought what I bought because it was on sale 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.310
 and I was really going to end up buying melo 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.200
 but I did not know when and surely I would 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.430
 would buy in softcover edition that the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.900
 truth is that there are some books that 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.520
 they are worth it in soft cover and others 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.720
 no, and I think in this case it's a 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.030
 book that in soft cover would lose 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.009
 I quite believe and last before anything else 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.869
 It's about the spin-off of Will Grace Will 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.850
 grace john dejongh david leigh anne is 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.310
 a novel only written by denise 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.960
 levitan and it's a novel that is not a 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.560
 novel really about the character of 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.560
 tiny coupe 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.560
 how nice 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.210
 it's beautiful, that is, it's super gay 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.700
 I love that beautiful love me 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.330
 you love it I swear that bright and that 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.910
 striking 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.990
 it smells like chrome four models 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.060
 collection and how nice it is as if it were 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.040
 the script of the musical hair I tell you 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.930
 is the script of the musical the timing upper 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.910
 of the latest version for those who have 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.010
 lewis will grace jones know you're 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.990
 nicu but in the end it is changing its 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.030
 work and therefore has another good title because 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.530
 this is the final work and for those who do not 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.480
 You have read it, well, it is not 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.710
 big valuable spoiler the man looks 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.560
 that from the first moment is 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.940
 changing the script all the time 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.070
 this this book 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.100
 it really is the script that I'm going to 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.410
 check in effect is the script of what 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.510
 that his work would be his musical work and 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.030
 can see parts is because for example 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.280
 just this part comes out in will grace and 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.890
 will grace on not to clear yes but it comes out 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.959
 narrated also seems like something pretty 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.240
 rather curious that a novel is not and 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.670
 that the one that is to be commercialized and 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.140
 it's really a script but I read that 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.240
 has some annotations as of the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.190
 characters then I think it's going to be 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.050
 something weird is probably from my 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.030
 next readings in plan and surely 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.990
 read it since it's super short looks like 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.180
 to read quickly because it's a work of 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.770
 it's a musical and the technical character 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.660
 but I liked it very much will grace very 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.940
 thick I liked a lot of video me 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.480
 I really like it so it's already 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.920
 precious the edition is that now it 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.420
 wants to melt lean for a while and it's 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.790
 this has been all for the unboxing of today 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.050
 I hope you liked it and that you read 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.060
 mercalli are very grayson valley 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.800
 you understand my family for this book 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.930
 I will bring next unboxing because I have 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.120
 bought thanks to the amazon offers 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.100
 the odd book worth sinned 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.130
 consumerist to me we will see new 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.330
 videos and new things and those things and 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.800
 many things 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.700
 I always say the same, I hope that I have 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.700
 liked goodbye
