00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.770 
came out and I just I loved him and it's
just<00:02:56.799> so<00:02:57.099> much<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.579> him<00:02:57.730> he's<00:02:58.090> such<00:02:58.359> a<00:02:58.389> perfect

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
just so much to him he's such a perfect

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.410 
just so much to him he's such a perfect
or<00:02:59.079> on<00:02:59.290> striker<00:02:59.769> but<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> only<00:03:00.670> thing<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.359> don't

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
or on striker but the only thing I don't

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.030 
or on striker but the only thing I don't
like<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.049> fact<00:03:02.170> he's<00:03:02.500> left<00:03:02.680> foot<00:03:02.829> it<00:03:02.889> if<00:03:02.980> he

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
like is the fact he's left foot it if he

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.379 
like is the fact he's left foot it if he
was<00:03:03.189> right<00:03:03.310> for<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:03.579> I<00:03:03.670> think<00:03:03.879> he<00:03:04.000> would<00:03:04.239> be<00:03:04.269> the

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
was right for it I think he would be the

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.030 
was right for it I think he would be the
best<00:03:04.689> driver<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.109> game<00:03:05.290> it'd<00:03:05.680> be<00:03:05.889> out<00:03:06.010> of

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
best driver on the game it'd be out of

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.309 
best driver on the game it'd be out of
him<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.370> Abraham<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> bitch<00:03:06.970> but<00:03:07.329> being<00:03:08.109> left

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
him and Abraham a bitch but being left

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.679 
him and Abraham a bitch but being left
footed<00:03:08.530> can<00:03:09.400> be<00:03:09.549> a<00:03:09.579> bit<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.909> pain<00:03:10.120> for<00:03:10.359> me<00:03:10.510> I

from the airway line I think this is the
girl<00:03:34.419> coming<00:03:34.720> up<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:35.019> minute<00:03:35.129> he's<00:03:36.129> away<00:03:36.459> as

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
doesn't miss a finish just rock it's a

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.420

worried
600k<00:04:27.800> he<00:04:28.039> dropped<00:04:28.370> down<00:04:28.580> Rumaki<00:04:29.180> was<00:04:29.539> a

600k he dropped down Rumaki was a

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.059 
600k he dropped down Rumaki was a
million<00:04:29.930> coins<00:04:30.080> he<00:04:30.289> dropped<00:04:30.530> down<00:04:30.620> so<00:04:30.860> much

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
million coins he dropped down so much

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.460 
million coins he dropped down so much
now<00:04:31.300> if<00:04:32.300> I<00:04:32.449> was<00:04:32.569> to<00:04:32.599> give<00:04:32.780> them<00:04:32.900> an<00:04:32.960> overall

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
now if I was to give them an overall

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.020 
now if I was to give them an overall
rate<00:04:33.830> in<00:04:33.979> I'd<00:04:34.250> have<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.610> give<00:04:34.699> him<00:04:34.789> a<00:04:34.819> line

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.119 
rate in I'd have to give him a line
because<00:04:35.270> I'm<00:04:35.539> not<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:36.020> fan<00:04:36.409> of<00:04:36.470> that<00:04:36.830> left<00:04:37.039> foot

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:37.129 
because I'm not a fan of that left foot

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.129 
because I'm not a fan of that left foot
and<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.849> think<00:04:38.120> sometimes<00:04:38.539> his<00:04:38.720> shot<00:04:38.960> power

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
and I think sometimes his shot power

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.409 
and I think sometimes his shot power
it's<00:04:39.979> just<00:04:40.220> too<00:04:40.400> much<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.940> he<00:04:41.060> hits<00:04:41.240> it<00:04:41.330> a

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
it's just too much and he hits it a

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.390 
it's just too much and he hits it a
little<00:04:41.690> bit<00:04:41.810> too<00:04:41.990> hard<00:04:42.229> at<00:04:42.409> times<00:04:42.590> but<00:04:43.220> other

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
little bit too hard at times but other

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.950 
little bit too hard at times but other
than<00:04:43.550> that<00:04:43.610> he<00:04:43.849> does<00:04:44.030> everything<00:04:44.419> else

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
than that he does everything else

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.409 
than that he does everything else
perfect<00:04:45.590> he's<00:04:46.159> a<00:04:46.190> very<00:04:46.550> very<00:04:46.729> strong<00:04:47.060> striker

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
perfect he's a very very strong striker

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.790 
perfect he's a very very strong striker
which<00:04:47.720> I<00:04:47.900> think<00:04:48.080> everyone<00:04:48.289> likes<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.650> have<00:04:48.740> a

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
which I think everyone likes to have a

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.490 
which I think everyone likes to have a
strong<00:04:49.099> and<00:04:49.280> fast<00:04:49.460> striker<00:04:49.930> he<00:04:50.930> reminds<00:04:51.349> me<00:04:51.409> a

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
strong and fast striker he reminds me a

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.320 
strong and fast striker he reminds me a
lot<00:04:51.650> of<00:04:51.800> ibrahimovic<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.610> way<00:04:52.759> when<00:04:53.120> he's<00:04:53.240> on

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
lot of ibrahimovic the way when he's on

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.059 
lot of ibrahimovic the way when he's on
the<00:04:53.360> ball<00:04:53.629> and<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.080> way<00:04:54.199> he<00:04:54.349> takes<00:04:54.830> the

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:55.069 
the ball and the way he takes the

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:57.279 
the ball and the way he takes the
stances<00:04:55.430> on<00:04:55.610> free<00:04:55.789> kicks<00:04:56.000> and<00:04:56.180> stuff<00:04:56.360> you<00:04:57.020> can

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289

relate<00:04:57.590> him<00:04:57.770> to<00:04:57.979> ibrahimovic<00:04:58.879> quite<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.120> bit

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
relate him to ibrahimovic quite a bit

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.129 
relate him to ibrahimovic quite a bit

only<00:05:03.349> like<00:05:03.500> I<00:05:03.620> said<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:04.190> only<00:05:04.430> downsides<00:05:04.940> of

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
only like I said the only downsides of

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.270 
only like I said the only downsides of
him<00:05:05.180> is<00:05:05.389> that<00:05:05.680> sometimes<00:05:06.680> he<00:05:06.800> hits<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.099> ball<00:05:07.250> a

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
him is that sometimes he hits the ball a

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.399 
him is that sometimes he hits the ball a
little<00:05:07.460> bit<00:05:07.759> too<00:05:07.880> hard<00:05:08.120> and<00:05:08.419> being<00:05:09.229> left

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
little bit too hard and being left

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.499 
little bit too hard and being left
