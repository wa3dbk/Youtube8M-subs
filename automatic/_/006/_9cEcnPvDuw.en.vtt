00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.430
 m 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.320
 and 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.220
 hello today tornado ms plexi 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:27.460
 So an amp that takes over the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.090
 specifications of the famous plessis 18 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.200
 marshall with improvements that's at 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.720
 say that parts for example we have some 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.750
 mercury magnetix processors and parts 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.800
 have therefore been revised upwards at the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.020
 quality everything has been really thinking back to 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.960
 this level then we have as on 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.290
 the original one has two channels one channel where 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.360
 we just have the volume and the tone and 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.920
 then the channel with the tremolo in which 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.270
 resumes volume tons and then 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.370
 the intensity and the speed of the tremolo 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.710
 can plug on speakers in 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.490
 four or eight or in 16 ohms if if we have 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.200
 a tornado baffle ms also with 2m 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.910
 75 from this come back 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.800
 we will first listen to him in his clear 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.300
 with this TV which is equipped with 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.750
 golden pickups ademe s17 you are the 55 and 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.350
 let's go 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.350
 Let's go 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.190
 Oh 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.550
 Oh 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.700
 the most obviously the most of this amp 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.209
 it's the tremolo so we'll listen to that 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.209
 right now 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.459
 no 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.630
 2 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.090
 m 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.230
 you 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.370
 we go to the double coil we are already 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.400
 in his crunch we will add a little 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.040
 of overdrive afterwards to saturate a 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.620
 little more amp at the entrance and then we 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.440
 will put the tremolo in the end that's like 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.129
 that will make dunbourgnoux fund will be rich 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.129
 here we go 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.470

 tornado msd humbucker 59 so pickups 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.449
 who are fairly faithful to the original paf 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
