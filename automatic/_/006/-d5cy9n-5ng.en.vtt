completely off both sides and then

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.580 
completely off both sides and then
you're<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> unscrew<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.600> then

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you're going to unscrew here and then

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.520 
you're going to unscrew here and then
you're<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> unscrew<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:03.239> where<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
you're going to unscrew up here where it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.000 
you're going to unscrew up here where it
connects<00:01:04.949> into<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> bottom<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.540> faucet

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
connects into the bottom of the faucet

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.460 
connects into the bottom of the faucet
the<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.760> larger<00:01:09.150> end<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.080> typically

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the the larger end on this is typically

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.890 
the the larger end on this is typically
what<00:01:10.770> goes<00:01:10.979> into<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.460> faucet<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.540> smaller

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
what goes into the faucet the smaller

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.450 
what goes into the faucet the smaller
end<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.380> typically<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:13.950> goes<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.369> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
end is typically what goes into that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.070 
end is typically what goes into that
water<00:01:14.790> supply<00:01:15.030> line<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.630> we'll<00:01:15.780> show<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:15.960> how

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
water supply line so we'll show you how

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.200 
water supply line so we'll show you how
to<00:01:16.200> do<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.770> that's<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.159> quick<00:01:17.369> quick

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
to do that but that's the quick quick

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.050 
to do that but that's the quick quick
what<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.450> call<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.900> two<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.380> two<00:01:19.590> one<00:01:19.619> how<00:01:19.950> you

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
what I call one two one two one how you

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.140 
what I call one two one two one how you
worry<00:01:21.060> how<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.689> where<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.960> goes<00:01:23.150> so

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
worry how you do it where it goes so

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.370 
worry how you do it where it goes so
like<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.479> said<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.750> first<00:01:24.960> thing<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.200> want<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
like I said the first thing you want to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.800 
like I said the first thing you want to
do<00:01:25.560> before<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.070> replace<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.640> line<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.630> you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
do before you replace this line is you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.319 
do before you replace this line is you
want<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.020> turn<00:01:28.229> off<00:01:28.259> your<00:01:28.560> water<00:01:28.710> supply<00:01:29.329> you

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
want to turn off your water supply you

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.940 
want to turn off your water supply you
can<00:01:30.479> use<00:01:30.659> different<00:01:30.990> tools<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.530> lights<00:01:31.770> them

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
can use different tools I lights them

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.700 
can use different tools I lights them
out<00:01:32.100> whatever<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.270> don't<00:01:33.689> strip<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.290> nut

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
out whatever you do don't strip the nut

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.289 
out whatever you do don't strip the nut
at<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> bottom<00:01:35.369> that's<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.000> thing<00:01:36.270> right

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
at the bottom that's this thing right

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.550 
at the bottom that's this thing right
here

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
here

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.450 
here
the<00:01:38.340> most<00:01:38.579> useful<00:01:39.360> thing<00:01:39.600> obviously<00:01:40.020> is

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
the most useful thing obviously is

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.090 
the most useful thing obviously is
channel<00:01:41.460> locks<00:01:41.869> pipe<00:01:42.869> wrench<00:01:43.200> most<00:01:43.890> pipe

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
channel locks pipe wrench most pipe

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.889 
channel locks pipe wrench most pipe
wrenches<00:01:44.430> are<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.880> big<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.240> don't<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
wrenches are really big I don't have the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.039 
wrenches are really big I don't have the
little<00:01:46.140> mini<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:48.180> works<00:01:48.509> really<00:01:48.810> well

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
little mini one this works really well
