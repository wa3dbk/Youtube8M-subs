what I can tell so far though it's a
it's<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.970> little<00:00:27.330> unstable<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:29.400> tried<00:00:29.699> to

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
it's a little unstable I just tried to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.479 
it's a little unstable I just tried to
check<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> new<00:00:31.890> watch<00:00:32.189> based

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.479 
check out one of the new watch based
settings<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.030> rebooted<00:00:33.600> itself<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.710> we'll

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
settings and rebooted itself so we'll

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.340 
settings and rebooted itself so we'll
see<00:00:35.670> how<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.910> goes<00:00:36.090> we're<00:00:36.540> gonna<00:00:36.630> try<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.320> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
see how it goes we're gonna try to do a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.959 
see how it goes we're gonna try to do a
walk-through<00:00:37.890> hopefully<00:00:38.399> it'll<00:00:38.610> make<00:00:38.820> it

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
walk-through hopefully it'll make it

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.760 
walk-through hopefully it'll make it
through<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> walkthrough<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.170> know<00:00:40.530> maybe

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
through the walkthrough you know maybe

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.350 
through the walkthrough you know maybe
we<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> things<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.090> when

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
we can do one of the things like when

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.119 
we can do one of the things like when
steve<00:00:42.690> jobs<00:00:42.719> announced<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.620> first<00:00:43.770> iphone

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
that worked on it were actually in the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.540 
that worked on it were actually in the
audience<00:00:48.719> doing<00:00:49.200> shots<00:00:49.559> every<00:00:50.100> time<00:00:50.340> that

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
audience doing shots every time that

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.540 
audience doing shots every time that
they're<00:00:50.879> part<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.690> demo<00:00:51.899> worked<00:00:52.550> all

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
they're part of the demo worked all

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.779 
they're part of the demo worked all
right<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.890> don't<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:55.980> anything<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.489> shots

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
right I don't have anything to do shots

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.700 
right I don't have anything to do shots
up<00:00:57.059> anyway<00:00:57.629> let's<00:00:57.840> take<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> look<00:00:58.230> at<00:00:58.320> watch<00:00:58.500> it

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
up anyway let's take a look at watch it

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.029 
up anyway let's take a look at watch it
was<00:00:58.859> two<00:00:59.129> beta<00:01:00.090> 5<00:01:00.390> okay<00:01:01.320> starting<00:01:01.770> from<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
was two beta 5 okay starting from the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.670 
was two beta 5 okay starting from the
top<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.640> now<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.890> quick<00:01:04.890> play<00:01:05.159> button<00:01:05.610> in

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
top we now have a quick play button in

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.340 
top we now have a quick play button in
music<00:01:07.909> so<00:01:09.530> it's<00:01:10.530> quick<00:01:10.830> play<00:01:11.040> hmm<00:01:12.229> think<00:01:13.229> we

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
music so it's quick play hmm think we

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.310 
music so it's quick play hmm think we
got<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> plate<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.040> source<00:01:14.520> first<00:01:15.110> which<00:01:16.110> will

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
got a plate the source first which will

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.980 
got a plate the source first which will
say<00:01:16.590> comes<00:01:16.950> from<00:01:17.119> Apple<00:01:18.119> watch<00:01:19.909> okay<00:01:20.990> that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
say comes from Apple watch okay that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.700 
say comes from Apple watch okay that
didn't<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.650> seem<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.369> work<00:01:24.530> it's<00:01:25.530> supposed

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
didn't really seem to work it's supposed

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
didn't really seem to work it's supposed
to<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> shuffle<00:01:26.880> type<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.450> deal<00:01:28.850> but<00:01:29.850> I

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
to be like a shuffle type of deal but I

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.950 
to be like a shuffle type of deal but I
guess<00:01:30.450> that's<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:32.000> quick<00:01:33.000> play<00:01:33.210> only<00:01:33.420> works<00:01:33.780> if

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
guess that's a quick play only works if

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.990 
guess that's a quick play only works if
you're<00:01:34.079> playing<00:01:34.259> through<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:35.040> phone<00:01:35.310> okay

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
fair enough so I'm recording with my

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.940 
fair enough so I'm recording with my
phone<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.390> we're<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.170> okay

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
phone so we're not going to do that okay

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.480 
phone so we're not going to do that okay
