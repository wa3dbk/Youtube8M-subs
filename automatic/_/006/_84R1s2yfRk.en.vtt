it to process the same keystroke that

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.970 
it to process the same keystroke that
you<00:03:00.530> typed<00:03:00.770> in<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:02.350> that<00:03:03.350> will<00:03:03.470> press<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.800> five

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980

button access denied not really that
important<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.940> suppose<00:03:08.390> on<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.440> different

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
important I suppose on a different

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.890 
important I suppose on a different
server<00:03:10.010> if<00:03:10.310> they<00:03:10.550> allow<00:03:10.880> like<00:03:11.150> traps<00:03:11.480> or<00:03:11.690> stuff

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
server if they allow like traps or stuff

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.560 
server if they allow like traps or stuff
then<00:03:12.170> it'd<00:03:12.320> be<00:03:12.610> useful<00:03:13.610> but<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:14.300> don't<00:03:14.450> really

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
then it'd be useful but you don't really

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.350 
then it'd be useful but you don't really
need<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.840> mess<00:03:15.020> with<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.290> right<00:03:15.410> now

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
need to mess with that right now

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.810 
need to mess with that right now
see<00:03:17.360> reset<00:03:18.470> okay<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.070> this<00:03:19.280> is<00:03:19.430> what<00:03:19.640> the

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
see reset okay so this is what the

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.210 
see reset okay so this is what the

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
default stuff is hold link that's how

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.760 
default stuff is hold link that's how
long<00:03:22.460> you<00:03:22.640> want<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:23.150> hold<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:24.110> it's<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.590> stay

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
long you want to hold it it's a stay

long you want to hold it it's a stay
open<00:03:25.070> now<00:03:25.880> on<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.810> server<00:03:27.020> you<00:03:27.320> must<00:03:27.470> have<00:03:27.680> it

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
open now on this server you must have it

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.470 
open now on this server you must have it
open<00:03:28.040> for<00:03:28.220> five<00:03:28.460> seconds<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.060> leave<00:03:29.090> so<00:03:29.390> I'm

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
open for five seconds to leave so I'm

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.640 
open for five seconds to leave so I'm
going<00:03:29.600> to<00:03:29.660> set<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:30.020> five<00:03:30.200> seconds

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
going to set that to five seconds

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.930 
going to set that to five seconds
initial<00:03:31.520> delay<00:03:31.760> that's<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.420> amount<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.440> time

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
initial delay that's the amount of time

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.920 
initial delay that's the amount of time
it<00:03:34.940> will<00:03:35.090> stay<00:03:36.970> materialize<00:03:37.970> until<00:03:38.270> it<00:03:38.720> turns

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
it will stay materialize until it turns

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.050 
it will stay materialize until it turns
fading<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:40.100> this<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.370> how<00:03:40.520> much<00:03:40.670> time<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:41.000> will

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
fading so this is how much time it will

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.680 
fading so this is how much time it will
take<00:03:41.120> before<00:03:41.570> it<00:03:41.810> allows<00:03:42.740> it<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:42.980> be<00:03:43.070> opened

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.020 
take before it allows it to be opened
multiple<00:03:44.690> press<00:03:44.900> delay<00:03:45.320> that's<00:03:46.070> if<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:46.880> want

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
multiple press delay that's if you want

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.420 
multiple press delay that's if you want
to<00:03:47.120> press<00:03:47.270> it<00:03:47.330> more<00:03:47.630> than<00:03:47.780> once<00:03:48.470> by<00:03:49.070> using<00:03:49.250> the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
to press it more than once by using the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.640 
to press it more than once by using the
additional<00:03:49.760> repeats<00:03:50.150> how<00:03:51.050> long<00:03:51.290> it<00:03:51.530> will

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
additional repeats how long it will

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.790 
additional repeats how long it will
pause<00:03:52.460> in<00:03:52.700> between<00:03:52.970> each<00:03:53.120> repeat<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:53.900> then

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
pause in between each repeat and then

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.260 
pause in between each repeat and then
additional<00:03:55.340> repeats<00:03:55.640> just<00:03:55.850> how<00:03:55.910> many<00:03:56.090> times

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
additional repeats just how many times

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.860 
additional repeats just how many times
you<00:03:56.420> want<00:03:56.570> to<00:03:56.600> repeat<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:58.330> and<00:03:59.330> then<00:03:59.600> this<00:03:59.690> is

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
you want to repeat it and then this is

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.100 
you want to repeat it and then this is
just<00:03:59.900> with<00:04:00.110> access<00:04:00.470> denied<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:02.120> let's<00:04:02.630> just

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
just with access denied so let's just

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.380 
just with access denied so let's just
use<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.440> keypad<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:04.540> we'll<00:04:05.540> place<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:07.390> keypad

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
use the keypad and we'll place a keypad

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.530 
use the keypad and we'll place a keypad
right<00:04:08.570> here<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:09.380> we<00:04:09.890> will<00:04:10.130> type<00:04:10.940> in<00:04:11.150> our<00:04:11.180> little

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
right here so we will type in our little

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.700 
right here so we will type in our little
code<00:04:11.900> one<00:04:12.350> three<00:04:13.720> seven<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:15.080> you<00:04:15.350> see<00:04:15.590> how

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
code one three seven and you see how

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.560 
code one three seven and you see how
those<00:04:15.890> little<00:04:16.609> stars<00:04:16.790> there<00:04:17.120> that's<00:04:17.420> the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
those little stars there that's the

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.210 
those little stars there that's the
secure<00:04:17.930> mode<00:04:18.080> right<00:04:18.260> there<00:04:18.440> if<00:04:18.710> that<00:04:18.770> was

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
secure mode right there if that was

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.550 
secure mode right there if that was
unchecked<00:04:19.670> those<00:04:19.880> would<00:04:20.030> be<00:04:20.150> numbers<00:04:20.560> okay

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
unchecked those would be numbers okay

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.100 
unchecked those would be numbers okay
and<00:04:21.830> it<00:04:22.790> should<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.450> can<00:04:23.600> walk<00:04:23.750> through<00:04:23.780> it

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
and it should you can walk through it
