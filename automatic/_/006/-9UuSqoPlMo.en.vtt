sort<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.379> know<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.680> dogs<00:02:59.099> they<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.370> and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
sort of you know the dogs they have and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.140 
sort of you know the dogs they have and
and<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.579> relationship<00:03:02.969> they<00:03:03.030> have

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
and the and the relationship they have

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.369 
and the and the relationship they have
with<00:03:03.180> like<00:03:03.389> to<00:03:03.480> say<00:03:03.629> something<00:03:03.989> about<00:03:04.079> them

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
with like to say something about them

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.440 
with like to say something about them
and<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.950> think<00:03:05.219> the<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:06.000> bigger<00:03:06.180> thing<00:03:06.359> is

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
and I think the the the bigger thing is

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.360 
and I think the the the bigger thing is
we<00:03:06.569> told<00:03:06.689> people<00:03:06.959> not<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.200> bring<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.709> dogs<00:03:07.859> if

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
we told people not to bring in dogs if

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.490 
we told people not to bring in dogs if
the<00:03:08.609> dogs<00:03:09.049> couldn't<00:03:10.049> comport<00:03:10.470> themselves

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the dogs couldn't comport themselves

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.679 
the dogs couldn't comport themselves
well<00:03:11.099> so<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:11.819> think<00:03:11.939> what<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.209> was<00:03:12.299> saying<00:03:12.540> at<00:03:12.599> the

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
well so I think what I was saying at the

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.179 
well so I think what I was saying at the
time<00:03:12.720> was<00:03:13.139> you<00:03:13.319> know<00:03:13.439> well<00:03:13.620> know<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:14.040> guy<00:03:14.129> who

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
time was you know well know the guy who

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.619 
time was you know well know the guy who
brings<00:03:14.459> in<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.669> dog<00:03:14.909> that's<00:03:15.180> like<00:03:15.359> running

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
brings in the dog that's like running

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.330 
brings in the dog that's like running
around<00:03:15.870> knocking<00:03:16.409> everything<00:03:16.650> over<00:03:16.889> that

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
around knocking everything over that

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.729 
around knocking everything over that
would<00:03:17.489> be<00:03:17.609> that<00:03:18.299> will<00:03:18.510> be<00:03:18.629> telling<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.590> your

reflects poorly on you you're done is

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.729 
reflects poorly on you you're done is
what<00:03:25.799> you're<00:03:25.889> saying<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.219> would<00:03:26.549> say<00:03:26.819> that<00:03:27.739> if

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
what you're saying I would say that if

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.569 
what you're saying I would say that if
you<00:03:28.980> bring<00:03:29.310> in<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.549> dog<00:03:31.099> that<00:03:32.099> causes

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
you bring in the dog that causes

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.030 
you bring in the dog that causes
problems<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:34.169> I<00:03:34.409> guess<00:03:34.739> theoretically

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
problems it it I guess theoretically

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.039 
problems it it I guess theoretically
reflects<00:03:35.730> on<00:03:35.909> your<00:03:36.030> judgment<00:03:36.269> but<00:03:36.629> I<00:03:36.689> think<00:03:36.959> it

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
reflects on your judgment but I think it

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.439 
reflects on your judgment but I think it
would<00:03:37.139> have<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.409> be<00:03:37.439> I<00:03:37.889> mean<00:03:38.729> it's<00:03:39.060> mostly

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
would have to be I mean it's mostly

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:40.460 
would have to be I mean it's mostly
tongue-in-cheek<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.139> would<00:03:40.229> have<00:03:40.349> to<00:03:40.440> be

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
tongue-in-cheek it would have to be

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.960 
tongue-in-cheek it would have to be
quite<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.859> catastrophe<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.549> order<00:03:41.729> for<00:03:41.849> it<00:03:41.940> to

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
quite the catastrophe in order for it to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.390 
quite the catastrophe in order for it to
really<00:03:42.150> matter<00:03:42.389> there<00:03:43.319> was<00:03:43.409> just<00:03:43.590> some<00:03:43.769> study

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
really matter there was just some study

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.180 
really matter there was just some study
out<00:03:44.579> this<00:03:44.790> week<00:03:44.970> about<00:03:45.239> dogs<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:46.319> dog

study but I think it's bringing your dog
is<00:03:55.439> great<00:03:55.590> for<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:55.829> couple<00:03:55.979> reasons<00:03:56.189> one<00:03:56.579> at

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
is great for a couple reasons one at

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.479 
is great for a couple reasons one at

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
there's a guilt factor every morning

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.069 
there's a guilt factor every morning
when<00:04:02.669> you<00:04:02.760> leave<00:04:02.939> your<00:04:03.090> dog<00:04:03.269> at<00:04:03.629> home<00:04:03.840> alone

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.649 
around and kids and she'd have a great
time<00:04:10.199> like<00:04:10.560> hanging<00:04:11.009> around<00:04:11.069> but<00:04:11.519> but<00:04:12.090> here

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
time like hanging around but but here

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.420 
time like hanging around but but here
most<00:04:12.959> dogs<00:04:13.229> are<00:04:13.530> sit<00:04:13.799> in<00:04:13.889> their<00:04:14.009> apartment

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
most dogs are sit in their apartment

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.159 
most dogs are sit in their apartment
until<00:04:14.639> the<00:04:14.790> dog<00:04:14.970> walker<00:04:15.239> comes<00:04:15.540> so<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.079> think

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
until the dog walker comes so I think
