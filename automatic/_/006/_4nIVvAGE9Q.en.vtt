00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
game and think it worked pretty well

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.210 
game and think it worked pretty well
it's<00:01:19.659> tough<00:01:19.869> for<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.080> defense<00:01:20.439> to<00:01:20.500> get<00:01:20.799> used<00:01:21.100> to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
it's tough for a defense to get used to

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.740 
it's tough for a defense to get used to
it<00:01:21.340> get<00:01:21.490> adjusted<00:01:21.939> especially<00:01:22.540> when<00:01:22.630> they

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
it get adjusted especially when they

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.390 
it get adjusted especially when they
don't<00:01:22.840> know<00:01:22.990> it's<00:01:23.140> coming<00:01:23.350> so<00:01:23.500> it's<00:01:23.829> another

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
don't know it's coming so it's another

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.859 
don't know it's coming so it's another
practice<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:25.210> we<00:01:25.270> like<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:25.630> we<00:01:25.720> feel

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
practice and we like it we feel

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.469 
practice and we like it we feel
comfortable<00:01:26.320> with<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:28.240> know<00:01:28.329> it's

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
comfortable with and it you know it's

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.719 
comfortable with and it you know it's
been<00:01:29.049> very<00:01:29.259> you<00:01:29.680> know<00:01:29.710> fun<00:01:29.979> for<00:01:30.250> us<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.520> doing

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
been very you know fun for us and doing

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.120 
been very you know fun for us and doing
it<00:01:30.880> because<00:01:31.540> it<00:01:31.810> gives<00:01:31.930> us<00:01:32.110> a<00:01:32.200> different<00:01:32.229> tempo

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
it because it gives us a different tempo

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.350 
it because it gives us a different tempo
a<00:01:33.159> different<00:01:33.490> style<00:01:33.759> we<00:01:33.909> should<00:01:34.060> get<00:01:34.119> up<00:01:34.240> on

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
a different style we should get up on

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.789 
a different style we should get up on
the<00:01:34.450> ball<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:34.780> go<00:01:34.930> play<00:01:35.110> again<00:01:35.409> and<00:01:35.560> hit<00:01:35.680> him

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
the ball and go play again and hit him

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.170 
the ball and go play again and hit him
in<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:35.920> mouth<00:01:35.979> again<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:36.610> you<00:01:37.000> know<00:01:37.060> it's

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
in the mouth again and you know it's

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.399 
in the mouth again and you know it's
good<00:01:37.360> so<00:01:37.570> we<00:01:37.630> got<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.810> lot<00:01:37.990> of<00:01:38.020> different

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
good so we got a lot of different

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.990 
good so we got a lot of different
adjustments<00:01:38.860> from<00:01:38.979> it<00:01:39.189> but<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:39.610> think<00:01:39.729> it
