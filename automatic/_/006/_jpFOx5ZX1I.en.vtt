00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
reverse and then a turning wheel which

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.940 
reverse and then a turning wheel which
turns<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.470> wheel<00:01:21.990> turns<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.110> wheels<00:01:23.410> left

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
turns the wheel turns the wheels left

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.370 
turns the wheel turns the wheels left
and<00:01:24.280> right<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:26.080> let's<00:01:26.319> see<00:01:26.500> it<00:01:26.590> in<00:01:26.709> action

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and right now let's see it in action

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
have a bunch of books to go over then

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.050 
have a bunch of books to go over then
we're<00:01:35.050> going<00:01:35.259> to<00:01:35.440> test<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.220> suspension<00:01:36.459> of

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
we're going to test the suspension of

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.160 
we're going to test the suspension of
the<00:01:37.090> vehicle<00:01:37.599> by<00:01:38.319> going<00:01:38.649> over<00:01:38.830> these<00:01:39.130> canes

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
with one direction books let's see how

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.729 
with one direction books let's see how
the<00:01:55.810> car<00:01:56.080> does<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:58.060> we're<00:01:58.450> off<00:01:58.660> over<00:01:59.649> the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:01:59.739 
the car does and we're off over the

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:02.309
