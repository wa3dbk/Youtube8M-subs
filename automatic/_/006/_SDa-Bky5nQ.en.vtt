00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
that's a good thing because they mean if

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.810 
that's a good thing because they mean if
they<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.930> fit<00:00:37.170> into<00:00:37.370> spaces<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.460> something

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
they can fit into spaces but something

they can fit into spaces but something
got<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> lot<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.210> space<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.600> run<00:00:39.629> where<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.050> what

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
got a lot of space to run where on what

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.350 
got a lot of space to run where on what
computer<00:00:40.559> stuff<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.610> they<00:00:41.790> easily<00:00:41.969> fit

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
computer stuff is so they easily fit

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.389 
computer stuff is so they easily fit
into<00:00:42.510> some<00:00:42.960> little<00:00:43.200> corner<00:00:43.559> oh<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.280> still

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
fitting them in the corner so as she

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.590 
fitting them in the corner so as she
walked<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.980> earth<00:00:50.190> she<00:00:50.430> powered<00:00:50.789> by<00:00:50.910> eight

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
walked this earth she powered by eight

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.680 
walked this earth she powered by eight
USB<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.850> USB<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
USB and this is the USB it's just a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.310 
USB and this is the USB it's just a
standard<00:00:55.050> USB<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:56.180> USB<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.020> will<00:00:58.170> fit

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
standard USB to USB so this will fit

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.619 
standard USB to USB so this will fit
most<00:00:58.469> computers<00:00:59.300> definitely<00:01:00.300> fit<00:01:00.449> my

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
most computers definitely fit my

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.119 
most computers definitely fit my
computer<00:01:01.079> I'm<00:01:01.199> pretty<00:01:01.559> much<00:01:01.680> every<00:01:01.980> single

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
computer I'm pretty much every single

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.200 
computer I'm pretty much every single
computer<00:01:02.579> fit<00:01:03.059> now<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.780> other<00:01:04.019> end<00:01:04.880> both<00:01:05.880> ends

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
computer fit now the other end both ends

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.600 
computer fit now the other end both ends
going<00:01:06.420> into<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> back

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
going into here do that in the back

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
going into here do that in the back
you've<00:01:08.909> got<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.420> cable<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.170> goes<00:01:10.229> from<00:01:10.500> one

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you've got a cable that goes from one

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.090 
you've got a cable that goes from one
speaker<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> other<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> tells<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:13.100> how

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
speaker to the other so it tells it how

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.580 
speaker to the other so it tells it how
to<00:01:14.159> talk<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.119> each<00:01:15.360> other<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> other<00:01:16.320> end

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
to talk to each other and the other end

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.679 
to talk to each other and the other end
is<00:01:16.830> obviously<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> usb<00:01:17.909> which<00:01:18.150> powers

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
is obviously to the usb which powers

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.109 
is obviously to the usb which powers
them<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:19.590> either<00:01:19.740> are<00:01:19.979> USB<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.030> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
them because either are USB so it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.090 
them because either are USB so it
doesn't<00:01:21.360> require<00:01:21.600> any<00:01:21.840> batteries<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:22.439> doesn't

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
doesn't require any batteries or doesn't

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.999 
doesn't require any batteries or doesn't
require<00:01:23.340> anything<00:01:24.330> else<00:01:24.570> no<00:01:25.200> also<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> Box

require anything else no also in the Box

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.940 
require anything else no also in the Box

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
plug them in and still just works really

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
plug them in and still just works really
that's<00:01:40.290> basically<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.770> did<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.700> these<00:01:41.820> kind

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.460 
150 USB digital speakers I do recommend
these<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.450> can't<00:01:48.689> put<00:01:48.840> them<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.140> about

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
these you can't put them up for about

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.160 
these you can't put them up for about
ten<00:01:49.799> pounds<00:01:50.070> which<00:01:50.640> premise<00:01:51.030> isn't<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.720> lot<00:01:51.930> for

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
ten pounds which premise isn't a lot for

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.109 
ten pounds which premise isn't a lot for
a<00:01:52.229> pair<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.560> speakers<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.130> my<00:01:53.640> review<00:01:54.090> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
a pair of speakers but my review of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.300 
a pair of speakers but my review of
these<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.570> I've<00:01:54.840> had<00:01:55.049> these<00:01:55.229> about<00:01:55.860> two<00:01:56.100> weeks

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
these is I've had these about two weeks

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.249 
these is I've had these about two weeks
and<00:01:56.579> they've<00:01:56.670> been<00:01:56.820> amazing<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.450> far<00:01:57.479> they're

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
and they've been amazing so far they're

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.990 
and they've been amazing so far they're
not<00:01:58.290> best<00:01:58.710> sound<00:01:58.979> quality<00:01:59.070> but<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.790> can't

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
not best sound quality but you can't

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.730 
not best sound quality but you can't
expect<00:02:00.360> much<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:00.750> ten<00:02:00.899> pounds<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.320> basically

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
expect much for ten pounds so basically

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.620 
expect much for ten pounds so basically
I<00:02:02.040> recommend<00:02:02.790> these<00:02:02.939> speakers<00:02:03.329> if<00:02:03.509> you're

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
I recommend these speakers if you're

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.569 
I recommend these speakers if you're
going<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> cheaper<00:02:04.320> option<00:02:04.409> obviously<00:02:04.979> if

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
going for a cheaper option obviously if

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.920 
going for a cheaper option obviously if
you<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:06.000> bit<00:02:06.180> more<00:02:06.360> money<00:02:06.509> then<00:02:06.810> go

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
you have a little bit more money then go

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.839 
you have a little bit more money then go
for<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> higher<00:02:07.380> option<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> hope<00:02:08.369> this

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
for a higher option so I hope this

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.609 
for a higher option so I hope this
