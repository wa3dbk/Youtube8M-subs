start but let me set the camera down
try

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.890 

start<00:01:43.500> two<00:01:43.890> times<00:01:44.280> say<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.270> first<00:01:45.540> pull

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
start two times say like the first pull

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.380 
start two times say like the first pull
it<00:01:46.050> doesn't<00:01:46.440> start<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.790> don't<00:01:47.850> open<00:01:48.360> that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it doesn't start if you don't open that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.460 
it doesn't start if you don't open that
valve<00:01:48.750> back<00:01:49.050> though

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
valve back though

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.560 
valve back though
and<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.710> pull<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.100> second<00:01:50.550> time<00:01:50.580> it'll

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and you pull it the second time it'll

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.630 
and you pull it the second time it'll
practically<00:01:52.080> rip<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.530> hands<00:01:52.920> off<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.550> you

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
practically rip your hands off so you

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:12.000 
practically rip your hands off so you
always<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:54.000> those<00:01:54.180> than<00:01:54.390> that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.519 

and<00:02:12.340> you
