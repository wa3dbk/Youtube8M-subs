00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello i am david he supply me chain 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.970
 wiser mango as the netherlands I am 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.130
 responsible for purchasing and 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.860
 waste processing of all our products 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.540
 joke asked if how green is the mac 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.430
 at joke my dose might be 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.050
 greener than you think so we have 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.480
 for example in most of ours 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.949
 restaurants anhydrous urinals all ours 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.730
 new restaurants are equipped with 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.250
 LED-lighting 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.359
 so go for as much as possible 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.260
 energy-efficient equipment and we go 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.080
 one step further 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.920
 our logistics panther avi and their party 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.570
 icova 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.640
 ensures that our waste is collected 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.600
 and is processed in a sustainable 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.579
 way 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.410
 we show you what goes on for example 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.870
 This milkshake cup happens when we get it 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.730
 we throw tess now shows us 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.440
 waste processing company then come 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.020
 to pick up 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.879
 copla think my name is corry odor and 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.620
 I am the director of new business 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.840
 development at covra 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 that milkshake cup goes along with 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.070
 other wastes that factory 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.020
 and maintained process and ultimately 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.809
 becomes the product that comes out 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.330
 converted into clean energy and colleague 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.080
 bouter like this point tell everything 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.330
 about how that family works 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.340
 thank you choir to just waste green 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.050
 to make energy we need some 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.150
 go through steps 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.850
 end that sorting and then do that 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:24.040
 we here in us to men it becomes 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.500
 grind material into usable money 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.990
 for further processing in our section 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.510
 then it becomes our requirements after that 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.610
 it selected his drum in rotten 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.470
 material seated in the driers I see you 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.240
 the product is dried product 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.610
 still too damp to be able to do that 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.540
 imagination this is also rolling there 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.540
 material of smoke 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.080
 After drying, the product is put in a pallet 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.710
 European where the material by a 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.150
 mat hoist 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.100
 must be pressed out under large 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.660
 force and therefore the material 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.650
 pressed together and yet she has one 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.720
 high ones are banned 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.880
 h then from this long process of 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.780
 lot of waste compact clean the form 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.550
 of energy 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.330
 countless house can be after four 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.119
 this heats well okay I hope so 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.370
 this answers your question 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.720
 we do a lot more green things like 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.709
 someone else has a question 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.709
 reassure us
