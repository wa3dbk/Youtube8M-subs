00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
applications easier I really hate that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.880 
applications easier I really hate that
it<00:01:54.299> keeps<00:01:54.450> turning<00:01:54.780> off<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:54.930> me<00:01:55.110> come<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.470> all

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.380 
it keeps turning off on me come on all
right<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.219> what<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> would<00:01:56.909> normally<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.299> to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
right so what you would normally have to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.230 
right so what you would normally have to
do<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.810> say<00:01:58.200> okay<00:01:58.229> google<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.240> afterwards

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
do is say okay google and afterwards

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.240 
do is say okay google and afterwards
outlaw<00:02:00.719> there<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.110> go<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.920> would<00:02:02.009> have<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
outlaw there you go it you would have to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.950 
outlaw there you go it you would have to
scroll<00:02:02.430> all<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.670> way<00:02:02.759> down<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.450> start

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
scroll all the way down here and start

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.420 
scroll all the way down here and start
an<00:02:04.049> application<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.770> no<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.009> likes<00:02:05.189> doing

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
an application but no one likes doing

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.249 
an application but no one likes doing
that<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.880> instead<00:02:06.210> simply<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:07.020> this

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
that so instead simply have this

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.479 
that so instead simply have this
launcher<00:02:07.649> right<00:02:07.770> here<00:02:08.039> i<00:02:08.069> believe<00:02:08.340> it's

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
launcher right here i believe it's

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.190 
launcher right here i believe it's
called<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.940> where<00:02:09.450> launch<00:02:09.720> or<00:02:09.899> something

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
called like where launch or something

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.229 
called like where launch or something
along<00:02:10.289> those<00:02:10.560> lines<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.129> get<00:02:11.970> all<00:02:12.209> your

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
along those lines and you get all your

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.980 
along those lines and you get all your
applications

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
applications

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.990 
applications
I<00:02:13.050> have<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.500> lot<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.920> applications<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.790> here<00:02:14.970> I

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
I have a lot of applications on here I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.750 
I have a lot of applications on here I
will<00:02:15.120> admit<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:17.100> guys<00:02:17.250> may<00:02:17.520> have

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
will admit that but you guys may have

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.360 
will admit that but you guys may have
five<00:02:18.000> or<00:02:18.030> six<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:18.660> still<00:02:18.990> accessing<00:02:19.860> these<00:02:20.100> is

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
five or six but still accessing these is

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.100 
five or six but still accessing these is
a<00:02:20.400> lot<00:02:20.610> easier<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:21.660> actually<00:02:21.810> go<00:02:22.050> ahead

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
a lot easier you can actually go ahead

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.020 
a lot easier you can actually go ahead
and<00:02:22.230> swipe<00:02:22.500> back<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.310> out<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.580> your<00:02:23.760> app

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
and swipe back and get out of your app

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.130 
and swipe back and get out of your app
tray<00:02:24.330> that's<00:02:24.570> what<00:02:24.690> we're<00:02:24.780> going<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.960> call<00:02:25.080> it

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
tray that's what we're going to call it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.710 
tray that's what we're going to call it
instead<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:25.800> launcher<00:02:26.210> swiping<00:02:27.210> down<00:02:27.240> this

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
instead of a launcher swiping down this

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.360 
instead of a launcher swiping down this
is<00:02:27.870> something<00:02:28.170> that's<00:02:28.260> default<00:02:28.740> with<00:02:28.890> Android

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
is something that's default with Android

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.400 
is something that's default with Android
wear<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.610> five-point<00:02:30.210> Oh<00:02:30.330> basically<00:02:31.230> this

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
wear a five-point Oh basically this

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.840 
wear a five-point Oh basically this
allows<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.980> access<00:02:32.130> your<00:02:32.460> supposed

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
allows you to access your supposed

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.880 
allows you to access your supposed
Notification<00:02:33.600> Center<00:02:33.630> why<00:02:34.170> isn't<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.830> a

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
Notification Center why isn't it a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.440 
Notification Center why isn't it a
notification<00:02:35.370> center<00:02:35.880> well<00:02:36.030> first<00:02:36.210> of<00:02:36.360> all

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
notification center well first of all

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.240 
notification center well first of all
your<00:02:36.600> notifications<00:02:36.780> are<00:02:37.470> displayed<00:02:37.890> up<00:02:38.040> here

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
your notifications are displayed up here

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.830 
your notifications are displayed up here
so<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.790> guess<00:02:38.880> we'll<00:02:39.120> simply<00:02:39.420> call<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
so I guess we'll simply call it the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.200 
so I guess we'll simply call it the
toggle<00:02:40.260> center<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.740> even<00:02:41.670> then<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:41.880> can't

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
toggle center and even then you can't

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.400 
toggle center and even then you can't
access<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.810> from<00:02:42.990> every<00:02:43.290> single

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
access this from every single

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.110 
access this from every single
application<00:02:43.830> something<00:02:44.310> they<00:02:44.400> should<00:02:44.580> fix<00:02:44.850> I

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
application something they should fix I

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.270 
application something they should fix I
really<00:02:45.480> don't<00:02:45.690> like<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.770> can<00:02:46.920> only<00:02:47.010> go

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
which is really useful there's also a

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.960 
which is really useful there's also a
theater<00:02:58.140> mode<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.130> when<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.730> raise<00:02:59.940> your

watches<00:03:18.270> let's<00:03:18.450> put<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.720> way<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.710> right

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
watches let's put it that way so right

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.620 
watches let's put it that way so right
here<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.250> course<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.610> sunlight<00:03:20.820> mode<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.330> as<00:03:21.450> I

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
here of course is sunlight mode and as I

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.910 
here of course is sunlight mode and as I
said<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.990> makes<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.410> little<00:03:22.590> bit<00:03:22.770> brighter

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
said it makes it a little bit brighter

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.620 
said it makes it a little bit brighter
but<00:03:23.430> then<00:03:23.640> it<00:03:23.880> does<00:03:24.120> turn<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.450> brightness

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
but then it does turn the brightness

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.450 
but then it does turn the brightness
down<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.290> does<00:03:25.380> not<00:03:25.410> destroy<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.160> battery

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
down so it does not destroy the battery

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.760 
down so it does not destroy the battery
completely<00:03:27.140> here<00:03:28.140> is<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.410> course<00:03:28.560> your

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
settings I guess we should jump into

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.730
