 a bit normal another way to avoid

 a payment of at least one month one of the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.360
 most serious problems there is that a 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.090
 sometimes we think that the money that there is in 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.799
 the credit card is our

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.939
