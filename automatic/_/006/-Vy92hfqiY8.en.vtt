maybe ones that are going to stay here
throughout<00:04:24.900> Halloween<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.500> guess<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:26.130> maybe

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
throughout Halloween I guess and maybe

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.870 
throughout Halloween I guess and maybe
after<00:04:27.960> Halloween<00:04:28.380> they'll<00:04:28.620> go<00:04:28.770> away<00:04:28.889> but<00:04:29.639> as

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
after Halloween they'll go away but as

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.460 
after Halloween they'll go away but as
right<00:04:30.210> now<00:04:30.360> they<00:04:30.660> don't<00:04:30.840> earn<00:04:30.960> goo<00:04:31.289> or

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
right now they don't earn goo or

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.050 
right now they don't earn goo or
anything<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:32.010> they<00:04:32.160> just<00:04:32.340> seem<00:04:32.520> like<00:04:32.729> they're

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
anything so they just seem like they're

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.040 
anything so they just seem like they're
regular<00:04:34.070> quests<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.240> he's<00:04:36.240> going<00:04:36.539> to<00:04:36.660> wear<00:04:36.840> the

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
regular quests so he's going to wear the

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.810 
regular quests so he's going to wear the
lead<00:04:37.320> donut<00:04:37.710> around<00:04:37.919> his<00:04:38.160> head<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:38.610> guess

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
lead donut around his head and I guess

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.730
