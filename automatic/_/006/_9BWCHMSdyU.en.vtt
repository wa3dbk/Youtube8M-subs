 gold so there are four berths 4 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.670

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.660
 mega bloks like adventure the guys force 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.020
 that I 'm caught there is disney 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.619

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.529
 it's a téké knight and it's a kind 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.300
 of the gauchos the idea taste to ride 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.480
 So this is the first time 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.489

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:44.930
 she will still vote the ok 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.930
 problem then 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.510
 the peculiarity of this kind of things 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.879
 is that they transform into a man and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.050
 after he can camouflage himself and 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.850
 turn into bricks 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.109

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.370
 to hide in the background is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.769
 original 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.080

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.820
 robot fusion friends does it with

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.590
 little bit like liligo bxl then is this 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.939

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.759
 in bricks 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.680
 here it looks like a brick tastes yes 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.159
 it has nothing to do with it 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.159

 hall in balance this magnificent power 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.020
 rangers megaforce banon

 they are rather rather strong eventually 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.400
 it's the small winner because they are 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.880
 higher than the seaplane and the car 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.320
