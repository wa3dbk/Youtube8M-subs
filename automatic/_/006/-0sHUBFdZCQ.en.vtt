00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
what if itís is been working on for

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.560 
what if itís is been working on for
about<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.160> year<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.580> half<00:00:08.610> from<00:00:09.420> a

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
about a year and a half from a

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.150 
about a year and a half from a
technological<00:00:09.929> point<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.769> how<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:10.950> make<00:00:11.099> a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
technological point is how to make a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.450 
technological point is how to make a
drum<00:00:11.340> can<00:00:11.519> fit<00:00:11.790> better<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.590> issue<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.190> at

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
drum can fit better and the issue is at

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.609 
drum can fit better and the issue is at
the<00:00:14.639> power<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> crown<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.660> it's

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
the power this is the crown so it's

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.939 
the power this is the crown so it's
taking<00:00:19.770> out<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.550> competitive<00:00:21.270> man<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:22.560> yeah

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
taking out a competitive man and yeah

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.519 
taking out a competitive man and yeah
you<00:00:23.279> know<00:00:23.310> drum<00:00:23.910> people<00:00:24.570> look<00:00:24.689> closely<00:00:24.930> you'll

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
you know drum people look closely you'll

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.160 
you know drum people look closely you'll
see<00:00:25.560> where<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.390> move<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.689> move<00:00:27.930> it

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
see where I have to move it move it

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.660 
see where I have to move it move it
around

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
around

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.570 
around
you<00:00:30.180> can<00:00:30.300> see<00:00:30.510> an<00:00:30.600> air<00:00:30.780> pocket<00:00:31.070> if<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.250> move<00:00:32.430> it

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
you can see an air pocket if I move it

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.310 
you can see an air pocket if I move it
see<00:00:33.450> how<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.660> heads<00:00:33.810> wound<00:00:34.050> up<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.590> down<00:00:34.739> yeah

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
see how it heads wound up and down yeah

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.530 
see how it heads wound up and down yeah
well<00:00:36.980> well<00:00:37.310> that<00:00:37.430> that's<00:00:37.579> because<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.150> film

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
well well that that's because the film

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.900 
well well that that's because the film
the<00:00:39.200> plastic<00:00:39.650> head<00:00:39.829> isn't<00:00:40.070> really<00:00:40.430> bearing<00:00:40.790> it

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
the plastic head isn't really bearing it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.880 
the plastic head isn't really bearing it
to<00:00:41.630> accomplish<00:00:42.020> that<00:00:42.170> catch<00:00:42.440> each<00:00:42.590> week<00:00:42.770> it

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
to accomplish that catch each week it

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.040 
to accomplish that catch each week it
down<00:00:43.040> with<00:00:43.190> them<00:00:43.420> so<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.510> already<00:00:44.600> starts

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
down with them so you already starts

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.150 
down with them so you already starts
squeezing<00:00:45.320> me<00:00:45.530> that<00:00:46.480> what<00:00:47.480> Evans<00:00:47.720> has<00:00:47.840> done<00:00:48.160> is

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
squeezing me that what Evans has done is

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.509 
squeezing me that what Evans has done is
we<00:00:49.340> have<00:00:49.370> changed<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:51.320> collar<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.489> collar

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
we have changed the collar the collar

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.290 
we have changed the collar the collar
angle

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
angle

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.330

make<00:00:55.300> a<00:00:55.329> new<00:00:55.600> home<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.860> if<00:00:56.980> I<00:00:57.070> take<00:00:57.280> a

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
make a new home so if I take a

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.439 
make a new home so if I take a
traditional<00:00:58.239> man<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.620> little<00:01:02.890> more<00:01:03.010> steep

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
traditional man it's a little more steep

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.140 
traditional man it's a little more steep
or<00:01:04.449> with<00:01:04.750> your<00:01:04.960> van<00:01:05.260> Gogh

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
or with your van Gogh

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.720 
or with your van Gogh
by<00:01:06.720> opening<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.230> a<00:01:07.320> collar<00:01:07.610> essentially<00:01:08.610> we

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
by opening of a collar essentially we

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.870 
by opening of a collar essentially we
have<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.120> wider<00:01:09.710> horizontal<00:01:10.710> putting<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.760> on

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
have a wider horizontal putting it on

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.770 
have a wider horizontal putting it on
the<00:01:12.000> drum<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.470> those<00:01:13.650> oh<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:16.010> it's<00:01:17.010> dead<00:01:17.400> on

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
the drum so those oh it is it's dead on

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.200 
the drum so those oh it is it's dead on
touching<00:01:18.780> yet<00:01:18.990> everywhere<00:01:19.370> sit<00:01:20.370> touching<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
touching yet everywhere sit touching the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.430 
touching yet everywhere sit touching the
bearing<00:01:21.570> get<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.840> everywhere<00:01:22.050> now<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.310> you

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
bearing get you everywhere now and you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.660 
bearing get you everywhere now and you
sounds<00:01:25.440> like<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> drama<00:01:25.830> well<00:01:26.190> tension<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:27.410> Wow

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
sounds like a drama well tension on Wow

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.100 
sounds like a drama well tension on Wow
and<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.760> improves<00:01:30.090> tuning<00:01:30.480> as<00:01:30.600> well<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and that improves tuning as well it

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.870 
and that improves tuning as well it
makes<00:01:31.350> too<00:01:31.560> much<00:01:31.830> easier<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.430> someone<00:01:32.640> that's

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
makes too much easier for someone that's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.860 
makes too much easier for someone that's
really<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.630> auto<00:01:33.780> tuning<00:01:34.110> type<00:01:34.380> person

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
really the auto tuning type person

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.030 
really the auto tuning type person
they'll<00:01:36.870> still<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.230> a<00:01:37.290> very<00:01:37.680> acceptable

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
they'll still get a very acceptable

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.740 
they'll still get a very acceptable
sound<00:01:38.340> from<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.640> get-go<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.479> that's<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
sound from the get-go and that's the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.530

just go on the drum regardless of brand

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.219 
just go on the drum regardless of brand
in<00:01:48.960> vintage<00:01:49.520> much<00:01:50.520> easier<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.330> they<00:01:51.869> tune<00:01:52.080> up

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
in vintage much easier and they tune up

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.930 
in vintage much easier and they tune up
and<00:01:52.440> much<00:01:52.590> faster<00:01:52.800> because<00:01:53.310> these<00:01:53.640> are<00:01:53.790> guys

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
and much faster because these are guys

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.460 
and much faster because these are guys
that<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.330> just<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> couple<00:01:55.080> minutes<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.350> get

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
that have just the couple minutes to get
