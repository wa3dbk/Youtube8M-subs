 they are all editors beat unhappy 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:20.760
 to the captains theater in hollywood 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.010
 boulevard in los angeles and is a term 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.170
 disney movie was my ice 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.570
 that is not this Christmas in Italy and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.650
 which succeeded now period 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.210
 and what to say in the meantime the first fedor dire 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.470
 I am that there is a short film before the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.590
 film made in an extraordinary way 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.559
 is a short pietro directs list during 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.210
 the activity 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.360
 we reveal nothing to brush up though 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.420
 it is a beautiful tribute to the cinema 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.940
 of the beginning primis 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.320
 the disney for and in general at the cinema 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.159
 all the cinema on a technical level 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.159
 hands of the artist 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.860
 yes, the date I see it 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.750
 well 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.460
 the original mind 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.460
 if you really have a manager 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.940
 and instead I liked the film 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.280
 very much I found it extraordinary 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.690
 but I found one of the best films 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.450
 of disney animation 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.820
 I believe the last many years in the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.770
 sense that it is beautiful made well done 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.960
 very well it has visual effects and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.490
 of nations that are extraordinary 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.170
 true cesano character looks like 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.610
 slightly to that of rapunzel matic 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.470
 not even much and only with himself 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.430
 my mother's intentions 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.760
 it happened 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.800
 Exactly history is not above all 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.690
 it is not what it seems from 1 st 2 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.230
 but it surprised me a lot less than shots of 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.620
 very original scene currently i 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.710
 changes in appearance from the assessor 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.250
 traditional are enough 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.770
 surprising I'm sure he has me 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.300
 surprised very much liked some 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.980
 things have not convinced me a hundred 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.810
 cent in terms of structure in my opinion 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.490
 could have been better is true 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.690
 naturally lange second complications 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.310
 me from which reaches conceptual view 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.590
 risiko that if they are beautiful 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.300
 here we do not want to say too much about 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.890
 history just because there are different 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.810
 surprises 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.080
 let's say he had the structure is a lot 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.760
 traditional is compact, etc. is a 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.550
 musical euro the great return of the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.830
 musical disney and all very well 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.110
 the songs are a lot of pearls and so on 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.569
 however, life is all one 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.000
 series twists and situations not 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.080
 they are strong traditional we say and gods 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.960
 samples 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.010
 so you did n't see a paris a 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.700
 throttle even if you like 25 degrees 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.349
 and yet the right point is freezing, yes there is 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.560
 that funny date this cinema that 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:59.230
 ready classic max c hollywood is that 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.030
 to the first if before the first anchor 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.010
 there was one from the beginning of the film 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.540
 show organ of the sky 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.549
 to the accordion which are placed on the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.190
 cost of the economy facts and the 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.720
 beautiful and then there was one 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.000
 spectacle of these two ladies who 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.620
 they sculpted while traveling 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.070
 on mine you like me in front of departments 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.070
 of snow 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.300
 yes of course the show 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.880
 entertainment for the whole family 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.430
 but it makes a great impression to see 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.110
 this kind of movie 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.730
 this kind of king is made right 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.660
 because so many leaders and then evaluated 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.060
 to these clothes cinemas 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.900
 in short, everything will adopt the interior is 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.629
 been all messed up 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.459
 on the subject, in short, to dispense the 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:46.370
 bibliography 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.370
 less positive we salute you also no
