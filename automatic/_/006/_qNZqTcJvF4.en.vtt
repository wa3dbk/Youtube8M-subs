losing<00:01:45.390> not<00:01:45.540> only<00:01:45.570> water<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.290> losing

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
losing not only water but you losing

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.710 
losing not only water but you losing
sodium<00:01:47.100> also<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.210> when<00:01:48.479> talking<00:01:48.659> about

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
sodium also and so when talking about

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.630 
sodium also and so when talking about
cramping<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> theory<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.460> really

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
cramping the theory is that it's really

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.870 
cramping the theory is that it's really
a<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.299> dinner<00:01:51.540> loss<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:53.009> what<00:01:53.220> happens<00:01:53.670> is

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
a so dinner loss and so what happens is

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.149 
a so dinner loss and so what happens is
these<00:01:54.060> guys<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:55.079> only<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.560> hydrating

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
these guys not only are they hydrating

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.289 
these guys not only are they hydrating
with<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.460> water<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:56.969> they're<00:01:57.090> using

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
with just water but they're using

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.120 
with just water but they're using
electrolyte<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.140> they're<00:01:58.320> using<00:01:58.619> other<00:01:58.829> kind

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
electrolyte or they're using other kind

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.069 
electrolyte or they're using other kind
of<00:01:59.360> drink<00:02:00.360> solutions<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.960> have

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
of drink solutions that have

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.319 
of drink solutions that have
carbohydrates<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.040> electrolytes<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.090> them

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
carbohydrates and electrolytes in them

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.510 
carbohydrates and electrolytes in them
help<00:02:03.719> replenish<00:02:04.049> that

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
help replenish that

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.730 
help replenish that

something<00:03:24.829> like<00:03:25.069> soccer<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.850> we<00:03:26.150> just<00:03:26.269> had

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
something like soccer and we just had

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:27.550 
something like soccer and we just had
the<00:03:26.450> world<00:03:26.630> cup<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.049> everybody's<00:03:27.380> watching

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
the world cup and everybody's watching

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.069 
the world cup and everybody's watching
that<00:03:28.090> we<00:03:29.090> don't<00:03:29.239> have<00:03:29.359> a<00:03:29.389> lot<00:03:29.480> of<00:03:29.600> breaks<00:03:29.900> you

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
that we don't have a lot of breaks you

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.720 
that we don't have a lot of breaks you
know<00:03:30.170> have<00:03:30.350> a<00:03:30.380> lot<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.650> chances<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.280> go<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:31.579> the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
know have a lot of chances to go to the

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.170 
know have a lot of chances to go to the
sideline<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:33.139> know<00:03:33.260> take<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.560> drink<00:03:33.769> of

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
sideline and you know take a drink of

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.580 
sideline and you know take a drink of
gatorade<00:03:35.180> powerade<00:03:35.690> what<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:35.989> juice<00:03:36.319> whatever

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
gatorade powerade what a juice whatever

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.920 
gatorade powerade what a juice whatever
you<00:03:36.829> have<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.280> so<00:03:37.609> again<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:38.060> pre<00:03:38.389> hydration

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
you have and so again that pre hydration

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.379 
you have and so again that pre hydration
is<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:39.500> key<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:40.579> problem<00:03:41.000> is<00:03:41.150> that<00:03:41.180> people

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
is so key the problem is that people

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.539 
is so key the problem is that people
don't<00:03:41.720> think<00:03:41.989> about<00:03:42.109> it<00:03:42.380> until<00:03:42.500> it's<00:03:43.220> an<00:03:43.370> hour

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
don't think about it until it's an hour

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.300 
don't think about it until it's an hour
before<00:03:43.730> game<00:03:44.090> time<00:03:44.599> and<00:03:45.560> that's<00:03:45.769> not<00:03:45.920> enough

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
before game time and that's not enough

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.150 
before game time and that's not enough
it<00:03:46.519> really<00:03:46.760> has<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:46.940> be<00:03:47.410> 24-48<00:03:48.410> hours<00:03:48.799> getting

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
it really has to be 24-48 hours getting

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.120 
it really has to be 24-48 hours getting
your<00:03:49.370> system<00:03:50.200> hydrated<00:03:51.200> getting<00:03:51.530> your<00:03:51.680> system

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
your system hydrated getting your system

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.039 
your system hydrated getting your system
used<00:03:52.579> to<00:03:52.880> taking<00:03:53.090> in<00:03:53.329> that<00:03:53.450> amount<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.840> fluid

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
used to taking in that amount of fluid

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.500 
used to taking in that amount of fluid

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
so I'll lock up on the set right this is

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:14.990 
so I'll lock up on the set right this is
true<00:04:13.790> we<00:04:14.030> don't<00:04:14.239> want<00:04:14.449> you<00:04:14.509> to<00:04:14.630> lock

true we don't want you to lock

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.289 
true we don't want you to lock
on<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.240> city<00:04:16.190> yeah<00:04:17.190> I've<00:04:17.850> been<00:04:18.120> what<00:04:18.269> I

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
on the city yeah I've been what I

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.630 
on the city yeah I've been what I
money's<00:04:18.600> locked<00:04:18.780> up<00:04:19.049> it's<00:04:19.200> not<00:04:19.440> exactly<00:04:20.400> right

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
money's locked up it's not exactly right

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.790 
money's locked up it's not exactly right
i<00:04:20.700> think<00:04:21.299> everybody<00:04:22.109> when<00:04:22.410> it's<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:22.740> hot

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
i think everybody when it's this hot

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.770 
i think everybody when it's this hot
when<00:04:23.490> you're<00:04:23.640> out<00:04:23.790> in<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:24.030> heat<00:04:24.300> everybody

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
when you're out in the heat everybody

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.240 
when you're out in the heat everybody
needs<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.140> drink<00:04:25.410> more<00:04:25.590> fluids<00:04:25.650> the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
needs to drink more fluids the

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.220 
needs to drink more fluids the
difference<00:04:26.610> is<00:04:26.820> you're<00:04:27.390> probably<00:04:27.540> not<00:04:27.870> losing

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
difference is you're probably not losing

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.250 
difference is you're probably not losing
as<00:04:28.320> much<00:04:28.350> sodium<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.400> may<00:04:29.700> not<00:04:29.910> need<00:04:30.260> the

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
as much sodium so you may not need the

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260 
as much sodium so you may not need the
different<00:04:31.740> sports<00:04:32.280> drinks<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.880> energy

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
different sports drinks the energy

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.330 
different sports drinks the energy
during<00:04:33.420> sports<00:04:33.840> drinks<00:04:34.320> electrolytes<00:04:35.010> that

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
during sports drinks electrolytes that

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.160 
during sports drinks electrolytes that
someone<00:04:36.210> that's<00:04:36.390> out<00:04:36.540> there<00:04:36.750> on<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.990> field

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
someone that's out there on the field

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.900 
someone that's out there on the field
really<00:04:37.530> kind<00:04:37.740> of<00:04:37.770> you<00:04:38.040> know<00:04:38.280> pumping<00:04:38.700> it<00:04:38.790> out

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
really kind of you know pumping it out

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.690 
really kind of you know pumping it out
is<00:04:39.150> going<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.450> be<00:04:39.600> so<00:04:39.900> pure<00:04:40.500> water<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:41.220> okay<00:04:41.670> for

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
is going to be so pure water is okay for

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.760 
is going to be so pure water is okay for
the<00:04:42.180> majority<00:04:42.660> of<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.870> population<00:04:43.320> but<00:04:43.650> we're

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
the majority of the population but we're

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.830 
the majority of the population but we're
talking<00:04:43.920> about<00:04:44.070> exercise<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.090> really

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
talking about exercise and really

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
probably heard want to replace with some

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.340 
probably heard want to replace with some
solution<00:04:50.790> that<00:04:50.910> has<00:04:51.090> a<00:04:51.150> sodium<00:04:51.690> carbohydrate

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
solution that has a sodium carbohydrate
