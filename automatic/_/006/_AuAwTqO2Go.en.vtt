00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.270
 first week is around or actually more 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.450
 as the first week or is the first 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.620
 week but pack a lot more 7 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.389
 like his conclusion it was pretty 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.930
 successful I think with two 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.480
 We are still close 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:28.560
 driven over 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:31.590
 Write and have the green jersey 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.570
 previously not so out of community has one 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.200
 stage win and some more 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.700
 days 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.800
 I think he himself was hard 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.480
 it to put on the sprints or 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.550
 to start or prepare without 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.649
 loans because some sees the situation 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.039
 Helped with all four years 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.170
 We do not have the first stage either 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.650
 with too many warm ones 25 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.080
 That's why I say I'm very well mastered 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:13.250
 Brencher are on foot but yes does too 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:18.910
 nothing 280 one also is not a 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.910
 of course, if he has it but nice 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.130
 he has so I have the second winner ok 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.439
 on the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.950
 where other second citizens second 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:34.640
 has become was of course the children 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.500
 very helpful but keep it up 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.079
 tried twice to continue 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.560
 two days with his two councils press 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:54.420
 and and does not have better and so much 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:55.470
 pain was probably pretty much 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.810
 nice that we also in taste 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.490
 Maybe they came around now 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.869
 the goal to set that still somehow 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.869
 try to recapture 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.860
 or I think the green jersey worn 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.509
 Of course that was a nice experience 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.840
 because the last three years it was like that 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.599
 the ok peter sager flap 1 has that 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.110
 green jersey plant hears that brings 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.810
 that he was repairing in green and that's why 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.000
 it was again nice that for seven 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.920
 driving alone for days 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.400
 but I'm in the book 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.190
 now only three points back, of course 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.150
 nice another two days off the shoulder 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.150
 can have 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.370
 let's see how the stages really 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.110
 go out 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.049
 Of course I hope that Peter Sager 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.900
 not so often come to the finale and 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.120
 could collect points 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.040
 the chance is there 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.040
 with a low chance 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.690
 In any case I will try many 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.960
 to get products 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.300
 even if it is safe 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.130
 between sprint you are the question 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.170
 There is the possibility on one 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.930
 It really is a group too 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.700
 then go to zwischensprint to drive 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:19.860
 something looked out theoretical 4 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:22.320
 Of course we hope to become yes and 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.280
 Of course, if many train drivers in 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.410
 level 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.570
 it is always as much a thing as 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.190
 far, a group is omitted and 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.200
 which team he drives afterwards 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.850
 so much depends on how that can be done 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.410
 looks great and what colors 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.420
 which tip are per lot 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.460
 Of course, a lot of problem 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.260
 also write four 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.020
 i think motto is easy now 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.490
 important to save as many grains as 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.470
 possible until Paris 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.550
 hopefully to arrive healthy and that 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.500
 little exciting paris really too 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.870
 they're just gonna change two pretty much 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.880
 hard weeks and should also be pretty hot 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.430
 Now how do you handle it 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:08.100
 the heat when we are still in Bergen 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.380
 that's good for you for mine 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.650
 Klimaautomatik but if you are natural 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.870
 then every rise on the apron is everything 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.970
 Well 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.320
 Of course we can not do much because we 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.000
 We have to wait for a time limit 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.130
 Euro 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.100
 then they really have left 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.780
 must then ask the question jumps 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.800
 three weeks is no sprint wii 2 or 3 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.120
 Nevertheless, paris is the big motivation 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.890
 to be tormented by it 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.620
 also because you probably saw it 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.360
 are you in the flat you are crazy 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.830
 the tour itself would be stronger 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.530
 so sign or you would be 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:51.790
 Of course you still have to write 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:55.900
 See who else would be there too 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:05:00.690
 other teams and think marines 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:03.280
 head to head has displayed page 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.880
 melt or with one of the supports 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.410
 here's and as others said after 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.370
 the whole pyrenees and alps stages 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:17.020
 you have to stop, maybe we'll see one 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.140
 saved a little more grains 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.010
 but 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.330
 it takes a bit longer for stein 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:28.270
 and the coach before that a little bit 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.830
 through the mountains until then it still takes 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.900
 a little bit further up is in three 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.850
 days i believe andreas wurster can 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.890
 are already considered something like you him 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.240
 On the day you can surprise on the 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.760
 room and video behind the works 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.150
 he always looks for himself 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.720
 birthday so that's exactly why one 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.800
 the hardest stages I was one of the 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.680
 The hardest stages are the last ones 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.910
 Years do not have that much now 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:01.110
 fun on his birthday and is it 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.370
 not so easy the big gift 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.150
 present 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:17.010
 guess do that or after the tour 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:17.010
 on the day for healthy Monday to the topic 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.770
 cook room 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.340
 and me everytime I go in here 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.780
 every one of the biggest wish fall and that 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.010
 will be implemented then I can 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.050
 That's what happened to us because we did 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:37.229
 hopefully every time tells 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:45.449
 plateau de beille over night again above 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:46.680
 on the mountain or then uses beautiful beautiful 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.970
 three days in thuringia 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.970
 we'll hopefully intervene
