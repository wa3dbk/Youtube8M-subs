our current humidity seventy-four
percent<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.759> still<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.180> bit

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
percent we still have a little bit

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.990 
percent we still have a little bit
moisture<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> air<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.610> we<00:01:23.610> expect<00:01:23.909> that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
moisture in the air here we expect that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.539 
moisture in the air here we expect that
to<00:01:24.180> go<00:01:24.299> down<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.710> clouds<00:01:25.920> clear<00:01:26.520> out

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
to go down here as the clouds clear out

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.760 
to go down here as the clouds clear out
and<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.780> backside<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> cold<00:01:28.710> front

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and the backside of the cold front

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.319 
and the backside of the cold front
clears<00:01:29.159> out<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.549> here<00:01:29.700> from<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> clouds

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
clears out of here from all the clouds

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.380 
clears out of here from all the clouds
and<00:01:30.659> what<00:01:31.500> weather<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:31.979> had<00:01:32.159> yesterday

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
and what weather that we had yesterday

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.510 
and what weather that we had yesterday
so<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:34.140> could<00:01:34.380> expect<00:01:34.740> these<00:01:34.920> classic<00:01:35.310> later

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
so we could expect these classic later

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
so we could expect these classic later
out<00:01:35.610> soon<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.270> moisture<00:01:36.869> levels<00:01:37.140> will<00:01:37.259> go

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
out soon and moisture levels will go

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.980 
out soon and moisture levels will go
down<00:01:37.560> there<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.100> will<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:39.630> humidity

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
down there for will be the humidity

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.170 
down there for will be the humidity
levels<00:01:40.290> will<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.710> lower<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.970> will<00:01:42.119> have

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
levels will be lower so we will have

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
levels will be lower so we will have
lower<00:01:42.840> humidity<00:01:43.110> values<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.040> our

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
lower humidity values and our

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.639 
lower humidity values and our
temperatures<00:01:44.820> will<00:01:45.270> stay<00:01:45.540> at<00:01:45.630> around<00:01:45.780> 34<00:01:46.380> for

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
temperatures will stay at around 34 for

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.830 
temperatures will stay at around 34 for
a<00:01:46.680> little<00:01:46.829> bit<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.670> layer<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.689> day

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
a little bit to layer as the day

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.440 
a little bit to layer as the day
progresses<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.040> 30<00:01:50.250> point<00:01:50.520> 29<00:01:50.939> pressure

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
progresses we have 30 point 29 pressure

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.420 
progresses we have 30 point 29 pressure
right<00:01:51.750> now<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.110> continues<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.740> rise<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.159> see
