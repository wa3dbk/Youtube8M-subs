00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.230
 all and welcome to this tutorial we 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.529
 let's see how to remove her from 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.519
 characters from a photo we will use 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.580
 the free software ghi so all the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.750
 world can use it 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:33.660
 at first I take the first picture 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.390
 here with the characters that we are going 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.250
 must remove 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.920
 but of course we will not leave 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.559
 a hole in the photo by removing it 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.039
 will have to fill that stuff so what 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.710
 we will do is take several 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.860
 pictures where the characters were 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:01:02.520
 moved here I opened the first 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:04.280
 photo I'm going to open a second but in 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.580
 as long as 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:20.090
 here is a second worker here is that in 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:23.780
 as long as 15 then the third picture 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.549
 also as a cal open that's it 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:32.150
 now let's go on the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.450
 first picture we will create him a 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:42.060
 wedge mask so added a mask 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.229
 here in white then add in this 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.229
 case we are going to come 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.329
 so I'm going to delete the others as 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.909
 that you see the first photo 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.810
 had seen it look at the difference here 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.860
 all the characters 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.890
 this is what we will have to delete 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.350
 ok so we go back to the first picture 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.180
 that what I just deleted here the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.689
 character the camera the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.069
 character the character so I have 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.069
 chose an eraser tool 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:23.640

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.300

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:39.750
 well turn off any character on 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:46.080
 first to fade 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:51.680
