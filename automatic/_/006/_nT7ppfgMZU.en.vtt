00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.029
 Hate- Yamaha model xt 1200 z super 0 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.029
 I tried to teach the influence on this 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.539
 t 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.310
 8 This is a very cool machine at first glance 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:28.130
 That design or styling must be high yamaha 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:30.290
 That delicate feeling of sporty design this eco flowing body line and so on 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.080
 I Well I it is characterized by 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.050
 so 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.270
 I was there six consecutive model in the old days I that in Paris I say that xtz 850 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.990
 But that 's it 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:48.510
 Such as ish rather load the rally or with CIMA or a little more say 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:54.420
 The modern version of this was a model, but I expanded the distribution resurrected to the modern day 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:58.390
 It became a strategy guide and became super Tetsu, but it becomes more labor-like character 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.440
 I feel that was revived in modern Te 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:06.550
 It feels like you've got this styling as well 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.010
 Yeah seems rather when that sport model rather than a big off-loader 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.520
 Such a high handling of tic 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:16.270
 Sense of alert 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.270
 Including the smoothness of the engine I had such a first impression 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.880
 It's an engine, but this is what goes in parallel, so-called parallel twin, so 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.830
 We adopt such a clan angle of 270 degrees crank 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.400
 The feature of the 270 degree crank is that 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:43.980
 v It looks like a twin light pulse tube with a feeling of heartbeat 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:47.690
 Well Director-General Yari's go to be the same wear and say health 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.470
 It has become a place where Basque people say that it is not unbearable in need 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.950
 Actual theme stone 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.280
 It's very high rotation smooth but it's firmly 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.520
 I wonder if I will take it with you 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.679
 Catch it went well so 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:07.090
 It's a taste, that's why it's such a big off 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:12.240
 Pittashi Kou in so kind of category I adventure model referred to in the recent 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:16.800
 You say that you are Hey Why are you fit and to, for example, these have little to dirt 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.830
 I'm sorry to say there's a place I'll write black eyes like this 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.450
 Kaka and its heart feeling is 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.430
 Of course, the feeling of heartbeat is connected to the sense of traction on the fly. 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.170
 Ne 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.010
 For example, Toka engine for direct'll keep was a hand 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.650
 Well, that's the kind of spinning attitude that is flowing like this 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.660
 By the way, I write it with Myoko 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.430
 I think it was just was 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.870
 Come and running while grasping the how 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.870
 It was thought that if not the splendor of 3 to about 760,000 parallel two-cylinder 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.580
 t 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.690
 I handling of I, but was a this is called first to be 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.530
 I'm dressed like this a little big off 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:07.180
 I felt that the handling was extremely close to a sport model 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.490
 If it is normal winding road would Hashire to sporty 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:15.130
 It is doing so as a sense of 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:18.550
 big hey I 'm going to run with that rhythm and average speed that seems to be close 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.710
 I think that is an example of this super 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:26.820
 I know I'd tried to think and its why 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:33.450
 It seems to be big but it is very high when actually riding 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:38.190
 It's light, it's light and it's light and it looks like the center of gravity is also high, and it's surprisingly negative. 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:42.750
 I Is that what because you but I was the center of gravity 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:47.400
 When you are wintering banking and I'm not very strong cornering 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:51.630
 When it is that tall machine with pretty eyes is high and it is therefore of Tteyuu a little scary 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.500
 But there I this is the feeling is close Merit year grant 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.410
 Such a place even think whether not it good led to bend ease in that Noriya of 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.690
 I will 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.690
 me 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.690
 t 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:12.850
 It's a brake, but that's the fact that it's a front and rear interlocking brake and it's abs 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:16.510
 It is a type that when you put the front desk this also hears Deer 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.989
 Nde independent media that the only operation media is activated 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.240
 For example, when running this winding, the front desk 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:27.410
 Only never it only finger can equal adjustment of the beam 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.090
 Is to just very nice to say so to be able to settle in the meeting say 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.949
 But if you want to make a Nico u turn 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.750
 It works independently and it is easy for users to do because it does not interfere with the front desk 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:41.520
 It is considered well 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:47.040
 I think it's a brake and abs is also a very natural touch 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.150
 Is fine I do not go immediately you can comparatively high deeply deep part when entering crowded grip 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.110
 Naa sporty from 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.420
 In Well that riding 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:05:00.940
 Among them ran, such as those naturalized to strongly hard fulfill the brake in the corner entry 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:05.080
 It is not easy working just bankrupt and that's a time and a rare follow likely Nitori 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:11.180
 Etc works a base engineeringally effectively 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:15.110
 It's seems to be pretty dense to control even in off-road 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.060
 It will stop dyeing properly . Got over Goto just after activating abs. 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.340
 Tightly and never Chau 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.340
 I think one abs say so support the off-road 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.930
 goo 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:39.210
 Well , though this is super useful. 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:43.380
 Certainly because it is this state , I think that there is nothing left to have in that Japanese city area 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:48.570
 It's actually just a ride, but rather than the image of the first ministerial award 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:51.009
 After also It is not the Takasugi in such a sheet it is the result of the Well low center of gravity 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:55.930
 I do not feel the existence of something 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:59.150
 Strangely, so there are so many cornering angles 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.030
 Rin who was good at management and troubles unexpectedly 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:05.120
 And output characteristics to because it is calm 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:08.450
 It does not mean that you will not jump out verbally 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.300
 It's kind of a friendly machine during this time 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.700
 and say Ne Te Super If a former 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:19.280
 Active in that Paris Daka 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:20.990
 It still kind of high because it is well such a childish bike was said to desert the king of 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.510
 Image is very high 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:29.950
 I'm pretty happy or such a glorious name 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:33.900
 It is kind of in that called out even in the modern has inherited 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:40.080
 When I rush along the road without that way 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:42.620
 It is a sporty and practical bike that can get that dream and still be 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.620
 thought
