00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to their original colors what I mean by

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.910 
to their original colors what I mean by
that<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.190> 2011<00:01:02.760> release<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.379> midsole<00:01:04.799> you

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
that the 2011 release on the midsole you

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.800 
that the 2011 release on the midsole you
had<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> little<00:01:05.400> bit<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.270> had<00:01:06.420> more<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
had a little bit of you had more of a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.130 
had a little bit of you had more of a
light<00:01:07.140> gray<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.860> midsole<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.990> then

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
light gray on the midsole there so then

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080 
light gray on the midsole there so then
went<00:01:10.290> back<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> darker<00:01:11.670> gray<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
went back to the darker gray on the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.480 
went back to the darker gray on the
midsole<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.200> closest<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
midsole so this is the closest to the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820 
midsole so this is the closest to the
original<00:01:14.580> release<00:01:15.570> back<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> 90s<00:01:16.680> when<00:01:16.799> a
