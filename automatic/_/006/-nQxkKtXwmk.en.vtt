00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.220
 Is this called marriage? 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.860
 Can't you refuse? 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.620
 The good day in my life 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.199
 Can you come again? 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.520
 On the road of exhausted life 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.680
 You are the best gift given to me by God. 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.660
 In order not to let this love rust 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:33.820
 I will wipe the light often 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.020
 Make an appointment, when everything becomes a thing of the past 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.140
 The day we met again 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.140
 I will leave everything behind, long beside you. 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.920
 Walk with you to the rest of your life 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.260
 You and me see each other as a dream 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.140
 Have you opened your heart and stayed deep? 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.600
 I will never regret even if I canâ€™t blossom. 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.720
 Because nothing will be eternal and immortal 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.580
 Is this called marriage? 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.000
 Can't you refuse? 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.620
 In order not to let this love rust 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.320
 I will wipe the light often 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.220
 On the road of exhausted life 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.280
 You are the best gift given to me by God. 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.440
 In order not to let this love rust 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:33.580
 I will wipe the light often 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:51.320
 Is this called fate? 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:03.840
 Can't you refuse? 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:21.140
 The good day in my life 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:35.180
 Can you come again? 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.760
 (I want to say it is still endless) 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:48.200
 The words you want to say are still endless (but you have already fully understood) 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.820
 If you come back, you can meet again. 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.440
 Please don't let go of my hand again. 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.120
 This life is not perfect love 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.880
 This life failed to complete the marriage 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.940
 If you come back, you can meet again. 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.860
 Please don't let go of my hand again. 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:38.060
 Please don't let go again 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.760
 my hand
