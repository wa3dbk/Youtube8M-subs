laser the med light laser removes
tattoos<00:00:20.279> by<00:00:20.580> shattering<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.420> tattoo<00:00:21.630> pigment

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
tattoos by shattering the tattoo pigment

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.859 
tattoos by shattering the tattoo pigment
and<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:23.220> very<00:00:23.460> specific<00:00:23.939> for<00:00:24.240> tattoo<00:00:24.539> ink

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.380 
and it's very specific for tattoo ink
and<00:00:25.080> therefore<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.010> affects<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.519> skin<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:27.359> a

and therefore it affects the skin to a
minimal<00:00:27.689> extent<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.310> this<00:00:29.310> allows<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.029> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
minimal extent and this allows you to

minimal extent and this allows you to
remove<00:00:30.480> your<00:00:30.539> tattoos<00:00:31.050> with<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.920> minimum

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
amount of trauma to the skin and a very

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.459 
amount of trauma to the skin and a very
low<00:00:34.800> risk<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.250> scouring<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:36.750> process

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
low risk of scouring the process

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.560 
low risk of scouring the process
actually<00:00:37.770> takes<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.489> number<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.000> sessions<00:00:39.180> so

particular problem take my eyes from the
laser<00:02:11.370> now<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.640> can<00:02:12.819> fix<00:02:13.090> down<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.599> on<00:02:13.660> the

specifically attracted to the black in
different<00:02:27.260> colors<00:02:27.470> will<00:02:27.680> require<00:02:27.950> different

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
different colors will require different

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.840 
different colors will require different
wavelengths<00:02:29.030> as<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.390> recurring

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
wavelengths as a recurring

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.910 
wavelengths as a recurring
we<00:02:31.330> have<00:02:31.480> two<00:02:31.660> lasers<00:02:32.050> with<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.290> total<00:02:32.470> three

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
we have two lasers with the total three

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.620 
we have two lasers with the total three
wavelengths<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.880> cover<00:02:34.090> all<00:02:34.390> different

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
wavelengths to cover all different

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.530 
wavelengths to cover all different
colors<00:02:35.190> now<00:02:36.190> us<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.670> what<00:02:36.850> will<00:02:36.970> happen<00:02:37.270> is

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
colors now us that what will happen is

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.970 
colors now us that what will happen is
it<00:02:37.750> actually<00:02:37.990> turn<00:02:38.200> white<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.590> Rebecca

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
it actually turn white and Rebecca

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.330 
it actually turn white and Rebecca
shouldn't<00:02:39.400> feel<00:02:39.610> any<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:41.040> are<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.130> ready

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
shouldn't feel any of this are you ready

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.360 
shouldn't feel any of this are you ready
yeah

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.309 

so<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.970> tattoo<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.480> actually<00:02:51.750> frosted<00:02:52.200> over

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
over the next week or two it'll scam

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.539 
over the next week or two it'll scam
Rebecca<00:03:03.510> will<00:03:03.840> need<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.080> put<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.409> the<00:03:05.129> panthan

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
Rebecca will need to put on the panthan

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.240 
Rebecca will need to put on the panthan
cream<00:03:05.819> two<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.480> three<00:03:06.629> times<00:03:06.659> a<00:03:07.019> day<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.440> help

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
cream two to three times a day to help

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.190 
cream two to three times a day to help
reduce<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.610> scabbing<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.269> after<00:03:10.019> about<00:03:10.140> a

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
reduce the scabbing and after about a

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.080 
reduce the scabbing and after about a
month<00:03:10.379> we<00:03:10.590> should<00:03:10.620> notice<00:03:11.010> some<00:03:11.220> recovery<00:03:11.640> are

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
month we should notice some recovery are

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.869 
month we should notice some recovery are
some<00:03:12.329> red<00:03:12.480> lightning<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.140> tattoo<00:03:14.069> so

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
repeat this process every six to eight

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.949 
repeat this process every six to eight
weeks<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.980> usually<00:03:17.879> after<00:03:18.299> 10<00:03:18.629> to<00:03:18.720> 20

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
weeks and usually after 10 to 20

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.229 
weeks and usually after 10 to 20
sessions<00:03:19.140> we<00:03:19.590> should<00:03:19.769> get<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.159> nice<00:03:20.700> reduction

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
sessions we should get a nice reduction

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.289 
sessions we should get a nice reduction
in<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.480> color<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.640> I'm<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:23.879> going<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.120> put

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
in the color so I'm just going to put

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.940 
in the color so I'm just going to put
some<00:03:24.329> dressings<00:03:24.810> on<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:27.420> tattoo<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.170> we

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
this just helps reduce any injury and

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.020 
this just helps reduce any injury and
helps<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.010> skin<00:03:38.159> to<00:03:38.459> heal<00:03:38.840> after<00:03:39.840> that

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
helps the skin to heal after that
