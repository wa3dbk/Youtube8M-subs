00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.719 
the only time I've tasted this was at
the<00:02:07.350> liquor<00:02:07.860> store<00:02:07.950> there<00:02:08.280> was<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.429> lady<00:02:08.640> there

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the liquor store there was a lady there

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.850 
the liquor store there was a lady there
passing<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.539> samples

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
passing out samples

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.000 
passing out samples
and<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.240> did<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.570> because<00:02:13.380> that's<00:02:13.800> what<00:02:13.980> I

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
and so I did that because that's what I

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.830 
and so I did that because that's what I
do<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.930> was<00:02:16.050> pretty<00:02:16.230> tasty<00:02:17.510> if<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.690> could

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
do and it was pretty tasty if you could

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.110 
do and it was pretty tasty if you could
think<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.230> like<00:02:19.470> Captain<00:02:19.980> Morgan<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.430> isn't

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
think of like Captain Morgan that isn't

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.740 
think of like Captain Morgan that isn't
watered<00:02:21.420> down<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.660> kind<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.100> got<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.220> Morgan

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
watered down and kind of got the Morgan

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.060 
watered down and kind of got the Morgan
can't<00:02:24.750> be<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.930> far<00:02:25.110> from<00:02:25.260> my<00:02:25.350> reach<00:02:25.620> right

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
pretty tasty yeah a better product in

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.170 
pretty tasty yeah a better product in
general<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.290> would<00:03:25.470> hope<00:03:25.860> that<00:03:26.250> black

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
general and I I would hope that black

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.750 
general and I I would hope that black
tends<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:28.050> become<00:03:28.230> there<00:03:28.860> in<00:03:29.340> probably<00:03:29.640> well

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
tends to become there in probably well

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.010 
tends to become there in probably well
be<00:03:29.880> but<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.120> think<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.480> should<00:03:30.690> really<00:03:30.870> be

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
be but I think this should really be

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.190 
be but I think this should really be
their<00:03:31.320> flagship<00:03:32.060> product<00:03:33.060> because<00:03:33.420> it's<00:03:33.630> it's

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
their flagship product because it's it's

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.640 
their flagship product because it's it's
closer<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.770> what<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:34.950> competitors<00:03:35.910> are<00:03:36.060> doing

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
closer to what the competitors are doing

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.800 
closer to what the competitors are doing
in<00:03:37.650> terms<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:38.100> wonder<00:03:38.340> what<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.640> shows<00:03:38.910> more

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
in terms I wonder what this shows more

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.930 
in terms I wonder what this shows more
of<00:03:40.020> regular<00:03:40.709> or<00:03:40.890> like<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.400> private<00:03:41.700> stuff<00:03:41.910> oh

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
of regular or like the private stuff oh

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.150 
of regular or like the private stuff oh
there's<00:03:42.180> note<00:03:42.510> enough<00:03:42.780> probably<00:03:43.770> so<00:03:43.920> they

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
there's note enough probably so they

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.949 
there's note enough probably so they
can't<00:03:44.370> sell<00:03:44.550> on<00:03:44.700> private<00:03:45.030> stock<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.360> is<00:03:45.420> more

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
yeah this maybe is - I think it's good

yeah this maybe is - I think it's good
because<00:06:22.250> you<00:06:23.000> still<00:06:23.270> get<00:06:23.389> a<00:06:23.449> lot<00:06:23.780> of<00:06:24.020> the

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
because you still get a lot of the

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.800 
because you still get a lot of the
patron<00:06:24.650> cafe<00:06:25.129> in<00:06:25.280> here<00:06:25.550> but<00:06:26.270> if<00:06:26.389> you<00:06:26.479> don't

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
patron cafe in here but if you don't

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.480 
patron cafe in here but if you don't
like<00:06:27.020> coffee<00:06:27.319> that<00:06:27.560> much<00:06:27.740> you<00:06:27.860> want<00:06:28.069> something

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
like coffee that much you want something

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.430

a<00:06:28.550> little<00:06:28.759> bit<00:06:28.849> sweeter<00:06:29.120> go<00:06:29.750> with<00:06:29.840> Kahlua<00:06:30.139> I

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
a little bit sweeter go with Kahlua I

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.379 
a little bit sweeter go with Kahlua I
think<00:06:30.860> that<00:06:31.009> would<00:06:31.159> be<00:06:31.190> and<00:06:31.849> most<00:06:32.090> people

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:32.389 
think that would be and most people

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:33.309 
think that would be and most people
probably<00:06:32.419> will<00:06:32.840> because<00:06:33.020> they<00:06:33.080> might<00:06:33.229> not

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
probably will because they might not

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.110 
probably will because they might not
have<00:06:33.500> that<00:06:33.680> so<00:06:33.949> Chloe<00:06:34.610> you're<00:06:34.729> probably<00:06:34.879> a

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
have that so Chloe you're probably a

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.879 
have that so Chloe you're probably a
little<00:06:35.240> more<00:06:35.449> sweetness<00:06:35.720> a<00:06:36.050> little<00:06:36.440> less<00:06:36.620> dark

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
little more sweetness a little less dark

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:37.330

Chloe<00:06:38.210> there's<00:06:38.419> no<00:06:38.479> really<00:06:38.720> not<00:06:38.840> that<00:06:39.050> sweet

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
Chloe there's no really not that sweet

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.850 
Chloe there's no really not that sweet
compared<00:06:41.030> to<00:06:41.060> this<00:06:41.180> though<00:06:41.419> yeah<00:06:41.960> it's<00:06:42.229> it's<00:06:42.560> a

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
compared to this though yeah it's it's a

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.710 
compared to this though yeah it's it's a
kind<00:06:42.919> of<00:06:43.129> sweet<00:06:43.400> quality<00:06:43.849> to<00:06:43.970> it<00:06:44.090> though<00:06:44.240> in

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
kind of sweet quality to it though in

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.080 
kind of sweet quality to it though in
this<00:06:45.440> I<00:06:45.590> think<00:06:45.650> I<00:06:46.099> don't<00:06:46.460> think<00:06:46.669> not<00:06:46.759> getting

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
this I think I don't think not getting

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.240 
this I think I don't think not getting
that<00:06:47.240> as<00:06:47.389> much<00:06:47.599> maybe<00:06:48.500> it's<00:06:48.710> good<00:06:49.069> I<00:06:49.099> don't

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
that as much maybe it's good I don't

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.439 
that as much maybe it's good I don't
know<00:06:49.400> what<00:06:49.610> it<00:06:49.699> is<00:06:49.789> that's<00:06:49.940> no<00:06:50.120> it<00:06:50.180> might<00:06:50.330> be

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
know what it is that's no it might be

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.689 
know what it is that's no it might be
the<00:06:50.569> fact<00:06:50.719> that<00:06:50.870> the<00:06:51.620> black<00:06:51.919> does<00:06:52.370> have<00:06:52.669> a

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:52.699 
the fact that the black does have a

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:54.339 
the fact that the black does have a
little<00:06:53.000> bit<00:06:53.150> of<00:06:53.270> bite<00:06:53.539> like<00:06:53.780> a<00:06:53.840> little<00:06:54.139> bit<00:06:54.259> of

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:54.349 
little bit of bite like a little bit of

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:57.339 
little bit of bite like a little bit of
burn<00:06:54.590> and<00:06:55.159> I<00:06:55.280> finish<00:06:55.990> you<00:06:56.990> could<00:06:57.139> of<00:06:57.229> course
