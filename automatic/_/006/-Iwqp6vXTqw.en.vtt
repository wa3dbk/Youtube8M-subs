00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
okay so we have our teflon tape we have

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.119 
okay so we have our teflon tape we have
our<00:00:42.300> clutch<00:00:42.960> bolt<00:00:43.670> that<00:00:44.670> goes<00:00:44.700> into<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> crank

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
our clutch bolt that goes into the crank

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.389 
our clutch bolt that goes into the crank
and<00:00:47.129> what<00:00:47.280> we're<00:00:47.430> gonna<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:48.950> is<00:00:49.950> start<00:00:50.340> by

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and what we're gonna do is start by

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.750 
and what we're gonna do is start by
winding<00:00:50.789> some<00:00:51.300> teflon<00:00:51.870> tape<00:00:53.270> onto<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> bolt

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
winding some teflon tape onto the bolt

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.580 
winding some teflon tape onto the bolt
and<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.820> want<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.149> wind<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.480> really<00:00:57.840> tight<00:00:58.079> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
and you want to wind it really tight and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.520 
and you want to wind it really tight and
you<00:00:58.739> want<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> wind<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.480> in<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:01.050> direction<00:01:03.530> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
you want to wind it in this direction so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.520 
you want to wind it in this direction so
that<00:01:04.559> when<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.920> start<00:01:05.159> turning<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.670> into<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
that when you start turning it into the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.219 
that when you start turning it into the
clutch<00:01:07.530> half<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.130> into<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> crank<00:01:09.229> it

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
clutch half and into the crank it

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.270 
clutch half and into the crank it
doesn't<00:01:10.619> unwind<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> tape<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.860> want<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
doesn't unwind the tape and you want to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.200 
doesn't unwind the tape and you want to
use<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> very<00:01:14.780> generous<00:01:15.780> amount<00:01:17.000> pretty<00:01:18.000> much

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
use a very generous amount pretty much

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.620 
use a very generous amount pretty much
as<00:01:18.780> much<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.619> there<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
as much as you can get on there and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.730 
as much as you can get on there and
still<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.080> slide<00:01:22.830> into<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.960> end<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
still have it slide into the end of the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.420 
still have it slide into the end of the
clutch

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.889 

like<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.579> said<00:01:32.640> make<00:01:32.969> sure<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.299> wound<00:01:33.570> really

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
like I said make sure it's wound really

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:34.630 
like I said make sure it's wound really
tight

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
tight

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.410 
tight
and<00:01:35.640> make<00:01:35.820> sure<00:01:35.969> there's<00:01:36.240> plenty<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:38.420> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and make sure there's plenty of it you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.789 
and make sure there's plenty of it you
want<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> go<00:01:39.780> back<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.140> forth<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.500> couple<00:01:40.619> times

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
want to go back and forth a couple times

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.679 
want to go back and forth a couple times
whoo<00:01:42.860> well<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.490> may<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.759> enough<00:01:45.240> right<00:01:45.450> there

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
whoo well that may be enough right there

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.350 
whoo well that may be enough right there
we'll<00:01:45.899> see<00:01:48.170> something<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.289> that<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:50.360> then

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
we'll see something like that and then

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.580 
we'll see something like that and then
what<00:01:51.509> we're<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.110> funnel<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.590> beer

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.949 

like<00:01:58.590> this<00:02:02.270> right<00:02:03.270> into<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.659> end<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
like this right into the end of the

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.800 
like this right into the end of the
crankshaft<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:08.420> take<00:02:09.420> our<00:02:09.569> clutch

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810

bolt<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:14.610> should<00:02:14.819> be<00:02:14.940> enough<00:02:16.519> start<00:02:17.519> winding

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
bolt that should be enough start winding

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.770 
bolt that should be enough start winding
it<00:02:18.030> into<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> threads<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:21.360> there<00:02:21.569> goes<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
it into the threads and there goes the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.259 
it into the threads and there goes the
teflon<00:02:22.319> tape<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:26.430> should<00:02:26.640> start<00:02:26.880> building

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
teflon tape it should start building

boom natty light Sun so there you go

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.270 
boom natty light Sun so there you go
there's<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:50.230> there's<00:02:51.230> half<00:02:51.590> of<00:02:51.710> the<00:02:51.770> clutch

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
there's the there's half of the clutch

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.720 
there's the there's half of the clutch
there's<00:02:52.700> your<00:02:52.880> crankshaft<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:55.310> that's<00:02:55.550> how

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
there's your crankshaft and that's how

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.220 
there's your crankshaft and that's how
natty<00:02:56.030> light<00:02:56.180> works<00:02:56.720> as<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.590> grass<00:02:58.010> tool
