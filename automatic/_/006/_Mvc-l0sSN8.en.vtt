00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
it's very important that you you know

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.409 
it's very important that you you know
call<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:27.810> or<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:28.890> really<00:04:29.070> need<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.430> work<00:04:30.150> as<00:04:30.390> a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
team it's very important as much as this

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.310 
team it's very important as much as this
is<00:04:34.620> about<00:04:34.950> getting<00:04:35.010> kills<00:04:35.580> for<00:04:35.820> yourself<00:04:36.320> you

correctly<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:42.229> I<00:04:43.400> don't<00:04:44.400> know<00:04:45.889> from<00:04:46.889> what<00:04:47.130> I

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
correctly and I don't know from what I

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.850 
correctly and I don't know from what I
play<00:04:47.760> it<00:04:48.060> seems<00:04:48.630> for<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:48.990> people<00:04:49.290> who<00:04:49.320> just

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
play it seems for the people who just

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.980 
play it seems for the people who just
play<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.400> online<00:04:50.790> for<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.240> fact<00:04:51.479> of<00:04:51.660> playing

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
play the online for the fact of playing

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.730 
play the online for the fact of playing
online<00:04:53.600> they<00:04:54.600> really<00:04:54.870> don't<00:04:55.080> have<00:04:55.350> any<00:04:55.500> sense

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
online they really don't have any sense

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.740 
online they really don't have any sense
of<00:04:55.890> how<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:58.220> play<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.400> correctly<00:05:00.240> it<00:05:00.539> would

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
of how to play it correctly it would

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.590 
of how to play it correctly it would
seem<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.220> as<00:05:02.220> you<00:05:02.400> saw<00:05:02.550> there<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:03.300> can<00:05:03.450> also

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
seem and as you saw there you can also

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.670 
seem and as you saw there you can also
combine<00:05:05.390> so<00:05:06.390> there<00:05:07.140> I<00:05:07.169> had<00:05:07.560> an<00:05:07.680> enviro<00:05:08.100> kill<00:05:08.910> as

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
combine so there I had an enviro kill as

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.310 
combine so there I had an enviro kill as
well<00:05:10.680> as<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:12.140> chart<00:05:13.140> shot<00:05:13.410> that<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:13.950> saw

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
well as the chart shot that you saw

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.440 
well as the chart shot that you saw
I<00:05:15.460> really<00:05:16.460> think<00:05:16.610> that<00:05:16.850> this<00:05:16.970> is<00:05:17.030> a<00:05:17.180> very

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
I really think that this is a very

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.450 
I really think that this is a very
interesting<00:05:18.050> thing<00:05:18.230> I'm<00:05:18.440> very<00:05:18.920> happy<00:05:19.310> that

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
interesting thing I'm very happy that

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.020 
interesting thing I'm very happy that
they<00:05:19.610> didn't<00:05:19.880> go<00:05:20.150> about<00:05:20.630> making<00:05:21.260> a

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
they didn't go about making a

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.360 
they didn't go about making a
multiplayer<00:05:23.030> that<00:05:23.390> is<00:05:23.630> you<00:05:24.170> know<00:05:24.370> your

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
multiplayer that is you know your

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.340 
multiplayer that is you know your
typical<00:05:25.730> stigma<00:05:26.390> when<00:05:26.570> it<00:05:26.660> comes<00:05:26.960> to

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
typical stigma when it comes to

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.100 
typical stigma when it comes to
first-person<00:05:27.800> shooters<00:05:28.460> or<00:05:29.120> you<00:05:29.330> have<00:05:29.510> B<00:05:29.840> team

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
first-person shooters or you have B team

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.970 
first-person shooters or you have B team
versus<00:05:30.530> a<00:05:30.680> team<00:05:31.100> or<00:05:31.340> 18<00:05:31.790> verses<00:05:32.060> bikini<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:32.980> I

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
versus a team or 18 verses bikini and I

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.340 
versus a team or 18 verses bikini and I
really<00:05:34.850> feel<00:05:35.030> that<00:05:35.060> they<00:05:35.330> focused<00:05:35.780> a<00:05:35.870> lot<00:05:36.050> in

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
really feel that they focused a lot in

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.700 
really feel that they focused a lot in
the<00:05:36.410> game<00:05:36.770> playing<00:05:37.340> campaign<00:05:38.000> and<00:05:38.710> really

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
the game playing campaign and really

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.220 
the game playing campaign and really
putting<00:05:39.950> their<00:05:40.160> focus<00:05:40.490> into<00:05:40.760> getting<00:05:41.060> these

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
putting their focus into getting these

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.460 
putting their focus into getting these
kill<00:05:42.230> shots<00:05:42.880> into<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:44.540> game<00:05:44.750> or<00:05:44.780> skill<00:05:45.230> shots

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
kill shots into the game or skill shots

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.780 
kill shots into the game or skill shots

even<00:06:26.300> more<00:06:26.540> because<00:06:27.080> you<00:06:27.290> can<00:06:27.470> control<00:06:27.980> the

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
even more because you can control the

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.300 
even more because you can control the

pill it so if you shoot it you can

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.690 
pill it so if you shoot it you can
virtually<00:06:31.760> control<00:06:32.630> it<00:06:32.810> afterwards<00:06:33.700> it's

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
virtually control it afterwards it's

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.200 
virtually control it afterwards it's
really<00:06:35.210> cool<00:06:35.950> kind<00:06:36.950> of<00:06:37.010> like<00:06:37.310> a<00:06:37.340> wanted<00:06:37.970> type

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
really cool kind of like a wanted type

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.570 
really cool kind of like a wanted type
of<00:06:38.360> feel<00:06:38.690> you<00:06:39.050> know<00:06:39.170> curving<00:06:40.100> the<00:06:40.250> bullets

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
of feel you know curving the bullets

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 
them up and that's a great thing about

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.280 
them up and that's a great thing about
this<00:07:38.680> game<00:07:39.040> using<00:07:39.640> the<00:07:39.760> environment<00:07:40.360> and

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.290 
this game using the environment and

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.420 
this game using the environment and
trying<00:07:41.560> to<00:07:41.680> be<00:07:41.800> creative<00:07:43.740> look<00:07:44.740> at<00:07:44.830> this<00:07:44.950> guy<00:07:45.070> I

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.430 
trying to be creative look at this guy I

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.140 
trying to be creative look at this guy I
it's<00:07:45.790> has<00:07:46.360> some<00:07:46.600> black<00:07:46.840> you<00:07:47.080> doing<00:07:47.290> mechanics

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.150 
it's has some black you doing mechanics

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.580 
it's has some black you doing mechanics
and<00:07:49.150> I<00:07:49.240> think<00:07:49.480> that's<00:07:49.630> probably<00:07:49.810> one<00:07:50.380> of<00:07:50.410> the

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:50.590 
and I think that's probably one of the

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.830 
and I think that's probably one of the
best<00:07:50.740> parts<00:07:51.070> about<00:07:51.130> it<00:07:51.460> is<00:07:51.660> the<00:07:52.660> game

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:52.840 
best parts about it is the game

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.210 
best parts about it is the game
mechanics<00:07:53.320> in<00:07:53.440> this<00:07:53.590> game<00:07:53.770> it<00:07:53.980> kind<00:07:54.190> of

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:54.220

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.580 
mechanics in this game it kind of
reminds<00:07:54.640> me<00:07:54.700> of<00:07:54.850> Halo<00:07:55.690> game<00:07:55.930> mechanics<00:07:56.440> or

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:56.590 
reminds me of Halo game mechanics or

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.080 
reminds me of Halo game mechanics or
