the<00:00:28.769> molding<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.400> recommend<00:00:29.760> getting<00:00:30.029> new

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the molding I do recommend getting new

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.010 
the molding I do recommend getting new
clips<00:00:31.219> to<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:33.030> know<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> work<00:00:33.510> with<00:00:33.719> because<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
clips to you know to work with because a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.330 
clips to you know to work with because a
lot<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.290> times<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.620> older<00:00:34.920> clips<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.280> are

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
lot of times the older clips that are

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.920 
lot of times the older clips that are
still<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.760> there<00:00:35.969> after<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.360> tore<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> chrome

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
still on there after you tore the chrome

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.569 
still on there after you tore the chrome
off<00:00:37.170> might<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.800> broken<00:00:38.010> off<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.460> they're

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
off might have broken off and they're

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.910 
off might have broken off and they're
brittle<00:00:38.910> by<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.120> time<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.750> age<00:00:40.410> anyway<00:00:40.860> so

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
brittle by this time in age anyway so

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.130 
brittle by this time in age anyway so
but<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:41.790> pretty<00:00:41.969> straightforward<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.780> you

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
but it's pretty straightforward so you

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.450 
but it's pretty straightforward so you
just<00:00:43.260> basically<00:00:43.410> get<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> clip<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.309> little

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
just basically get the clip a little

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.240 
just basically get the clip a little
white<00:00:44.789> piece<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.780> not<00:00:45.930> cut<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.410> tab<00:00:46.739> off<00:00:47.039> that

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
white piece do not cut this tab off that

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.580 
white piece do not cut this tab off that
sticks<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.610> from<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.000> back<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.870> lot<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.350> people

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
sticks out from the back a lot of people

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.240 
sticks out from the back a lot of people
think<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.809> to<00:00:51.809> cut<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.140> off<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.829> that's

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
think that to cut that off but that's

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.799 
think that to cut that off but that's
there<00:00:53.489> for<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> reason<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.210> got<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.360> hammer<00:00:54.690> that

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
there for a reason you got a hammer that

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.619 
there for a reason you got a hammer that
through<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.550> spreads<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> teeth<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.449> on

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
through so it spreads the teeth out on

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.500 
through so it spreads the teeth out on
this<00:00:57.809> end<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> fastens<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> hole<00:00:59.510> so

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
this end so it fastens it in the hole so

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.720 
this end so it fastens it in the hole so
basically<00:01:00.809> what<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.140> want<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:02.460> get

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
basically what you want to do is get

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.789 
basically what you want to do is get
your<00:01:02.910> piece<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.390> stick<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.650> like

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
your piece and stick it in just like

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.760 
your piece and stick it in just like
that<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.159> pops<00:01:05.400> right<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.590> want

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
that it pops right in and then you want

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.410 
that it pops right in and then you want
a<00:01:07.830> hammer<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:10.369> little<00:01:11.369> tab<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.000> make

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
a hammer that little tab in and make

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.210 
a hammer that little tab in and make
sure<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.720> straight<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.320> line<00:01:13.350> because<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
sure it's straight in a line because you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.590 
sure it's straight in a line because you
know<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.580> chrome<00:01:14.760> molding<00:01:15.150> straight<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.570> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
know the chrome molding straight if you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.210 
know the chrome molding straight if you
cook<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.170> any<00:01:16.320> way<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.710> moldings<00:01:17.100> not

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
cook it in any way the moldings not

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.580 
cook it in any way the moldings not
going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.430> go<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.840> flush<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.409> you're<00:01:19.500> gonna
