00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.400 
but that's not to say that the head
sculpt<00:03:33.670> is<00:03:33.820> a<00:03:33.850> total<00:03:34.330> loss<00:03:34.540> it's<00:03:34.959> actually

think<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.400> toys<00:04:06.730> were<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.390> lot<00:04:07.930> of<00:04:07.959> fun<00:04:08.350> in

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
think the toys were a lot of fun in

retrospect<00:04:10.150> looking<00:04:10.360> back<00:04:10.600> I<00:04:10.959> think<00:04:10.989> the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
retrospect looking back I think the

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.380 
retrospect looking back I think the
animated<00:04:11.860> series<00:04:12.190> was<00:04:12.370> more<00:04:12.760> fun<00:04:13.090> than<00:04:13.120> the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
animated series was more fun than the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.349 
animated series was more fun than the
prime<00:04:13.690> series<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:15.489> personal<00:04:15.850> opinion<00:04:16.239> I

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
prime series just a personal opinion I

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.699 
prime series just a personal opinion I
know<00:04:16.419> that's<00:04:16.660> going<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.840> be<00:04:16.900> flame<00:04:17.290> bait<00:04:17.500> for

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
know that's going to be flame bait for

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.520 
know that's going to be flame bait for
the<00:04:17.769> comments<00:04:18.280> sorry<00:04:18.549> guys<00:04:18.820> but<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:20.109> design

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530

of<00:04:20.739> these<00:04:20.830> transformers<00:04:21.609> just<00:04:22.090> made<00:04:22.270> me

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
of these transformers just made me

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.390 
of these transformers just made me
happier<00:04:22.930> than<00:04:23.260> what<00:04:23.680> we've<00:04:23.830> gotten<00:04:24.220> with

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
happier than what we've gotten with

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.760 
happier than what we've gotten with
these<00:04:24.610> with<00:04:25.120> though<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.479> prime<00:04:25.720> figures<00:04:26.110> now

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
these with though the prime figures now

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.629 
these with though the prime figures now
that's<00:04:27.039> not<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.370> say

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
that's not to say

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.489 
that's not to say
don't<00:04:27.759> like<00:04:27.939> the<00:04:28.090> Prime<00:04:28.330> figures<00:04:28.719> but<00:04:28.930> overall

00:04:29.489 --> 00:04:29.499 
don't like the Prime figures but overall

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:31.950 
don't like the Prime figures but overall
but<00:04:29.740> on<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.310> whole<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.729> think<00:04:30.780> animated<00:04:31.780> was<00:04:31.930> a

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
but on the whole I think animated was a

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.469 
but on the whole I think animated was a
little<00:04:32.229> bit<00:04:32.319> more<00:04:32.499> fun<00:04:32.879> so<00:04:33.879> guys<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.270> have<00:04:34.360> been
