compartment first thing you got to do is
go<00:00:23.230> out<00:00:23.260> to<00:00:23.500> your<00:00:23.560> car<00:00:23.740> and<00:00:23.800> find<00:00:24.189> out<00:00:24.340> what

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
go out to your car and find out what

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.580 
go out to your car and find out what
kind<00:00:24.640> of<00:00:24.760> globes<00:00:25.000> are<00:00:25.359> in<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.720> car<00:00:25.990> where<00:00:26.500> you

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
kind of globes are in the car where you

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.560 
kind of globes are in the car where you
want<00:00:26.770> to<00:00:26.830> replace<00:00:27.070> them<00:00:27.340> there<00:00:28.090> are<00:00:28.180> basically

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
want to replace them there are basically

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.710 
want to replace them there are basically
three<00:00:28.689> types<00:00:28.960> of<00:00:29.320> globes<00:00:30.269> one<00:00:31.269> of<00:00:31.359> them<00:00:31.480> is<00:00:31.510> a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
three types of globes one of them is a

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.570 
three types of globes one of them is a
festoon<00:00:32.410> which<00:00:32.619> almost<00:00:32.800> looks<00:00:33.010> like<00:00:33.220> a<00:00:33.340> little

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
festoon which almost looks like a little

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.640 
festoon which almost looks like a little
fuse<00:00:34.000> there's<00:00:34.870> another<00:00:35.110> type<00:00:35.350> of<00:00:35.379> globe

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
fuse there's another type of globe

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.620 
fuse there's another type of globe
called<00:00:36.040> a<00:00:36.220> t10<00:00:36.699> and<00:00:36.969> there<00:00:37.120> are<00:00:37.210> bigger<00:00:37.420> and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
called a t10 and there are bigger and

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.810 
called a t10 and there are bigger and
smaller<00:00:37.870> versions<00:00:38.469> of<00:00:38.590> those<00:00:38.770> and<00:00:39.070> then

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
smaller versions of those and then

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.280 
smaller versions of those and then
there's<00:00:40.000> a<00:00:40.059> bayonet<00:00:40.450> type<00:00:40.660> the<00:00:40.780> bayonet<00:00:41.110> type

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
there's a bayonet type the bayonet type

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.130 
there's a bayonet type the bayonet type
of<00:00:41.440> quite<00:00:41.710> unusual<00:00:42.280> but<00:00:43.090> there<00:00:43.690> are<00:00:43.840> some

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
of quite unusual but there are some

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.110 
of quite unusual but there are some
interior<00:00:44.739> globes<00:00:45.160> are<00:00:45.340> still<00:00:45.520> user<00:00:45.700> bayonet

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
interior globes are still user bayonet

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.510 
interior globes are still user bayonet
so<00:00:46.390> first<00:00:46.690> thing<00:00:46.899> to<00:00:47.020> do<00:00:47.140> is<00:00:47.290> to<00:00:47.379> identify<00:00:47.860> the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
so first thing to do is to identify the

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.490 
so first thing to do is to identify the
globes<00:00:48.879> that<00:00:48.969> you've<00:00:49.120> got<00:00:49.270> your<00:00:49.420> car<00:00:49.600> and<00:00:49.840> then

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
globes that you've got your car and then

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.400 
globes that you've got your car and then
go<00:00:50.680> into<00:00:50.800> your<00:00:50.950> local<00:00:51.070> store<00:00:51.430> that<00:00:51.640> sells<00:00:51.940> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
go into your local store that sells the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.100 
go into your local store that sells the
air<00:00:53.410> pro<00:00:53.879> LED<00:00:54.879> lighting<00:00:55.180> system<00:00:55.210> now<00:00:55.870> our

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
air pro LED lighting system now our

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.459 
air pro LED lighting system now our
system<00:00:56.469> is<00:00:56.590> called<00:00:56.829> super<00:00:57.309> SMD<00:00:57.760> and<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.899> sm<00:00:59.320> d

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
system is called super SMD and the sm d

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.350 
system is called super SMD and the sm d
stands<00:00:59.800> for<00:00:59.920> surface<00:01:00.610> mount<00:01:00.640> diode<00:01:01.090> and<00:01:01.270> the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
stands for surface mount diode and the

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.180 
stands for surface mount diode and the
reason<00:01:01.660> why<00:01:01.780> it's<00:01:01.930> super<00:01:02.320> is<00:01:02.500> that<00:01:03.039> our

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
reason why it's super is that our

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.940 
reason why it's super is that our
surface<00:01:03.520> mount<00:01:03.730> diodes<00:01:04.119> have<00:01:04.420> three<00:01:05.050> surface

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
surface mount diodes have three surface

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.010 
surface mount diodes have three surface
mount<00:01:06.190> diodes<00:01:06.610> in<00:01:06.850> each<00:01:07.180> little<00:01:07.450> chip<00:01:07.780> and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
mount diodes in each little chip and

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.620 
mount diodes in each little chip and
therefore<00:01:08.950> they<00:01:09.100> give<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.490> three<00:01:10.030> x<00:01:10.299> amount

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
therefore they give you three x amount

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.260 
therefore they give you three x amount
alone<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:12.130> pretty<00:01:12.369> simple<00:01:12.640> how<00:01:12.880> to<00:01:12.939> choose

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
alone it's pretty simple how to choose

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.240 
alone it's pretty simple how to choose
one<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.320> great<00:01:14.470> things<00:01:14.740> about<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:15.130> air

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
one of the great things about the air

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.859 
one of the great things about the air
pro<00:01:15.490> range<00:01:15.760> is<00:01:16.030> they<00:01:16.240> have<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.450> little<00:01:16.600> trimming

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
pro range is they have a little trimming

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.590 
pro range is they have a little trimming
light<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:18.610> you<00:01:18.700> like<00:01:18.909> you<00:01:19.090> can<00:01:19.180> even<00:01:19.420> take

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
light and if you like you can even take

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.320 
light and if you like you can even take
that<00:01:19.750> out<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:19.990> your<00:01:20.110> car<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:20.939> put<00:01:21.939> inside<00:01:22.180> your

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
that out to your car and put inside your

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.520 
that out to your car and put inside your
car<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:22.600> check<00:01:22.720> it<00:01:22.869> out<00:01:22.930> much<00:01:23.080> like<00:01:23.290> they

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
car and check it out much like they

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.990 
car and check it out much like they
produce<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:24.130> whether<00:01:24.250> it's<00:01:24.430> enough<00:01:24.640> for<00:01:24.670> you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
produce and whether it's enough for you

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.969 
produce and whether it's enough for you
and<00:01:25.210> there<00:01:25.720> are<00:01:25.810> different<00:01:26.140> models<00:01:26.560> that<00:01:26.860> have

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
and there are different models that have

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.380 
and there are different models that have
different<00:01:27.189> amount<00:01:27.460> of<00:01:27.520> lights<00:01:27.670> just<00:01:28.240> be

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
different amount of lights just be

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.789 
different amount of lights just be
careful<00:01:28.600> that<00:01:29.080> when<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.409> check<00:01:29.439> it<00:01:29.680> out

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
careful that when you check it out

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.219 
careful that when you check it out
during<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.159> day<00:01:30.210> these<00:01:31.210> lights<00:01:31.600> don't<00:01:31.900> appear

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
during the day these lights don't appear

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.719 
during the day these lights don't appear
to<00:01:32.259> be<00:01:32.470> all<00:01:32.710> that<00:01:32.890> bright<00:01:33.100> inside<00:01:33.490> your

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
to be all that bright inside your

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.670 
to be all that bright inside your
interior<00:01:34.180> but<00:01:34.450> believe<00:01:34.750> me<00:01:34.780> at<00:01:35.200> nighttime

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
interior but believe me at nighttime

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.410 
interior but believe me at nighttime
it's<00:01:35.920> completely<00:01:36.670> different<00:01:36.970> story<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:37.360> if

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
it's completely different story so if

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.210 
it's completely different story so if
you<00:01:37.540> are<00:01:37.659> going<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.840> check<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.110> out<00:01:38.229> go<00:01:38.890> into<00:01:39.189> a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
you are going to check it out go into a

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.859 
you are going to check it out go into a
dark<00:01:39.460> environment<00:01:39.729> inside<00:01:40.299> a<00:01:40.360> garage<00:01:40.509> or

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
dark environment inside a garage or
