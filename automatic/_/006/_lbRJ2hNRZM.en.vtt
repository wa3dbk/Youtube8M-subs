00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.000
 action technique of hugging her fa 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.639
 would be 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.639
 provision number 1 passed with point 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.830
 dead the triathlete will perform only one 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.810
 action each time with one arm ie 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.360
 there will only be one arm pulling or 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.099
 recovering the inactive arm should 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.500
 be blocked in front of your shoulder in 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.060
 deadlock should try not to 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.920
 advance the beginning of the work of 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.600
 our arm until the arm that 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.760
 is doing in the action there is not 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.210
 reached the same position the arm that 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.210
 wait for you 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.670
 progression number 2 arm stroke alternating 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.470
 arms the triathlete works a 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.240
 determined number of strokes with a 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.790
 arm while the other is off in 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.140
 some area of â€‹â€‹the square gives once that 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.230
 the number of strokes has been reached 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.240
 demanded at a certain distance the 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.130
 arm that was in use should stop 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.520
 and the one who was standing start the 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.520
 work 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.730
 provision number 3 past touching table 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.500
 the triathlete must put on a board 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.080
 between the modules and that it stands out 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.510
 enough of the water should be made 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.160
 nothing crawl normally but every 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.440
 once the aquatic phase of the 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.540
 stroke on one side has to touch the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.750
 table with fingers to then continue 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.670
 with the recovery of normal form should 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.440
 keep your attention at the touch of the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.820
 table in all the strokes and 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.820
 finish them correctly 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.280
 provision number 4 will come to rub the 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.530
 surface the athlete tea during the 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.780
 recovery of the arms should rub against the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.520
 fingers the surface of the water from almost 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.009
 the output of the arm to almost 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.750
 entry of the hand in the water is precise 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.819
 have your elbow high in your 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.579
 I recover as well as perform the 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.649
 corresponding longitudinal turn as 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.600
 will have the shoulder out of the water too 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.640
 You must wear your forearm under the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.060
 elbow to be able to find the water with 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.060
 the veins
