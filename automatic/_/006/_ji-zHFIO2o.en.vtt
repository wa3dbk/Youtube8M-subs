00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.240
 how do you do that over the flashes in 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.729
 Minecraft can get the experience 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.660
 you in this video 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:10.760
 hey and welcome to one 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.950
 fire dangerous video here in the tutorial 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.290
 center in this it is in the flash 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.359
 First, let's look at how 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.400
 it is possible lightning in minecraft too 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.769
 spawn for it there is the normal 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.740
 get together this starts with 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.079
 together lightning bolt that's called 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.720
 Lightning in minecraft and if you just 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.310
 the command in the chat example, enters with 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.020
 I have ctrl v here in this case 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.910
 copied the clipboard and then 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.000
 then runs directly on yours 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.129
 position is a lightning stretched as well 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.949
 It is possible to use the command with relative 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.699
 coordinates or generally one 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.010
 position indication for the flashes too 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.140
 provided with this relative coordinate 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.850
 I'll flash ten blocks now 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.859
 spawn right from command blog and 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.089
 Look, here's ten blocks on the right 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.190
 Lightning struck 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.839
 Also accurate coordinates are natural 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.920
 possible and can be easily in the 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:03.230
 xy form and attach here but in this 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.630
 three candidates here have flashes one 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.759
 very special effect spawn if 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.369
 your present or directly on her 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.790
 head such a lightning then we see 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.610
 that first of all the villagers too 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.799
 a witch becomes the kripo becomes one 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.439
 loaded creeper and a loaded one 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.540
 Nativity is far more explosive than a 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.909
 normal under pig is to one 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.590
 By the way, zombie pigment is degenerating 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.780
 you fight now against this war has 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.460
 then it is possible that he is going to war 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.200
 head dropped and that is also the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.509
 only possibility for a greeter 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.399
 head in survival mode to come 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.049
 do not you want a flash with one 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.090
 send command there you have to 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.520
 thunderstorms wait because only then exists 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.710
 the chance that lightning strike 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.140
 Incidentally, the fire then what through 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.270
 Lightning is ignited mostly extinguishes 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.100
 automatically by the rain 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.539
 that by the lightning actually no 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.610
 big danger emanates 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.530
 Nevertheless, you should set 0 in game mode 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.689
 be the hat because a flash sees some 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.030
 live as well as the ensuing fire 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.609
 in the video description you will find the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.159
 command to flash a lot of fun 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.019
 with it and thank you for watching if 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.240
 you still feel like you can 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.940
 like to see how it is possible 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.280
 blocks on the head more about it 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.470
 now respective video otherwise 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.650
 Thank you for watching tools and see you 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.650
