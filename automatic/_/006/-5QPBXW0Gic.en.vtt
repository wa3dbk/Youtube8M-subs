00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.909

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.909
 enjoy it 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.520
 hello my name is marcos and I will tell you my 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.590
 history was Tuesday with the 6 of the 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.960
 tomorrow I was going to get ready to go to 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.910
 school with sleep I got up was one day 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.130
 I dressed myself 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.050
 teeth ready my backpack and I went in the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.029
 way I thought I wanted to 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.160
 invite my friends to play at my house 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.770
 classic penguin wars was coming to 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.689
 the school was 7 with 40 minutes 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.270
 the school played at 8 in the morning 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.250
 I had time to tell my friends 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.649
 I invite you to my house to play classic 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.540
 Penguin wars greet my companions them 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.370
 I said I was going to invite them to my house 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.260
 they answered yes yes 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.930
 all my friends until I was 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.760
 fans of that game tomorrow go to my 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.130
 home to play they were going to bring their 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.260
 netbook plus I have wifi in my house 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.090
 and it would not be a problem we all talk and 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.610
 on Wednesday we were going to gather them in my 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.890
 home to play and invite them to play was 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.320
 the biggest mistake I made was the 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.600
 one in the afternoon we were going to go to my 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.570
 house besides my parents would not be in 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.610
 because they would be working alone 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.310
 three minutes to get out of the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.409
 school my partner told me he was 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.359
 investigating and there is a private room 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.369
 always worked in crash and penguin 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:22.719
 wards and I answered what is called the 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.579
 room 0 1000 11 10 0 1 this is the name 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.289
 room told me that weird the name of the 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.359
 room but it does not matter after three 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.609
 minutes ended the class and we 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:32.259
 we went running to my house to play but 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.299
 coming to my house was the most error 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.880
 big of my life Wednesday with 3 hours 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.069
 and 30 minutes we arrived at my house we entered 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.380
 my colleagues left the backpacks in 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.390
 my piece took out the netbooks and we went 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.030
 to facebook to play classic penguin 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.340
 wars everything started fine but when you put the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.989
 name of the room started everything was wrong 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.989
 all black the background and there was a player 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:54.939
 level 78 and his picture was a dead man 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:56.469
 with a star in the middle but that's not 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.250
 he imported them we went into the room and 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:02.319
 started playing the player was called 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.149
 666 when playing notice that his ping ino had 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.979
 the same clothes as me but what was 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.140
 weird his ping ino was red 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.509
 blood and their eyes the same and we scared them 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.340
 a little and he laughed as if he had the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.290
 battle won and then he said them 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.720
 you know what it's called or I know where 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.880
 they live and what school they go to and we do not 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.100
 we believed him and we talked badly with him 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.200
 doodles told them if they want to live 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.360
 are you winning each one of you one 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.460
 for one if they want to live if I do not 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.770
 they win or they refuse to fight with me the 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.350
 I will kill them I will give them a term of up to ten days and 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.450
 we did not believe him and he named jose 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.640
 but JosÃ© refused to play to fight with 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.860
 he then said jose tomorrow you will be 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.990
 dead they have ten days or if they will not live 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.030
 the same destiny that jose you already 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.190
 they know the room where I am 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.990
 when they see Jose dead there they just go 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.300
 to fight with me to save their 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.310
 pathetic life ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha and 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.350
 we left the room and not 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.630
 we were worried the ones mattered 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.700
 cum and we play crash and penguin wars in 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.820
 a room invented by me but jose al 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.980
 ignore player 666 going to 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.290
 to die back my worst nightmares are 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.840
 they were really doing Thursday 7 hours 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.790
 with 30 minutes all my friends and I the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.890
 we went next to the school we arrived at 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.380
 school at 7 hours with 50 minutes 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.630
 everything was quiet we went to class and 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.700
 all normal joseph mocking that he did not die 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.500
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha said jose 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.180
 it was a lie, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.130
 ja that I was going to kill was only 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.230
 coincidence that I knew my name just 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.790
 but when I left class I was going to change my 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.310
 life completely was the worst 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.469
 because it was going to happen to me we were dating 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.390
 to class again we were going to join in 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.400
 my house but suddenly we saw a shadow 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.590
 in the distance it did not matter but that 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.540
 shadow pulled a gun and threw something but not 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.370
 they were imported but the worst was what they threw 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.049
 the mysterious subject threw it under 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.150
 Dry stood still with a face 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.220
 pain but did not scream or said it hurts 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.560
 not only was he standing and we 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.359
 we said I know what happens to you the object that 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.400
 threw the mysterious man took him to 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.439
 jose and I looked back was a network 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.689
 of fishing but it was not a simple network 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.790
 I only had three strings but the strings 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.769
 they were transparent and they were bloody 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.659
 and suddenly look jose jose is 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.879
 fell arms and legs and 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.439
 I drew blood to myself and my friends 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.569
 blood fell and I with a face 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.790
 terrified I looked at jose how my 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.500
 Friend Maria was screaming and crying with a 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.079
 terrified face and my other companions 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.299
 they looked terrified they covered their eyes 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.280
 but I was so close to him he saw it I saw it 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.380
 how his legs fell and 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.440
 arms and I said to myself it's true what 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.689
 that player 666 said he could not 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.969
 believe I knelt and yell 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:34.309
 or because you killed him just because he 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:36.679
 refused to play with you that's inhuman 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:38.929
 all terrified and the mysterious subject 

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:40.909
 he said now he gets terrified and now he 

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:42.619
 touch Pedro if he does not play Pedro will die 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:45.019
 just ha ha ha ha ha ha and the voice 

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:47.419
 mysterious fell and terrified pedro said to 

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:51.249
 me and I was very terrified and I said just 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.249
 ten days of time or if we will not die 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.770
 Two hours have passed since Joseph died 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.199
 all my friends were in my house 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.240
 terrified I told them we only had ten 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.159
 days only ten days to stop the 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.900
 killer and beat him in the game and just 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.999
 Pedro can do it if he can not be 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.159
 turn another victim and only one will come out 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.650
 I live but said depends we can die 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:16.770
 all there is no other choice we need 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.289
 fight with player 666 or if not 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.389
 we will have the same destiny as jose alone 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.800
 We have 10 days we can you 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.800
 we will win to leave alive
