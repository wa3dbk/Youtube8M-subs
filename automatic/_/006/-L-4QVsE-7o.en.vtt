00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.000
 At this stage we are in the 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.290
 learning is normal sometimes you do not 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.360
 can draw all funds is greater 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.389
 What would you like to take away, huh? 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.020
 went to 11 years is more beautiful than 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.580
 love even more noise than sound 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.830
 This is normal at this stage of 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.960
 learning do not worry 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.400
 The important thing is that you're hitting 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.749
 this throughout his study is not 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.110
 important that you type correctly 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:37.330
 the fingers you position correctly 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.920
 right hand and bends in right bow 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.250
 in that space that I told you 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.470
 nothing of the right hand position here 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.510
 Ok, right. 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.530
 the arm that in the corner as I said 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:56.340
 and play comfortably 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.050
 Okay, nothing to stand like that. 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.360
 so that all in time you will 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.220
 hitting goes like you will not have 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.170
 No teacher, and in that moment you 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.420
 only the video is not 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.940
 You have to police yourself in this respect. 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.049
 that police found a left position 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:20.070
 by this agreement it is a right that you 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.940
 get no addiction what not to touch 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.270
 huh 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.649
 the pride of technique is good 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.399
 one thing I want you to notice 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:32.490
 it is also that the left hand it is not 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:36.509
 to ensure the instrument 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.170
 the instrument it should lean on itself 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.780
 only the one who is your left hand is not 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.770
 her purpose to ensure an instrument 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.600
 because he did not fall 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.030
 right the left hand function is 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.220
 effectively working on strings by typing 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.220
 with typing right 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.340
 What I want to say is because the people 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.579
 has to run on the guitar and the guitar should 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.969
 to lean on a leg at last in this popular 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.649
 iPhone already said because if you have not 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.869
 the support you will make the hand to 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.700
 head holding the instrument is to end 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.480
 with this function is not the function of it 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.989
 is not free to move is to 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.200
 change the positions it needs to act 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.470
 And never forget to rest, okay? 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.049
 or is there one is bigger you make one 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.090
 exercise a little ten minutes ago 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:36.390
 times in repression 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:39.959
 2 to 1 and do ten times for example or 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.040
 what you find here that supports and 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.920
 Rest, do not force your hand if you 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.549
 begin to realize that you are having a 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.920
 any pain or pain will happen the fact 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.519
 you get with pain you stop time 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.890
 let him rest because if you force the 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.150
 we love and force repetitive movements 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.120
 can cause injuries so take it slow 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.470
 hand rested're back in if necessary 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.650
 another day to do 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.430
 obviously with practice we will 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.250
 acquiring resistance in but do not force 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.819
 I do not it 's not interesting that you 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.849
 strength because it can bring you touch injuries 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.590
 One more important tip I want to 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.340
 give because it's something we use 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.900
 for all of life, not economy of movement 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.579
 always when people put people down 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.870
 have to try to do with the name of 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.940
 movement I'm going to show our people 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.489
 Lift up, look, we 're fine here. 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:46.470
 exercise 3 is already doing the right 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:50.280
 Hello, then, note that for you. 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.049
 change aft position there is not 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.040
 I need a lot of movement 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:59.280
 note early that practically three 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.440
 slide on the rope two here what it goes 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.329
 do look here he'll do only this 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.829
 movement is movement here I ride 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:14.290
 there move to fell a lot back 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:19.810
 practically he stays there 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:22.709
 just sliding down the two touch string 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.709
 this is very important 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:31.300
 When I went to change it, it's already okay. 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.070
 use this tip 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.180
 next time I can escape the account 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.180
 exercise here
