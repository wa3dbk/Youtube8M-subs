00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
do this before that way my blade would

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.370 
do this before that way my blade would
still<00:04:14.650> add<00:04:14.860> all<00:04:15.490> the<00:04:15.730> state<00:04:16.000> at<00:04:16.390> least<00:04:17.020> now<00:04:17.320> you

know
never<00:04:18.430> cut<00:04:18.820> Formica<00:04:19.390> with<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.780> Japanese<00:04:20.350> saw<00:04:23.670> so

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
never cut Formica with a Japanese saw so

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.480 
never cut Formica with a Japanese saw so
then<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.120> do<00:04:25.390> it<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.810> right<00:04:26.050> way<00:04:26.410> using<00:04:27.190> my

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
then I do it the right way using my

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.730 
then I do it the right way using my
router<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.360> flush<00:04:28.570> trim<00:04:28.750> bit<00:04:31.080> now<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.380> can

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
router and a flush trim bit now I can

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.710 
router and a flush trim bit now I can
cut<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.070> Formica<00:04:33.670> in<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:34.060> center<00:04:34.420> of<00:04:34.450> the

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
cut the Formica in the center of the

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.629 
cut the Formica in the center of the
edging

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.340 

after<00:04:40.639> that<00:04:40.850> I<00:04:41.060> cut<00:04:41.450> the<00:04:41.600> tabletop<00:04:42.139> to<00:04:42.260> the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
after that I cut the tabletop to the

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.490 
after that I cut the tabletop to the
right<00:04:42.530> size

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:05:00.650 

and<00:04:49.710> cut<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.760> corner<00:04:51.180> at<00:04:51.360> 45<00:04:51.930> degrees

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.270 

then<00:05:01.660> I<00:05:01.900> cut<00:05:02.139> the<00:05:02.290> rest<00:05:02.470> of<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.740> edging<00:05:03.100> and

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
then I cut the rest of the edging and

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.129 
then I cut the rest of the edging and
glue<00:05:03.940> it<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.330> exposed<00:05:04.750> fly<00:05:05.410> with<00:05:05.650> edge<00:05:07.139> to

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
glue it to the exposed fly with edge to

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.499 
glue it to the exposed fly with edge to
stop<00:05:08.410> them<00:05:08.560> from<00:05:08.770> moving<00:05:09.009> I<00:05:09.340> use<00:05:09.880> some<00:05:10.120> Atlas

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
stop them from moving I use some Atlas

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:19.290 
stop them from moving I use some Atlas
spins<00:05:10.780> and<00:05:11.350> clamp<00:05:12.280> the<00:05:12.460> edging<00:05:17.699> then<00:05:18.699> I<00:05:18.940> grew

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
spins and clamp the edging then I grew

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.300 
spins and clamp the edging then I grew
all<00:05:19.479> the<00:05:19.690> basis<00:05:20.080> dowels<00:05:22.620> to<00:05:23.620> all<00:05:23.770> liberating

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
all the basis dowels to all liberating

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:34.760 
all the basis dowels to all liberating
in<00:05:24.430> place<00:05:24.699> while<00:05:25.240> the<00:05:25.449> glue<00:05:25.479> dries<00:05:25.600> I<00:05:26.199> use<00:05:26.740> pins

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.070 

when<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.919> edgings<00:05:36.370> glue<00:05:36.669> is<00:05:36.820> dry<00:05:37.090> I<00:05:37.120> plane<00:05:37.900> the

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
when the edgings glue is dry I plane the

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:48.060 
when the edgings glue is dry I plane the
edging<00:05:38.500> flush<00:05:38.770> to<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.160> table<00:05:39.610> I<00:05:46.380> take<00:05:47.380> extra

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
edging flush to the table I take extra

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.790 
edging flush to the table I take extra
care<00:05:48.310> not<00:05:48.760> to<00:05:48.789> damage<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.270> Formica<00:05:49.900> I<00:05:50.139> can<00:05:50.650> be

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
care not to damage the Formica I can be

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.659 
care not to damage the Formica I can be
so<00:05:50.979> clumsy<00:05:51.190> sometimes

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:04.200 

then<00:05:57.669> I<00:05:58.000> Reese<00:05:58.599> and<00:05:58.870> under<00:05:59.440> the<00:05:59.620> table

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.140 

I<00:06:04.270> wrote<00:06:05.169> a<00:06:05.199> round<00:06:05.560> over<00:06:05.919> on<00:06:06.100> all<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:06.789> exterior

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.550 

I<00:06:33.280> answer<00:06:34.280> down<00:06:34.490> Center<00:06:35.120> finder<00:06:35.599> and<00:06:35.840> climb

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
I answer down Center finder and climb

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.040 
I answer down Center finder and climb
the<00:06:36.590> tabletop<00:06:37.370> so<00:06:37.939> I<00:06:37.970> can<00:06:38.270> see<00:06:38.479> where<00:06:38.689> to<00:06:38.720> drill

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
the tabletop so I can see where to drill

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:46.990 
the tabletop so I can see where to drill
the<00:06:39.500> other<00:06:39.530> holes<00:06:39.979> I<00:06:45.069> glue<00:06:46.069> the<00:06:46.250> aligning<00:06:46.729> pins

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000

in their rolls taking care not to use
too<00:06:50.240> much<00:06:50.389> food<00:06:50.629> I<00:06:50.960> put<00:06:51.919> the<00:06:52.039> two<00:06:52.189> pieces

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
too much food I put the two pieces

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.450 
too much food I put the two pieces
together<00:06:52.759> so<00:06:53.240> I<00:06:54.080> can<00:06:54.379> be<00:06:54.560> sure<00:06:54.800> the<00:06:55.009> pins<00:06:55.250> stay

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
together so I can be sure the pins stay

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.510 
together so I can be sure the pins stay
straight<00:06:55.789> while<00:06:56.479> the<00:06:56.689> glue<00:06:56.900> dries<00:06:57.250> then<00:06:58.250> I

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520
