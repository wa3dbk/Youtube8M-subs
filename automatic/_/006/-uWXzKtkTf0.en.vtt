00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.860
 Speak there, people here are the kronos and be 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.609
 Welcome to another video and this time. 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.949
 where are we back with video 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.070
 Good guys, I want to explain to you guys. 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.529
 before starting the video here 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.849
 why we stayed so long 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.849
 no video 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.540
 What happened was that I got sick of the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.399
 microcredit to the minecraft and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.760
 This is something that is going to happen. 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.090
 eventually if you make a channel in 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.020
 that you only put videos of a game 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.370
 which in my case here was the minecraft 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.530
 how I was putting videos from 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.469
 I'm finished and my year is minecraft. 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.300
 I decided not to put another this is to come from 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:04.619
 other games because I because the galley 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.220
 here the channel I like minecraft and then I 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.900
 I do not think it's cool to put glass 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.710
 This is something I can not do. 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.750
 have to put of other games too 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.630
 because otherwise I'll end up getting sick and then 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.490
 channel will be without videos as it was 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.009
 but I did not stop making video 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.650
 also because I was sick of 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.740
 minecraft that happened to stay as well 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.979
 It was boring that way 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.890
 that we did in the last video is I saw 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.630
 a better one than her being that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.930
 family we made 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.820
 I was already was already better than 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.259
 that I wanted to do 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.380
 Then the gym was disheartening and I was 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:55.689
 there and discouraged I know and also 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.310
 It's with some other things that are 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.740
 happening to me 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.649
 Good, what are we going to do in this? 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.619

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.619
 What are we going to do? 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.840

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.150
 our map and I'll be doing this 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.400
 in some videos 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.650
 I had already done a video reforming the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.080
 our house but in this video that people 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.950
 will continue to reform it from the house 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.019
 look cool in the shadow of the tower here and 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.360
 It's good that's what we'll do. 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.060
 Some renovations, I'm going to change this house. 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.250

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.390
 our house there then what we will 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.190

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.819
 for now in this video here will be the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.760
 change of house and I go there to change and how 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.870
 coughing is now moddy's since I am 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.989
 playing in version 1.1 7.2 in the 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.680
 camera and the fine ocs to take the 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.920
 leg 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.890
 There is no way to do the time lapse of 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.959
 change so that what I'm going to do goes 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.299
 to be the next I do not know if I'm going 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.980
 do only remodel this house from here because 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:08.170
 maybe travel but as I go 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.370
 a video and I see so easy other 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.410
 reforms 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.650
 I'm going to leave the camera in position 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:21.450
 a certain block will be the one here and 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:23.700
 I'll come here at home and 123 there guys 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.400
 I finished moving here, it's our house. 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:31.269
 Look, I just made a lot of changes. 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:35.109
 I changed that is Estonian bic by 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.389
 new wood acacia I switched on the 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.600
 our stone fence for about 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.880
 I did not change the wood of the 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.870
 roof of our house for the 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.430
 Cassia and the changes purposes is also in the 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.189
 side 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.500
 it is on the side also I put the cacique 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:56.319
 thus dividing the two floors and 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.750
 put the house up I found that 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.670
 It was really cool guys and I liked it here. 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.090
 from inside too that I did several 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:08.680
 changes she just came back is the new wood 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.260
 what to give the cksa is to give uk 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.709
 I think that's what I changed that the 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.680
 Our house poet is white wood 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:22.120
 I also put the serving log on 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.099
 place where you have around there to give a 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.039
 nap in the house right? 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:30.430
 It's a matter of status, it was like this. 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:33.009
 So, I thought it was good. 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.229
 here are the changes of our house and 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:39.639
 Now I'll show you guys up there. 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:43.660
 the difference between cassia and wood is 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:46.449
 django the much redder and 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:51.789
 I think it combines a lot more procrastinating. 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:53.710
 looks like it's clay brick roof 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.169
 Look how nice it got. 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.220
 and look at the difference as it is much more 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:03.460
 red is also galera remembering that 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:08.080
 There is no text ipec that for 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:11.229
 box brings isleb co trunk of the house 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.050
 then is when to upgrade the triple ae 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.570
 pec is going to change a little too, we are 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.169
 that this heavenly window is symmetrical and 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.630
 santi was a little tart and what windows 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.030
 and I thought it was cool, I wanted 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.759
 ask your opinion is this accurate 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.979
 It turned out better that way. 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:33.520
 and if you also have some 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:36.159
 suggestion to change more here the house for 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.889
 Leave it prettiest and I wanted to ask you there. 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:41.099

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:46.720
