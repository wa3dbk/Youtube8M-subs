00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.850
 the year begins has already been happening 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.900
 it has been good 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.000
 it was a new challenge as if 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.680
 I came from a more middle 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.140
 technological then loeb was 16 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.520
 seconds my pet y I came on 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.330
 books offer you a glass of 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.340
 thank you wine and then that's for sure I had 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.340
 a love anyway for only 9 in 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.890
 practice this 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.290
 on the other hand in the family person 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.760
 after the umpteenth I was motivated late 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.720
 youth training there worked in 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:13.880
 the technological world pilot has spread 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.390
 this time one side I love because 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.729
 I have too many projects whose project to be 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.220
 undo project then for the 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.930
 adversaries he often made his shares 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.659
 to that on it my team to say 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.820
 how to make traction 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.920
 the experience they were different and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.470
 attractive if you are too much in a world 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.420
 tourist and who is the competition 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.160
 then finally had a lot 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.260
 Uzbek affluence in a period 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.170
 as the month of July - from 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.150
 unless despite the fact that 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.920
 cars each in the background we are told we 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.140
 could be directly increased 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.780
 denain experience of our visitors 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.540
 think editions will try on close 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.210
 later dassier to keep our customers 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.730
 but our visitors on the site asleep 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.160
 way to develop a formula for the 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.590
 supper are the people stay longer 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.330
 long time left our rides the web with 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.250
 all your universe 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.540
 example as we speak of a corpus 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.310
 or internet 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.330
 steve mandanda the bottom we see the 26 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.170
 December then coast it took local 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.130
 unfortunately for skiers I 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.170
 would say that they had a lot of naive 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.430
 menzo the ridership was double the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.990
 what is planned for the period of 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.440
 backup from experience in the 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.480
 zouglou 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.090
 or is it precisely the toy of 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.400
 rain with common we do for 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.080
 improve and keep our customer lynx 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.040
 or the issue assaults documents 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.940
 can renew itself 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.800
 how can we tell them if the measure 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.680
 came to give the ball kidney 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.920
 of energy to popularity at all like t 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.540
 she 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.120
 I will have humans last ten years 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.850

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.570
 project fucking contact with the 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.940
 animals nearby 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.670
 astor water in the construction of 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.470
 clothes early the new wave it's from 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.430

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.560
 of seperation 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.180
 these hebrew quads game you will be our 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.620
 project in years sites what are we going 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.940

 there who bathe weight of snow 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.200
 it's going to be a nice attraction 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.760
 has he admitted he has to 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.290
 the experience that there was still a 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.410
 times i have things that people are 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.820
 aware this is all the aspect that zhu 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.980
 was involved at the research level 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.980
 whether it's at the Quebec level or 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.959
 elsewhere at wigston interesting axis but 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.450
 despite all ignored the pink one or a 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.209
 shot in the mission as toys or in to

 the institutional aspect to allergies 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.470
 or from the general public 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.510
 the conservation mission in the background 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.010
 then this broadcast the in the background it 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.720
 there is an aspect plus a leaf an axis 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.130
 that we give ourselves that we want to give ourselves 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.709
 more and more to the covers and looking 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.000
 as such sexta notoriety also that is 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.970
 important for care networks 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.880
 commit on this axis the goal of educating 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.640
 also the games life visitors cases are 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.960
 little 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.780
 put in touch in some way 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.910
 with the animal or with our 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.950
 educators to explain a little this 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.960
 what did the animals do? 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.000
 it's a little what we want is that the 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.160
 visiting a landmark that is done wow 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.960
 for the experience and beauty of doubs 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.220
 but who retain something is 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.230
 that they keep something that attracts 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.000
 own santons from home that will have ap 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.169
 finally that we were 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.630
 able to do said learns something 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.100
 thing it's about conservation then 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.750
 the importance of the environment for 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.550
 preserving biodiversity is one of 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.990
 first important challenges we had 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.030
 in the background that I have with my team 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.010
 it is the renewal of accreditation 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:55.440
 the asia zone of lucchi the situation of the 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.960
 North American and have standards and 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.850
 standards that requires then if we want 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.220
 go get this water certification 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.750
 it must be complied with it is necessary to bring 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.790
 changes in our practices in the 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.500
 methodology then I 'm wrong these 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.330
 Requests for Zelda is what you 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.730
 allows you to get a bigger 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.770
 diversity of nÃ®mes or supposed 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.330
 what is the vision of paul gosselin 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.880
 for the son of president ray ma 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.380
 general manager philosophy that is 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.220
 who are relaxing to my old 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.750
 experiences 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.220
 there is a nice base of people there is 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.380
 surely a nice team to the urban 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.510
 a great expertise of the people who are 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.979
 passionate about their work it smells 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.830
 reality when we sit at the wolf 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.020
 people often tell us and then from 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.300
 the legend and buzz which good ideas 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.100
 I will tell you to change this 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.419
 do me attitude 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.610
 it's really a work of equipment that 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.460
 will bring us more success towards 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:49.220
 where the aim is to conserve energy 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.220
 have to thank you again for having 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.270
 for
