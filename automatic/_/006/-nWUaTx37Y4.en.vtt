00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.070
 so then we're going to do this for 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.779
 the four sides and they will have something 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.480
 A) Yes 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:13.179
 in the good letter and my magic that 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.290
 you put me here as this was very very 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.119
 honda I tell you that you can put 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.890
 pieces of newspaper I 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.779
 I found this or it is like to 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.310
 which fill very low carpet well 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.439
 but you can fill what you want 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.000
 so that it is not so deep very well if 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.040
 you notice is our step heel 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.570
 I would not need it because you are going 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.220
 measuring so that the years remain a 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.739
 little bullets up and you can see them 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.780
 exact a little bit of the center with felt 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.820
 because the felt 7 that felt the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.890
 The advantage it has is that it does not overflow 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.510
 it is very does not see very noble analysts that 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.980
 give it to bend and I go in fact can 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.230
 endure that you put rings 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.059
 Thin delgadillo or zac finito are a 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.789
 little piquitos so you do not swallow 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.769
 well we measure exact same width 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.449
 from our box and we're going to make some 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.879
 long strips ok 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.240
 this is my width now since we have 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.880
 the width I'm going to fold in half 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.880
 about three fingers is calculated 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.940
 that will be six centimeters already folded 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.810
 we turn to double here ok I will tell 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.850
 sorry ok 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.760
 we 're going to cut these we're going to do 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.730
 many strips ok in the middle part what 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.620
 what we are going to do is now cotton 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.870
 let's fill our felt strip 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.620
 with cotton very well if it's good what 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.030
 we leave so you do not get so thick 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.070
 If you have a fill, have a 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.720
 little volume and hold us is not 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.090
 know that those are going to be the ones that are going to 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.650
 go like that by forming many exact strips 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.800
 those are our strips here the only thing 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.360
 what we are going to do is staple ok 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.540
 since we have in the center part 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.150
 our cotton so many staples 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.460
 depending on a felt 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.280
 I already have a stack stapled here 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.350
 there we make good it is very simple what 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.800
 only thing that we are going to do because it is the same 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.619
 go placing one after another look that if 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.180
 we help them to wait we throw that yes 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.070
 look at it with your three fingers or the six 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.720
 centimeters so that in identical everything 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.530
 it is exactly here you have to stay 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.930
 exactly the same 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.030
 here what they do as two others 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.429
 so that they stay as very tight 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.020
 and the rings that are not raised is 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.000
 important there is no one to burn a 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.590
 little pressure and so they can 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.480
 introduce the rings and do not stay 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.860
 watered down they go down this is very 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.330
 important because remember that always 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.250
 we end up putting the same rings 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.750
 which are the ones that give the most 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.520
 down a box that we have adapted 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.620
 never level or what we see them but the 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.450
 idea is to see our rings already 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.950
 it will be something like this that your expertise 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.770
 nothing else what you're going to do is fit 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.930
 Video ring and slowly not be 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.590
 incredible is very simple to do is 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.150
 a real professional nanny key to 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.620
 that you can have access to all 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.620
 your jewels open at the end
