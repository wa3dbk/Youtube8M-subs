00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 this cosmetics brand has a great 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.040
 variety of products and the best thing is that 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.200
 are inexpensive products and one 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.160
 acceptable quality 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.809
 I bought these products locally and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.439
 in the information box I left you 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.770
 a direct entry to my blog where 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.970
 he detailed the prices of the ingredients 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.519
 some photos of the products 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.790
 Most of the products you buy 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.149
 are from the flawless line and how can 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.870
 see in the base color tank is perfect 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.870
 for me it is quite creamy and covering 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.490
 something that has this base in favor is that 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.280
 it's more of working and also on the skin 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:57.149
 It looks pretty and juicy 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:01.430
 something that I also liked is that I do not know 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.430
 feel on the skin is quite light 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.729
 As you can see, it's too juicy for me 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.490
 taste but I'll let it settle 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.640
 okay for a few minutes 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.229
 the proofreaders that I chose are these two 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.960
 which is the beige and the buff the burj is the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.860
 that I am placing in my lacrimal to 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.350
 illuminate under my eyes and then 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.679
 I used the beige to hide some 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.520
 imperfections since it is the same tone 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.130
 of my skin 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.799
 these proofreaders are too 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.189
 too greasy and tend to run 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.409
 which I did not like but they are creamy and 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.729
 easy to work I think for the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.000
 dry skin are ideal now I'm going to 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.330
 use these powders the first thing I'm going 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.959
 to use is the natural something that has this 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.479
 powder is that it is really powders or it 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:03.289
 scattered everywhere and it's something that 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.289
 does not finish convincing me 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.539
 but at least it works pretty well 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.819
 how much to massify refers and leaves a 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.819
 pretty nice finish on the skin 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.220
 like bronzer use the color 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.030
 chesnutt is also a powder for the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.209
 face of the flawless line and these 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.019
 darker tones than the natural one that 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.019
 use previously as blusher 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:36.980
 I'm using this milan browser and 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.349
 it's the radiant 0-3 that I love the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.540
 Result in the skin is extremely 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.239
 beautiful I'm really surprised with 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.260
 these products on my lips I opted for 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:52.640
 a red matte color of the sensation before 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.530
 my friends look good my hope that this 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.069
