00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.300
 although it is usual 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.550
 well apparently it's going to update the 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.550
 easy system that this takes a while 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.970
 nothing else 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.970

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.690
 good and continue a little longer with a 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.710
 a second part of the weight 'though 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.710
