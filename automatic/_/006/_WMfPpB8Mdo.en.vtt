blocked off and GTA online they won't
open<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.760> some<00:00:38.910> reason<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.870> get

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
open for some reason so you have to get

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.490 
open for some reason so you have to get
in<00:00:40.620> there<00:00:40.800> somehow<00:00:41.360> there<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.540> two<00:00:42.899> known

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
in there somehow there is two known

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.729 
in there somehow there is two known
methods<00:00:44.219> which<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.210> obviously<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.289> first

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
methods which is obviously this first

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100 
methods which is obviously this first
direct<00:00:47.160> method<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.450> flying<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
direct method of just flying a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.490 
direct method of just flying a
helicopter<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> jumping<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
helicopter in and jumping out and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.189 
helicopter in and jumping out and
there's<00:00:52.500> another<00:00:52.980> method<00:00:53.520> which<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.600> just

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
there's another method which is just

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.000 
there's another method which is just
jumping<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.770> truck<00:00:55.800> over<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.430> fence<00:00:56.699> and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
jumping a truck over the fence and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.189 
jumping a truck over the fence and
getting<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.309> way<00:00:59.520> I<00:01:00.090> prefer<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.140> method

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
getting in that way I prefer this method

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.060 
getting in that way I prefer this method
um<00:01:02.329> because<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.390> easier<00:01:03.960> than<00:01:04.530> jumping<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
um because it's easier than jumping the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.370 
um because it's easier than jumping the
truck<00:01:05.250> over<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> fence<00:01:06.299> because<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
truck over the fence because you have to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.340 
truck over the fence because you have to
avoid<00:01:07.920> tanks<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.240> there<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> third<00:01:10.049> method

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
avoid tanks but there is a third method

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.289 
avoid tanks but there is a third method
not<00:01:10.770> many<00:01:11.040> people<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:11.610> about<00:01:11.790> which<00:01:12.150> I'm

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
not many people know about which I'm

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.440 
not many people know about which I'm
going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.570> explaining<00:01:13.170> today<00:01:13.439> which<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.450> at

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
going to be explaining today which is at

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.450 
going to be explaining today which is at
times<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.470> risky<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.369> going

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
times it can be risky but you're going

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.149 
times it can be risky but you're going
to<00:01:17.580> die<00:01:17.820> pretty<00:01:18.180> much<00:01:18.680> unsafe<00:01:19.680> three<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to die pretty much unsafe three out of

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.710 
to die pretty much unsafe three out of
five<00:01:20.430> times<00:01:20.729> trying<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.390> anyhow<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.720> yeah

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
five times trying this anyhow so yeah

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.620 
five times trying this anyhow so yeah
obviously<00:01:25.500> which<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.799> want<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.460> just

obviously which we want to do is just
fly<00:01:27.630> into<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> base<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> low<00:01:29.659> Jess<00:01:30.659> will

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
fly into the base kind of low Jess will

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.980 
fly into the base kind of low Jess will
spawn<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.650> here<00:01:32.189> right<00:01:32.970> across<00:01:33.090> next<00:01:33.900> as

point<00:02:22.090> with<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.950> all<00:02:23.950> right<00:02:24.129> so<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.300> method

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
point with it all right so the method

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
point with it all right so the method
not<00:02:25.959> many<00:02:26.140> people<00:02:26.500> know<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.950> I'm<00:02:27.640> getting<00:02:28.480> in

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
not many people know is I'm getting in

not many people know is I'm getting in
over<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.069> fence<00:02:30.690> now<00:02:31.690> if<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.049> just<00:02:32.200> go<00:02:32.290> to

over the fence now if you just go to
this<00:02:32.500> road<00:02:32.799> there<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.519> truck<00:02:33.879> that<00:02:34.660> usually

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
this road there is a truck that usually

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.690 
this road there is a truck that usually
it's<00:02:35.230> either<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:35.590> truck<00:02:35.890> or<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.129> sand<00:02:36.430> King

it's either this truck or the sand King
that<00:02:37.090> spawn<00:02:37.360> up<00:02:37.510> there<00:02:37.690> which<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:37.959> good<00:02:38.140> for

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
that spawn up there which is good for

basically<00:02:55.840> it's<00:02:56.019> going<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.230> use<00:02:56.319> it<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.500> jump

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
basically it's going to use it to jump

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.479 
basically it's going to use it to jump
up<00:02:57.190> into<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.879> base<00:03:01.799> now<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:02.860> want<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.220> try<00:03:03.400> and

up into the base now you want to try and

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.069 
up into the base now you want to try and
get<00:03:03.610> as<00:03:03.700> close<00:03:03.819> as<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.150> can<00:03:04.390> because<00:03:04.660> if<00:03:04.959> you

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
get as close as you can because if you

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.110 
get as close as you can because if you
don't<00:03:05.379> you'll<00:03:05.769> see<00:03:06.010> your<00:03:06.280> character<00:03:06.849> will<00:03:06.879> do

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
don't you'll see your character will do

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.410 
don't you'll see your character will do
a<00:03:07.180> retarded<00:03:07.780> spin<00:03:08.709> fall<00:03:09.010> thing<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.700> maybe

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
a retarded spin fall thing and maybe

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.660 
a retarded spin fall thing and maybe
wait<00:03:10.720> 10<00:03:10.930> seconds<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.680> regain<00:03:12.040> consciousness

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
wait 10 seconds to regain consciousness

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.490 
wait 10 seconds to regain consciousness
or<00:03:12.849> whatever<00:03:15.420> now<00:03:16.420> once<00:03:16.630> you're<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:16.930> you're

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
going to want to climb up that box right

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.009 
going to want to climb up that box right
there<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.480> they<00:03:19.540> get<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.900> roof<00:03:21.600> now<00:03:22.600> like

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
there and they get to the roof now like

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.559 
there and they get to the roof now like
I<00:03:23.230> said<00:03:23.260> this<00:03:23.590> might<00:03:23.829> be<00:03:24.100> risky<00:03:24.730> for<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.329> if

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
I said this might be risky for you if

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.789 
I said this might be risky for you if
you<00:03:25.690> don't<00:03:25.900> know<00:03:25.989> what<00:03:26.139> you're<00:03:26.319> doing<00:03:26.620> but

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
you don't know what you're doing but

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.620 
you don't know what you're doing but
after<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.130> couple<00:03:27.280> tries<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:27.970> should<00:03:28.269> get<00:03:28.510> it

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
after a couple tries you should get it

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.620 
after a couple tries you should get it
pretty<00:03:28.930> easily<00:03:29.700> just<00:03:30.700> keep<00:03:30.970> climbing<00:03:31.209> up<00:03:31.480> the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
pretty easily just keep climbing up the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.970 
pretty easily just keep climbing up the
roof<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.139> then<00:03:32.290> jump<00:03:32.560> down<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.769> other<00:03:32.950> side

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
roof and then jump down the other side

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.530 
roof and then jump down the other side
and<00:03:33.519> then<00:03:33.700> you're<00:03:33.880> going<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.030> want<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.359> make<00:03:34.510> a

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
and then you're going to want to make a

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.199 
and then you're going to want to make a
mad<00:03:34.870> dash<00:03:34.900> for<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.799> airplane<00:03:36.459> which<00:03:36.790> will<00:03:37.060> be

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
mad dash for the airplane which will be

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.349 
mad dash for the airplane which will be
straight<00:03:37.540> ahead<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.430> but<00:03:39.430> again<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:40.299> is

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
straight ahead of you but again this is

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.940 
straight ahead of you but again this is
risky<00:03:40.900> because<00:03:41.019> you<00:03:41.290> do<00:03:41.410> have<00:03:41.440> to<00:03:41.680> make<00:03:41.709> it

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
risky because you do have to make it

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.819 
risky because you do have to make it
across<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.250> whole<00:03:42.579> entire<00:03:42.880> runway<00:03:43.359> while

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829
