ceiling without using tape so let's use

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.370 
ceiling without using tape so let's use
the<00:04:37.220> same<00:04:37.250> cutting<00:04:38.120> in<00:04:38.240> technique<00:04:38.630> as<00:04:39.140> I

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
the same cutting in technique as I

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.190 
the same cutting in technique as I
showed<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:39.710> earlier<00:04:40.570> we<00:04:41.570> just<00:04:41.600> push<00:04:42.020> the

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
bristles and to where you the line to be

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.400 
bristles and to where you the line to be
and<00:04:48.850> as<00:04:49.850> long<00:04:50.000> as<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.210> don't<00:04:50.330> go<00:04:50.510> up<00:04:50.720> past<00:04:51.140> that

and as long as you don't go up past that

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.280 
and as long as you don't go up past that
crack<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:52.240> lay<00:04:53.240> this<00:04:53.390> out<00:04:53.600> so<00:04:53.780> it<00:04:53.930> doesn't

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
crack you lay this out so it doesn't

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.920 
crack you lay this out so it doesn't
drip<00:04:54.530> on<00:04:54.770> you<00:04:57.490> see<00:04:58.490> that<00:04:58.700> line<00:04:58.910> in<00:04:59.060> there<00:04:59.240> let's

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
drip on you see that line in there let's

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.790
