00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.760
 It was a high game 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.590
 conditioned by what the camp was 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.840
 where an Avellino team to which 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.060
 I make the sincere congratulations because he has 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.449
 really played a great team has 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.949
 known to interpret very well below 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.210
 the aspect of aggression but also 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.269
 under the technical aspect 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.039
 so today we really got it 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.879
 a result in front of a team 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.640
 that I didn't really think he had all 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.320
 these qualities and we got it at 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.739
 ninety-first but you know very well that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.239
 means little in football matches 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.300
 they really finish and last 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.789
 seconds also in the day lian e 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.249
 so many games have changed in the last ones 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.620
 minutes, however, the reaction and the desire 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:55.469
 however not to succumb and it was not 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 easy led us to a draw that 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.839
 all in all I think we also have 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.710
 deserved 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.129
 mister 6 defeats behind under 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.649
 a goal 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.780
 ninetieth expired what he thought into 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.570
 I'm not sorry for that moment 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.610
 boys because with so many errors e 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.740
 many interpretations, perhaps incorrect 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.689
 we had created all that doesn't care 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.850
 the last thing I could tell him that not 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.800
 they would have not given the soul 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.580
 and clear that in this category 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.070
 in these fields and with the burden of being 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.890
 a pescara player and also the honor 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.840
 I add 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.300
 more needs to be done and it is not easy 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.270
 gives from so many negative results e 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.520
 to react is what I wanted in short 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.980
 so the team will be there now 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.930
 another week to work 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.260
 however, I believe it is seen for good or for 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.700
 bad things I wanted to see 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.620
 team appeared very focused 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.720
 in the defensive phase 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.790
 in the offensive aspect maybe not 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.530
 he could expect more 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.670
 well it is concentrated even if we then 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.610
 immediately a goal obviously where there is a 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.170
 error but rather they are a couple of errors and 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.119
 also other situations, however, today 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.730
 really brings out the qualities 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.100
 instead of the strikers of the fool 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.900
 re and midfielders ie not one 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.820
 team that throws the ball forward but 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.100
 the moment the mind has forward 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.400
 technical players that the room abio 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.540
 mystical and know how to put it in spaces e 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.760
 so it was not easy for the defenders 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.860
 then consider ragusa the fifth 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.300
 it is not really a fifth salviato ri 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.200
 he played after a while 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.750
 expulsion is in love is one is that 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.700
 I want an attacking them 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.980
 that is knowing how to propose oneself in attack though 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.750
 also help the team did it e 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.280
 caprari then entered the manner 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.900
 just short of the neck also 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.320
 the ball that had taken a few minutes 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.290
 first shows that behind are behind 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.760
 like those of those he played 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.740
 today they are truly players 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.990
 very interesting young people from the point of 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.850
 psychological view how much this is worth 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.210
 point much much more than what 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.870
 you can think of why he is giving us back 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.380
 courage gives us awareness in the of 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.870
 what will be our league and 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.380
 then obtained so it makes you understand 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.120
 I repeat if kids are smart 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.670
 that to get even the minimum 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.800
 result must really give give everything 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.450
 in the field what the fans want is 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.550
 what the fans rightly want 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.920
 wants the company and that's what 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.860
 I promised and to the company and fans and 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.140
 this is what they will see from the first 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.480
 last day in which they were more 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.180
 skara therefore satisfied with this 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.920
 starting position but I mean 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.750
 clear that we say that in percentages has 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.570
 played at 40 percent of what I would like 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.270
 that played me though is also true that 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.130
 we played in an impossible field against 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.989
 a great opponent then holding on 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.200
 I consider these two things 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.030
 I only conclude Brugman's play on 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.340
 goal shows that a field game 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.540
 dry and therefore it is clear that in certain 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.550
 situations most likely 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.220
 we succeed 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.840
 I use the conditional to express better 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.560
 more than what we have 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.560
 expressed today
