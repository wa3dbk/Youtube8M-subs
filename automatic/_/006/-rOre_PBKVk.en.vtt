00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.240
 Focus on the US Federation 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.850
 For the backpack 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.109
 It is a picture function check 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.719
 The original manual is attached, too 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.490
 Since there is also firmly after that, other functions quite well 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.880
 There is a Japanese manual and whether it corresponds to the residents of 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.539
 I'm surprised I've been with it, but I'm done 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.310
 For example, do you use that item of wear? 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.229
 later 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:32.679
 Completely of high school students 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:37.249
 Motor proof thermal overload with four cases rice 

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:39.200
 In a form that takes care 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.540
 This time 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.900
 I think I'm going to make a rooster boat 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.600
 Continue the soil with a high sensitivity scoop 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.540
 So take this one too 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.250
 It is a mask which removes in such a stoppage area and light control vertical 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.700
 Put this on 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 It looks like the ninth 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.420
 Just do 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.410
 In this 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.410
 High singlet 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.290
 New 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.840
 The city is always small Hasuzu Town Small 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.150
 It feels like it's hot and heavy today, but 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.150
 Pendin reduction 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.940
 I can say 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.940
 Usually the screen looks like this 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.510
 When you press the Yokoo button 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.440
 This is the main screen playback 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 I can not use it so bd 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.600
 Know 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 Hands for example 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.770
 I'm sure I think 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.880
 It's like taking a picture like this in Tsurumitsu 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.880
 The tongue is fat but it is accompanied by 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.230
 I will have a speaker in the afternoon on the note model 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.680
 But say 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.720
 If you know the fast-forwarding machine with kanji 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.589
 Bathed in light 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.499
 It is a capital city 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.499
 This is only this fast forward like this 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.239
 I want to try scrolls when doing picture scroll work 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.399
 I'm looking into it individually as I like 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.749
 Though it has been m1 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:42.449
 I think that it will be a good Honda with a speaker and dwind 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:47.459
 Joining too 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.459
 Can be adjusted 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.559
 The next screen foot is spread out 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:56.559
 When you use the next ad, the screen 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.009
 It is said that it is regenerated 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.329
 That lcd 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.339
 I have a backpack and I'm ready even if the terrain is open 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:09.229
 I feel like Shibata city
