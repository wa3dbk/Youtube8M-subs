there<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.829> enough<00:01:44.250> difference<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.149> know

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
there is enough difference to you know

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.539 
there is enough difference to you know
have<00:01:45.600> separate<00:01:46.170> ones<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.009> attention<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
have separate ones but the attention to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.600 
have separate ones but the attention to
detail<00:01:48.079> is<00:01:49.079> amazing<00:01:49.439> because<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
detail is amazing because the the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.160 
detail is amazing because the the
variation<00:01:51.210> between<00:01:51.240> these<00:01:51.600> two<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.869> really

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
variation between these two is really

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.929 
variation between these two is really
just<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.470> slight<00:01:52.740> movement<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.220> one<00:01:53.399> finger<00:01:53.790> and

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
just a slight movement of one finger and

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
just a slight movement of one finger and
this<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.630> little<00:01:54.869> more<00:01:55.020> closed<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.710> like

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
this was a little more closed up like

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.950 
this was a little more closed up like
the<00:01:56.070> hands<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.939> are<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.270> here

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the hands that are on here

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.569 
the hands that are on here
the<00:01:58.409> ones<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.770> comes<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.250> not<00:01:59.430> as

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the ones that it comes with but not as

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.880 
the ones that it comes with but not as
closed<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.960> figure<00:02:01.229> itself<00:02:01.500> at<00:02:01.710> three

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
closed up so the figure itself at three

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.130 
closed up so the figure itself at three
three<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.280> three-quarter<00:02:02.579> inch<00:02:02.850> scale<00:02:03.140> will

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
three and three-quarter inch scale will

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.399 
three and three-quarter inch scale will
pop<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.469> off<00:02:04.560> right<00:02:04.770> here<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.869> PVC

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
pop it off right here it's a like PVC

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.279 
pop it off right here it's a like PVC
it's<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.310> PVC<00:02:08.640> figure<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.479> has<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.989> wire

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
it's a PVC figure and it has a wire

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.500 
it's a PVC figure and it has a wire
bendy<00:02:10.830> tail<00:02:11.039> which<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.640> put<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.090> way<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.330> it

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
bendy tail which I put this way so it

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.760 
bendy tail which I put this way so it
stands<00:02:12.810> up<00:02:12.989> on<00:02:13.080> its<00:02:13.230> own

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
stands up on its own

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.100 
stands up on its own
and<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.790> think<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.450> first<00:02:15.630> thing<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.870> should<00:02:16.020> do

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and I think the first thing we should do

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.470 
and I think the first thing we should do
is<00:02:16.230> really<00:02:16.470> check<00:02:17.460> out<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.700> articulation<00:02:18.360> and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
is really check out the articulation and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.180 
is really check out the articulation and
then<00:02:18.570> look<00:02:18.990> into<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.380> detail<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.980> figure

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
then look into the detail of the figure

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.700 
then look into the detail of the figure
so<00:02:20.370> we'll<00:02:20.580> start<00:02:20.760> with<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.000> head<00:02:21.500> here<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.590> is

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
so we'll start with the head here it is

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.410 
so we'll start with the head here it is
on<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> ball-joint<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.790> like<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.090> which<00:02:24.300> is

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
on a ball-joint just like that which is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.570 
on a ball-joint just like that which is
a<00:02:24.450> pretty<00:02:24.780> good<00:02:24.870> amount<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.290> articulation<00:02:26.010> we

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
a pretty good amount of articulation we

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.310 
a pretty good amount of articulation we
have<00:02:26.790> these<00:02:27.030> shoulders<00:02:27.480> here<00:02:27.720> up<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.230> down

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
have these shoulders here up and down

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.890 
have these shoulders here up and down
this<00:02:28.560> way<00:02:28.800> they<00:02:29.010> move<00:02:29.220> forward<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.760> arms<00:02:29.970> you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
this way they move forward the arms you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.260 
this way they move forward the arms you
actually<00:02:31.230> get<00:02:31.380> elbows<00:02:31.770> as<00:02:32.010> thin<00:02:32.580> as<00:02:32.790> these

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
actually get elbows as thin as these

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.750 
actually get elbows as thin as these
arms<00:02:33.660> are<00:02:33.900> they<00:02:34.500> do<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.920> articulation<00:02:35.550> in

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
arms are they do have articulation in

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.420 
arms are they do have articulation in
the<00:02:35.850> elbow<00:02:36.150> here<00:02:36.390> which<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.720> very<00:02:37.020> nice<00:02:37.470> for

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
the elbow here which is very nice for

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.950 
the elbow here which is very nice for
something<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.820> looks<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.150> delicate<00:02:39.360> and

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
something that looks so delicate and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.390 
something that looks so delicate and
then<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.320> course<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.950> wrists<00:02:41.250> here

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
then of course you have the wrists here

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.090 
then of course you have the wrists here
with<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.640> hands<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.720> do<00:02:43.170> have<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.650> upper

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
with the hands you do have the upper

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.610 
with the hands you do have the upper
chest<00:02:44.820> here<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.290> ball

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
chest here then you have the ball

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.830 
chest here then you have the ball
jointed<00:02:47.070> hips<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.120> ball<00:02:48.330> jointed<00:02:48.660> hips

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
jointed hips and the ball jointed hips

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.170 
jointed hips and the ball jointed hips
they<00:02:48.990> do<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.380> swivel<00:02:49.860> here<00:02:50.640> which<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.000> can

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
they do have a swivel here which you can

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.840 
they do have a swivel here which you can
actually<00:02:51.360> rotate<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:53.190> know<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.580> your

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
actually rotate in you know to your

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.420 
actually rotate in you know to your
desired<00:02:54.210> effect<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.220> knees

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
desired effect and we have the knees

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.720 
desired effect and we have the knees
here<00:02:56.820> also<00:02:57.620> all<00:02:58.620> right

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
here also all right

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.360 
here also all right
and<00:02:59.910> we<00:03:00.330> have<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.870> section<00:03:01.500> here<00:03:01.710> which<00:03:02.010> also

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
and we have this section here which also

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.720 
and we have this section here which also
spins<00:03:02.760> on<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.090> top<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.780> ankle<00:03:04.200> here<00:03:04.740> which

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
spins on the top of the ankle here which

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.070 
spins on the top of the ankle here which
is<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.000> only<00:03:06.120> movement<00:03:06.510> you'll<00:03:06.600> get<00:03:06.810> for<00:03:07.020> the

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
is the only movement you'll get for the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.260 
is the only movement you'll get for the
foot<00:03:07.320> there<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.680> seems<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.220> be<00:03:08.820> able<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.060> go

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
foot there and it seems to be able to go

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.970 
foot there and it seems to be able to go
forward<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:09.750> way<00:03:09.960> also<00:03:10.350> which<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.710> nice

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
forward this way also which is a nice

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.010 
forward this way also which is a nice
touch<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.910> detail<00:03:12.240> next<00:03:12.630> thing<00:03:12.780> we<00:03:12.840> got<00:03:12.870> to

is<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.460> honest<00:03:23.760> it's<00:03:23.940> like<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.060> mix<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.660> green

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
is to be honest it's like a mix of green

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.500 
is to be honest it's like a mix of green
and<00:03:25.110> brown<00:03:25.320> light<00:03:25.800> brown<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.490> it's<00:03:27.240> got<00:03:27.360> these

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
and brown light brown and it's got these

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.320 
and brown light brown and it's got these
sections<00:03:28.350> where<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.650> seems<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.150> some<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.270> the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
sections where it seems like some of the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.570 
sections where it seems like some of the
flesh<00:03:30.600> is<00:03:30.780> just<00:03:30.960> bulging<00:03:31.470> out<00:03:31.650> like<00:03:32.400> right

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
flesh is just bulging out like right

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.580 
flesh is just bulging out like right
back<00:03:32.760> here<00:03:33.120> almost<00:03:33.480> as<00:03:33.720> if<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.960> skin<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.320> just

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
back here almost as if the skin is just

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.890 
back here almost as if the skin is just
broken<00:03:35.070> through<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.520> it's<00:03:35.720> it's<00:03:36.720> not

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
broken through and it's it's not

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.480 
broken through and it's it's not
