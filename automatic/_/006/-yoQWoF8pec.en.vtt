dog fur lined campus so our options were
to<00:01:43.240> take<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.600> elevator<00:01:43.960> in<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.170> stairs<00:01:44.440> we

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
to take the elevator in the stairs we

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.560 
to take the elevator in the stairs we
thought<00:01:45.010> we'd<00:01:45.190> give<00:01:45.370> the<00:01:45.490> stairs<00:01:45.730> at<00:01:45.850> ride<00:01:46.060> and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
thought we'd give the stairs at ride and

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.240 
thought we'd give the stairs at ride and
now<00:01:47.440> go

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.770 

once<00:01:53.250> we<00:01:53.400> reached<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.790> boarding<00:01:54.090> area<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.600> had

once we reached the boarding area we had

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.570 
once we reached the boarding area we had
a<00:01:54.810> little<00:01:55.170> bit<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.500> wait<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:55.890> our<00:01:56.010> train<00:01:56.310> and

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
a little bit of a wait for our train and

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.730 
a little bit of a wait for our train and
I<00:01:56.940> decided<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.510> keep<00:01:57.630> peel<00:01:57.870> off<00:01:58.050> as<00:01:58.230> far<00:01:58.620> away

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
I decided to keep peel off as far away

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.470 
I decided to keep peel off as far away
from<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.100> track<00:01:59.310> as<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.640> possibly<00:01:59.820> could<00:02:00.270> and

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
from the track as I possibly could and

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.600 
from the track as I possibly could and
we<00:02:00.780> found<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.110> place<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.530> sit<00:02:01.710> now<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.310> board

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
basically get comfortable with the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.990 
basically get comfortable with the
surroundings<00:03:15.890> of<00:03:16.010> being<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.640> station<00:03:16.970> like

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
surroundings of being in a station like

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.300 
surroundings of being in a station like
this<00:03:17.150> one<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:18.410> we<00:03:18.530> thought<00:03:18.709> watching<00:03:19.099> a<00:03:19.190> train

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
this one so we thought watching a train

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.129 
this one so we thought watching a train
or<00:03:19.430> two<00:03:19.670> wouldn't<00:03:19.940> be<00:03:20.150> such<00:03:20.359> a<00:03:20.389> big<00:03:20.630> deal<00:03:20.690> and

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
or two wouldn't be such a big deal and

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.809 
or two wouldn't be such a big deal and
then<00:03:21.470> when<00:03:21.650> we<00:03:21.769> were<00:03:21.859> ready<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.190> go<00:03:22.430> we<00:03:22.609> hopped

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
then when we were ready to go we hopped

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.640 
then when we were ready to go we hopped
on<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.000> train<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.480> headed<00:03:23.930> back<00:03:23.959> home<00:03:24.290> this

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
on a train and headed back home this

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.170 
on a train and headed back home this
turned<00:03:24.859> out<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.100> be<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.220> pretty<00:03:25.430> good<00:03:25.790> trip<00:03:25.970> for

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
turned out to be a pretty good trip for

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.970 
turned out to be a pretty good trip for
pilaf<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.690> maybe<00:03:26.989> next<00:03:27.170> time<00:03:27.440> we'll<00:03:27.560> go<00:03:27.709> for<00:03:27.920> a

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
pilaf and maybe next time we'll go for a

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.770 
pilaf and maybe next time we'll go for a
little<00:03:28.220> bit<00:03:28.400> longer<00:03:28.639> trip<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.269> we<00:03:29.450> don't<00:03:29.660> want
