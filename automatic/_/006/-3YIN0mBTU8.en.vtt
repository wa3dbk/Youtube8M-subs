00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
discovery that I found not sure if I'm

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.350 
discovery that I found not sure if I'm
the<00:00:06.839> first<00:00:07.080> one<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.350> see<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:07.710> or<00:00:07.890> not<00:00:08.069> but

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
either way it is a great thing to know

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.900 
either way it is a great thing to know
everyone<00:00:13.559> knows<00:00:13.799> about<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.309> spread<00:00:14.580> players

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
everyone knows about the spread players

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.430 
everyone knows about the spread players
command<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.509> if<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.690> don't<00:00:15.900> know<00:00:16.080> then<00:00:16.350> you

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
command and if you don't know then you

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.620 
command and if you don't know then you
should<00:00:16.680> know<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:17.670> used<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.180> lot<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.359> mini

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
should know it's used in a lot of mini

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.910 
should know it's used in a lot of mini
games<00:00:18.810> mainly<00:00:19.710> for<00:00:20.640> for<00:00:21.630> games<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.680> mind

cracks<00:00:23.250> UHC<00:00:24.710> it<00:00:25.710> basically<00:00:26.279> spreads<00:00:26.730> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
cracks UHC it basically spreads the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.540 
cracks UHC it basically spreads the
players<00:00:27.150> throughout<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.019> world<00:00:28.230> into<00:00:29.039> random

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
players throughout the world into random

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.799 
players throughout the world into random
locations<00:00:31.669> it<00:00:32.669> also<00:00:32.880> has<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.360> ability<00:00:33.780> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
locations it also has the ability to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.560 
locations it also has the ability to
keep<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.829> teams<00:00:35.130> together<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:35.969> everybody

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
keep the teams together so if everybody

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.229 
keep the teams together so if everybody
spread<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.770> teams<00:00:38.129> will<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.460> spread<00:00:39.000> out

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
spread out the teams will be spread out

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.950 
spread out the teams will be spread out
but<00:00:39.540> stay<00:00:39.840> together<00:00:40.399> if<00:00:41.540> that<00:00:42.540> makes<00:00:42.750> any

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
but stay together if that makes any

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.660 
but stay together if that makes any
sense

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
sense

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.529 
sense
but<00:00:44.870> with<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.110> new<00:00:46.350> IP<00:00:47.059> selector<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.090> came

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
but with the new IP selector that came

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.279 
but with the new IP selector that came
out<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> 1.8<00:00:49.620> snapshots<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:51.230> kind<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
out for the 1.8 snapshots I kind of

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.049 
out for the 1.8 snapshots I kind of
wanted<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> test<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.100> out<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.399> see<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.789> can

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
wanted to test it out and see if we can

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.500 
wanted to test it out and see if we can
use<00:00:54.239> spread<00:00:54.629> players<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.510> attribute

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
use spread players with the a attribute

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.110 
use spread players with the a attribute
or<00:00:57.750> selecting<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:59.039> let<00:00:59.190> me<00:00:59.280> go<00:00:59.460> ahead<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.910> get

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
or selecting so let me go ahead and get

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.580 
or selecting so let me go ahead and get
some<00:01:00.359> mobs<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.109> got

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
some mobs here I got

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.189 
some mobs here I got
let's<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.730> some<00:01:02.940> pigs<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.480> cows<00:01:03.809> why

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
let's just get some pigs and cows why

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.840 
let's just get some pigs and cows why
not<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:06.170> there<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.290> go<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.860> pigs<00:01:08.430> there's

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
not so there we go some pigs there's

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.270 
not so there we go some pigs there's
some<00:01:09.030> cows<00:01:10.130> awesome

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
some cows awesome

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.050 
some cows awesome
now<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.540> command<00:01:13.020> block<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.939> spreading<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
now this command block is spreading the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.030 
now this command block is spreading the
place<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.540> spread<00:01:15.960> players<00:01:16.229> from<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
place so spread players from the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.260 
place so spread players from the
coordinate<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> center<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.000> that

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
coordinate in the center of that

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.580 
coordinate in the center of that
platform<00:01:20.689> 26<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:22.320> 7<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.460> um<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:24.590> can

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
platform 26 to 7 that's just um I can

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.760 
platform 26 to 7 that's just um I can
actually<00:01:25.860> set<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.400> 9<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> think

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.190 

so<00:01:30.770> it's<00:01:31.070> spreading<00:01:31.640> them<00:01:31.790> either<00:01:32.120> two<00:01:32.750> blocks

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
so it's spreading them either two blocks

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.800 
so it's spreading them either two blocks
away<00:01:33.410> or<00:01:33.770> nine<00:01:34.070> blocks<00:01:34.370> away<00:01:34.520> from<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.510> entire

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
away or nine blocks away from the entire

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.760 
away or nine blocks away from the entire
area<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.380> it's<00:01:36.590> just<00:01:36.860> doing<00:01:37.100> at<00:01:37.490> E<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:39.440> type

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
area and it's just doing at E the type

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.350 
area and it's just doing at E the type
equals<00:01:40.430> not<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.760> player

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
equals not a player

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.190 
equals not a player
so<00:01:41.960> this<00:01:42.620> false<00:01:42.980> that's<00:01:43.520> just<00:01:43.940> saying<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:45.020> keep

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
so this false that's just saying to keep

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.930 
so this false that's just saying to keep
the<00:01:45.350> teams<00:01:45.560> together<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.130> right<00:01:46.310> now<00:01:46.550> it

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
the teams together so right now it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.350 
the teams together so right now it
should<00:01:47.810> spread<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.710> players<00:01:49.360> separately

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
should spread the players separately

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.670 
should spread the players separately
throughout<00:01:50.720> this<00:01:50.870> entire<00:01:51.080> arena<00:01:51.820> there<00:01:52.820> we<00:01:52.910> go

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
throughout this entire arena there we go

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.180 
throughout this entire arena there we go
random<00:01:54.680> positions<00:01:55.250> all<00:01:55.490> over<00:01:55.850> pretty<00:01:56.150> cool

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
random positions all over pretty cool

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.980 
random positions all over pretty cool
now<00:01:58.660> what<00:01:59.660> if<00:01:59.780> I<00:01:59.960> make<00:02:00.230> it<00:02:00.410> so<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:01.100> teams<00:02:01.430> are

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
now what if I make it so the teams are

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.070 
now what if I make it so the teams are
true<00:02:04.180> now<00:02:05.180> this<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:05.480> where<00:02:05.660> things<00:02:05.810> get

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
true now this is where things get

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.760 
true now this is where things get
interesting

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.080 

apparently<00:02:10.420> mobs<00:02:11.420> are<00:02:12.040> all<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> same<00:02:13.460> team

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
apparently mobs are all on the same team

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.050 
apparently mobs are all on the same team
even<00:02:14.570> if<00:02:14.690> I<00:02:14.810> don't<00:02:15.050> have<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.620> team<00:02:16.190> specified

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
even if I don't have a team specified

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.890 
even if I don't have a team specified
for<00:02:17.480> any<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.930> them<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.460> I<00:02:19.460> did<00:02:19.760> try<00:02:20.090> setting<00:02:20.600> a

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
for any of them and I did try setting a

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.380 
for any of them and I did try setting a
specific<00:02:21.500> team<00:02:21.770> let's<00:02:22.100> say<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.370> put<00:02:22.700> pigs<00:02:23.090> on<00:02:23.360> a

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
specific team let's say I put pigs on a

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.350 
specific team let's say I put pigs on a
pink<00:02:23.810> team<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.140> cows<00:02:24.800> on<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.070> brown<00:02:25.310> team<00:02:25.580> they

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
pink team and cows on a brown team they

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.390 
pink team and cows on a brown team they
were<00:02:26.420> still<00:02:26.810> put<00:02:27.620> together

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
were still put together

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.950 
were still put together
unfortunately<00:02:29.240> it'd<00:02:29.360> be<00:02:29.480> great<00:02:29.630> if<00:02:29.750> they

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
unfortunately it'd be great if they

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.390 
unfortunately it'd be great if they
weren't<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:32.000> that's<00:02:32.180> just<00:02:32.420> something<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.900> note

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
weren't so that's just something to note

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.560 
weren't so that's just something to note
now<00:02:34.400> over<00:02:34.910> here<00:02:35.480> spread<00:02:36.260> players<00:02:36.940> false<00:02:37.940> with

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
you can see right here it says type not

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.930 
you can see right here it says type not
player<00:02:43.880> this<00:02:44.120> one<00:02:44.360> just<00:02:44.690> says<00:02:45.080> at<00:02:45.950> E<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:46.700> I'm

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
player this one just says at E so I'm

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.660 
player this one just says at E so I'm
going<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.390> be<00:02:47.510> spread<00:02:47.870> with<00:02:48.860> them<00:02:49.340> they're

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
going to be spread with them they're

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.890 
going to be spread with them they're
gonna<00:02:49.790> be<00:02:49.940> spread<00:02:50.180> out<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:50.570> I'm<00:02:50.630> gonna<00:02:50.780> be

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
gonna be spread out and I'm gonna be

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.170 
gonna be spread out and I'm gonna be
spread<00:02:51.170> out<00:02:51.230> there<00:02:51.530> too<00:02:51.790> so<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.880> can<00:02:52.970> see

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
spread out there too so you can see

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.060 
spread out there too so you can see
we're<00:02:53.420> all<00:02:53.450> in<00:02:53.660> random<00:02:54.020> positions<00:02:54.170> pretty

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
we're all in random positions pretty

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.410 
we're all in random positions pretty
cool<00:02:55.660> let<00:02:56.660> me<00:02:56.750> do<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.020> again<00:02:58.420> random

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
cool let me do that again random

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.690 
cool let me do that again random
positions<00:03:00.020> now<00:03:00.580> now<00:03:02.290> what<00:03:03.290> if<00:03:03.410> we<00:03:03.770> set<00:03:04.550> the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
positions now now what if we set the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.670 
positions now now what if we set the
teams<00:03:05.030> back<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.959> true<00:03:06.380> without<00:03:08.590> taking<00:03:09.590> off

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
teams back to true without taking off

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.250 
teams back to true without taking off
the<00:03:09.860> player<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:10.550> is<00:03:10.730> including<00:03:11.360> me<00:03:11.390> the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the player so this is including me the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.080 
the player so this is including me the
player<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.910> team's

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
player and team's

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.520 
player and team's
equal<00:03:14.420> true<00:03:14.950> if<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:16.480> step<00:03:17.480> here

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
equal true if I step here

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.260 
equal true if I step here
it's<00:03:19.920> kind<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.220> tough<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.460> see<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.910> one<00:03:21.090> but

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
it's kind of tough to see that one but

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.820 
it's kind of tough to see that one but
they<00:03:21.540> all<00:03:21.840> get<00:03:22.230> put<00:03:22.440> together<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:24.050> I<00:03:25.050> am

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
they all get put together and I am

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.400 
they all get put together and I am
separated<00:03:26.820> from<00:03:27.030> them<00:03:27.300> let<00:03:27.870> me<00:03:27.960> see<00:03:28.110> if<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.260> can

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
separated from them let me see if I can

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.780 
separated from them let me see if I can
get<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.590> good<00:03:28.800> example<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:31.220> there<00:03:32.220> we<00:03:32.400> go

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
get a good example of this there we go

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.970 
get a good example of this there we go
so<00:03:33.390> in<00:03:33.540> order<00:03:33.660> for<00:03:33.840> me<00:03:33.990> to<00:03:34.080> get<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.350> good<00:03:34.590> example

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
so in order for me to get a good example

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.520 
so in order for me to get a good example
I<00:03:35.400> had<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.730> kind<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.090> play<00:03:37.080> with<00:03:37.110> the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
I had to kind of play with the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.800 
I had to kind of play with the
coordinates<00:03:38.070> so<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.370> set<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:38.940> six<00:03:39.420> seven

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
coordinates so I set this to six seven

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.410 
coordinates so I set this to six seven
rather<00:03:40.020> than<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.500> seven<00:03:40.890> but<00:03:41.520> if<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.880> stand<00:03:42.210> over

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
rather than to seven but if I stand over

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.940 
rather than to seven but if I stand over
here<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:42.690> can<00:03:42.810> see<00:03:42.990> they're<00:03:43.230> all<00:03:43.410> grouped<00:03:43.770> up

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
here you can see they're all grouped up

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.550 
here you can see they're all grouped up
in<00:03:44.130> that<00:03:44.310> spot<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.660> was<00:03:45.900> over<00:03:46.140> there<00:03:46.320> by

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
in that spot and I was over there by

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.220 
in that spot and I was over there by
myself<00:03:46.740> so<00:03:47.640> one<00:03:47.850> more<00:03:47.970> time<00:03:48.020> they're<00:03:49.020> all

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
myself so one more time they're all

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.080 
myself so one more time they're all
grouped<00:03:49.500> over<00:03:49.800> there<00:03:49.980> but<00:03:50.220> I'm<00:03:50.400> right<00:03:50.610> here

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
grouped over there but I'm right here

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.770 
grouped over there but I'm right here
so<00:03:51.900> apparently<00:03:52.230> mobs<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.460> players<00:03:53.790> according

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
so apparently mobs and players according

so apparently mobs and players according
to<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.110> game<00:03:55.290> are<00:03:55.560> on<00:03:55.770> separate<00:03:56.340> teams<00:03:56.580> even

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
to the game are on separate teams even

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.760 
to the game are on separate teams even
though<00:03:57.150> we<00:03:57.300> are<00:03:57.420> all<00:03:57.450> considered<00:03:58.260> entities

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
though we are all considered entities

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.520 
though we are all considered entities
now<00:03:59.610> some<00:04:00.180> people<00:04:00.300> might<00:04:00.660> want<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.959> know<00:04:01.110> okay

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
now some people might want to know okay

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.550 
now some people might want to know okay
well<00:04:01.740> if<00:04:02.120> all<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.600> peaceful<00:04:04.050> mobs<00:04:04.260> are<00:04:04.440> on

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
well if all of the peaceful mobs are on

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.860 
well if all of the peaceful mobs are on
teams<00:04:05.690> what<00:04:06.690> about<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.350> evil<00:04:08.190> angry<00:04:08.550> bad<00:04:09.540> mobs

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
teams what about the evil angry bad mobs

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.280 
teams what about the evil angry bad mobs
the<00:04:10.260> monsters<00:04:10.820> slash<00:04:11.820> times<00:04:12.240> set<00:04:13.970> 17,000<00:04:15.290> just

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
the monsters slash times set 17,000 just

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.300 
the monsters slash times set 17,000 just
so<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.590> these<00:04:16.739> zombies<00:04:17.310> won't<00:04:17.780> burn<00:04:18.780> up

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.870 

well<00:04:22.270> let's<00:04:22.570> see<00:04:22.900> if<00:04:23.139> if<00:04:23.380> they<00:04:23.980> are<00:04:24.130> all<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.700> the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
well let's see if if they are all on the

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.210 
well let's see if if they are all on the
same<00:04:24.910> team<00:04:25.210> then<00:04:26.200> they<00:04:26.380> will<00:04:26.530> all<00:04:26.680> be<00:04:26.860> put<00:04:27.100> in

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
same team then they will all be put in

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.850 
same team then they will all be put in
the<00:04:27.340> same<00:04:27.550> spot<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.120> if<00:04:28.210> they<00:04:28.389> are<00:04:28.540> not<00:04:28.870> then

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
the same spot and if they are not then

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.680 
the same spot and if they are not then
they<00:04:30.040> will<00:04:30.220> be<00:04:30.340> put<00:04:30.550> in<00:04:30.700> two<00:04:31.000> different<00:04:31.450> spots

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
they will be put in two different spots

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.580 
they will be put in two different spots
so<00:04:33.000> looks<00:04:34.000> like<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.330> same<00:04:34.570> spot<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.200> me

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
so looks like the same spot to me

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.580 
so looks like the same spot to me
so<00:04:36.580> unfortunately<00:04:37.389> every<00:04:37.930> single<00:04:38.350> type<00:04:38.560> of

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
so unfortunately every single type of

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.360 
so unfortunately every single type of
mob<00:04:39.010> is<00:04:39.310> on<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.330> same<00:04:40.630> team<00:04:41.080> now<00:04:41.800> it<00:04:42.070> would<00:04:42.340> be

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
mob is on the same team now it would be

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.050 
mob is on the same team now it would be
really<00:04:42.580> useful<00:04:43.169> if<00:04:44.169> they<00:04:44.980> did<00:04:45.220> implement<00:04:45.580> this

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
really useful if they did implement this

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.629 
really useful if they did implement this
so<00:04:46.419> that<00:04:46.600> let's<00:04:47.500> say<00:04:47.710> like<00:04:47.919> peaceful<00:04:48.400> mobs

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
so that let's say like peaceful mobs

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.490 
so that let's say like peaceful mobs
versus<00:04:49.470> angry<00:04:50.470> mobs<00:04:50.710> are<00:04:52.260> different<00:04:53.260> teams

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
versus angry mobs are different teams

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.650 
versus angry mobs are different teams
that'd<00:04:54.220> be<00:04:54.400> really<00:04:54.610> cool<00:04:54.910> or<00:04:55.090> if<00:04:55.300> you<00:04:55.480> can

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
that'd be really cool or if you can

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
that'd be really cool or if you can
specify<00:04:55.990> specific<00:04:56.350> teams<00:04:57.160> for<00:04:57.430> them<00:04:57.580> and<00:04:58.680> then

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
specify specific teams for them and then

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.170 
specify specific teams for them and then
they<00:04:59.830> can<00:05:00.010> be<00:05:00.160> spread<00:05:00.490> out<00:05:00.520> depending<00:05:01.060> on

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
they can be spread out depending on

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.550 
they can be spread out depending on
which<00:05:01.390> ones<00:05:01.630> are<00:05:01.780> on<00:05:01.900> which<00:05:02.110> team

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
which ones are on which team

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.190 
which ones are on which team
that'd<00:05:02.800> be<00:05:02.830> really<00:05:03.250> awesome<00:05:03.580> so<00:05:04.540> I<00:05:04.840> just

wanted to share this little discovery

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.990 
wanted to share this little discovery

like this and hopefully it does get

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.420 
like this and hopefully it does get
implemented<00:05:13.240> into<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.780> game<00:05:13.870> completely
