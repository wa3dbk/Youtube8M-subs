00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.360 
technique with the right hand you're
plucking<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.329> open<00:02:53.930> D<00:02:54.109> note<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.560> then<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.829> G

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
plucking the open D note and then the G

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.699 
plucking the open D note and then the G
the<00:02:55.609> B<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:55.970> high<00:02:56.120> e<00:02:56.150> with<00:02:56.420> these<00:02:56.569> fingers

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.259 

and<00:03:00.709> then<00:03:01.130> we're<00:03:01.250> gonna<00:03:01.340> go<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:01.579> an<00:03:01.790> E<00:03:02.000> minor

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
and then we're gonna go to an E minor

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.629 
and then we're gonna go to an E minor
chord<00:03:02.389> now<00:03:03.380> we're<00:03:03.560> playing<00:03:03.769> from<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.069> low<00:03:04.370> E

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
chord now we're playing from the low E

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.370 
chord now we're playing from the low E
we're<00:03:04.940> still<00:03:05.209> playing<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.630> G<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.019> be<00:03:06.170> in<00:03:06.290> the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
we're still playing the G to be in the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.379 
we're still playing the G to be in the
high<00:03:06.560> E<00:03:09.100> now<00:03:10.100> is<00:03:10.430> where<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.819> gets<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.060> little<00:03:11.090> bit

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
high E now is where it gets a little bit

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.990 
high E now is where it gets a little bit
trickier<00:03:11.750> we're<00:03:11.900> gonna<00:03:11.989> play<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.440> G<00:03:12.650> chord

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
trickier we're gonna play the G chord

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.720 
trickier we're gonna play the G chord
this<00:03:14.000> gets<00:03:14.269> split<00:03:14.829> between<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.190> measures<00:03:16.579> so

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
this gets split between the measures so

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.539 
this gets split between the measures so
we<00:03:16.760> have<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.090> G<00:03:17.269> chord<00:03:17.569> and<00:03:18.310> then<00:03:19.310> we're<00:03:19.459> gonna

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
we have the G chord and then we're gonna

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.009 
we have the G chord and then we're gonna
go<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.000> F<00:03:20.180> chord<00:03:20.209> like<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:22.959> so<00:03:23.959> B

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
go to the F chord like this so B

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.220 
go to the F chord like this so B
sometimes<00:03:27.019> he'll<00:03:27.260> go<00:03:27.349> like<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:28.989> open<00:03:29.989> and

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
sometimes he'll go like this open and

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.450 
sometimes he'll go like this open and
then<00:03:30.530> like<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.220> no

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
then like that no

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:51.940 

so<00:03:34.460> one<00:03:34.640> more<00:03:34.820> time<00:03:35.030> really<00:03:35.450> slow<00:03:50.110> now<00:03:51.110> in

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
so one more time really slow now in

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.310 
so one more time really slow now in
between<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.460> chords<00:03:53.090> right<00:03:53.570> before<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:53.960> switch

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
between the chords right before I switch

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.220 
between the chords right before I switch
I<00:03:54.560> put<00:03:55.070> my<00:03:55.160> fingers<00:03:55.550> back<00:03:55.730> down<00:03:56.030> onto<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.570> onto

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
I put my fingers back down onto the onto

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.540 
I put my fingers back down onto the onto
the<00:03:57.320> strings<00:03:57.650> like<00:03:57.860> this<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.220> it<00:03:58.280> gives<00:03:58.370> it

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
the strings like this and it gives it

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.910 
the strings like this and it gives it
this<00:03:58.640> percussive<00:03:59.450> kind<00:03:59.750> of<00:03:59.870> pop<00:04:00.140> it<00:04:00.530> sounds

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
this percussive kind of pop it sounds

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.610 
this percussive kind of pop it sounds
like<00:04:01.040> this<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:04.270> that's<00:04:05.270> kind<00:04:05.630> of<00:04:05.750> giving<00:04:06.410> it<00:04:06.470> a

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
like this and that's kind of giving it a

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:15.040 
like this and that's kind of giving it a
little<00:04:06.770> bit<00:04:06.860> more<00:04:07.160> rhythm<00:04:13.570> so<00:04:14.570> you<00:04:14.690> just<00:04:14.870> put

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
little bit more rhythm so you just put

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.340 
little bit more rhythm so you just put
your<00:04:15.140> fingers<00:04:15.500> down<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:17.630> velocity<00:04:18.320> of

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
your fingers down and the velocity of

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.320 
your fingers down and the velocity of
the<00:04:18.650> your<00:04:19.040> fingers<00:04:19.400> hitting<00:04:19.640> the<00:04:19.700> strings<00:04:20.090> it

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
the your fingers hitting the strings it

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.700 
the your fingers hitting the strings it
makes<00:04:20.480> it<00:04:20.600> pop<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:20.840> little<00:04:21.080> bit<00:04:23.350> so<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.470> right

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
makes it pop a little bit so the right

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.870 
makes it pop a little bit so the right
hand<00:04:25.040> is<00:04:25.250> gonna<00:04:25.430> look<00:04:25.610> like<00:04:25.850> this<00:04:28.600> so<00:04:29.600> index

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
hand is gonna look like this so index

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:40.420 
hand is gonna look like this so index
middle<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.150> ring<00:04:35.770> then<00:04:36.770> from<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.130> D<00:04:39.310> from<00:04:40.310> the

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
middle and ring then from the D from the

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:48.490 
middle and ring then from the D from the
low<00:04:40.610> E<00:04:42.550> from<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.730> G<00:04:44.170> f-sharp<00:04:45.170> and<00:04:47.380> that<00:04:48.380> would

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
low E from the G f-sharp and that would

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.410 
low E from the G f-sharp and that would
be<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.740> right<00:04:48.980> hand<00:04:49.310> so<00:04:49.720> keeps<00:04:50.720> like<00:04:50.930> that<00:04:52.420> so

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
be the right hand so keeps like that so

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.940 
be the right hand so keeps like that so
that<00:04:53.630> would<00:04:53.810> be<00:04:53.960> for<00:04:54.230> the<00:04:54.350> verse<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:54.890> the

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
that would be for the verse and the

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.110 
that would be for the verse and the
chorus<00:04:55.400> now<00:04:56.530> he'll<00:04:57.530> also<00:04:57.800> at<00:04:58.370> times<00:04:58.640> over<00:04:59.030> the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
chorus now he'll also at times over the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.630 
chorus now he'll also at times over the
chorus<00:04:59.480> hold<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.170> chords<00:05:00.860> out<00:05:01.040> like<00:05:01.280> this<00:05:01.490> he

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
chorus hold the chords out like this he

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.530 
chorus hold the chords out like this he
just<00:05:01.670> strums<00:05:02.210> them<00:05:02.480> one<00:05:02.990> two<00:05:03.680> three<00:05:04.520> four<00:05:05.270> to

you that are having a hard time with the

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.799 
you that are having a hard time with the
the<00:05:38.539> f-sharp<00:05:38.749> like<00:05:39.289> this<00:05:39.789> or<00:05:40.789> the<00:05:41.239> B<00:05:41.449> minor

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:41.809 
the f-sharp like this or the B minor

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:43.089 
the f-sharp like this or the B minor
like<00:05:42.139> this<00:05:42.439> there's<00:05:42.679> a<00:05:42.769> couple<00:05:42.919> different

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
like this there's a couple different

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:44.739 
like this there's a couple different
ways<00:05:43.399> you<00:05:43.519> can<00:05:43.819> play<00:05:43.969> it<00:05:44.179> you<00:05:44.329> can<00:05:44.360> play<00:05:44.599> it

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:44.749 
ways you can play it you can play it

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:46.479 
ways you can play it you can play it
like<00:05:44.899> this<00:05:45.259> so<00:05:45.499> instead<00:05:45.769> of<00:05:45.829> playing<00:05:46.039> the<00:05:46.249> bar

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:46.489 
like this so instead of playing the bar

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:50.499 
like this so instead of playing the bar
