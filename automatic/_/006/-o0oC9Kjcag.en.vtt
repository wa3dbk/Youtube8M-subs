00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.150
 the channel this time I bring you the 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.490
 five songs the five of decks that 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.590
 I like the pokémon games more 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.650
 in my opinion of course and as 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.650
 we always start forward 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.500
 at number 5 I get nostalgic and it's 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.930
 it clear who he comes to your 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.900
 head the number 1 route of red pokemon 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.510
 when you hear this simple song 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.550
 but at the same time so addictive the route 1 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.970
 my mother that great very but that very 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.970
 good 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.890
 and this is another great song of the first 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.270
 generation of pokemon get in 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.190
 situation the first time you play at 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.840
 pokemon you come to the league and thanks to 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.850
 all the high command but hopes that still 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.440
 the champion remains and your opponent is blue 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.120
 since the beginning of the game very epic 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.430
 truth then more epic is with this 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.250
 wonderful song made exclusively 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.600
 for the moment or how big is this 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.600
 my mother of my favorite is of course 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.710

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.689

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.170

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.250

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.520
 undoubtedly the melody of this song 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.050
 has something special for me from the time 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.700

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.590
