of training the first team is it quite a
steep<00:00:31.380> learning<00:00:31.410> curve<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.969> was<00:00:33.630> really

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
steep learning curve and I was really

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.900 
steep learning curve and I was really
actually<00:00:33.960> last<00:00:34.290> year<00:00:34.469> were<00:00:34.620> from<00:00:34.910> tossed

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
actually last year were from tossed

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.360 
actually last year were from tossed
roseville<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.649> lot<00:00:37.920> crackling

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
roseville but in at a lot crackling

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.610 
roseville but in at a lot crackling
nanotech<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.000> ones<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> lot<00:00:39.570> harder<00:00:39.719> more

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
nanotech it ones it's a lot harder more

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.580 
nanotech it ones it's a lot harder more
concentration<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.640> movement<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.410> it's<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.469> lot

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
concentration one movement so it's a lot

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.389 
concentration one movement so it's a lot
harder<00:00:43.710> than<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.280> day<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.629> terms<00:00:46.050> of

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
harder than the day but in terms of

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.279 
harder than the day but in terms of
working<00:00:47.399> alongside<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.329> first-team<00:00:48.840> players

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
working alongside the first-team players
