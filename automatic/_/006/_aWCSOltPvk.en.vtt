there you go 50 can you spawn egg at the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.410 
there you go 50 can you spawn egg at the
moment<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:09.040> maximum<00:03:09.519> amount<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:09.970> enemies<00:03:10.299> in

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
oh yes there's one more thing that I

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.380 
oh yes there's one more thing that I
needed<00:06:06.590> to<00:06:06.680> show<00:06:06.890> you<00:06:06.950> guys<00:06:07.190> let<00:06:07.820> me<00:06:07.880> see<00:06:08.120> if<00:06:08.300> I

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
needed to show you guys let me see if I

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.030 
needed to show you guys let me see if I
could<00:06:08.540> actually<00:06:08.660> get<00:06:08.960> myself<00:06:09.170> situated<00:06:09.440> I

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
could actually get myself situated I

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.830 
could actually get myself situated I
need<00:06:10.520> to<00:06:10.580> figure<00:06:10.820> out<00:06:10.940> what<00:06:11.090> I<00:06:11.120> want<00:06:11.330> to<00:06:11.390> do<00:06:11.600> and

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
need to figure out what I want to do and

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.560 
need to figure out what I want to do and
sign<00:06:12.470> pigman<00:06:12.920> I<00:06:13.190> guess<00:06:13.910> it<00:06:14.030> can't<00:06:14.210> burn<00:06:14.360> and

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
sign pigman I guess it can't burn and

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.830 
sign pigman I guess it can't burn and
sunt<00:06:14.780> because<00:06:15.110> they're<00:06:15.860> impervious<00:06:16.550> to<00:06:16.840> lava

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
sunt because they're impervious to lava

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.690 
sunt because they're impervious to lava
of<00:06:18.140> course<00:06:18.410> which<00:06:18.650> burns<00:06:18.950> them<00:06:19.220> so<00:06:19.460> I<00:06:19.490> guess

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
of course which burns them so I guess

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.120 
of course which burns them so I guess
the<00:06:19.850> Sun<00:06:20.030> is<00:06:20.150> not<00:06:20.300> going<00:06:20.420> to<00:06:20.480> burn<00:06:20.660> them<00:06:20.950> so<00:06:21.950> if

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
the Sun is not going to burn them so if

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.710 
the Sun is not going to burn them so if
you<00:06:22.220> have<00:06:22.340> a<00:06:22.370> dispenser<00:06:22.760> what<00:06:23.270> you<00:06:23.390> could<00:06:23.540> do

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
you have a dispenser what you could do

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.100 
you have a dispenser what you could do
is<00:06:23.900> actually<00:06:24.050> create<00:06:24.530> your<00:06:24.560> own<00:06:24.710> spawner<00:06:26.110> so

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
is actually create your own spawner so

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.170 
is actually create your own spawner so
there<00:06:27.560> you<00:06:27.650> go

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
there you go

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.940 
there you go
example<00:06:29.180> put<00:06:29.510> a<00:06:29.540> little<00:06:29.690> mushroom<00:06:30.140> and<00:06:30.320> let's

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
example put a little mushroom and let's

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.800 
example put a little mushroom and let's
try<00:06:31.130> it<00:06:31.190> out<00:06:31.340> with<00:06:31.400> a<00:06:31.520> lever<00:06:31.790> let<00:06:32.450> me<00:06:32.540> see<00:06:32.690> if<00:06:32.750> I

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
try it out with a lever let me see if I

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.750 
try it out with a lever let me see if I
can<00:06:32.930> find<00:06:33.110> one<00:06:33.350> I<00:06:33.500> can<00:06:33.530> I'm<00:06:33.920> not<00:06:33.980> so<00:06:34.430> good<00:06:34.610> at

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
can find one I can I'm not so good at

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.470 
can find one I can I'm not so good at
these<00:06:34.940> all<00:06:35.300> right<00:06:35.660> lever<00:06:36.110> there<00:06:36.470> you<00:06:36.560> go<00:06:37.480> lever

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:38.480 
these all right lever there you go lever

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.280 
these all right lever there you go lever
there<00:06:38.870> you<00:06:38.960> go

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
there you go

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.280 
there you go
you<00:06:39.980> can<00:06:40.130> spawn<00:06:40.400> as<00:06:40.700> many<00:06:41.080> animals<00:06:42.080> that<00:06:42.140> you

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
you can spawn as many animals that you

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.130 
you can spawn as many animals that you

all right so what you can do is make a

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.550 
all right so what you can do is make a
trap<00:07:10.490> system<00:07:10.700> were<00:07:11.090> pretty<00:07:11.810> much<00:07:11.990> stepping<00:07:12.500> on

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
trap system were pretty much stepping on

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.050 
trap system were pretty much stepping on
a<00:07:12.590> pressure<00:07:12.770> plate<00:07:12.890> we'll<00:07:13.310> actually<00:07:13.580> spawn

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
a pressure plate we'll actually spawn

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.090 
a pressure plate we'll actually spawn
enemies<00:07:14.720> or<00:07:14.960> anything<00:07:15.410> that<00:07:15.530> you<00:07:15.710> want<00:07:15.890> to<00:07:15.950> do

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750 
so if you want to make like a haunted

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.020 
so if you want to make like a haunted
house<00:07:18.080> where<00:07:18.410> you're<00:07:18.830> spawning<00:07:19.130> enemies<00:07:19.400> out

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.030 
house where you're spawning enemies out
