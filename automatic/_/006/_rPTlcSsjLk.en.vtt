secondary fermentation stage you know
you've<00:00:11.280> you've<00:00:11.759> gone<00:00:11.880> through<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.179> first

it's made of glass and i actually did

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.310 
it's made of glass and i actually did
the<00:00:37.860> primary<00:00:38.370> fermentation<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.510> about

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the primary fermentation on this about

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.130 
the primary fermentation on this about
three<00:00:40.649> weeks<00:00:40.950> ago<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.750> at<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> end<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
primary fermentation i racked it over

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
primary fermentation i racked it over
into<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> secondary<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.840> then<00:00:46.170> i<00:00:46.230> added<00:00:46.500> some

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
into the secondary and then i added some

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.670 
into the secondary and then i added some
sugar<00:00:46.890> water<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.140> boost<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> alcohol

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
sugar water so to boost the alcohol

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.229 
sugar water so to boost the alcohol
content<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.370> little<00:00:50.579> bit<00:00:50.730> i<00:00:50.879> want<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> do

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
content just a little bit i want to do

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.090 
content just a little bit i want to do
that<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.629> around<00:00:51.840> fifteen<00:00:52.260> sixteen<00:00:52.739> percent

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
that for around fifteen sixteen percent

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.029 
that for around fifteen sixteen percent
and<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.780> don't<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.440> can't<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.949> very

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
and if you I don't you can't see it very

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.150 
and if you I don't you can't see it very
well<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.239> airlock<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.350> still

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
well but the airlock here is still

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.420 
well but the airlock here is still
bubbling<00:00:59.430> now<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.359> giving<00:01:00.719> off<00:01:00.809> about<00:01:01.430> about

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
bubbling now it's giving off about about

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.620 
bubbling now it's giving off about about
a<00:01:02.460> bubble<00:01:02.940> every<00:01:04.070> 20<00:01:05.070> seconds<00:01:05.519> maybe<00:01:05.729> which

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
a bubble every 20 seconds maybe which

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.870 
a bubble every 20 seconds maybe which
means<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.110> still<00:01:07.229> cooking<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.610> done

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
means it's still cooking it's not done

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.480 
means it's still cooking it's not done
yet<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> will<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.040> been<00:01:11.189> three<00:01:11.460> weeks

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
yet so I will and it's been three weeks

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.429 
yet so I will and it's been three weeks
in<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> secondary<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> lot<00:01:13.409> of

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
in the secondary so I get a lot of

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.320 
in the secondary so I get a lot of
questions<00:01:13.830> how<00:01:14.010> long<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.430> leave<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:15.060> how

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
questions how long I leave it here how

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.789 
questions how long I leave it here how
long<00:01:15.360> belly<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.170> depends

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
long belly but there will just depends

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.370 
long belly but there will just depends
on<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.729> wine<00:01:17.909> you're<00:01:18.150> fermenting<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.140> this

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
on on the wine you're fermenting so this

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.820 
on on the wine you're fermenting so this
this<00:01:19.710> particular<00:01:20.750> wine<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> combination<00:01:22.409> of

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
last batch we made was awesome but you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.620 
last batch we made was awesome but you
do<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.250> let<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> sit<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.759> age<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
do have to let it sit in age in the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.390 
do have to let it sit in age in the
bottle<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.049> about<00:01:37.259> eight<00:01:37.590> nine<00:01:37.619> months

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
bottle for about eight nine months

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.770 
bottle for about eight nine months
before<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.790> takes<00:01:38.909> really<00:01:39.390> really<00:01:39.600> good

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
before it takes really really good

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.960 
before it takes really really good
anyway<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.920> answer<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.400> question<00:01:41.520> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
anyway so the answer to the question is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.179 
anyway so the answer to the question is
as<00:01:42.180> long<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.110> takes<00:01:43.290> how<00:01:43.619> long<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.040> like

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
as long as it takes how long do I like

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.039 
as long as it takes how long do I like
to<00:01:44.310> sit<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.729> secondary<00:01:45.119> as<00:01:45.360> long<00:01:45.869> as<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
to sit in the secondary as long as it
