00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
some of the later levels but like I

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.819 
some of the later levels but like I
never<00:03:11.060> found<00:03:11.299> it<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.599> be<00:03:11.630> overly<00:03:12.290> repetitive

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
never found it to be overly repetitive

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.069 
never found it to be overly repetitive
just<00:03:13.040> because<00:03:13.370> of<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.700> variety<00:03:14.299> offered<00:03:14.959> in

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
the gameplay I think that's pretty well

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.990
