00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
basically this is a peel-off mask

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.920 
basically this is a peel-off mask
usually<00:04:44.310> well<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.030> when<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.210> first<00:04:45.480> got<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.840> I

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
usually well and when I first got it I

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.090 
usually well and when I first got it I
would<00:04:46.050> apply<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:46.320> everywhere<00:04:46.620> on<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:46.890> face

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
would apply it everywhere on the face

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.940 
would apply it everywhere on the face
but<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:47.810> after<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.840> while<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.110> figured<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.740> should

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
but I after a while I figured I should

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.240 
but I after a while I figured I should
use<00:04:50.100> it<00:04:50.250> only<00:04:50.370> where<00:04:50.790> my<00:04:51.230> main<00:04:52.230> concerns<00:04:52.830> are

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
use it only where my main concerns are

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.210 
use it only where my main concerns are
which<00:04:53.610> is<00:04:53.850> my<00:04:54.270> t-zone<00:04:55.170> so<00:04:55.710> on<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.010> nose<00:04:56.190> a

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
which is my t-zone so on the nose a

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.860 
which is my t-zone so on the nose a
little<00:04:56.520> bit<00:04:56.730> on<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:56.910> cheeks<00:04:57.240> around<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.720> nose

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
little bit on the cheeks around the nose

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.690 
little bit on the cheeks around the nose
and<00:04:58.170> on<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.380> chin<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.770> this<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.430> just<00:04:59.580> a

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
and on the chin and this is just a

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.310 
and on the chin and this is just a
peel-off<00:05:00.090> mask<00:05:00.450> sometime<00:05:00.780> I<00:05:00.810> would<00:05:01.020> use<00:05:01.200> it

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
peel-off mask sometime I would use it

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.020 
peel-off mask sometime I would use it
all<00:05:01.470> over<00:05:01.500> but<00:05:02.040> it's<00:05:02.220> such<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.490> good<00:05:02.730> product

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
all over but it's such a good product

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.060 
all over but it's such a good product
and<00:05:03.270> I<00:05:03.390> didn't<00:05:03.630> want<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.840> waste<00:05:04.020> it<00:05:04.290> like<00:05:04.530> on<00:05:04.860> my

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
and I didn't want to waste it like on my

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.070 
and I didn't want to waste it like on my
forehead<00:05:05.370> I<00:05:05.700> barely<00:05:06.000> have<00:05:06.270> any<00:05:06.510> problem<00:05:06.990> areas

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
forehead I barely have any problem areas

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.800 
forehead I barely have any problem areas
there<00:05:07.650> so<00:05:08.010> I<00:05:08.040> figured<00:05:08.520> just<00:05:08.850> use<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.480> wherever

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810
