here<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.720> maritime<00:02:20.140> climate<00:02:20.440> we<00:02:20.710> have<00:02:21.270> but<00:02:22.270> it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
here the maritime climate we have but it

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.570 
here the maritime climate we have but it
does<00:02:22.810> mean<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.230> we<00:02:23.470> have<00:02:23.650> long<00:02:23.920> extended

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
does mean that we have long extended

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.060 
does mean that we have long extended

autumns and long extended harvest period

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.700 
autumns and long extended harvest period
that<00:02:27.460> is<00:02:27.610> why<00:02:27.880> we<00:02:28.120> get<00:02:28.270> such<00:02:28.420> intense<00:02:28.840> flavors

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
that is why we get such intense flavors

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.340 
that is why we get such intense flavors
and<00:02:29.860> our<00:02:29.980> fruit<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:31.030> lot<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.210> what<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.570> do<00:02:31.780> is

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
and our fruit and a lot of what we do is

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.710 
and our fruit and a lot of what we do is
just<00:02:32.650> handling<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.030> intensity

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
just handling that so that the intensity

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.410 
just handling that so that the intensity
of<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.020> fruit<00:02:35.380> isn't<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.220> only<00:02:36.250> thing<00:02:36.760> that

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
of the fruit isn't the only thing that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.330 
of the fruit isn't the only thing that
makes<00:02:37.600> up<00:02:37.840> our<00:02:37.990> wine<00:02:38.290> but<00:02:38.560> it's<00:02:38.710> the<00:02:38.860> structure

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
makes up our wine but it's the structure

makes up our wine but it's the structure
of<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.580> wine<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.080> equally<00:02:41.080> important

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.650

the aim behind what we're doing is to

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.780 
the aim behind what we're doing is to
