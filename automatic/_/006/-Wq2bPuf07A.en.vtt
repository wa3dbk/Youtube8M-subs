00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.680
 we lead him to try 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.550
 run tony scott wound standards and 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.360
 We can not see the parameters of which he 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.669
 us burgas 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.059
 I will say that he gives me a percentage 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.590
 disappointed killed and surprised in a bad sense 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.390
 of this word despite the fact that speed 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.219
 working as you yourself could understand quite 

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:27.560
 high level 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.790
 the data is of course disappointing so wounds 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.970
 damn chumak 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.430
 but p 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.170
 later dust particles 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.340
 but for some reason I missed the press 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.250
 the truth with the process is unclear why 13 14 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.250
 frames goes but a little vodka 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.550
 but if byt 40 frames 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:44.390
 if every 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.329

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:20.049
 no Moscow 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.150
 understandable unfortunately they say with 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.869
 prosecution percentage 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:32.859
 the previous time did not work out only 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:37.059
 now let's finish here then 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:39.309
 we'll see 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.309
 how will go forward 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.680
