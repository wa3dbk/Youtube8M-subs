00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800
 sweet your baby is fine 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.750
 its irregular weight curve however 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.299
 he is subject to gastroenteritis or 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.670
 other small infections your child 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.010
 can be protected by reinforcing his 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.660
 immune system 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 the military system is called the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.859
 body defense system against 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.529
 viruses and microbes that cause 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.880
 diseases among the means to strengthen 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.040
 immune system 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.649
 some probiotics play a role 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.140
 major than under probiotics 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.760
 they are living microorganisms 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.469
 naturally present in the flora 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.910
 intestinal 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.010
 when they are in sufficient quantity 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.430
 it has a beneficial effect on the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.980
 health 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.649
 it contributes among other things to the balance 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.809
 of the intestinal flora and stimulates the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.190
 immune system 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.550
 breast milk can naturally 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.360
 contain probiotics 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.460
 let's see how probiotics 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.309
 could help strengthen the system 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.969
 immune of your baby in 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.460
 intestine 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.950
 probiotics attaches itself to the micro 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 villi in sufficient quantity 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.030
 it forms a first line of 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.619
 protection that prevents viruses or 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.659
 microbes to cross the wall 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.100
 intestinal 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.220
 on the other hand some probiotics 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.380
 stimulates the secretion of antibodies 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.409
 antibodies neutralize viruses and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.240
 microbes additionally some probiotics 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.909
 have the distinction of making the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.280
 acidic environments this acidity reduces the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.979
 development of microbes and stimulates 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.990
 growth of probiotics and children 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.900
 probiotics act directly 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.409
 on microbes by neutralizing them and 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.270
 by evacuating them to the collar or through 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.219
 this quadruple protection 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.000
 your baby's defense system is 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.549
 more performant and cotton your baby is 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.539
 in better health 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.539
