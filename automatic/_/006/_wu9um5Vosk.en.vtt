00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.379
 Kinder bothered to keep in a box finished her 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.929
 that the Kinders are constantly falling about 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.480
 neat cute collection then 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.960
 you click on that video hi with you i 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.520
 Katya and today we will solve your problem 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.740
 today together with you we will do 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.430
 such a diorama for masha and 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.650
 bear 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.810
 by the same principle you can do 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:37.520
 Diorama for any collection of toys from 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:42.629
 Kinder to start we need 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.149
 adhesive tape scissors glue desired pencil 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.010
 because it will be so much more convenient 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.960
 kinder box from under kinder surprise 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.730
 can also use a box from under 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.800
 tea and well, the main thing that she was 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.440
 small and rectangular 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.899
 as well as different color cardboard by think 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.430
 all this let's start the food at all 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.789
 forgot to say what we need 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.159
 rulers to start take our box 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:09.810
 measure the length of the width of the height and all that 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.600
 need then we all measured take a sheet 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.600
 cardboard color which we will have ground 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.030
 Measure out the length of the start box is here 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.860
 when so 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.799
 postponing the side of the height of the box 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.060
 us 42 other side building a right angle 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.610
 and on it we also lay off the height 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.000
 42 and draw a line to us 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.250
 it was more convenient 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.590
 I just take stock in case because 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.189
 that you never know what we postpone further 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.189
 width 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.759
 this is where we will stand by ourselves 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.759
 figurines and on the other hand also 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.860
 we postpone 6 2 as soon as on the drawing 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.259
 we had two such rectangles 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.710
 need to leave more serif in order 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.500
 to glue this box yourself 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.110
 for this, I take somewhere a little more 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.299
 half a centimeter in the end we have 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.330
 it turns out this is a drawing that we 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.280
 now have to cut along the lines 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.750
 in order to be comfortable all the lines you 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.750
 let's work with scissors 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.330
 then easily bend like this 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.760
 way and voila he's already ready 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.250
 try on it on a box like this 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.380
 us it turns out and on the reverse side we 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.210
 scotch here this here is our bend chick 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.220
 we glue and with such movements 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.020
 stick it on our box and here 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.810
 do we face such a problem that 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:45.910
 here this edge as it is incomprehensible sit I 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.910
 I suggest to stick it with glue 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.300
 in the end, we hold on tight and 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.880
 Now we will start 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.540
 making the very background for our 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.990
 dioramas 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.740
 for this we need to add three lengths 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:10.100
 these are two widths and one 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.960
 length further we take the blue leaf from 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.510
 me it is blue you may be quite 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.240
 another color but it will serve 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.670
 girls on our go and we are 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.760
 we lay twenty and eight on it 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.610
 centimeter further we choose about 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.310
 how long will our diorama I 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.260
 here it is 11 centimeters will do exactly 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.780
 also as soon as we have on the sheet 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.760
 it turned out something we cut by 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.880
 contour that's it just in case 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.400
 I left and here on this contour 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.830
 cut out and if we all cut out 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.910
 correctly measured everything turned out 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.980
 we should get out here such a diorama 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.800
 next you just glue it as 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.400
 we need can be scotch can glue me 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.620
 more convenient glue clamp tape but there is 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.180
 one thing but I really don't like these 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.880
 here are the corners of a diorama 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.970
 so I round them up a little bit like this 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.970
 here and here comes such a diorama 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.160
 You can also decorate the background of the diorama by 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.160
 to your wish 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.590
 Well here is our diorama and ready 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.930
 now it remains only to place there 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.540
 figurines also if you can 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.610
 stick on this side of the liner so 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.370
 much more convenient to observe at what stage 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.290
 assembly is this collection a for 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.420
 so that the figures and gangs some 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.580
 can be bonded such as Fixiki 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.150
 You can also stick to the place where 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.830
 there are figures of double-sided tape and they 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.810
 will stick too 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.390
 and they won't fall like this 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.700
 small diy for collectors on 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.480
 this is probably all with you I was kittens up 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.310
 new meetings 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:06.170
 they will soon District to share and 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:10.180
 so that the figures do not fall you 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.180
 You can stick them as it did
