00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
for the Macintosh of course a lot of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.969 
for the Macintosh of course a lot of

because<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.249> its<00:02:05.369> Genesis<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.119> CDI<00:02:06.539> pours<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
because of its Genesis and CDI pours and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.559 
because of its Genesis and CDI pours and
all<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.190> stuff<00:02:08.429> we're<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:08.670> lousy<00:02:08.970> controls

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
all that stuff we're just lousy controls

all that stuff we're just lousy controls
but<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.019> me<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.379> kind<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.159> dark<00:02:11.430> castle

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
but for me I kind of see the dark castle

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.860 
but for me I kind of see the dark castle
as<00:02:12.120> one<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.629> those<00:02:12.750> games<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.379> like

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
as one of those games for like

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.410 
as one of those games for like
gamer's<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.129> game<00:02:15.340> was<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> lot<00:02:15.909> better<00:02:16.209> on

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420

the Macintosh version before they put it
into<00:02:18.879> other<00:02:19.239> consoles<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.989> think<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:20.830> 1998<00:02:21.640> the

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
into other consoles I think in 1998 the

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.520 
into other consoles I think in 1998 the
game<00:02:22.000> was<00:02:22.180> later<00:02:22.360> remade<00:02:22.690> for<00:02:23.170> its<00:02:23.290> newer

well<00:02:39.010> that's<00:02:39.280> because<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.760> first<00:02:40.000> model<00:02:40.329> of

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
well that's because the first model of

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.910 
well that's because the first model of
the<00:02:40.450> Macintosh<00:02:40.840> was<00:02:41.200> only<00:02:41.379> in<00:02:41.530> black<00:02:41.680> and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
the Macintosh was only in black and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.920 
the Macintosh was only in black and
white<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:42.400> since<00:02:42.849> with<00:02:43.060> its<00:02:43.209> newer<00:02:43.420> model<00:02:43.840> it

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
white and since with its newer model it

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.569 
white and since with its newer model it
was<00:02:44.079> in<00:02:44.200> color<00:02:44.470> kind<00:02:44.769> of<00:02:44.890> made<00:02:45.010> sense<00:02:45.280> why<00:02:45.519> it

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
was in color kind of made sense why it

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.430 
was in color kind of made sense why it
was<00:02:45.730> called<00:02:45.940> color<00:02:46.420> dark<00:02:46.750> castle<00:02:47.049> and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
was called color dark castle and

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.170 
was called color dark castle and
something<00:02:47.890> like<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.760> first<00:02:48.790> time<00:02:49.150> I

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
something like that the first time I

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.309 
something like that the first time I
heard<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.540> name<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:50.019> sounded<00:02:50.290> like

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
heard that name it sounded like

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.410 
heard that name it sounded like
