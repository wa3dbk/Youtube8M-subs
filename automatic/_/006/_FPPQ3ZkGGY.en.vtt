alright i just gave it a little bit more
tone<00:05:52.670> here<00:05:53.230> which<00:05:54.230> is<00:05:54.380> fine<00:05:56.470> so<00:05:57.470> i'm<00:05:57.650> going<00:05:57.800> to

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
tone here which is fine so i'm going to

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.670 
tone here which is fine so i'm going to
hit<00:05:58.070> okay<00:05:58.460> and<00:05:58.570> then<00:05:59.570> I<00:05:59.720> also<00:05:59.930> want<00:06:00.320> to<00:06:00.350> sharpen

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
hit okay and then I also want to sharpen

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.080 
hit okay and then I also want to sharpen
it<00:06:01.040> a<00:06:01.250> little<00:06:01.910> bit<00:06:03.520> just<00:06:04.520> to<00:06:04.670> make<00:06:04.820> it<00:06:04.850> a<00:06:04.940> little

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
it a little bit just to make it a little

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.900 
it a little bit just to make it a little
more<00:06:05.180> crisp<00:06:05.600> so<00:06:05.870> go<00:06:06.050> to<00:06:06.110> filter<00:06:06.700> scroll<00:06:07.700> down

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
more crisp so go to filter scroll down

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.510 
more crisp so go to filter scroll down
and<00:06:08.090> sharpen<00:06:08.570> and<00:06:08.750> then<00:06:09.440> go<00:06:09.620> to<00:06:09.650> unsharp<00:06:10.280> mask

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
and sharpen and then go to unsharp mask

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.640 
and sharpen and then go to unsharp mask
then<00:06:11.270> you're<00:06:11.420> going<00:06:11.540> to<00:06:11.600> get<00:06:11.720> this<00:06:11.900> window<00:06:12.140> and

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
then you're going to get this window and

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.430 
then you're going to get this window and
it's<00:06:13.370> going<00:06:13.490> to<00:06:13.550> give<00:06:13.790> you<00:06:14.000> a<00:06:14.350> hundred<00:06:15.350> percent

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
it's going to give you a hundred percent

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.910 
it's going to give you a hundred percent
of<00:06:16.160> you<00:06:16.720> is<00:06:17.720> going<00:06:17.930> to<00:06:17.990> look<00:06:18.170> really<00:06:18.350> really

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
of you is going to look really really

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.710 
of you is going to look really really
gross<00:06:19.220> here<00:06:19.490> but<00:06:19.670> don't<00:06:19.790> worry<00:06:19.970> about<00:06:20.030> that<00:06:20.450> I

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
gross here but don't worry about that I

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:27.490 
gross here but don't worry about that I
usually<00:06:21.440> set<00:06:21.830> my<00:06:22.010> radius<00:06:23.740> at<00:06:24.740> like<00:06:26.200> 1.5<00:06:27.200> and

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
usually set my radius at like 1.5 and

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.160 
usually set my radius at like 1.5 and
I'll<00:06:27.620> keep<00:06:27.770> that<00:06:27.950> threshold<00:06:28.280> of<00:06:28.610> 0<00:06:29.090> and<00:06:29.330> then

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.170 
I'll keep that threshold of 0 and then

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.620 
I'll keep that threshold of 0 and then
what<00:06:30.410> what<00:06:30.680> I<00:06:30.710> do<00:06:30.830> is<00:06:31.250> you<00:06:32.000> can<00:06:32.150> see<00:06:32.210> on<00:06:32.540> the

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
what what I do is you can see on the

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.890 
what what I do is you can see on the
preview<00:06:33.080> what<00:06:33.290> happens<00:06:34.030> I<00:06:35.030> won't<00:06:35.390> start<00:06:35.720> off

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
preview what happens I won't start off

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.260 
preview what happens I won't start off
at<00:06:36.140> one<00:06:37.070> percent<00:06:37.460> so<00:06:37.580> you<00:06:37.640> can<00:06:37.820> see<00:06:38.000> the

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
at one percent so you can see the

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.180 
at one percent so you can see the
difference<00:06:38.720> so<00:06:39.320> you<00:06:39.380> see<00:06:39.590> what<00:06:39.740> happens<00:06:40.100> if

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
difference so you see what happens if

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.830 
difference so you see what happens if
our<00:06:40.340> goal<00:06:40.520> I<00:06:40.820> know<00:06:41.150> it's<00:06:41.360> probably<00:06:41.480> hard<00:06:41.660> to

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
our goal I know it's probably hard to

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.220 
our goal I know it's probably hard to
see<00:06:42.050> on<00:06:42.080> the<00:06:42.260> screen<00:06:42.430> but<00:06:43.990> what<00:06:44.990> I'm<00:06:45.080> going<00:06:45.200> to

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
see on the screen but what I'm going to

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.390 
see on the screen but what I'm going to
do<00:06:45.410> is<00:06:45.590> I'm<00:06:45.680> just<00:06:45.740> going<00:06:45.830> to<00:06:45.980> add<00:06:46.130> a<00:06:46.160> little

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
do is I'm just going to add a little

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.800 
do is I'm just going to add a little
sharpening<00:06:46.910> to<00:06:47.090> it<00:06:47.240> just<00:06:47.360> to<00:06:47.480> make<00:06:47.660> it<00:06:47.690> a

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
sharpening to it just to make it a

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.240 
sharpening to it just to make it a
little<00:06:48.050> bit<00:06:48.260> crisper<00:06:49.160> and<00:06:50.770> it's<00:06:51.770> kind<00:06:51.980> of<00:06:52.010> hard

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
little bit crisper and it's kind of hard

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.870 
little bit crisper and it's kind of hard
to<00:06:52.340> see<00:06:52.810> from<00:06:53.810> the<00:06:53.990> camera<00:06:54.380> view<00:06:54.410> but<00:06:54.860> like<00:06:55.790> I

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
to see from the camera view but like I

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.460 
to see from the camera view but like I
said<00:06:55.940> if<00:06:56.180> you<00:06:56.210> go<00:06:56.390> to<00:06:56.450> unsharp<00:06:56.900> mask<00:06:57.110> and<00:06:57.320> just

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
said if you go to unsharp mask and just

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.540 
said if you go to unsharp mask and just
play<00:06:57.620> with<00:06:57.740> the<00:06:57.800> sayings<00:06:58.100> i<00:06:58.160> usually<00:06:58.430> keep<00:06:58.490> my

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
play with the sayings i usually keep my

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.330 
play with the sayings i usually keep my
radius<00:06:59.000> in<00:06:59.120> 1.5<00:06:59.690> my<00:06:59.930> threshold<00:07:00.200> of<00:07:00.470> 0<00:07:00.830> so<00:07:01.310> you

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
radius in 1.5 my threshold of 0 so you

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.740 
radius in 1.5 my threshold of 0 so you
can<00:07:01.550> play<00:07:01.730> with<00:07:01.880> the<00:07:02.000> amount<00:07:02.240> percentage

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
can play with the amount percentage

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.970 
can play with the amount percentage
until<00:07:03.050> you<00:07:03.200> get<00:07:03.350> something<00:07:03.590> to<00:07:03.830> your<00:07:03.950> liking

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:03.980 
until you get something to your liking

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.450 
until you get something to your liking
