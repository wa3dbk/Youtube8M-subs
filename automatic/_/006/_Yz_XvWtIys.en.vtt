00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
inter-disciplinary so we got a kind of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:07.340 
inter-disciplinary so we got a kind of
happening<00:00:57.870> now<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.530> use<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.950> Ted<00:00:59.280> start<00:01:06.350> this

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350

is<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> tie<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.450> stretches<00:01:09.450> as<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
is a is a tie that stretches as the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.170 
is a is a tie that stretches as the
plant<00:01:09.960> grows<00:01:10.050> it<00:01:10.530> doesn't<00:01:10.800> cut<00:01:10.950> into<00:01:11.180> stems

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
plant grows it doesn't cut into stems

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.880 
plant grows it doesn't cut into stems
and<00:01:12.420> his<00:01:12.570> gifts<00:01:13.050> so<00:01:13.410> we're<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.770> go

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and his gifts so we're going to go

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:37.880 
and his gifts so we're going to go
around

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.840 

this<00:01:38.890> is<00:01:39.100> because<00:01:39.190> walking<00:01:39.760> rampant<00:01:41.580> tie<00:01:42.580> down

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
this is because walking rampant tie down

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.010 
this is because walking rampant tie down
over<00:01:43.240> here<00:01:43.420> I<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:49.360> it<00:01:49.480> looks<00:01:49.630> like<00:01:49.840> it's

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020
