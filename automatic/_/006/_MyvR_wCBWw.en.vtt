00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.430
 This fall package sees fall because we now want this Fannie Mae 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.989
 look closely 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.729
 Scope 1 million 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.729
 there is room for the usb cable in Ticino 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:20.660
 core 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.400
 we have the slot here for 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.519
 the micro- has been gone 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.579
 Here is a first appointment staked box 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.609
 up here is the slot for the 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:31.640
 headphone 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.650
 that's one day only 5-millimeter jack that is 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.430
 One can also 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.450
 connect one of the headphones without adapter 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.390
 here we see 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.600
 Rheine the app is one that is a 3-megapixel camera 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.920
 and here and there we still have 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.500
 who once had everything here 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.420
 Kurt Masur hides 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.050
 so 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.710
 Let's have a look 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.790
 Georg surface would have differently the mobile runs with Windows Moral 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.990
 Percent Expo 5 and percent had tender sense surface over it 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.730
 placed 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.250
 this is a resistive touchscreen that responds to pressure to make it possible 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.630
 not only with the finger that we with him but also with the stylus 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.630
 The display, however, is quite small compared to others once before 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.580
 us around 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.700
 of or touchscreen phones 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.360
 with 11 42 times 56 millimeters respectively 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.550
 320 by 240 pixel resolution that is not so much now 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.990
 We are not artificial and artificial for that either 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.470
 people 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.290
 Only a new deadline for the cash register keys locks and pushes you 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.070
 that can be done 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.530
 Kids how far but not into the camera but 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.420
 We're happy to help with the Stoxx 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.130
 look around 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.590
 Gelabert 90 topic the current 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.890
 Eckerts Mascha let ads and condition is natural 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.890
 Internet access has Wi-Fi 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.320
 changes exactly the time 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.180
 Kai Africans a low grip so 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.530
 and then you have these down here who knows you already from the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.379
 others have the cigarettes 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.139
 his home page Local and 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.479

 Internet Photos and Videos Music Weather 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:19.840
 Map 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.869
 at settings and programs 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:25.530
 when I look at photos and videos 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.139
 not everyone then you can us to percent 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.369
 the rest of the practical and branches TuS here 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.039
 to side caregivers but bar over which you can zoom 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.700
 and then that 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.530
 I work very well around that is still very weak hundreds 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.969
 recorded 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.079
 see the EU and others 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.119
 in the resin 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.119
 Hansen also assigned funnels to and fro 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.469
 this works very well otherwise the picture gallery is for me 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.239
 especially made smart with them 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.109
 by scrolling 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.559
 So that's exactly what it is here 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:06.439
 I know fast access in principle to the vast majority of things 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.680
 In addition, it always hinbekommt when you get up here 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.079
 Throm vouches 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.649
 yes the little house 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:19.359
 there is still the special bonus fit because then you get into the normal mini 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.539
 fall 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:22.490
 then he will be for himself 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.400
 not everyone like that 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.339
 around 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:26.279
 applications 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.999
 applications 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.249
 what do not want to play - live 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:34.249
 Marcel Kilz Pictures and Videos 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.909
 How can I be more brief 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.179
 with the pen 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:43.479
 With them you can also see the hosts that works very well 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.140
 for example, Facebook oil 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.729
 the pre-installed or on YouTube 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.290
 The Copa is all about 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.599
 Navigation software that they have a demo version on it 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:01.569
 So I have to listen to 15 at first on a tax and finally 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.559
 quite well 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:05.590
 I think we will paint now 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.399
 he would have missed 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:09.859
 Pepe had Kaymer 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.859
 Children can become serious here and also at » 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:19.029
 and then animal the symbol and then I also have percent here I say 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.819
 move input options I can paint 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.819
 so decided with finger or stylus 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.370
 Topics like how do I get 'suggestions 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.949
 that means even if you are a bit of a company value around 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.340
 for such a word culture in it that is the mobile phone 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.580
 takes the most likely word percent 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.300
 in March 0 2 0 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.180
 then you can still here 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.680
 a compact qwerty keyboard can be faded in so read always 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.140
 2 um and letters where 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.039
 Kaster 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.039
 and there are still 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.349
 if complete qwerty keyboard you know 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.939
 so from there it is advisable then I have really already percent with this 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.389
 the stylus 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.870
 to refer accordingly 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.939
 otherwise it will be really nice and slow 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.379
 who everything to earn the money 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.969
 Operation is very good 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:19.919
 most of you can really do with the topic the deeper you get serious 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.719
 take penetrates the more often 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:24.809
 Bussmann then once here the process pin percent increased 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.669
 because call during the marriage 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.719
 Iris Atalanta does not have anything round about censorship area DAX 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:36.030
 the more you then really come across Windows Mobile it needs you 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.550
 then 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.220
 according to the pen to use I think but thinks that is quite good 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.330
 succeeded »said Stangl it is not so Trier so much 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.939
 stay low can not longer «This is absolutely fine
