to get the product at the right price
but<00:00:24.180> that's<00:00:24.330> not<00:00:24.570> always<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.109> usually<00:00:26.039> what

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
but that's not always it usually what

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
to be able to get the low quantity to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.690 
to be able to get the low quantity to
test<00:00:30.689> them<00:00:30.900> instead<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.710> spending<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.369> million

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
test them instead of spending a million

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.870 
test them instead of spending a million
dollars<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.390> thousand<00:00:34.100> $15<00:00:35.100> dollars<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.610> lot<00:00:35.820> of

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
dollars on thousand $15 dollars a lot of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.040 
dollars on thousand $15 dollars a lot of
people<00:00:36.210> don't<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.690> sort<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.989> money

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
people don't have that sort of money

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.170 
people don't have that sort of money
they<00:00:37.620> might<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.010> five<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.550> ten<00:00:38.760> maximum

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
they might have five to ten maximum

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.330 
they might have five to ten maximum
twenty<00:00:39.510> grand<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.840> start<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.800> problem<00:00:41.160> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
twenty grand to start but the problem is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.010 
twenty grand to start but the problem is
the<00:00:41.940> quantities<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.420> they<00:00:42.600> would<00:00:42.780> order

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the quantities that they would order

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.200 
the quantities that they would order
with<00:00:43.860> five<00:00:44.129> ten<00:00:44.370> or<00:00:44.399> twenty<00:00:44.760> grand

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
with five ten or twenty grand

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.630 
with five ten or twenty grand
don't<00:00:45.719> get<00:00:45.960> them<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> same<00:00:46.500> price<00:00:46.860> as<00:00:47.160> those

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
don't get them the same price as those

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.369 
don't get them the same price as those
who<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:47.969> spending<00:00:48.180> millions<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
who are spending millions so the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.650 
who are spending millions so the
question<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.800> how<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.629> same

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
question is how can you get the same

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.000 
question is how can you get the same
price<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.500> would<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.680> if<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.949> order

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
price that you would get if you order

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.750 
price that you would get if you order

Millions

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.119 
Millions
with<00:00:54.390> only<00:00:54.539> five<00:00:55.020> ten<00:00:55.320> or<00:00:55.469> twenty<00:00:55.739> thousand

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
with only five ten or twenty thousand

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.010 
with only five ten or twenty thousand
dollars<00:00:56.370> well<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> answer<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.480> I've<00:00:57.840> let

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
dollars well the answer to this I've let

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.740 
dollars well the answer to this I've let
it<00:00:58.140> out<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> bag<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.670> is

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
it out of the bag now here it is

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.319 
it out of the bag now here it is
piggybacking<00:01:01.160> what<00:01:02.160> happens<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.940> lot<00:01:03.210> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
piggybacking what happens is a lot of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.149 
piggybacking what happens is a lot of
factories<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.840> China<00:01:03.870> are<00:01:04.589> constantly

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
factories in China are constantly

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.880 
factories in China are constantly
producing<00:01:05.540> massive<00:01:06.540> quantities<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.530> regular

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
producing massive quantities for regular

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.830 
producing massive quantities for regular
customers<00:01:07.920> these<00:01:08.880> will<00:01:09.090> typically<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.689> your

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
customers these will typically be your

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.170 
customers these will typically be your
Americans<00:01:10.380> because<00:01:10.890> America<00:01:11.310> has<00:01:11.430> an<00:01:11.820> economy

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
Americans because America has an economy

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.300 
Americans because America has an economy
which<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.689> at<00:01:12.780> least<00:01:12.810> 10<00:01:13.200> 20<00:01:13.590> 30<00:01:13.799> times<00:01:13.890> larger

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
which is at least 10 20 30 times larger

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.520 
which is at least 10 20 30 times larger
than<00:01:14.580> Australia<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.080> need<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.409> do

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
than Australia so what you need to do

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.219 
than Australia so what you need to do
with<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.740> factory<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.820> ask<00:01:18.030> them<00:01:18.360> when<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
with the factory is to ask them when and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.929 
with the factory is to ask them when and
with<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> American<00:01:20.009> customer<00:01:20.460> or<00:01:20.640> when<00:01:20.759> their

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
with the American customer or when their

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.359 
with the American customer or when their
largest<00:01:21.390> customer<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.020> next<00:01:22.619> producing<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.189> run

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
largest customer is next producing a run

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.700 
largest customer is next producing a run
and<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.299> ask<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.869> they<00:01:25.080> could<00:01:25.320> add<00:01:25.470> your

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and then ask if they could add your

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.210 
and then ask if they could add your
quantity<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.340> say<00:01:27.170> 5,000<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.590> their<00:01:28.770> quantity

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
quantity of say 5,000 to their quantity

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.450 
quantity of say 5,000 to their quantity
of<00:01:29.520> 100,000<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:31.470> give<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> same<00:01:32.250> price

now<00:01:33.299> there's<00:01:34.079> no<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> disadvantage<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
now there's no a disadvantage for the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.590 
now there's no a disadvantage for the
factory<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.610> do<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.880> because<00:01:36.329> they're<00:01:36.479> ready

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
factory to do this because they're ready

factory to do this because they're ready
producing<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> goods<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.829> they<00:01:38.009> don't<00:01:38.189> have

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
producing the goods and they don't have

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.190 
producing the goods and they don't have
to<00:01:38.460> go<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> way<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.299> make<00:01:39.659> another<00:01:39.960> run

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
