 dynamics observatory 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.290
 also on the magnet program showed 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.660
 significant changes for now 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.000
 there are 2 beta gamma regions of those 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.150
 us a directly facing the new one 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.530

 Mass ejection runs on the top left to us 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.310
 over and will be very likely 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.560
 do not even strip here on the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.350
 engine simulation of nasa can do that 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.210
 very special recognize such a special 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.979

 shortly after the flair showed up in the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.550
 pacific a r3 radio blackout so one 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.960
 disturbance in the high frequency of 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.060
 Communication on the sun 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.310
 facing the earth for one to 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.080
 two hours with contact loss as well 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.420
 an equally long disturbance in the 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.369
 low frequency navigation blackout 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.590
 area was the pacific ocean with 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.410
