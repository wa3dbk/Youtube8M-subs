 new and how is the spock talking here? 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.490
 with the shallow cutter control now 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:18.630
 fan this and I have no eyes but lets 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.420
 For there is waterfall color is crazy and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.930
 waterfall that sure is 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.480
 doing is for those who do not know recognize 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.490
 a series that spock is already making a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.800
 light texture series and then we are 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.739
 join to make a 3d face texture 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.149
 few people know why I did not 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.070
 I warned you in the place 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.320
 more personal than the guy who saw the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.620
 Spock and how does this series work? 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.850
 It's going to be an episode there on the channel and on the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.280
 We are going to see who the sport channel is 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.710
 Do you want to talk to your hair? 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.260
 rojas was the first sporting channel to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.480
 people did look only at our daycare table 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.210
 Look how beautiful it is old full of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.960
 moisturize yet nÃ© mano oxi a generous 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:06.689
 come here was to know who's hot did 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.619
 also look only to the face just to see 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:15.060
 look at this mano sky 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.220
 also in apart the attack was just the guy 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.240
 and will put kid in the middle of them here is 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.320
 just very chic and full of details 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.340
 in this one gic with which she would stay in the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.430
 four points right 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.770
 Looks pretty good and in case and asked 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.479
 Thank you, everyone! 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.009
 works so you comment on the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.829
 recommend below that you want to see 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.290
 Whoever does it to you soon, that puts you 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.240
 either exactly and unfairly because I 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.100
 I will make a couple of right the Prescott 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.149
 episode so she looks cool chick 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.610
 Because then, right job, then and no. 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.110
 if we did in this episode that the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.439
 people made is an anvil look at the face 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.270
 trying a hammer here that gives a 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.240
 iron detail of the edge detail 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.520
 The little foot in the milk was a 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.899
 time to make the mustache because 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.770
 people as reference of an anvil 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.110
 original 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.649
 by the way we are going with an anvil in the world 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.440
 real 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.140
 and she has one and they have a lot of curves 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.590
 curve is grimace but who can appear 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.330
 like this 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.400
 I'm strange to do with the block, right? 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.640
 that's what it's complicated to do 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.379
 that little thing on her foot here is the branch 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.620
 who came closest was so 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.629
 was this is with these reliefs then the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.790
 people got very good result this 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.610
 here is anvil when you create it 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.799
 it was up you look loose right 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.790
 this one is brand new now we 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.379
 catch you see that the fights that remain 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.610
 as I began to not contemplate that these 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.980
 you receive when you use a 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.730
 A little bit is this find up 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.130
 exactly to this one here beta 4 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.620
 blacksmith literally screwed at the same time 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.329
 Extra group denied everything I wanted 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.190
 do something more elaborate in the 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.290
 hammer so we did not think so. 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.230
 I needed it because it was kind of beautiful 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.480
 So tell me what you found there. 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.910
 I found it very good and gets fat 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.190
 Let's go now for the proton that has 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.640
 very good too that was the cactus galley 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.440
 look shakhtar and cut look at this cactus and 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.879
 Look what crazy thing only has the thorns. 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.140
 and high relief 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.069
 You can not move much in 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.840
 corners right because that these 15 set 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.700
 who lives in the field of the trinity galley 29 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.170
 united is not that the attacker does 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.510
 automatically with a texture 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.849
 Black only gets fat but I do not want him to 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.760
 make these spines neatly 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.889
 we had 11 very good games is the 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.349
 sides of the team and also on top right 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:39.840
 in the coconut from here in my hair 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.760
 boyish face just looks stuck in 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.950
 his round head guys look only 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.780
 crazy thing and also with the little handles 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.150
 here on top of him right? 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.459
 How does this work? It's just you. 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.440
 to take a little more would also do here 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.540
 if you put so type the cactus it 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.090
 it comes so're seeing and it's just you by 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.760
 it up here that it fits the rate 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.950
 exactly seam face and she just guys 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.599
 What a time, well, we wanted to do it. 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.880
 at this point the little arms here will stay 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.220
 very cool but chronic problems with me 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.030
 But you have to do it here, you 'd have to go. 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.549
 varying with the time of putting this 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.320
 He creates arm in everything, and he goes. 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.959
 I would not know who I do not know 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.630
 kind of like this by chance of the session 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.280
 fairly disputed here you went 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.810
 putting it in the direction you want it 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.770
 It's putting on but it's still fine. 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.449
 strange because you would have to 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.569
 always put arm in the equestrian think 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.879
 It is kind of weird is also on the mind is 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.530
 also varied from the cactus people 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:38.199
 decided to only change this part plus one of the 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.180
 thorns and put this part of teaching 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.699
 round that in my test was graphic 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.250
 more than enough in focus is the 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:48.069
 interesting to put some 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.830
 details of the blocks, the ones you can 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:53.229
 change completely than on the anvil and the 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.810
 kraft time to people changes but type of handle 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.509
 here to the fence around we also only 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.409
 put the top is not only a detail is 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.020
 equal 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.970
 surely it was not just him that was you 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.039
 What were you guys asking for was the 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.960
 anvil and also the cactus then 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.759
 forget to stop supporting the series in 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.190
 down but more important than that 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.690
 comment below the xbox you want 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.389
 You want to see it? 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.490
 Why will you appear in the video on 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.680
 the same screen as the participants who 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.090
 appeared in the video today is this question 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.080
 these people in the past video of 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.879
 sporting 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.280
 so do not forget that the channel 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.020
 stock because there will be our third 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.240
 video of a person who promised here 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.139
 a certain Friday 16th that day 10 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.719
 points 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.599
 it rained in the tank it will leave on Sunday 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:38.949
 Sunday beauty then this kind Sunday and 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.719
 probably later she went on to 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.130
 Wednesday will see the place where you 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.440
 to be more or less these days the people 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.509
 so I hope they have tanned it 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.009
 thanks guys who commented on the blocks 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.110
 continue like this because you must give us 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.610
 much more idea is beyond blogging forums 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.710
 wins also makes the details that you 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.830
 want to see if the staff spoke or 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.620
 they wanted anvil with an ax and that 's a 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.029
 cut it up and also talked about 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.279
 cactus is that I find an idea that was 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.139
 very good and this shins spins then 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.430
 I committed under what you want and have 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.550
 a detail that you think would stay 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:13.210
 very good, but the extinction of the globe has come to 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.699
 see if it is to make a description of the block 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.979
 how do you think help also travels to 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:20.979
 burn looks we did here sends 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:23.110
 freedom is very great then the 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.060
 species has liked the texture so far 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.979
 just consult her neighbor icon here 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.750
 its spectrum of eating the meat is 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:33.669
 put pop said along with cool 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:35.259
 half of the orange was the series and is 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.180
 comment the blocks your sports car 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.430
 because Sunday will probably leave our 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.740
 our next episode there 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.230
 That's when I said the spock but one more 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.140
 to hyper next to this series 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.270
 is older and if using this seriousness 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.350
 who think so much time that the block 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.620
 people are going to do 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.620
 It's going to be very good so this is it folks 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.620
 Speaking
