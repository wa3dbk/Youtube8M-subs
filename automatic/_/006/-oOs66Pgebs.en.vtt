tulip stamp to create a background and

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.999 
tulip stamp to create a background and
then<00:05:06.419> I<00:05:06.449> glue<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.440> daily<00:05:07.800> paper<00:05:08.069> um<00:05:08.479> my<00:05:09.479> little

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
then I glue the daily paper um my little

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.459 
then I glue the daily paper um my little
project<00:05:11.009> I<00:05:11.330> didn't<00:05:12.330> like<00:05:12.449> that<00:05:12.479> step<00:05:13.169> that<00:05:13.349> was

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
project I didn't like that step that was

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.619 
project I didn't like that step that was
behind<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.979> leaf<00:05:14.250> so<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:14.639> just<00:05:15.000> used<00:05:15.300> New<00:05:15.479> York

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:15.629 
behind the leaf so I just used New York

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.080 
behind the leaf so I just used New York
colors<00:05:15.870> to<00:05:15.990> colorize<00:05:16.259> it<00:05:16.409> again<00:05:16.819> when<00:05:17.819> they<00:05:17.909> go

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
colors to colorize it again when they go

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.350 
colors to colorize it again when they go
in<00:05:18.270> with<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.599> stamps<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.580> make<00:05:20.580> sure<00:05:20.789> that<00:05:21.090> you

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
in with the stamps to make sure that you

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.360 
in with the stamps to make sure that you
won't<00:05:21.599> see<00:05:21.870> that<00:05:22.500> there<00:05:22.770> was<00:05:22.919> a<00:05:22.979> little

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
won't see that there was a little

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.379 
won't see that there was a little
mistake<00:05:24.560> now<00:05:25.560> I<00:05:25.590> put<00:05:25.919> that<00:05:26.069> one<00:05:26.219> aside<00:05:26.389> didn't

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
mistake now I put that one aside didn't

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.899 
mistake now I put that one aside didn't
feel<00:05:27.569> it<00:05:27.780> just<00:05:28.319> yet<00:05:28.590> with<00:05:28.889> that<00:05:29.069> one<00:05:29.250> so<00:05:29.699> I'm

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
feel it just yet with that one so I'm

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:34.309 
feel it just yet with that one so I'm
going<00:05:30.210> on<00:05:30.389> to<00:05:30.779> the<00:05:31.289> summer<00:05:31.710> one<00:05:32.009> and<00:05:33.139> I<00:05:34.139> thought

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
going on to the summer one and I thought

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.529 
going on to the summer one and I thought
I'm<00:05:34.469> gonna<00:05:34.650> use<00:05:34.889> these<00:05:35.069> big<00:05:35.370> big<00:05:35.669> sunflowers

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
I'm gonna use these big big sunflowers

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.730 
I'm gonna use these big big sunflowers
this<00:05:37.469> is<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.979> big<00:05:38.520> flowers<00:05:39.270> stamp<00:05:40.080> sheet<00:05:40.319> new

one well relatively new and and this

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.050 
one well relatively new and and this
point<00:05:45.560> if<00:05:46.560> I<00:05:46.710> use<00:05:46.949> deadly<00:05:47.250> paper<00:05:47.520> on<00:05:47.699> this<00:05:47.849> one

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
point if I use deadly paper on this one

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.850 
point if I use deadly paper on this one
then<00:05:48.270> I<00:05:48.300> need<00:05:48.599> to<00:05:48.630> do<00:05:48.930> deadly<00:05:49.319> paper<00:05:49.560> on<00:05:49.770> the

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
off the paper ones that's how it goes so

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.519 
off the paper ones that's how it goes so
I<00:05:57.330> just<00:05:57.659> stamp<00:05:58.020> a<00:05:58.259> bit<00:05:58.680> more<00:06:01.940> and<00:06:03.409> I<00:06:04.409> am

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:04.529

searching for the bird steps from a

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.689 
searching for the bird steps from a
beach<00:06:07.219> stamp<00:06:08.219> set<00:06:09.050> because<00:06:10.050> in<00:06:10.889> summer<00:06:11.310> the

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
beach stamp set because in summer the

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.230 
beach stamp set because in summer the
there<00:06:12.419> were<00:06:12.509> a<00:06:12.539> lot<00:06:12.900> of<00:06:12.930> birds<00:06:13.199> here<00:06:14.120> not<00:06:15.120> as

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
there were a lot of birds here not as

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.040 
there were a lot of birds here not as
many<00:06:15.419> as<00:06:15.509> in<00:06:15.659> spring<00:06:16.289> over<00:06:16.710> in<00:06:17.219> winter<00:06:17.550> but

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
many as in spring over in winter but

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.010 
many as in spring over in winter but
anyway<00:06:19.129> and<00:06:20.129> you<00:06:20.370> won't<00:06:20.550> see<00:06:20.729> anything<00:06:21.000> of<00:06:21.599> it

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
anyway and you won't see anything of it

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.159 
anyway and you won't see anything of it
later<00:06:22.529> but<00:06:22.919> I<00:06:22.979> just<00:06:23.400> glued<00:06:23.819> those<00:06:24.270> down<00:06:24.779> and<00:06:25.080> I

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
later but I just glued those down and I

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.990 
later but I just glued those down and I
thought<00:06:25.349> that<00:06:25.620> the<00:06:25.889> center<00:06:26.460> of<00:06:26.639> the<00:06:26.759> flower

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
thought that the center of the flower

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.269 
thought that the center of the flower
was<00:06:27.240> too<00:06:27.569> dark<00:06:27.810> so<00:06:28.229> I'm<00:06:28.710> just<00:06:28.889> going<00:06:29.039> in<00:06:29.250> with

00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:29.279 
was too dark so I'm just going in with

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:31.309 
was too dark so I'm just going in with
another<00:06:29.610> layer<00:06:29.909> of<00:06:30.000> deli<00:06:30.509> paper<00:06:30.779> with<00:06:31.050> another

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 
another layer of deli paper with another

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.610 
another layer of deli paper with another
color<00:06:31.590> and<00:06:32.120> glue<00:06:33.120> that<00:06:33.180> down<00:06:33.539> on<00:06:34.319> top<00:06:34.500> with

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
color and glue that down on top with

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.400 
color and glue that down on top with
that<00:06:34.649> one

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:44.480 

I<00:06:39.440> could<00:06:40.440> have<00:06:40.530> used<00:06:41.900> the<00:06:42.900> beach<00:06:43.110> beach<00:06:43.920> set

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
I could have used the beach beach set

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.270 
I could have used the beach beach set
easily<00:06:45.240> but<00:06:45.480> it<00:06:45.720> was<00:06:45.930> all<00:06:46.110> nature<00:06:46.470> light<00:06:46.680> so<00:06:46.980> I

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
easily but it was all nature light so I

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.590 
easily but it was all nature light so I
want<00:06:47.670> to<00:06:47.760> keep<00:06:48.030> it<00:06:48.960> into<00:06:49.470> the<00:06:49.800> nature<00:06:50.460> theme<00:06:50.970> so

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
want to keep it into the nature theme so

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.790 
want to keep it into the nature theme so
flowers<00:06:52.500> trees<00:06:52.770> leaves<00:06:53.310> and<00:06:53.900> this<00:06:54.900> is<00:06:55.620> the

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
flowers trees leaves and this is the

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.070 
flowers trees leaves and this is the
deli<00:06:56.040> paper<00:06:56.340> that<00:06:56.640> I'm<00:06:56.790> using<00:06:57.030> for<00:06:57.240> the<00:06:57.720> leaves

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 
deli paper that I'm using for the leaves

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.380 
deli paper that I'm using for the leaves
as<00:06:58.230> well<00:06:58.260> and<00:06:58.590> I'm<00:06:58.680> happy<00:06:58.770> that<00:06:59.310> I<00:06:59.460> did<00:06:59.730> that<00:06:59.910> it

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390 
as well and I'm happy that I did that it

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.080 
as well and I'm happy that I did that it
looked<00:07:00.450> better<00:07:00.870> this<00:07:01.560> way

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
looked better this way
