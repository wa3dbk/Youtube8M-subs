know<00:02:20.900> ten<00:02:21.500> percent<00:02:21.830> vinegar<00:02:22.220> ninety<00:02:22.820> percent

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
know ten percent vinegar ninety percent

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.520 
know ten percent vinegar ninety percent
distilled<00:02:23.450> water<00:02:23.690> through<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.019> would<00:02:24.350> be<00:02:24.500> a

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
distilled water through it would be a

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.710 
distilled water through it would be a
good<00:02:24.620> idea<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.980> get<00:02:25.130> any<00:02:25.280> scaling<00:02:25.640> or<00:02:26.030> algae

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
good idea to get any scaling or algae

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.890 
good idea to get any scaling or algae
out<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.049> your<00:02:27.200> pump<00:02:27.650> if<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.160> have<00:02:28.430> some<00:02:29.090> still

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
out of your pump if you have some still

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.789 
out of your pump if you have some still
brand<00:02:30.049> new<00:02:30.110> pump<00:02:30.320> thing<00:02:30.470> or<00:02:30.560> three<00:02:30.650> about

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
brand new pump thing or three about

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.130 
brand new pump thing or three about
cleaning<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.250> now<00:02:32.209> these<00:02:32.390> should<00:02:32.930> just

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
cleaning it now these should just

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.180 
cleaning it now these should just
separate<00:02:33.970> like<00:02:34.970> so<00:02:35.269> there<00:02:35.720> we<00:02:35.840> go<00:02:36.010> looks<00:02:37.010> like

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
separate like so there we go looks like

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.330 
separate like so there we go looks like
we're<00:02:37.340> pretty<00:02:37.370> clean<00:02:37.730> inside<00:02:38.030> here<00:02:38.269> for<00:02:38.480> mine

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
we're pretty clean inside here for mine

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.819 
we're pretty clean inside here for mine
so<00:02:40.340> that's<00:02:40.489> not<00:02:40.610> bad<00:02:40.850> so<00:02:41.660> there's<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.049> old

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
so that's not bad so there's the old

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.319 
so that's not bad so there's the old
piece<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.459> can<00:02:43.579> get<00:02:43.700> different<00:02:43.880> covers

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
piece and you can get different covers

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.000 
piece and you can get different covers
suit<00:02:44.989> your<00:02:45.140> needs<00:02:45.320> there<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.590> found<00:02:45.739> there's<00:02:45.980> a

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
suit your needs there I found there's a

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.530 
suit your needs there I found there's a
whole<00:02:46.160> bunch<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.400> different<00:02:46.700> kinds<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.390> now

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
whole bunch of different kinds so now

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.020 
whole bunch of different kinds so now
we're<00:02:47.959> going<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.110> mount<00:02:48.320> our<00:02:48.470> new<00:02:48.739> foe<00:02:49.730> be<00:02:49.910> at

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
we're going to mount our new foe be at

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.520 
we're going to mount our new foe be at
one<00:02:50.209> on<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:51.739> it<00:02:51.799> literally<00:02:52.040> sinks<00:02:52.519> right<00:02:53.530> on

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
one on so it literally sinks right on

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.580 
one on so it literally sinks right on

how<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.250> heck<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.489> seals<00:02:56.879> oh<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:57.840> going<00:02:57.930> to

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
how the heck that seals oh it's going to

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.960 
how the heck that seals oh it's going to
rotor<00:02:58.170> seal<00:02:58.410> okay<00:02:58.769> cool<00:02:58.980> all<00:02:59.640> right<00:02:59.760> maybe<00:02:59.879> I

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
rotor seal okay cool all right maybe I

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.190 
rotor seal okay cool all right maybe I
have<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.150> change<00:03:00.360> anything<00:03:00.540> about<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.989> okay

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
have to change anything about it okay

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.850 
have to change anything about it okay
cool<00:03:01.349> so<00:03:02.190> mount<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.150> like<00:03:03.180> that<00:03:03.650> get<00:03:04.650> your

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
cool so mount it like that get your

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.110 
cool so mount it like that get your
screw<00:03:05.190> kit<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:07.760> because<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.849> reason<00:03:08.970> why

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
screw kit and because the reason why

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.250 
screw kit and because the reason why
you're<00:03:09.209> going<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.450> use<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.569> different<00:03:10.050> screw

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
you're going to use a different screw

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.949 
you're going to use a different screw
kit<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.620> because<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.550> has<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:12.420> finer<00:03:12.660> screws

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
kit is because it has a finer screws

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.380 
kit is because it has a finer screws
because<00:03:13.200> machine<00:03:13.500> screws<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.920> some<00:03:14.040> postures

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
because machine screws and some postures

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.699 
because machine screws and some postures
change<00:03:15.390> your<00:03:15.569> bid<00:03:15.720> over<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.110> Phillips<00:03:16.650> head

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
change your bid over to a Phillips head

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.190 
change your bid over to a Phillips head
I<00:03:17.129> wish<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.970> use<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.120> Robinson<00:03:18.690> or<00:03:18.840> torques

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
I wish the use of Robinson or torques

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.789 
I wish the use of Robinson or torques
it's<00:03:19.379> a<00:03:19.410> lot<00:03:19.590> better<00:03:19.739> than<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.069> Phillips<00:03:21.799> and

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
it's a lot better than the Phillips and

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.630 
it's a lot better than the Phillips and
then<00:03:22.970> we're<00:03:23.970> going<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.150> switch<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.750> over<00:03:24.930> as

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
then we're going to switch that over as

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.309 
then we're going to switch that over as
you<00:03:26.640> can<00:03:26.910> see<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.239> if<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.959> don't<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.230> the

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
you can see the if you don't have the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.900 
you can see the if you don't have the
right<00:03:28.349> Phillips<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.010> just<00:03:29.160> rips<00:03:29.430> Robo<00:03:29.760> it

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
right Phillips that it just rips Robo it

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.500 
right Phillips that it just rips Robo it
just<00:03:30.180> starts<00:03:30.360> slipping<00:03:30.840> right<00:03:31.110> away<00:03:35.510> make

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
just starts slipping right away make

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.589 
just starts slipping right away make
sure<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:36.780> lined<00:03:36.959> up<00:03:38.090> now<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.450> might<00:03:39.569> notice

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
sure it's lined up now you might notice

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.210 
sure it's lined up now you might notice
that<00:03:40.110> I'm<00:03:40.200> doing<00:03:40.319> it<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.590> bit<00:03:40.769> on<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.920> cross

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
that I'm doing it a bit on a cross

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.580 
that I'm doing it a bit on a cross
pattern<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:42.150> reason<00:03:42.480> why<00:03:42.599> I'm<00:03:42.750> doing<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:43.319> is

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
pattern the reason why I'm doing that is

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.940 
pattern the reason why I'm doing that is
so<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.950> get<00:03:44.099> even<00:03:44.459> compression<00:03:45.360> on<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:46.140> seal

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
so you get even compression on the seal

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.610 
so you get even compression on the seal
now<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:47.970> goes<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:48.660> goes<00:03:48.870> true<00:03:49.140> for<00:03:49.379> putting

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
now this goes this goes true for putting

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.069 
now this goes this goes true for putting
on<00:03:49.709> cpu<00:03:50.250> coolers<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.879> as<00:03:51.569> well<00:03:51.750> as<00:03:51.840> even

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
on cpu coolers and as well as even

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.710 
on cpu coolers and as well as even
putting<00:03:52.230> on<00:03:52.379> tire<00:03:52.650> tires<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.700> for<00:03:54.540> anything

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
putting on tire tires so for anything

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.970 
putting on tire tires so for anything
you're<00:03:54.989> doing<00:03:55.019> something<00:03:55.500> like<00:03:55.620> this<00:03:55.680> you're

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
you're doing something like this you're

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.430 
you're doing something like this you're
going<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.160> want<00:03:56.280> even<00:03:56.579> compression<00:03:57.349> so<00:03:58.349> you

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
going to want even compression so you

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.050 
going to want even compression so you
get<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.620> nice<00:03:58.860> good<00:03:59.310> seal<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.670> then<00:04:02.940> we're

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
get a nice good seal and then we're

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.059 
get a nice good seal and then we're
going<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.209> go<00:04:03.269> back<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:04.170> star<00:04:04.440> pattern<00:04:04.650> and

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
going to go back and a star pattern and

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.569 
going to go back and a star pattern and
the<00:04:05.340> first<00:04:05.670> pattern<00:04:06.030> we<00:04:06.120> came<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.660> and

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
the first pattern we came and and

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.620 
the first pattern we came and and
retighten<00:04:08.579> everything<00:04:08.880> down<00:04:09.090> make<00:04:09.600> sure

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
retighten everything down make sure

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.170 
retighten everything down make sure
we're<00:04:09.900> good<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.410> we<00:04:11.190> are<00:04:11.400> good<00:04:11.609> so<00:04:11.940> there<00:04:12.060> we

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
we're good and we are good so there we

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.949 
we're good and we are good so there we
go<00:04:12.209> this<00:04:12.780> pump<00:04:13.230> has<00:04:13.440> now<00:04:13.590> been<00:04:13.799> upgraded<00:04:13.980> to
