relationship I'll try to get a Sonali on
this<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.430> depends<00:01:35.880> on

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
this one I really think that depends on

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.240 
this one I really think that depends on
the<00:01:36.060> girl<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.320> way<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.530> figured<00:01:37.950> out<00:01:38.100> is

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the girl and the way you figured out is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.920 
the girl and the way you figured out is
having<00:01:38.549> open<00:01:38.850> communication<00:01:39.000> from<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
having open communication from the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.800 
having open communication from the
beginning<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.880> kind<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.030> seeing<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.509> hey<00:01:42.750> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
beginning so kind of seeing like hey you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.539 
beginning so kind of seeing like hey you
know<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:45.079> want<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.200> try<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.409> thing<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.159> you

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
know I I want to try this thing and you

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.830 
know I I want to try this thing and you
know<00:01:47.700> would<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:47.970> feel<00:01:48.240> comfortable<00:01:48.270> doing

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
know would you feel comfortable doing

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.870 
know would you feel comfortable doing
that<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.320> sounds<00:01:49.680> very<00:01:49.860> scripted<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.610> think

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
that it sounds very scripted but I think

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.780 
that it sounds very scripted but I think
that<00:01:51.060> would<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> lot<00:01:51.600> better<00:01:51.630> than<00:01:52.790> putting

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
that would be a lot better than putting

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.609 
that would be a lot better than putting
it<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.060> her<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:54.720> figuring<00:01:55.229> out<00:01:55.380> she

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it in her but then figuring out she

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.219 
it in her but then figuring out she
actually<00:01:55.710> hates<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> would<00:01:57.420> say<00:01:57.659> that

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
actually hates that so I would say that

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.719 
actually hates that so I would say that
would<00:01:58.409> become<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.740> best<00:01:59.070> way<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.490> because

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
would become the best way to go because

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.719 
would become the best way to go because
some<00:02:00.090> girls<00:02:00.360> do<00:02:00.899> want<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> do<00:02:01.409> things<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.070> are

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
some girls do want to do things and are

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.429 
some girls do want to do things and are
curious<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.450> they<00:02:03.600> don't<00:02:03.780> want<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.020> seem<00:02:04.229> like

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
curious but they don't want to seem like

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.670 
curious but they don't want to seem like
sluts<00:02:04.880> but<00:02:05.880> not<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.240> fast<00:02:06.479> rushing<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.469> part

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
sluts but not so fast rushing that part

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.050 
sluts but not so fast rushing that part
of<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.799> relationship<00:02:08.280> isn't<00:02:08.459> necessarily

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
of the relationship isn't necessarily

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.390 
of the relationship isn't necessarily
the<00:02:09.390> best<00:02:09.539> idea<00:02:09.929> Christy<00:02:10.920> makes<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> case<00:02:11.370> for

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the best idea Christy makes the case for

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.500 
the best idea Christy makes the case for
holding<00:02:11.879> off<00:02:11.970> at<00:02:12.420> least<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.050> short<00:02:13.290> term

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
holding off at least in the short term

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.839 
holding off at least in the short term
I<00:02:13.599> think<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.500> holding<00:02:15.010> off<00:02:15.159> on<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
I think that that holding off on the

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.179 
I think that that holding off on the
physical<00:02:16.239> part<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:17.019> relationship<00:02:17.230> can<00:02:17.890> only

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
physical part of a relationship can only

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.890 
physical part of a relationship can only
lead<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.549> good<00:02:18.760> things<00:02:18.819> because<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.659> get<00:02:19.780> to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
lead to good things because you get to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.020 
lead to good things because you get to
learn<00:02:20.019> about<00:02:20.079> somebody<00:02:20.790> with<00:02:22.140> out<00:02:24.000> having<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
learn about somebody with out having the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.289 
learn about somebody with out having the
physical<00:02:25.480> part<00:02:25.959> sway<00:02:26.590> your<00:02:26.860> opinion<00:02:27.030> cuz<00:02:28.030> once

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
physical part sway your opinion cuz once

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.479 
physical part sway your opinion cuz once
