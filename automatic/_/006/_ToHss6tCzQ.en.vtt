to<00:00:43.410> make<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> couple<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.730> changes<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
to make a couple of changes and the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.970 
to make a couple of changes and the
first<00:00:46.140> stint<00:00:46.260> change<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.710> I'm<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
first stint change that I'm going to

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.240 
first stint change that I'm going to
make<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.430> right<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> paper<00:00:49.129> this<00:00:50.129> is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
make is right here on the paper this is

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.430 
make is right here on the paper this is
going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.670> all<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.270> text<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.890 
I'm going to slide him over here and see
still<00:02:14.570> sliding<00:02:14.930> over<00:02:17.320> okay<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:20.120> he<00:02:20.390> slides<00:02:20.690> up

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
still sliding over okay and he slides up

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.600 
still sliding over okay and he slides up
and<00:02:21.940> then<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.180> fades<00:02:23.510> in<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:25.220> slides

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
and then this fades in and this slides

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.320 
and then this fades in and this slides
over<00:02:26.060> okay<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.230> sounds<00:02:27.560> good<00:02:28.180> maybe<00:02:29.180> I'll

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
over okay that sounds good maybe I'll

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.910 
over okay that sounds good maybe I'll
even<00:02:29.420> make<00:02:29.660> this<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.989> little<00:02:30.170> bit<00:02:30.350> bigger

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:45.270 

the<00:02:37.920> key<00:02:39.140> make<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.290> slightly<00:02:40.500> bigger

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.390 

so<00:02:46.280> now<00:02:46.490> it<00:02:47.950> animates<00:02:48.950> in<00:02:50.890> now<00:02:51.890> I<00:02:51.920> have<00:02:52.130> more

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
so now it animates in now I have more

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.450 
so now it animates in now I have more
room<00:02:52.640> or<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.270> text<00:02:53.840> that's<00:02:53.960> going<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.260> appear

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
room or the text that's going to appear

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.980 
room or the text that's going to appear
ok<00:02:55.460> so<00:02:55.520> after<00:02:55.850> all<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.270> these<00:02:56.510> animations

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
ok so after all of these animations

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.490 
ok so after all of these animations
happen<00:02:57.760> I'm<00:02:58.760> on<00:02:58.970> frame<00:02:59.300> 50<00:02:59.840> I'm<00:03:00.050> going<00:03:00.320> to<00:03:00.380> need

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
happen I'm on frame 50 I'm going to need

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.190 
happen I'm on frame 50 I'm going to need
to<00:03:00.620> add<00:03:00.770> some<00:03:00.800> more<00:03:01.430> frames<00:03:02.090> for<00:03:02.930> what's<00:03:03.110> going

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
to add some more frames for what's going

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.110 
to add some more frames for what's going
to<00:03:03.350> happen<00:03:03.650> next<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.220> what<00:03:04.400> he<00:03:04.550> does<00:03:04.730> is<00:03:04.760> he

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
to happen next and what he does is he

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.180 
to happen next and what he does is he
goes<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.870> top<00:03:06.110> layer<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.650> he<00:03:06.740> adds<00:03:06.890> two

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
goes to the top layer and he adds two

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.320 
goes to the top layer and he adds two
new<00:03:07.220> layers<00:03:08.320> 12<00:03:09.320> ok<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.280> first<00:03:10.460> layer<00:03:10.760> he

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
new layers 12 ok the first layer he

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.810 
new layers 12 ok the first layer he
calls<00:03:11.660> page<00:03:12.560> content<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:13.460> I'm<00:03:13.520> going<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.730> do

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
calls page content so I'm going to do

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.820 
calls page content so I'm going to do
that<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.620> page<00:03:15.620> content<00:03:16.220> ok<00:03:17.350> or<00:03:18.350> I'll<00:03:18.800> just

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
that to page content ok or I'll just

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.310 
that to page content ok or I'll just
call<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:19.250> content<00:03:19.790> all<00:03:20.330> right<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.630> then<00:03:20.690> layer

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
call it content all right and then layer

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.340 
call it content all right and then layer
10<00:03:21.740> he<00:03:22.550> does<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.970> one<00:03:23.180> also<00:03:23.390> calls<00:03:24.140> that

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
10 he does that one also calls that

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.790 
10 he does that one also calls that
labels<00:03:25.930> ok<00:03:28.990> I'm<00:03:29.990> going<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.230> have<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:30.350> guys<00:03:30.560> do

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
labels ok I'm going to have you guys do

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.430 
labels ok I'm going to have you guys do
one<00:03:31.040> more<00:03:31.280> okay<00:03:31.910> well<00:03:32.690> we'll<00:03:32.930> start<00:03:33.200> with<00:03:33.290> that

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
one more okay well we'll start with that

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.290 
one more okay well we'll start with that
actually<00:03:33.770> that's<00:03:33.890> fine<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.400> we'll<00:03:35.060> scroll

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
actually that's fine and we'll scroll

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.600 
actually that's fine and we'll scroll
over<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.900> last<00:03:36.110> animation<00:03:36.740> happens<00:03:37.220> here

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
over and the last animation happens here

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.540 
over and the last animation happens here
and<00:03:37.760> on<00:03:38.750> 50<00:03:39.320> I'm<00:03:39.440> free<00:03:39.680> at<00:03:39.770> last<00:03:40.010> animation

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
and on 50 I'm free at last animation

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.790 
and on 50 I'm free at last animation
happens<00:03:40.820> at<00:03:40.910> 47<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:41.660> you<00:03:41.720> can<00:03:41.930> pick<00:03:42.080> any<00:03:42.320> frame

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
happens at 47 so you can pick any frame

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.130 
happens at 47 so you can pick any frame
I'm<00:03:43.430> going<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:43.670> pick<00:03:43.880> 50<00:03:44.270> because<00:03:44.840> all<00:03:45.020> the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
I'm going to pick 50 because all the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.420 
I'm going to pick 50 because all the
animation<00:03:45.620> has<00:03:45.710> already<00:03:45.890> happened<00:03:46.160> and

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
animation has already happened and

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.400 
animation has already happened and
that's<00:03:47.330> where<00:03:47.570> he<00:03:47.660> starts<00:03:47.960> putting<00:03:48.200> some

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
that's where he starts putting some

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.650 
that's where he starts putting some
keyframes<00:03:48.770> so<00:03:49.550> he<00:03:49.730> does<00:03:49.910> this<00:03:50.090> he<00:03:50.360> puts<00:03:50.540> a

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
keyframes so he does this he puts a

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.820 
keyframes so he does this he puts a
keyframe<00:03:51.080> here<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:52.340> he<00:03:52.430> was<00:03:52.520> f6<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.590> f6<00:03:54.590> and

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
keyframe here and he was f6 and f6 and

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.940 
keyframe here and he was f6 and f6 and
then<00:03:55.489> 5<00:03:56.209> 10<00:03:56.780> frames<00:03:57.050> ahead<00:03:57.230> he<00:03:57.530> puts<00:03:57.770> another

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
then 5 10 frames ahead he puts another

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.390 
then 5 10 frames ahead he puts another
keyframe<00:03:58.250> f6f<00:03:59.239> six<00:04:00.110> and<00:04:01.270> then<00:04:02.270> and<00:04:03.110> I<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.470> then

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
keyframe f6f six and then and I and then

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.810 
keyframe f6f six and then and I and then
he<00:04:04.459> goes<00:04:04.610> 10<00:04:04.880> frames<00:04:05.150> ahead<00:04:05.770> and<00:04:06.770> puts<00:04:07.610> another

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
he goes 10 frames ahead and puts another

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.400 
he goes 10 frames ahead and puts another
keyframe<00:04:08.150> I'm<00:04:08.600> actually<00:04:08.810> going<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.140> drag<00:04:09.380> this

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
keyframe I'm actually going to drag this

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.840 
keyframe I'm actually going to drag this
over<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:09.950> do<00:04:10.070> like<00:04:10.310> seven<00:04:10.940> frames<00:04:11.180> ahead<00:04:12.820> so<00:04:13.820> I

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
over and do like seven frames ahead so I

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.039 
over and do like seven frames ahead so I
just<00:04:14.060> make<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:14.630> a<00:04:14.750> little<00:04:14.870> more<00:04:14.959> visible<00:04:17.049> see

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
just make it a little more visible see

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.400 
just make it a little more visible see
here<00:04:18.380> f6<00:04:19.340> if<00:04:20.120> six<00:04:20.540> doesn't<00:04:20.900> matter<00:04:21.049> exactly

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
here f6 if six doesn't matter exactly

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.490 
here f6 if six doesn't matter exactly
how<00:04:21.769> many<00:04:21.980> frames<00:04:22.280> is<00:04:22.750> ok<00:04:23.750> so<00:04:23.810> I've<00:04:24.110> just<00:04:24.140> done

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
how many frames is ok so I've just done

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.790 
how many frames is ok so I've just done
that<00:04:25.010> all<00:04:25.490> right<00:04:25.640> so<00:04:25.970> he<00:04:26.120> does<00:04:26.330> four<00:04:27.260> sets<00:04:27.650> of

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
that all right so he does four sets of

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.909 
that all right so he does four sets of
keyframes<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:28.960> then<00:04:29.960> he<00:04:30.050> puts<00:04:30.260> labeled

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
keyframes and then he puts labeled

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.659 
keyframes and then he puts labeled
content<00:04:31.630> inside<00:04:32.630> of<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.080> keyframes<00:04:33.560> he<00:04:34.370> calls

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
content inside of the keyframes he calls

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.640 
content inside of the keyframes he calls
the<00:04:34.970> first<00:04:35.210> one<00:04:35.480> he<00:04:35.900> says<00:04:36.200> on<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.440> frame

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
the first one he says on the frame

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.400 
the first one he says on the frame
labels<00:04:37.040> he<00:04:37.160> clicks<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.610> keyframe<00:04:38.060> and<00:04:38.410> then

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
labels he clicks the keyframe and then

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.260 
labels he clicks the keyframe and then
goes<00:04:39.620> down<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:40.040> property<00:04:40.490> window<00:04:40.640> and<00:04:41.030> types

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
goes down the property window and types

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.070 
goes down the property window and types
in<00:04:41.510> home<00:04:42.880> ok<00:04:43.880> and<00:04:44.090> then<00:04:44.270> hits<00:04:44.480> enter<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.050> now

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080
