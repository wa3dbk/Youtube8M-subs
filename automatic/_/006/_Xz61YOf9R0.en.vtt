00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.260
 to get the achievement of the tank 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.570
 win first we must download the 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.460
 package mission from the start and 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.349
 we also have to play it 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.070
 obligatorily in the most difficult 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.259
 difficult legendary when starting the mission 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.259
 we leave or advance the scene of 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.419
 home that is optional we clear the 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.989
 area and we make sure that we have to 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.370
 butt the ammunition of the sea and from there 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.219
 we move towards the scorpion tank 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.559
 Now surely you have a 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.390
 doubt since the description of the achievement 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.149
 says you have to spend it with the 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.730
 tank intact what they really 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.679
 they wanted to say is that they do not owe you 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.199
 destroy the tank even if it is very 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.710
 damaged as long as they do not destroy it they will give you 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.710
 the achievement 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.480
 for me 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.050
 by destroying the antiaircraft covenant 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.490
 the falcons will come to your aid 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.150
 take advantage of the assistance you will have for 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.150
 go ahead 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.480
 forever 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.329
 in this part there will be 2 robben before and 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.210
 several turrets 6 scattered all over the 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.640
 area the recommended thing here is to kill the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.830
 which is inside those turrets using 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.450
 the yolk for something I had told the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.849
 principle that this weapon you had to 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.370
 stop do not worry about stolen before 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.830
 now believe me they will not be so annoying 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.050
 how are these turrets besides we 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.860
 we will take care of them with the tank a 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.860
 shortly after 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.860
 once all or at least the 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.530
 Most cheikh turrets climb the 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.890
 scorpion and finishes clearing well the 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.890
 zone 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.150
 then head towards the door and 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.800
 You must destroy the last revenant 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.750
 come to the door and after that 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.750
 have opened will give you this achievement 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.770
 Novelty all over the base
