 long time 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.770

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:48.730

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.340
 believe that those of the army is the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.140
 latest 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.570

 magnificent magnificent transition 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.910
 I tend to do this 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:03.830
 superimpose pioneers gd to skip this 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.330
 I'm going to sprout 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.330

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:32.940

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:57.620

 no case of flight tests in one shot there 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:46.370
 almost made known from episode 2 nimes 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.050
 during a junior night at ease in his 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.470
 room there is a small normal range to 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.680
 the end 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.440
 although he is in France through the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.180
 justin pink episode 3 is not bad too 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:03.620

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:06.129

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.129
 but nîmes 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.620
 it's true not these shitty cameras 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:30.310

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.030
 widely 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:43.060
 to assume without spanking thanks 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.669

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.150
 years there are better gocistes 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.030

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:37.070
 in fact for that leverage left 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:40.790
 will evolve the bonus characters if 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:51.910
 easily beaten double or jarrett 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:51.910
