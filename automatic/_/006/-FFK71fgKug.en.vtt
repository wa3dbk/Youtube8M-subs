 at we turn and we turn the content 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.659
 of the box all difficult with one 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.560
 hand and see the image of ours 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.869

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.140
 after is the microphone the microphone have 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.060

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:58.799
 so here there is and there are images of 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.640
 all the potentials of the del 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.320
 our our headphones 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.770
 then it says there is an adapter 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.770
 included 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.880
 nothing here is written there 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.570
 section the various explanations explains i 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.960
 various elements that make up ours 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.020
 headphones 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.120
 but no more talk we are going to open 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.700
 our box that I obviously have 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.330
 already open since I had to use it 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.860
 to see if they were good 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:41.420
 or not this merit of the work has changed 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.420
 all sorry a sorry hand here 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.440
 I'll call the box away go away 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:56.490
 here we see our beautiful headphones 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:58.560
 disorder behind we open taste once 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.810
 here are our boys headphones 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.690
 very but very beautiful girls also at 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.970
 feel this feels good 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.880
 I don't know what ever much material is 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:15.959
 beautiful even here behind these are 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:18.500
 adjustable that is you can use them 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.680
 adjustable 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.019
 we open and with your headphones here 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.540
 guys there's the adapter for her on 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.739
 microphone is not seen from where there is the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.390
 computer 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:36.000
 this is the microphone adapter here 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.530
 there is our confusion of threads well 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.019
 let's talk 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.040
 let's analyze the threads there are a 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:47.760
 contract this is the regulator 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.239
 ie we say that is the central part 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:57.959
 the in our headphones here activates the 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:59.790
 microphone on if you see a microphone 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.370
 off and on 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.299
 and what turns on this side 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.359
 we find smh which means that for 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:12.209
 turn up the volume to lower the emblem 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.189
 of the right to the very beautiful on the other 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.909
 side what we see on the other side 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.690
 we see 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:22.019
 sorry for purposes here is the volume 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.380
 it's another time in volume but the volume 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.759
 of the game then lower lower and 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.530
 then boy is a very important thing 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:34.680
 is whether to set seven offices must 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.669
 use either for pc or for playstation or for 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.440
 xbox 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.190
 obviously the playstation set up yes 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.840
 they can easily change that way 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:51.229
 change it changes even if from pc 1a pc2 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:53.789
 you can change one thing about the clip 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.280
 as they are very annoying and I can 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.759
 trimmings bother you very much they stick 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.820
 to the shirt or trousers they and 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:07.080
 they are very very very block 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:11.780
 useful and here at the end of all these 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.639
 wires here is the usb adapter and two cables 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.440
 perhaps to put in the pc or maybe in the 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.099
 TV would put in 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.760
 television 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:23.280
 however this here or perhaps also in the 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.039
 xbox I've never tried for the xbox but 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.099
 he thinks he even puts himself on the 360 ​​is 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:32.729
 this I used it there I put it 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:35.220
 in the playstation and guys I repeat it 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:39.050
 it really feels really good 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.050
 these headphones are really well made 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.229
 we see in all their splendor 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:55.250
 really done very well guys and the 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.800
 brand and as I repeat to the said sorry 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.759
 a moment later I leave it so can 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:05.629
 take the microphone I said I am 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:09.650

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:16.180
 from gamestop moves 49 euros as 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:19.300
 we can see the adjustable microphone 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:29.000
 then to just need them 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:31.639
 fit them for good, maybe the only one 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 striano we fit here it is must 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:37.370
 feel the bang in a click 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.470
 let's put some light into it and to 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:44.210
