accurate overall exposure and

accurate overall exposure and
comparatively<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.770> exposures<00:02:45.400> from<00:02:45.520> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
comparatively so the exposures from the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.740 
comparatively so the exposures from the
60d<00:02:46.780> were<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.440> better<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.920> two<00:02:48.750> the

60d were the better of the two the

autofocus speeds of both cameras are

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.920 
autofocus speeds of both cameras are
certainly<00:02:51.459> very<00:02:51.640> impressive<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.510> Canon

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
certainly very impressive and the Canon

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.240 
certainly very impressive and the Canon
offers<00:02:53.140> nine<00:02:53.350> points<00:02:53.740> all<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:54.070> which<00:02:54.160> are

offers nine points all of which are

cross type sensitivity basically means

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.580 
cross type sensitivity basically means
that<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.300> have<00:03:01.450> increased<00:03:01.840> sensitivity<00:03:02.080> in

that you have increased sensitivity in

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.890 
that you have increased sensitivity in

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
in terms of image quality the Canon

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.570 
in terms of image quality the Canon
produces<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.110> larger<00:03:29.530> files<00:03:29.769> of<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.100> two<00:03:30.310> and
