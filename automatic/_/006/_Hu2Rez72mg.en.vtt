00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.140
 in recent years the zombies are 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.420
 returned to the limelight in all fields 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.919
 from TV to video games with a big one 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.380
 number of products they were looking for 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.029
 recreate more or less successful ways 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.399
 a world victim of a non- epidemic 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.290
 few died , however, they succeeded 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.059
 as boys of undead lab author of 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.270
 state of the key title released 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.890
 in summer 2013 on xbox 360 and on pc in 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.719
 able to bewitch in a very short time 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.519
 all fans of the genre 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.170
 the attraction was all in the idea of 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.300
 survival transmitted by the videogame 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.620
 with the player in constant danger is 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.929
 never really safe 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.030
 today almost two years after 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.769
 original release status of that yes 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.989
 re-presents on xbox live with some 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.699
 graphic editing in this one edition 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.710
 containing in addition to the original game 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.050
 also two said to be released 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.699
 subsequently the top of cai throws us 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.950
 immediately in the middle of the action with 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.080
 marcus on vacation with a friend on the mountain 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.790
 turner and immediately involved in a fight 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.040
 with makeshift weapons against a group of 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.720
 zombie vanguard of the epidemic rules 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.579
 that we will find ourselves facing in 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.899
 game after escaping 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.450
 from the middle of our vacation 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.340
 we will find shelter a church seat of a 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.500
 group of survivors who will constitute 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.759
 the first nucleus of the community ea 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.159
 this point the game opens 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.619
 giving us the chance to explore the rules 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.670
 tribe county turnip 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.159
 characterized by a large plain in 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.079
 which are found factors and cultivated fields 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.700
 river three small towns is a number 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.829
 disproportionate of abandoned buildings 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.570
 all to explore to find useful 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.909
 resources and survivors to bring in 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.710
 except to increase the size of the 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.450
 our community is very important 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.130
 within the game is for help 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.939
 that people can guarantee us 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.890
 against the zombies 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.969
 yes because every npc has characteristics 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.710
 different 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.329
 we will therefore find characters with ability 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.070
 as a mechanic able to repair the 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.780
 our other specialized vehicles 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.369
 in the use of firearms and that 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.890
 we can employ as you see against the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.780
 zombies and many other types one 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.130
 however, a very large community requires a 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.880
 large number of resources to be able to 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.320
 to survive 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.150
 we will therefore often have to go to the 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.830
 search for food and medicine for the whole 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.200
 map always pay attention to 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.640
 constant zombie threat during 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.140
 our exploration should 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.480
 pay particular attention to 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.740
 load carried in the backpack since 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.420
 carrying excessive weight 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.400
 the stamina bar took place a lot 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.900
 quickly with the risk of leaving us 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.910
 breathless in the midst of a horde of 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.620
 impossible brain eater 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.510
 load an old rescue die 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.160
 in fact it means losing forever the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.480
 our character by forcing us to 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.950
 reason to always study the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.840
 situation before we move 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.910
 fundamental and therefore use a 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.440
 stealth approach in particular when 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.420
 we will be on a mission without the help of 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.890
 companions also make a little noise 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.410
 like breaking glass in a building 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.790
 can shoot with a firearm 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.890
 will attract both the two and neighbors 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.390
 forcing us to abandon resources 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.860
 found to flee more 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.600
 easily 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.130
 fortunately when we will be forced to 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.930
 fight we can count on a vast 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.310
 arsenal that includes weapons from 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.620
 fire is a long series of white weapons 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.120
 like knives and accept the system of 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.830
 combat announces however convinced 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.840
 fully seen that often also 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.730
 use a shoulder will be needed 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.560
 numerous shots to spread a zombie 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.630
 able to absorb our blows 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.040
 no visible consequences in addition to 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.750
 basic game that will keep you busy for 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.700
 over 20 hours just to finish the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.170
 there are also two main campaigns 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.870
 downloadable content capable of 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.709
 dramatically increase longevity 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.750
 breakdown is all about 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.060
 survival almost completely eliminated 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.200
 the narrative component and putting ourselves at 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.790
 command of a small group of 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.100
 survived with the only goal of 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.600
 stay alive for as long as possible 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.010
 once the resources in the 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.840
 our area we will be obliged to 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.730
 locate a camper that will have to be 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.799
 repaired and filled with gasoline for 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.329
 move a new area with women who 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.370
 become increasingly stronger and 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.720
 we will be aggressive with every move 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.310
 then forced to leave gods behind 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.930
 thus avoiding our group members 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.880
 the possibility of forming a true e 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.650
 own army of survivors in 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.880
 able to wipe out without difficulty 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.590
 all the undead 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.060
 lifeline represents one instead 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.160
 complete distortion with respect to 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.170
 basic game in this 10 we will be busy 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.400
 in the downforce town in command 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.680
 of a group of army soldiers 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.030
 United States committed to resist 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.070
 to zombie attacks and to save the 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.720
 last civilians left alive 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.250
 from the beginning we will have a 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.470
 very large number of firearms e 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.330
 ammunition but it's better to save them for 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.709
 the final stages of the campaign from 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.870
 duration of about five hours 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.520
 the town is indeed poor in 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.290
 ammunition often forcing us to 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.750
 escape in front of hordes of undead but it is 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.220
 so many stetur of that presents itself 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.170
 on xbox one with some improvements 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.840
 graphic improved lighting e 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.090
 a resolution brought to 1080p the truth 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.890
 problem as for the 360 ​​version remains 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.480
 however the framerate with enough declines 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.860
 old in the driving and play phases 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.990
 that almost gets stuck in the 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.210
 improved agitated situations 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.740
 finally also the animations despite there 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.360
 expect much more from 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.220
 developers saw that the compartment 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.900
 technician certainly did not shout at the 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.670
 miracle in the last edition 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.230
 been of that in this year one 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.970
 emissions is confirmed as a good title 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.040
 for all lovers of the survival genre 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.630
 with a constant fight against the zombies 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.850
 that never leave us a moment 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.830
 truce constantly forcing us to 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.780
 look for new resources to survive 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.190
 sin only for the presence of dips of 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.990
 framerate and for the absence of one 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.550
 multiplayer mode capable of 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.930
 further extend longevity 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.930
 already practically endless
