00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
setup because a lot of you guys like the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.060 
setup because a lot of you guys like the
way<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.929> put<00:00:16.139> down<00:00:16.170> territories<00:00:16.920> with

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
way that I put down territories with

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.769 
way that I put down territories with
that<00:00:17.190> Norfleet<00:00:17.640> rocket<00:00:18.000> launcher<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.480> you

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
that Norfleet rocket launcher and you

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.050 
that Norfleet rocket launcher and you
like<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> way<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> set<00:00:19.560> up<00:00:19.590> my<00:00:19.680> assassin<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.609> I'm

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
like the way I set up my assassin so I'm

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.880 
like the way I set up my assassin so I'm
gonna<00:00:21.300> show<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:22.050> skill<00:00:22.350> trees<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.800> I

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
gonna show you the skill trees that I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.950 
gonna show you the skill trees that I
have<00:00:23.130> through<00:00:23.460> gauge<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.970> necromancer<00:00:24.510> and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
have through gauge the necromancer and

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.830 
have through gauge the necromancer and
if<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.350> notice<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.859> don't<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.910> one<00:00:26.970> skill

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
if you notice I don't have not one skill

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.410 
if you notice I don't have not one skill
tree<00:00:28.109> maxed<00:00:28.560> out<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.369> reason<00:00:29.820> why<00:00:29.970> is

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
tree maxed out and the reason why is

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.939 
tree maxed out and the reason why is
because<00:00:30.480> there<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.109> certain<00:00:31.380> skills

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
because there are certain skills

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.549 
because there are certain skills
throughout<00:00:32.640> each<00:00:32.910> tree<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.960> lent<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> each

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
throughout each tree that lent to each

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.979 
throughout each tree that lent to each
other<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.100> make<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:36.059> powerful<00:00:36.300> setup

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
other and make a really powerful setup

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.190 
other and make a really powerful setup
so<00:00:37.500> first<00:00:37.800> off<00:00:38.100> I've<00:00:38.489> invested<00:00:39.149> heavily<00:00:39.329> into

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
so first off I've invested heavily into

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.229 
so first off I've invested heavily into
the<00:00:40.320> anarchy<00:00:40.890> tree<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.550> know<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> lot<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the anarchy tree now I know a lot of

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.030 
the anarchy tree now I know a lot of
people<00:00:42.690> don't<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.230> understand<00:00:43.950> how

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
people don't really understand how

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.279 
people don't really understand how
anarchy<00:00:44.730> works<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> set<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:45.989> up<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
anarchy works and if you set it up the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.470 
anarchy works and if you set it up the
way<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.800> set<00:00:47.129> up<00:00:47.160> every<00:00:47.850> time<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.239> kill

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
way I have it set up every time you kill

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.000 
way I have it set up every time you kill
an<00:00:48.570> enemy<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.989> hit-and<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.469> weapon

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
an enemy in a hit-and your weapon

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.130 
an enemy in a hit-and your weapon
reloads<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.760> its<00:00:50.940> own<00:00:51.120> you're<00:00:51.690> gonna<00:00:51.840> gain<00:00:52.079> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
reloads on its own you're gonna gain a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.950 
reloads on its own you're gonna gain a
stack<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> anarchy<00:00:53.219> if<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.940> reload<00:00:54.480> before

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
stack of anarchy if you reload before

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.590 
stack of anarchy if you reload before
that<00:00:55.440> clip<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.920> empty<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.910> gonna<00:00:57.210> start<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
that clip is empty it's gonna start to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.569 
that clip is empty it's gonna start to
lose<00:00:57.870> energy<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.980> that's<00:00:59.190> alright<00:00:59.520> because

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
lose energy but that's alright because

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.580 
lose energy but that's alright because
we<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.300> invested<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.930> skill<00:01:01.260> called

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
we have invested in a skill called

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.100 
we have invested in a skill called
discord<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.300> court<00:01:03.629> does<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
discord and what this court does it

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.950 
discord and what this court does it
allows<00:01:04.739> us<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.430> stop<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.150> Anarchy<00:01:06.720> from

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
allows us to stop the Anarchy from

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.080 
allows us to stop the Anarchy from
losing<00:01:07.350> stacks<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.549> go<00:01:08.700> ahead<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
losing stacks so if you go ahead and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450 
losing stacks so if you go ahead and
shoot<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.659> more<00:01:09.869> shot<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:10.920> reload

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
shoot one more shot and then reload

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.910 
shoot one more shot and then reload
it'll<00:01:12.030> stop<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.330> anarchy<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> really

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it'll stop the anarchy but the really

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.620 
it'll stop the anarchy but the really
cool<00:01:14.100> thing<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.030> court<00:01:15.360> while

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
cool thing is is with this court while

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.600 
cool thing is is with this court while
you're<00:01:15.960> losing<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:16.890> anarchy

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
you're losing your anarchy

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
you're losing your anarchy
you're<00:01:17.880> also<00:01:18.080> regenerating<00:01:19.080> your<00:01:19.229> health<00:01:19.500> so

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you're also regenerating your health so

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.440 
you're also regenerating your health so
that's<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.340> important<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.090> between

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
that's really important in between

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.120 
that's really important in between
battles<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.770> shoot<00:01:22.979> your

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
battles because you can just shoot your

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.420 
battles because you can just shoot your
gun<00:01:23.400> once<00:01:23.670> reload<00:01:24.479> start<00:01:25.110> discord<00:01:25.740> gave<00:01:26.250> your

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
gun once reload start discord gave your

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.520 
gun once reload start discord gave your
health<00:01:26.700> back<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.180> between<00:01:27.540> fights<00:01:27.810> shoot

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
health back in between fights shoot

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.710 
health back in between fights shoot
again<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.009> stop<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.759> Anarchy<00:01:30.210> from<00:01:30.420> losing

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
again and stop with Anarchy from losing

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.240 
again and stop with Anarchy from losing
stacks<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.409> only<00:01:31.590> lose<00:01:31.890> probably<00:01:32.100> about

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
stacks and you only lose probably about

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.920 
stacks and you only lose probably about
five<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.759> ten<00:01:32.939> stacks<00:01:33.210> from<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.540> which<00:01:33.689> isn't

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
five to ten stacks from that which isn't

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.740 
five to ten stacks from that which isn't
bad<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> middle<00:01:35.670> tree<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.299> kind<00:01:36.689> of

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
bad so what the middle tree is kind of

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.300 
bad so what the middle tree is kind of
more<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:36.990> four<00:01:37.380> elemental<00:01:37.920> damage

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
more like four elemental damage

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
more like four elemental damage
resistance<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.630> use<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> lot<00:01:40.320> of

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
resistance and I do use a lot of

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.679 
resistance and I do use a lot of
elemental<00:01:41.040> weapons<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.270> why<00:01:42.450> I've

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
elemental weapons so this is why I've

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.539 
elemental weapons so this is why I've
invested<00:01:43.170> into<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.409> tree<00:01:43.680> specifically

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
invested into this tree specifically

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.670 
invested into this tree specifically
because<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.060> electricity<00:01:45.509> part<00:01:45.990> because

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
because of the electricity part because

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.340 
because of the electricity part because
death<00:01:46.950> trap<00:01:47.280> does<00:01:47.549> use<00:01:47.850> electrical<00:01:48.450> damage<00:01:48.899> so

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
death trap does use electrical damage so

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.929 
death trap does use electrical damage so
I<00:01:49.380> wanted<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.860> boost<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.220> because<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.729> wanted

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
I wanted to boost that because I wanted

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.310 
I wanted to boost that because I wanted
my<00:01:51.060> death<00:01:51.270> trap<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> little<00:01:52.200> bit

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
my death trap to be a little bit

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800 
my death trap to be a little bit
powerful<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.159> if<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.790> notice<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> last<00:01:54.540> tree

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
powerful and if you notice the last tree

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.969 
powerful and if you notice the last tree
two<00:01:54.990> best<00:01:55.229> friends<00:01:55.290> forever

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
two best friends forever

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.830 
two best friends forever
I<00:01:56.130> wouldn't<00:01:56.700> really<00:01:56.850> go<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.329> buck<00:01:57.630> up

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
I wouldn't really go with the buck up

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.840 
I wouldn't really go with the buck up
that's<00:01:58.140> trap<00:01:58.469> ability<00:01:58.950> because<00:01:59.250> right<00:01:59.700> now

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that's trap ability because right now

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.940 
that's trap ability because right now
there's<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.149> bug<00:02:00.450> where<00:02:00.750> he<00:02:00.869> does<00:02:01.140> restore<00:02:01.649> some

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
there's a bug where he does restore some

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.069 
there's a bug where he does restore some
enemies<00:02:02.340> uh<00:02:02.369> shields<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.840> kind<00:02:04.020> of

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
enemies uh shields and that kind of

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.889 
enemies uh shields and that kind of
sucks<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:04.649> I've<00:02:05.040> invested<00:02:05.729> 5<00:02:06.000> out<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.299> 5<00:02:06.479> skill

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
sucks but I've invested 5 out of 5 skill

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.690 
sucks but I've invested 5 out of 5 skill
points<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.380> they're<00:02:07.799> close<00:02:08.129> enough<00:02:08.520> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
points and they're close enough and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.119 
points and they're close enough and
close<00:02:09.330> enough<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:10.410> important<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.039> this

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
close enough is really important to this

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.130 
close enough is really important to this
class<00:02:11.489> setup<00:02:11.849> because<00:02:12.209> as<00:02:12.540> you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
class setup because as you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.340 
class setup because as you
stacks<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.890> anarchy<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:15.030> lose<00:02:15.360> accuracy<00:02:15.960> so

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
stacks of anarchy you lose accuracy so

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.530 
stacks of anarchy you lose accuracy so
let's<00:02:16.650> see<00:02:16.860> what<00:02:17.070> this<00:02:17.190> looks<00:02:17.490> like<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.850> actual

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
let's see what this looks like in actual

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.140 
let's see what this looks like in actual
practice<00:02:19.100> part<00:02:20.100> right<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:20.370> we're<00:02:20.640> here<00:02:20.670> inside

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
practice part right so we're here inside

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.880 
practice part right so we're here inside
the<00:02:21.300> bloodshot<00:02:21.720> stronghold<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.620> reason

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the bloodshot stronghold and the reason

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.890 
the bloodshot stronghold and the reason
I<00:02:22.980> chose<00:02:23.010> bloodshot<00:02:23.760> stronghold<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.480> because

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
I chose bloodshot stronghold is because

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.900 
I chose bloodshot stronghold is because
it<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.170> indoors<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.310> wanted<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.670> show<00:02:26.850> you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
it is indoors and I wanted to show you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.700 
it is indoors and I wanted to show you
how<00:02:27.330> close<00:02:27.570> enough<00:02:27.990> works<00:02:28.260> especially

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
how close enough works especially

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.640 
how close enough works especially
indoors<00:02:29.490> because<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.480> beast<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.990> you

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
indoors because it is a beast and you

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.800 
indoors because it is a beast and you
also<00:02:32.010> notice<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.550> do<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> skill<00:02:33.570> that

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
also notice that I do have a skill that

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.530 
also notice that I do have a skill that
every<00:02:34.380> time<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.650> reload<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.850> lets<00:02:36.210> out<00:02:36.390> an

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
every time I reload it lets out an

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.510 
every time I reload it lets out an
electrical<00:02:36.990> shock<00:02:37.260> an<00:02:37.470> overcharge<00:02:37.920> which<00:02:38.370> is

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
electrical shock an overcharge which is

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.250 
electrical shock an overcharge which is
pretty<00:02:38.700> awesome<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.330> you'll<00:02:39.600> see<00:02:39.750> deathtrap

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
pretty awesome and you'll see deathtrap

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.810 
pretty awesome and you'll see deathtrap
being<00:02:40.560> worth<00:02:40.770> what<00:02:41.040> it's<00:02:41.160> sitting<00:02:41.400> inside<00:02:41.490> the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820

which<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.070> good<00:03:26.340> thing<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:27.299> once<00:03:27.870> your

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
which is a good thing so once your

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.479 
which is a good thing so once your
health<00:03:28.350> gets<00:03:28.590> up<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.950> point<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.370> where

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
health gets up to a point to where

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.520 
health gets up to a point to where
you're<00:03:29.700> comfortable<00:03:30.000> moving<00:03:30.930> on<00:03:31.080> with<00:03:31.320> and

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
you're comfortable moving on with and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.140 
you're comfortable moving on with and
you<00:03:31.860> don't<00:03:32.040> want<00:03:32.250> your<00:03:32.340> Anarchy<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.910> drain

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
you don't want your Anarchy to drain

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.930 
you don't want your Anarchy to drain
anymore<00:03:33.510> just<00:03:34.019> shoot<00:03:34.290> one<00:03:34.560> more<00:03:34.590> shot<00:03:35.040> reload

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
anymore just shoot one more shot reload

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.600 
anymore just shoot one more shot reload
and<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.660> deactivates<00:03:37.440> this<00:03:37.680> cord<00:03:38.010> it's<00:03:38.430> as

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
and it deactivates this cord it's as

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.220 
and it deactivates this cord it's as
simple<00:03:38.790> as<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.420> know<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.690> skill<00:03:39.959> trees

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
simple as that I know the skill trees

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.350 
simple as that I know the skill trees
makes<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.590> seem<00:03:40.799> really<00:03:41.340> complicated<00:03:41.820> but

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
makes it seem really complicated but

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.539 
makes it seem really complicated but
it's<00:03:42.570> actually<00:03:42.810> really<00:03:43.140> simple<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:44.250> now

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
it's actually really simple and now

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.550 
it's actually really simple and now
we're<00:03:44.730> gonna<00:03:44.850> take<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> look<00:03:45.330> at<00:03:45.630> why<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.080> pick

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
we're gonna take a look at why I pick

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.590 
we're gonna take a look at why I pick
close<00:03:46.920> enough<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.670> I'm<00:03:48.150> gonna<00:03:48.299> demonstrate

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
close enough and I'm gonna demonstrate

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.110 
close enough and I'm gonna demonstrate
this<00:03:49.200> with<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.040> conference<00:03:50.580> call<00:03:50.820> because

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
this with the conference call because

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.210 
this with the conference call because
the<00:03:51.269> conference<00:03:51.750> call<00:03:51.959> is<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.530> easiest<00:03:52.950> to

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
the conference call is the easiest to

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.160 
the conference call is the easiest to
see<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.580> pellets<00:03:53.970> flying<00:03:54.269> through<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.690> air

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
see the pellets flying through the air

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.650 
see the pellets flying through the air
so<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.560> remember<00:03:56.070> this<00:03:56.220> area<00:03:56.519> being<00:03:57.209> really

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
so I remember this area being really

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.150 
so I remember this area being really
tough<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.110> first<00:03:58.320> time<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.650> played<00:03:58.920> through

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
tough the first time I played through

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.729 
tough the first time I played through
with<00:03:59.400> my<00:03:59.580> assassin<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.360> died<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.810> few<00:04:01.110> times<00:04:01.170> but

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
with my assassin I died a few times but

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:02.840 
with my assassin I died a few times but
if<00:04:01.830> you<00:04:01.950> look<00:04:02.130> at<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.400> with<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.610> mech

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
if you look at that with the mech

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.300 
if you look at that with the mech
romancer<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.420> do<00:04:03.510> not<00:04:03.930> even<00:04:04.260> need<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.739> be<00:04:04.890> around

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
romancer I do not even need to be around

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.670 
romancer I do not even need to be around
that<00:04:05.459> quarter<00:04:05.880> all<00:04:06.239> you<00:04:06.480> have<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.720> do<00:04:06.900> is<00:04:07.350> shoot

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
that quarter all you have to do is shoot

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.440 
that quarter all you have to do is shoot
something<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.250> make<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.580> bullets<00:04:08.940> bounce<00:04:09.180> off

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
something to make the bullets bounce off

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.840 
something to make the bullets bounce off
and<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.019> bullets<00:04:10.410> will<00:04:10.590> fly<00:04:10.890> all<00:04:11.100> over<00:04:11.459> which

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
and the bullets will fly all over which

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.150 
and the bullets will fly all over which
is<00:04:12.000> actually<00:04:12.570> real

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
is actually real

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.400 
is actually real
really<00:04:13.550> good<00:04:13.880> for<00:04:14.360> a<00:04:14.390> far<00:04:14.750> out<00:04:14.930> enemies

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
really good for a far out enemies

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.900 
really good for a far out enemies
especially<00:04:15.950> using<00:04:16.100> a<00:04:16.280> shotgun

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
especially using a shotgun

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.670 
especially using a shotgun
this<00:04:17.180> makes<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.660> range<00:04:17.900> of<00:04:18.050> the<00:04:18.110> shotgun<00:04:18.410> a

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
this makes the range of the shotgun a

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.800 
this makes the range of the shotgun a
whole<00:04:19.130> lot<00:04:19.430> more<00:04:19.700> especially<00:04:20.090> if<00:04:20.600> you<00:04:20.660> have<00:04:20.780> a

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
whole lot more especially if you have a

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.950 
whole lot more especially if you have a
sniper<00:04:21.140> or<00:04:21.769> like<00:04:22.100> it<00:04:22.220> above<00:04:22.490> balcony<00:04:23.120> or<00:04:23.450> you

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
sniper or like it above balcony or you

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.690 
sniper or like it above balcony or you
know<00:04:24.050> those<00:04:24.230> high<00:04:24.380> period<00:04:24.770> snipers<00:04:25.250> later<00:04:25.520> on

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
know those high period snipers later on

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.910 
know those high period snipers later on
in<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:25.910> game<00:04:26.090> this<00:04:26.510> is<00:04:26.690> a<00:04:26.720> very<00:04:27.140> good<00:04:27.440> skill<00:04:27.860> to

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
in the game this is a very good skill to

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.980 
in the game this is a very good skill to
help<00:04:28.220> take<00:04:28.490> those<00:04:28.700> out<00:04:28.910> especially<00:04:29.750> if<00:04:29.840> you're

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
help take those out especially if you're

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.020 
help take those out especially if you're
like<00:04:30.140> stuck<00:04:30.380> behind<00:04:30.740> cover<00:04:31.040> and<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:31.670> really

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
like stuck behind cover and you really

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.490 
like stuck behind cover and you really
won't<00:04:32.180> want<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.480> fucking<00:04:32.810> pop<00:04:32.990> out<00:04:33.200> because

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
won't want to fucking pop out because

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.040 
won't want to fucking pop out because
your<00:04:33.680> health<00:04:33.890> is<00:04:34.040> real<00:04:34.220> low<00:04:34.460> all<00:04:34.910> you<00:04:35.150> do<00:04:35.420> shoot

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
your health is real low all you do shoot

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.020 
your health is real low all you do shoot
the<00:04:36.200> ceiling<00:04:36.650> let<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.190> bullets<00:04:37.580> bounce<00:04:37.790> off

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
the ceiling let the bullets bounce off

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.420 
the ceiling let the bullets bounce off
and<00:04:38.330> boom<00:04:38.810> now<00:04:38.960> you<00:04:39.080> have<00:04:39.470> an<00:04:39.620> infinite<00:04:40.040> range

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
and boom now you have an infinite range

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.390 
and boom now you have an infinite range
shotgun<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.300> this<00:04:41.750> is<00:04:41.960> exactly<00:04:42.500> how<00:04:43.010> I<00:04:43.040> like<00:04:43.370> to

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
shotgun so this is exactly how I like to

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.700 
shotgun so this is exactly how I like to
set<00:04:43.730> my<00:04:43.760> mech<00:04:44.090> romancer<00:04:44.630> up<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:45.050> is<00:04:45.260> probably

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
set my mech romancer up it is probably

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.770 
set my mech romancer up it is probably
the<00:04:45.830> easiest<00:04:46.160> way<00:04:46.640> to<00:04:46.670> play<00:04:46.940> through<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.540> know

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
the easiest way to play through I know

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.570 
the easiest way to play through I know
you<00:04:47.960> guys<00:04:48.200> probably<00:04:48.620> don't<00:04:48.860> have<00:04:49.070> conference

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
you guys probably don't have conference

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.040 
you guys probably don't have conference
calls<00:04:49.760> you<00:04:49.850> don't<00:04:50.030> need<00:04:50.300> a<00:04:50.330> conference<00:04:50.780> call

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
calls you don't need a conference call

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.810 
calls you don't need a conference call
for<00:04:51.260> this<00:04:51.350> to<00:04:51.470> work<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:52.040> only<00:04:52.250> reason<00:04:52.640> why<00:04:52.790> I

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
for this to work the only reason why I

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.090 
for this to work the only reason why I
chose<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.420> conference<00:04:53.900> call<00:04:54.080> is<00:04:54.290> because<00:04:54.920> you

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
chose the conference call is because you

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.040 
chose the conference call is because you
can<00:04:55.250> actually<00:04:55.550> see<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:56.180> bullets<00:04:56.540> fly<00:04:56.810> through

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
can actually see the bullets fly through

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.570 
can actually see the bullets fly through
the<00:04:57.140> air<00:04:57.170> if<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:57.830> have<00:04:57.950> like<00:04:58.130> an<00:04:58.250> assault

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
the air if you have like an assault

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.150
