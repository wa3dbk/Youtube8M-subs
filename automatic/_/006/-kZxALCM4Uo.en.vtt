00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.210
 hello to all friends i hope a 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.309
 balsam 4 stand of htc one m9 and htc juan 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.810
 n 8 and a very rapid comparison 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.510
 let's start with specifics immediately 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.340
 we want a bit like aesthetically for 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.289
 both 5-inch full HD displays 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.060
 this top is a good thing for not 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:30.130
 consume more battery than necessary 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.780
 processors with 801 and 810 hours with 64 bits 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.100
 so obviously more handsome but 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.739
 I wanted to see or better in the review 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.170
 in a few months we say tragic Valian 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.629
 against 2 gigabytes of ram and 16 gb valent 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.980
 in the latter it looks 72 for the 29th 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.379
 expandable with microsd 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.699
 the cameras the gold are here we have 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.960
 that of good to my classic 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.429
 here we have a fine pixel which 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.399
 frontally while on the back 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:54.879
 we have a 20 megapixel for the m9 is 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.409
 water all pixelated for the m8 anyway 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.819
 you can see very well how the 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.469
 differences are very few and from 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:01.839
 aesthetic point of view good camera 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:05.199
 it becomes almost almost square 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.880
 that of the one m8 round disappears sensor 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.770
 depth for photos 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.560
 the LED remains double and also from 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.409
 in other words, aluminum is the various designs 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.399
 are the same here is frontally time 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.840
 if not the same and this can be 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.460
 positive but also negative 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.770
 since someone might have expected 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.740
 what is more innovative, however, sees that not 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.450
 there is practically nothing changed from 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.579
 to say that my bike already had a design 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.740
 very very nice is enough e 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.170
 futuristic in quotation marks so there 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.780
 could stay another year than not 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.700
 changed a lot but maybe I would 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.609
 however tried two better the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.990
 frames at least with black with ht logo 5 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.000
 if they are my opinions 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.869
 the thing that has changed fundamentally 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.810
 the battery that changes to 2600 to 2850 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.020
 milan therefore in autonomy knows in theory 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.450
 upper and the ignition key 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.950
 that is sweaty right too this is a 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.289
 advantage not just given that it is more 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.210
 easy to reach while on juan n 8 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.060
 or up in your own very comfortable for 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.310
 the rest by telephone very sin 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.080
 beautiful the absence we also have the 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.490
 7.0 against 6 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.100
 logical as you have seen 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.110
 I expected some difference 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.280
 also extra aesthetics anyway for 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.660
 This video is all we will say us 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.440
 next video a jump from lorenzo for 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.440
 experience no bank hi
