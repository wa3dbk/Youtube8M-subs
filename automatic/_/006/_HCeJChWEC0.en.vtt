00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.240
 80 milliliters of whole oil

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.840
 i 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.720
 and we beat at high speed until 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.720
 double its volume 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.079
 then the oil 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.810
 we keep beating a little more 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.570

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.630
 slow speed so that the flour does not 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.490
 Salt 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.320
 and we are gradually increasing the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.320
 speed until you finish mixing 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.509

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.340
 fill the capsules 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.330
 once we have filled all the 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.030
 capsules we can bake the 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.270
 directly like this or put them over 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.290

 little liquid candy 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.080
 we mix it with the help of a spoon 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.340
 when we have this consistency what 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.849
