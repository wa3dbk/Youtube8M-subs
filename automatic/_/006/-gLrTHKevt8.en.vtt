 We will introduce the operation to make it ready 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:16.349
 First of all, this is the screen after rhythm x-login. 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.360
 This is a list of products that have been exhibited in the United States 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:30.960
 There are some products with such a profit in the red 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:37.150
 Even if this product is sold as it is, it will be in the red 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:41.770
 I want to search for items in the red and change to a state where I can make a profit 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:45.260
 There is a narrowing menu at the top of this screen 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.150
 Profit is negative here 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:54.650
 Cutlet 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:57.900
 Here, because there is a commodity that is calculated on the profit in it is under exhibition in wave angel has become bogged 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:03.230

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.740
 It will be present I would like to maintain this and make it profitable 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.020
 I will 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.479
 First of all, we will also change the price at once, so if you check this check box 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:32.630
 All products can be checked 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:34.730
 In that state, there is a button that lets you nail nails , so let's raise the price. 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.440
 Click on the button 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.690
 Hmm 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.390
 When you raise energy 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:48.130
 Many times N 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:51.369
 Now that prices are changing , all products can now be profitable 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.810
 If you make a batch change, only some products will be in this form 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.960
 The slave contract may become very large, so in that case individually here 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.960
 so 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.930
 Please change to the amount of money you think is appropriate 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.819
 If it is ok, it is a button that reflects the change 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.819
 Click here 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:23.470
 This price information is sent to the Amazon by the fact that the cause of the loss is both late 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:30.910
 The product will not be in the red but the maintenance of the product is complete 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:37.750
 I just search , change the price and send it to sweet vinegar . 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.830
 You can also search next to the other functions here, narrow down here . This search is product name 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.140
 a degree of progress 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.250
 You can search by Jancode sku 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.250
 For example, as an example 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:56.760
 Even those who have put on the date of exhibition on sku 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:03:02.700
 If you want to search for that sku, for example 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:05.340
 In the case of me, because we cut off by the date 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:11.400
 14/01/05 day 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.200
 If the want to find the ones that were opened when you want to search have the original box input to 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.190
 These are 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.569
 If you put the ice ku 24 0705 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.709
 You can also search by sku 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:28.410
 The yellow area here is also used earlier 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:35.550
 Products checked in bulk 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:40.069
 If you want to change it at once, you can change the price to the lowest price or reduce the price 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:44.040
 It is a button to raise the price or batch change of stock quantity again 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:50.040
 It is that under the collective change of shipping dates 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:54.790
 Change the product which checked this at once, and the button to reflect not change here 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.470
 If you can change the information in a month by clicking 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.270
 It will be said 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.980
 Yes it was easy, but it exceeded the maintenance and narrowing search of fire products 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.950
 Raised to price cuts 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.950
