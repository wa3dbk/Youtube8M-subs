00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
it just had every color and the sky was

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.199 
it just had every color and the sky was
absolutely<00:03:05.530> beautiful<00:03:05.650> at<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.550> same<00:03:06.880> time

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
absolutely beautiful at that same time

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.420 
absolutely beautiful at that same time
there's<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.780> couple<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.770> had<00:03:08.920> them<00:03:08.980> walk<00:03:09.220> out

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
there's a couple and I had them walk out

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.729 
there's a couple and I had them walk out
there<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.540> here's<00:03:10.780> actually<00:03:11.110> I<00:03:11.440> was<00:03:11.590> just

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:12.750 
there and so here's actually I was just
playing<00:03:11.950> with<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.100> dehaze<00:03:12.310> slider<00:03:12.340> here

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
playing with the dehaze slider here

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.150 
playing with the dehaze slider here
zeroed<00:03:13.270> out<00:03:13.390> here's<00:03:14.290> when<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.470> add<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.920> dehaze

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
zeroed out here's when I add the dehaze

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.979 
zeroed out here's when I add the dehaze
slider<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.060> can't<00:03:16.300> even<00:03:16.480> see<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.780> couple

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
slider and you can't even see the couple

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.630 
slider and you can't even see the couple
down<00:03:17.200> here<00:03:17.260> I'll<00:03:17.650> just<00:03:17.709> quickly<00:03:18.070> add<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.370> little

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
down here I'll just quickly add a little

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.760 
down here I'll just quickly add a little
graduated<00:03:19.209> filter<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:19.600> here<00:03:19.630> now<00:03:20.380> guys<00:03:20.560> if

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
graduated filter in here now guys if

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.080 
graduated filter in here now guys if
this<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.370> kind<00:03:21.550> of<00:03:21.610> stuff<00:03:21.820> where<00:03:21.970> you're

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
little recaps and of different things

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.360 
little recaps and of different things
that's<00:03:37.120> happening<00:03:37.720> in<00:03:37.900> lightroom<00:03:38.680> as<00:03:39.100> of

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
that's happening in lightroom as of

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.820 
that's happening in lightroom as of
recently<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:41.110> can<00:03:41.200> see<00:03:41.350> i<00:03:41.380> just<00:03:41.440> used<00:03:41.739> a

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
recently so you can see i just used a

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.500 
recently so you can see i just used a
little<00:03:41.920> graduated<00:03:42.430> filter<00:03:42.670> there's<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.090> before

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
little graduated filter there's a before

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.410 
little graduated filter there's a before
and<00:03:43.810> after<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:45.160> just<00:03:45.370> really<00:03:45.910> just<00:03:46.209> makes

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
and after and it just really just makes

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.229 
and after and it just really just makes
that<00:03:46.540> sky<00:03:46.840> come<00:03:47.080> alive<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:47.800> a<00:03:48.150> couple<00:03:49.150> other

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
that sky come alive so a couple other

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.840 
that sky come alive so a couple other
examples<00:03:49.450> how<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.110> can<00:03:50.320> use<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.850> here's

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
examples how you can use it and here's

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.400 
examples how you can use it and here's
one<00:03:52.060> where<00:03:52.209> we<00:03:52.390> got<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:52.630> kind<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:52.930> Sun<00:03:53.140> flare

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
one where we got this kind of Sun flare

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.660 
one where we got this kind of Sun flare
look<00:03:53.650> with<00:03:53.800> this<00:03:53.890> couple<00:03:54.310> if<00:03:54.370> I<00:03:54.459> hit<00:03:54.580> the

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
look with this couple if I hit the

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.490 
look with this couple if I hit the
dehaze<00:03:54.940> slider<00:03:54.970> you're<00:03:55.840> gonna<00:03:55.959> see<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.350> just

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
dehaze slider you're gonna see it just

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.170 
dehaze slider you're gonna see it just
kind<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.769> brings<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.280> little<00:03:57.550> bit<00:03:57.640> more<00:03:57.790> tone<00:03:58.030> in

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
kind of brings a little bit more tone in

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.140 
kind of brings a little bit more tone in
here<00:03:58.390> now<00:03:58.840> unfortunately<00:03:59.220> it<00:04:00.220> will<00:04:00.519> as<00:04:00.820> I

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
here now unfortunately it will as I

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.820 
here now unfortunately it will as I
mentioned<00:04:01.510> previously<00:04:02.019> it<00:04:02.290> will<00:04:02.560> kind<00:04:02.800> of

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
mentioned previously it will kind of

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.699 
mentioned previously it will kind of
mess<00:04:03.010> up<00:04:03.040> some<00:04:03.430> of<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.750> those<00:04:04.750> skin<00:04:05.110> tones<00:04:05.380> and

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
mess up some of the those skin tones and

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.199 
mess up some of the those skin tones and
so<00:04:05.830> what<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.130> can<00:04:06.280> do<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.519> come<00:04:06.760> down<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:06.940> the

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
so what you can do is come down to the

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.990 
so what you can do is come down to the
hue<00:04:07.630> saturation<00:04:07.840> luminance<00:04:08.470> slider<00:04:09.010> okay<00:04:09.760> and

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
hue saturation luminance slider okay and

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000 
hue saturation luminance slider okay and
I<00:04:10.870> like<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.170> take<00:04:11.290> my<00:04:11.350> luminance<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:11.950> I'll

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
I like to take my luminance and I'll

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.530 
I like to take my luminance and I'll
just<00:04:12.190> boost<00:04:12.459> that<00:04:12.640> up<00:04:12.760> just<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:13.090> little<00:04:13.120> bit<00:04:13.420> in

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
just boost that up just a little bit in

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.810 
just boost that up just a little bit in
my<00:04:13.630> saturation<00:04:13.900> down<00:04:14.470> just<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:14.799> little<00:04:14.829> bit<00:04:15.130> we

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
my saturation down just a little bit we

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.930 
my saturation down just a little bit we
went<00:04:15.940> a<00:04:15.970> little<00:04:16.060> bit<00:04:16.239> too<00:04:16.359> far<00:04:16.540> on<00:04:16.660> that<00:04:16.810> one

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
went a little bit too far on that one

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.699 
went a little bit too far on that one
to<00:04:18.000> find<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.330> good<00:04:18.570> nice<00:04:18.780> even<00:04:19.200> medium<00:04:19.500> and

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
to find a good nice even medium and

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.190 
to find a good nice even medium and
again<00:04:20.400> there's<00:04:20.610> kind<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:20.820> before<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.540> after

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
again there's kind of before and after

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.840 
again there's kind of before and after
now<00:04:22.230> let's<00:04:23.100> look<00:04:23.220> at<00:04:23.310> another<00:04:23.430> image<00:04:23.820> here

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
now let's look at another image here

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.610 
now let's look at another image here
let's<00:04:24.270> look<00:04:24.450> at<00:04:24.540> this<00:04:24.660> one<00:04:24.900> this<00:04:25.320> is<00:04:25.470> actually

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
let's look at this one this is actually

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.890 
let's look at this one this is actually
an<00:04:25.890> image<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.280> PI<00:04:26.520> recently<00:04:27.180> shot<00:04:27.390> when<00:04:27.780> he

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
an image that PI recently shot when he

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.420 
an image that PI recently shot when he
was<00:04:28.020> out<00:04:28.170> playing<00:04:28.800> with<00:04:28.890> an<00:04:29.100> underwater

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
was out playing with an underwater

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.600 
was out playing with an underwater
camera<00:04:30.360> housing<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.020> now<00:04:31.680> this<00:04:31.890> is<00:04:32.070> actually

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
camera housing and now this is actually

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.180 
camera housing and now this is actually
if<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.850> look<00:04:32.880> here<00:04:33.210> it's<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.420> JPEG<00:04:33.630> okay<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:35.100> I'm

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
if you look here it's a JPEG okay so I'm

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.340 
if you look here it's a JPEG okay so I'm
actually<00:04:35.460> working<00:04:35.790> a<00:04:35.970> JPEG<00:04:36.330> which<00:04:36.480> most<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.230> us

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
actually working a JPEG which most of us

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.400 
actually working a JPEG which most of us
will<00:04:37.560> know<00:04:37.740> has<00:04:38.460> a<00:04:38.490> lot<00:04:38.820> less<00:04:39.030> data<00:04:39.360> than<00:04:40.200> a<00:04:40.290> raw

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
will know has a lot less data than a raw

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.990 
will know has a lot less data than a raw
file<00:04:40.710> but<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.610> D<00:04:41.760> haze<00:04:42.770> slider<00:04:43.770> is<00:04:44.610> not<00:04:44.850> going

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
file but that D haze slider is not going

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.490 
file but that D haze slider is not going
to<00:04:45.060> be<00:04:45.150> stopped<00:04:45.420> so<00:04:45.930> if<00:04:45.990> I<00:04:46.080> go<00:04:46.200> down<00:04:46.320> to<00:04:46.440> the

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
to be stopped so if I go down to the

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.410 
to be stopped so if I go down to the
haze<00:04:46.620> slider<00:04:46.890> and<00:04:47.130> I<00:04:47.220> click<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:47.670> watch<00:04:48.180> what

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
haze slider and I click it watch what

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.570 
haze slider and I click it watch what
happens<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:48.870> sky<00:04:49.110> boom<00:04:49.890> we<00:04:50.370> get<00:04:50.490> this

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
happens to that sky boom we get this

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.430 
happens to that sky boom we get this
beautiful<00:04:51.390> sky<00:04:51.630> now<00:04:51.840> some<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.230> might<00:04:52.410> be

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
beautiful sky now some of you might be

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.500 
beautiful sky now some of you might be
saying<00:04:52.680> yeah<00:04:53.460> but<00:04:53.640> Trevor<00:04:53.820> those<00:04:54.060> skin<00:04:54.300> tones

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
saying yeah but Trevor those skin tones

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.790 
saying yeah but Trevor those skin tones
are<00:04:54.690> disastrous<00:04:55.200> and<00:04:55.500> you're<00:04:55.590> absolutely

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
are disastrous and you're absolutely

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.190 
are disastrous and you're absolutely
right<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.430> so<00:04:56.820> again<00:04:57.510> let's<00:04:57.720> go<00:04:57.870> use<00:04:58.050> that

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
right and so again let's go use that

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.690 
right and so again let's go use that
little<00:04:58.350> trick<00:04:58.650> let's<00:04:58.860> go<00:04:58.980> huge<00:04:59.220> saturation

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
little trick let's go huge saturation

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.670 
little trick let's go huge saturation
luminance<00:04:59.850> let's<00:05:00.690> take<00:05:00.840> our<00:05:00.930> saturation<00:05:01.500> down

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
luminance let's take our saturation down

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.010 
luminance let's take our saturation down
let's<00:05:02.670> take<00:05:02.820> our<00:05:02.940> luminance<00:05:03.450> up<00:05:03.630> a<00:05:03.690> little<00:05:03.870> bit

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
let's take our luminance up a little bit

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.160 
let's take our luminance up a little bit
and<00:05:05.210> let's<00:05:06.210> see<00:05:06.360> maybe<00:05:06.540> even<00:05:06.810> take<00:05:06.990> out<00:05:07.110> a

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
and let's see maybe even take out a

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.020 
and let's see maybe even take out a
little<00:05:07.260> bit<00:05:07.470> of<00:05:07.560> reds<00:05:07.860> maybe<00:05:08.640> even<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.940> little

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
little bit of reds maybe even a little

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.690 
little bit of reds maybe even a little
bit<00:05:09.180> of<00:05:09.270> yellows<00:05:09.570> okay<00:05:10.140> and<00:05:10.470> now<00:05:11.130> let's<00:05:11.160> look

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
bit of yellows okay and now let's look

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.810 
bit of yellows okay and now let's look
at<00:05:11.760> it<00:05:11.850> before<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.710> after<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:14.070> we're<00:05:14.670> almost

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
at it before and after and we're almost

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.400 
at it before and after and we're almost
there<00:05:15.180> with<00:05:15.390> a<00:05:15.420> little<00:05:15.750> bit<00:05:15.840> more<00:05:15.990> tweaking<00:05:16.110> I

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
there with a little bit more tweaking I

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.900 
there with a little bit more tweaking I
can<00:05:16.530> get<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.770> skin<00:05:17.010> tone<00:05:17.190> just<00:05:17.250> about<00:05:17.760> the

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
can get that skin tone just about the

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.880 
can get that skin tone just about the
same<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.480> yeah<00:05:18.780> we<00:05:18.900> got<00:05:19.050> that<00:05:19.200> sky<00:05:19.500> looking

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
same and yeah we got that sky looking

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.940 
same and yeah we got that sky looking
absolutely<00:05:20.580> gorgeous<00:05:21.080> I'm<00:05:22.080> telling<00:05:22.560> ya<00:05:22.680> this

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
know that the moment I use a dehaze

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.870 
know that the moment I use a dehaze
slider<00:05:30.990> I'm<00:05:31.410> gonna<00:05:31.560> just<00:05:31.770> kill<00:05:32.460> their<00:05:32.640> skin

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.240 
give a proper exposure on this shot so
we'll<00:05:40.200> bring<00:05:40.290> the<00:05:40.410> exposure<00:05:40.710> up<00:05:40.950> just<00:05:41.160> a

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
we'll bring the exposure up just a

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.310 
we'll bring the exposure up just a
little<00:05:41.280> bit<00:05:41.490> I'm<00:05:42.120> gonna<00:05:42.300> even<00:05:42.450> show<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.110> the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
little bit I'm gonna even show you the

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.260 
little bit I'm gonna even show you the
difference<00:05:43.620> here's<00:05:43.830> vibrance<00:05:44.430> okay<00:05:44.940> this<00:05:45.150> is

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
difference here's vibrance okay this is

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.670 
difference here's vibrance okay this is
how<00:05:45.390> I<00:05:45.419> used<00:05:45.720> to<00:05:45.810> do<00:05:45.990> things<00:05:46.200> when<00:05:46.350> I<00:05:46.380> wanted<00:05:46.620> to

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
how I used to do things when I wanted to

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.680 
how I used to do things when I wanted to
add<00:05:46.800> more<00:05:47.040> tone<00:05:47.280> to<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.580> color<00:05:47.850> our<00:05:48.210> excuse<00:05:48.540> me

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
add more tone to the color our excuse me

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.050 
add more tone to the color our excuse me
more<00:05:48.930> more<00:05:49.470> color<00:05:49.710> to<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:49.919> tone<00:05:50.640> of<00:05:50.669> the<00:05:50.790> skies

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
more more color to the tone of the skies

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.610 
more more color to the tone of the skies
and<00:05:51.390> things<00:05:51.540> like<00:05:51.630> that<00:05:51.840> I<00:05:52.050> would<00:05:52.350> use<00:05:52.500> that

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
and things like that I would use that

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.350 
and things like that I would use that
vibrance<00:05:53.100> slider<00:05:53.160> but<00:05:53.550> now<00:05:53.700> I'm<00:05:54.030> switching

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
vibrance slider but now I'm switching

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.940 
vibrance slider but now I'm switching
over<00:05:54.630> I'm<00:05:54.840> using<00:05:55.020> the<00:05:55.230> haze<00:05:55.380> letter<00:05:55.650> a<00:05:55.740> lot

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
over I'm using the haze letter a lot

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.610 
over I'm using the haze letter a lot
more<00:05:56.220> so<00:05:56.790> there's<00:05:56.970> vibrance<00:05:57.480> but<00:05:58.020> let's<00:05:58.230> let's

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
more so there's vibrance but let's let's

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.710 
more so there's vibrance but let's let's
just<00:05:58.830> anticipate<00:05:59.760> already<00:06:00.150> that<00:06:00.330> their<00:06:00.450> skins

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
just anticipate already that their skins

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.780 
just anticipate already that their skins
are<00:06:00.840> gonna<00:06:00.930> be<00:06:01.110> it's<00:06:01.410> gonna<00:06:01.650> be<00:06:01.830> messed<00:06:02.610> up

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
are gonna be it's gonna be messed up

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.950 
are gonna be it's gonna be messed up
we've<00:06:03.000> already<00:06:03.150> noticed<00:06:03.510> that<00:06:03.630> in<00:06:03.690> the<00:06:03.750> past

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
we've already noticed that in the past

so I'm going to come in here I'm gonna

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.680 
so I'm going to come in here I'm gonna
bring<00:06:05.340> my<00:06:05.460> saturation<00:06:05.700> down<00:06:06.240> a<00:06:06.270> little<00:06:06.480> bit

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
bring my saturation down a little bit

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.110 
bring my saturation down a little bit
bring<00:06:07.320> my<00:06:07.410> luminance<00:06:07.800> up<00:06:07.950> a<00:06:08.040> little<00:06:08.250> bit<00:06:08.400> maybe

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
bring my luminance up a little bit maybe

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.670 
bring my luminance up a little bit maybe
even<00:06:09.390> my<00:06:09.480> yellows<00:06:09.810> up<00:06:09.960> a<00:06:10.020> little<00:06:10.200> bit<00:06:10.350> and<00:06:10.560> now

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
even my yellows up a little bit and now

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.590 
even my yellows up a little bit and now
right<00:06:10.950> there<00:06:11.220> and<00:06:11.610> now<00:06:11.730> we're<00:06:12.120> almost<00:06:12.240> getting

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
right there and now we're almost getting

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.860 
right there and now we're almost getting
that<00:06:12.780> kind<00:06:13.110> of<00:06:13.260> vampire<00:06:14.390> skin<00:06:15.390> tones<00:06:15.630> right

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
that kind of vampire skin tones right

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.140 
that kind of vampire skin tones right
more<00:06:16.260> kind<00:06:16.590> of<00:06:16.620> more<00:06:16.680> white<00:06:17.040> there<00:06:17.850> which

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
more kind of more white there which

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.909 
more kind of more white there which
which<00:06:18.690> is<00:06:18.990> not<00:06:19.169> really<00:06:19.380> what<00:06:19.410> we<00:06:19.620> want

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
which is not really what we want

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.860 
which is not really what we want
but<00:06:20.100> again<00:06:20.340> I'm<00:06:20.520> anticipating<00:06:21.360> already<00:06:21.660> that

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
but again I'm anticipating already that

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.930 
but again I'm anticipating already that
that<00:06:21.900> dehaze<00:06:22.290> slider<00:06:22.320> is<00:06:22.740> going<00:06:22.919> to<00:06:23.040> fix<00:06:23.190> or<00:06:23.820> in

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
that dehaze slider is going to fix or in

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.940 
that dehaze slider is going to fix or in
other<00:06:24.060> words<00:06:24.240> it's<00:06:24.390> gonna<00:06:24.510> destroy<00:06:25.200> it<00:06:25.530> and<00:06:25.830> so

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
other words it's gonna destroy it and so

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.469 
other words it's gonna destroy it and so
I'm<00:06:26.039> kind<00:06:26.460> of<00:06:26.490> fixing<00:06:26.820> it<00:06:26.850> ahead<00:06:26.970> of<00:06:27.120> time<00:06:27.270> so

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
I'm kind of fixing it ahead of time so

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.060 
I'm kind of fixing it ahead of time so
let's<00:06:27.990> go<00:06:28.110> ahead<00:06:28.200> and<00:06:28.380> take<00:06:28.500> that<00:06:28.530> haze<00:06:28.830> slider

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
let's go ahead and take that haze slider

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.050 
let's go ahead and take that haze slider
let's

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
let's

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
notice the difference from the vibrance

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.430 
notice the difference from the vibrance
slider<00:06:50.120> when<00:06:51.120> it<00:06:51.270> was<00:06:51.389> bringing<00:06:51.870> some<00:06:52.139> tones

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
slider when it was bringing some tones

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.310 
slider when it was bringing some tones
in<00:06:52.650> the<00:06:52.710> sky<00:06:52.919> but<00:06:53.100> not<00:06:53.310> nearly<00:06:53.910> as<00:06:54.270> much<00:06:54.930> as<00:06:54.990> the

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
in the sky but not nearly as much as the

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.129 
in the sky but not nearly as much as the
haze<00:06:55.470> slider<00:06:55.770> so<00:06:56.120> if<00:06:57.120> your<00:06:57.389> haven't<00:06:58.050> already

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 
than go through in every single time do

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.980 
than go through in every single time do
that<00:07:16.470> why<00:07:16.860> not<00:07:17.070> create<00:07:17.340> a<00:07:17.430> preset<00:07:18.210> that<00:07:18.810> you

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990 
that why not create a preset that you

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.159 
that why not create a preset that you
can<00:07:19.139> then<00:07:19.290> just<00:07:19.440> click<00:07:19.740> on<00:07:19.919> to<00:07:20.450> add<00:07:21.450> some<00:07:21.990> haze

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:22.169 
can then just click on to add some haze

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:23.870 
can then just click on to add some haze
and<00:07:22.470> desaturate<00:07:23.010> your<00:07:23.130> skin<00:07:23.340> tones<00:07:23.520> all<00:07:23.669> at

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 
and desaturate your skin tones all at

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.450 
and desaturate your skin tones all at
the<00:07:23.940> same<00:07:24.090> time<00:07:24.150> and<00:07:24.600> in<00:07:24.960> fact<00:07:25.169> SR<00:07:25.950> Lounge<00:07:26.160> does

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 
the same time and in fact SR Lounge does

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.760 
the same time and in fact SR Lounge does
have<00:07:26.669> some<00:07:26.880> presets<00:07:27.330> that<00:07:27.930> will<00:07:28.110> do<00:07:28.320> that

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770 
have some presets that will do that

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.310 
have some presets that will do that
that<00:07:29.220> will<00:07:29.340> allow<00:07:30.300> you<00:07:30.360> to<00:07:30.479> with<00:07:30.870> one-click

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:31.320 
that will allow you to with one-click

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.290 
that will allow you to with one-click
desaturate<00:07:31.889> skin<00:07:32.100> tones<00:07:32.340> but<00:07:32.850> like<00:07:32.940> I<00:07:33.030> said<00:07:33.090> if

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 
desaturate skin tones but like I said if

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.969 
desaturate skin tones but like I said if
this<00:07:33.419> is<00:07:33.479> all<00:07:33.810> sounding<00:07:34.140> kind<00:07:34.470> of<00:07:34.530> foreign<00:07:34.830> to

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 
this is all sounding kind of foreign to

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:36.469 
this is all sounding kind of foreign to
you<00:07:35.100> go<00:07:35.610> check<00:07:35.820> out<00:07:35.940> the<00:07:36.060> Lightroom<00:07:36.330> 5
