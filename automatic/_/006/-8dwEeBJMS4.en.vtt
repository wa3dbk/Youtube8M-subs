 with full light as it does not gestate the magic and I want that despite his club 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:24.319
 after a good performance 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.439
 they took what happens that the fairy music is what really makes the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.649
 work apart from the tickets 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.829
 we return to the people with the music and the music goes to work with the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.400
 people 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.440

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.860
 people get a little 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.160
 I went where the name of villa and chicken comes 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.590
 good I lead in the heavenly name that I had about three years because of 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.440

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.019
 as a villa and has avoided talking about it the name of the deceased will soon 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.970
 that I will cry if I am already so much culture and 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.800
 of electronic music and above all of having criticism as artists in Mexico 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.670
 because in Europe the dykes are the ones that start from the cake are big 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.110
 good stars we have the case of the 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.850
 juliÃ¡n by seen by band and that already shadow of the stars 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.280
 were 100 mexico are already plowing ojÃ©n this with respect to the 16 already 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.740
 recognized our work and if we accept being considered as 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.770
 artists 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.380
 would be at the acapulco festival where villa issa already attended to play there 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.990
 it's really impressive that people are accepting this already as an artist not 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.930
 because he really considered that if we are artists because he transmits and moss 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.340
 our music for example personally 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.740
 the mesh of the villares that we are already playing make our own 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.340
 music we play for people is an idea to -express us by 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.630
 example musicians do it with live music we do it with 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.960
