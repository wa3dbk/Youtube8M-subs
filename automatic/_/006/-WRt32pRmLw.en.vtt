00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
uncompressed to the compressed and I

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.010 
uncompressed to the compressed and I
don't<00:05:29.699> have<00:05:30.150> enough<00:05:30.479> since<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:30.750> difference

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
don't have enough since the difference

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.080 
don't have enough since the difference
that<00:05:31.199> I<00:05:31.229> did<00:05:31.590> a<00:05:31.620> couple<00:05:31.800> changes<00:05:32.099> and<00:05:32.550> I<00:05:32.849> checks

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
that I did a couple changes and I checks

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.779 
that I did a couple changes and I checks
with<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.419> and<00:05:33.630> but<00:05:34.409> it's<00:05:35.280> just<00:05:36.030> just<00:05:37.520> this<00:05:38.520> is

if a new camera comes out and but in

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.879 
if a new camera comes out and but in

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
terms of be sleep performance I can't

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.510 
terms of be sleep performance I can't
watch<00:05:56.099> just<00:05:56.639> my<00:05:57.570> mind<00:05:57.750> that<00:05:58.440> I<00:05:58.650> might<00:05:58.949> has<00:05:59.370> been

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
watch just my mind that I might has been

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.040 
watch just my mind that I might has been
pretty<00:05:59.789> much<00:06:00.030> blown<00:06:00.270> away<00:06:00.449> by<00:06:00.599> this<00:06:00.659> one<00:06:00.870> so

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
pretty much blown away by this one so

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.260 
pretty much blown away by this one so
far<00:06:01.229> I<00:06:01.440> bought<00:06:01.919> more<00:06:02.220> reviews<00:06:02.580> more

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
far I bought more reviews more

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.909 
far I bought more reviews more
introductions<00:06:03.720> and<00:06:04.080> more<00:06:04.169> tests<00:06:04.560> they<00:06:04.710> are

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
introductions and more tests they are

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.589 
introductions and more tests they are
definitely<00:06:05.159> needed<00:06:05.669> but<00:06:06.479> I<00:06:07.280> so<00:06:08.280> far<00:06:08.550> only<00:06:08.909> just

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
definitely needed but I so far only just

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.400 
definitely needed but I so far only just
