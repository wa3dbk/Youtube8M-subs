four years does it two years yeah it's

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.430 
four years does it two years yeah it's
the<00:06:34.820> fourth<00:06:35.090> year<00:06:35.240> it's<00:06:35.750> actually<00:06:36.140> the<00:06:36.260> tree

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
the fourth year it's actually the tree

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.469 
the fourth year it's actually the tree
has<00:06:36.620> to<00:06:36.650> be

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 
has to be
