00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.909

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.620
 hi friends today you are here once again 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.240
 in my cooking channel I know you are many 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.219
 of you who really like the 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.930
 pizzas and you usually buy it often 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.670
 frozen in order that this one I have not 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.710
 stuck in the kitchen with the intention of 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.110
 show you how to make a homemade dough 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.430
 of pizza to make a pizza what 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.100
 we need are the following 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.460
 ingredients 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.720
 about 250 grams of flour fixos that be 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.190
 a special flour to use 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.440
 anybody right to the guards is a 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.470
 much less because it will contain 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.110
 more yeast and prick a lot more 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.650
 approximately 120 milliliters of water 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.989
 one and a half tablespoons of yeast no more 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.190
 and a pinch of good salt we're going to 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.190
 start making the dough 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.630
 The first thing we are going to do is catch 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.750
 which are the 250 grams of flour without 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.910
 spend there in this way I eat 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.650
 I have a very thick because thermomix 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.150
 I can go see how much I am going to 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.770
 throwing of flour as I'm going to 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.390
 if you do not have thermomix 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.910
 you will have to think about a weight of 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:27.550
 kitchen there goes a little bit until 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:29.400
 that reaches 250 grams of flour 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.730
 and a little more 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.920
 a bit more there is perfect weight 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.280
 just exact 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.680
 we are going to take the 120 milliliters of 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.469
 water do not go with the water because if 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.990
 you will not have too soft dough 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:52.230
 and we're going to take a teaspoon and 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:55.130
 half yeast powder one 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.310
 and a half more 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.939
 and more perfect half and now three 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:06.530
 quarters more or less a whole merged 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:11.290
 but almost almost whole of this salt 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:15.370
 way we are going to close everything very well 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.290
 We are going to put it on the hunt and 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.459
 Now what we are going to do is leave it 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.170
 knead for five minutes once 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.909
 we have finished embracing the mass 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.609
 let's look at what we have left 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:31.209
 let's do in a bowl let's take 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:34.239
 a little bit of oil in this way and 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.040
 we are going to grease everything very well with so much 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.930
 oil as you need to 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:45.099
 that is well greased very well very 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.859
 well I know that of all the walls 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:53.010
 coated with the agent and we're going to 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:57.280
 catch and let's throw the dough in the bowl 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.049
 in this way we are going to turn it around 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.989
 also so that there is good for our 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.720
 side up that covers the oil well 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.609
 olive and what we are going to do now is 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.349
 with a transparent phil 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.940
 I'm going to wash it first the hand that 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.970
 I have a little armored 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.560
 we will take a transparent fill like this 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.620
 and we are going to pour a little oil 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.450
 also to oil it perfect many 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.460
 you will say so that if you do not touch the club very 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.370
 easy because you're dripping I was going to go 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:28.629
 oiling the dough little by little 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.540
 in this way very well and we are going to 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:35.170
 stop peace rebozar and bless review 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.450
 for one hour one hour has already passed 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.250
 since we let the dough strengthen and 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.530
 let's set them as absorbed oil and 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.379
 has gained a lot of weight and now it 's a lot 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.780
 softer and tender what we are going to do 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.390
 Now it's time to finish the mazar 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.340
 make our pizza base for it 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.650
 we will take a surface like this what 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.690
 that you want and we're going to flour is 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.459
 important that we see because otherwise 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.859
 dynamos what is going to happen is that it's going 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.569
 to remain the mass stuck and in the end not 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.450
 we're going to do nothing because it's going to 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.769
 undo it whole so we cheer up well 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.959
 all this there well coated with flour 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:14.049
 to prevent us from being left 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:17.199
 perfect air pasted I think that already with 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:20.109
 this is going to be worth it and we are going to take the mass 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:23.050
 and we're going to wait for that is a 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.670
 little bit attached to golf there goes now 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.760
 coming out and we are going to extend it 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.610
 until we give it the form of a base 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.040
 of pizza once we have extended the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.440
 pizza dough is left in this way 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.720
 Now the only thing left is already caesar 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.720
 of the ingredients to taste and put it 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.490
