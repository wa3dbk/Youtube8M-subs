00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.150
 hi i'm adriÃ¡n and i'm fat that would be 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.370
 the first sentence we would say in 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.440
 any conventional therapy and not 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.900
 is much more distant from the reality that I 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.240
 I applied many many years ago in 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.580
 which anyone who wanted 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.490
 insult me thanks to my physical appearance 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.220
 to be fat because I could not get 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.420
 beyond with a smile of my saying 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.330
 you can not think of anything better because that's 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.630
 what I come to tell you now a day of 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.490
 today I have a job that I like a 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.940
 couple who loves me parents 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:43.870
 wonderful friends who are few 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.239
 very few but they are like my family and 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.149
 I come to say with all this with all 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.489
 the veneers that I am telling is 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.630
 simple I want you to make a 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.210
 question what is how are you and what if 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.140
 you know answer it o'hara life more 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.989
 simple and that is that question itself 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.439
 take everything if I go out 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.570
 an answer of your physical appearance 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.790
 it will be even simpler since I have 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.240
 started the video talking about my appearance 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.930
 physical you will say hey chicken I am tall I am 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.840
 low because I'm fat I'm a bitch and a 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.380
 much smaller percentage look over 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.920
 its psychological aspect that we say hey 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.340
 I'm nice chicken I will not think about what it is 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.289
 kind or who gives everything to the person who 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.110
 is on your side or a percentage 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:42.369
 still much smaller will think that 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.799
 Hey I'm selfish I'm rude I 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.130
 I'm a scoundrel but those people will be 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.200
 Very few people have thought 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.770
 just in those things when I said 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.439
 the phrase you know how you are I want 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.149
 say with all this if you know how 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:03.520
 you are if you know what life is like 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.220
 It will be much simpler for you 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.460
 we can improve everything 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.220
 what do we do wrong, for example is 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.020
 Of course, being fat does not mean 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.630
 that I'm unhappy upside down I'm very 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.900
 happy as I said but I do know that in a 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.210
 Future to the immediate or long-term best 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.500
 distance will have some problems by 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.840
 that I have made the decision to operate 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.480
 I am going to do thanks to the advice of my 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.880
 doctor and others I'm going to make a 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.570
 stomach reduction so that in the 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.940
 future my body because of the weight not 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.070
 have consequences such consequences 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.600
 as well as because of circulation 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.959
 heart problems problems 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.780
 tension etc etc etc conclusion of everything 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.690
 what I thought I said in more than one 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.510
 present as I did 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.600
 and thanks to this I am thinking of a 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.600
 future 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.210
 I sure was happy but now I know that 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.640
 in the future I will be happier and you 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.940
 you can also apply or this is like 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.840
 you are the same as you are high and low 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.970
 that you be nice that you are selfish 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.800
 that you are impolite 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.520
 that is, there is a person who gives everything for 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:28.480
 the rest the question is that you think 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.810
 as you are and if there is anything in the future 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.260
 will bring problems struggles for 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.100
 change it because for the simple reason 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.200
 that you are always happier 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.350
 if you are a person for example selfish 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.350
 in the future 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.960
 You may be left alone or you may 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.600
 many people that are worth leaving 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.230
 be rushed if on the contrary you are 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.290
 a person that of sympathy because you are 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.260
 kind the future surely you 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.290
 correspond with good friends to your 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.660
 around a family that wants you a 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.280
 family that supports you 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.280
 and a happy future 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.269
 without dilating me more 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.060
 I just want to say that you think of 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.990
 you who think of the people that you 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.560
 He wants you to be happy and it does not matter 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.230
 you are 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.120
 ok no 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:36.290
 but fight to be happy 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.290
 and with this I do not want more to say 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.930
 that I am happy 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.070
 see you later
