going to say first use spot one take a
step<00:02:08.690> forward<00:02:08.750> go<00:02:09.259> forward<00:02:09.289> for<00:02:09.799> me<00:02:09.920> spot<00:02:10.670> to

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
step forward go forward for me spot to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.460 
step forward go forward for me spot to
is<00:02:11.120> going<00:02:11.269> to<00:02:11.360> say<00:02:11.450> now<00:02:11.630> take<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.870> bigger<00:02:12.170> step

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
is going to say now take a bigger step

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:30.180 
is going to say now take a bigger step
for<00:02:12.739> me<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.160> we'll<00:02:13.340> do<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.549> with<00:02:13.700> timing

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.350 

alright<00:02:31.190> we've<00:02:31.370> done<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.640> reading<00:02:31.849> exercises

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
alright we've done the reading exercises

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.010 
alright we've done the reading exercises
1<00:02:32.840> 2<00:02:33.349> 3<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.190> now<00:02:34.280> we're<00:02:34.430> on<00:02:34.550> r<00:02:34.580> in<00:02:34.730> exercise<00:02:35.450> for

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
1 2 3 and now we're on r in exercise for

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.020 
1 2 3 and now we're on r in exercise for
all<00:02:36.739> right<00:02:36.860> we're<00:02:37.010> in<00:02:37.040> exercise<00:02:37.489> for<00:02:37.819> is

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
all right we're in exercise for is

all right we're in exercise for is
basically<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:39.020> rectangle<00:02:39.890> now<00:02:40.459> we're<00:02:40.580> going<00:02:40.670> to

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
basically a rectangle now we're going to

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.030 
basically a rectangle now we're going to
do<00:02:41.080> lengthening<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.230> shortening<00:02:42.560> throughout

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
do lengthening and shortening throughout

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.580 
do lengthening and shortening throughout
this<00:02:43.660> rectangle<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.050> I'm<00:02:45.170> going<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.319> be<00:02:45.440> doing

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
this rectangle and I'm going to be doing

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.470 
this rectangle and I'm going to be doing
some<00:02:45.860> circles<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.670> some<00:02:46.790> stopping<00:02:47.239> some

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
some circles and some stopping some

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.210 
some circles and some stopping some
going<00:02:47.780> throughout<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.319> i'm<00:02:48.890> going<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.069> do<00:02:49.190> a

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
going throughout that i'm going to do a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.090 
going throughout that i'm going to do a
walk<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.180> i'm<00:02:50.300> also<00:02:50.480> doing<00:02:50.750> at<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.020> trot<00:02:51.350> now

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
walk and i'm also doing at the trot now

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.550 
walk and i'm also doing at the trot now
once<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.550> get<00:02:52.760> really<00:02:53.030> good<00:02:53.239> rhythm<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.380> can

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
once you get really good rhythm you can

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.830 
once you get really good rhythm you can
take<00:02:54.739> this<00:02:54.890> exercise<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.760> lengthen<00:02:56.569> it<00:02:56.720> out

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
take this exercise and lengthen it out

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.330 
take this exercise and lengthen it out
spread<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.530> out<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.680> little<00:02:57.800> bit<00:02:57.890> more<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.250> you

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
spread it out a little bit more and you

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.460 
spread it out a little bit more and you
can<00:02:58.459> actually<00:02:58.610> do<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.030> at<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.989> low<00:03:00.140> but<00:03:00.349> you

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
can actually do it at the low but you

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.199 
can actually do it at the low but you
have<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.680> go<00:03:00.769> through<00:03:00.950> line<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.459> get<00:03:01.970> into

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
have to go through line and get into

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.400 
have to go through line and get into
connection<00:03:02.630> before<00:03:02.750> we<00:03:02.989> can<00:03:03.110> start<00:03:03.140> doing

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
connection before we can start doing

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.670 
connection before we can start doing
that<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.730> remember<00:03:05.360> again<00:03:05.690> rhythm<00:03:06.140> is<00:03:06.290> timing

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
that so remember again rhythm is timing

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.910 
that so remember again rhythm is timing
rhythm<00:03:07.549> is<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:08.060> balance<00:03:08.870> rhythm<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.739> pull

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
rhythm is a balance rhythm is and pull

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.640 
rhythm is a balance rhythm is and pull
shin<00:03:10.160> rhythm<00:03:10.580> is<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:11.000> speed<00:03:11.660> control<00:03:11.810> these<00:03:12.500> are

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
shin rhythm is a speed control these are

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.870 
shin rhythm is a speed control these are
the<00:03:12.709> things<00:03:12.799> we're<00:03:13.010> looking<00:03:13.190> for<00:03:13.580> from<00:03:13.819> the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
the things we're looking for from the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.030 
the things we're looking for from the
horse<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.450> give<00:03:14.600> us<00:03:14.780> now<00:03:15.440> through<00:03:15.709> all<00:03:15.860> that

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
horse to give us now through all that

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.259 
horse to give us now through all that
we're<00:03:16.250> also<00:03:16.430> looking<00:03:16.670> for<00:03:16.970> our<00:03:17.030> basic

we're also looking for our basic

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.590 
we're also looking for our basic

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
stand still and relaxation flexion and

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.380 
stand still and relaxation flexion and
strength<00:03:24.200> okay<00:03:24.950> all<00:03:25.489> those<00:03:25.910> things<00:03:26.150> have<00:03:26.360> to

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
strength okay all those things have to

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.940 
strength okay all those things have to
come<00:03:26.540> into<00:03:26.840> play<00:03:27.080> to<00:03:27.350> do<00:03:27.530> these<00:03:27.680> exercises

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
come into play to do these exercises

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.759 
come into play to do these exercises
work<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:29.450> do<00:03:29.600> them<00:03:29.720> correctly<00:03:29.870> we're<00:03:30.590> going<00:03:30.680> to

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
work to do them correctly we're going to

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.530 
work to do them correctly we're going to
do<00:03:30.890> them<00:03:30.980> five<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.459> seven<00:03:31.700> times<00:03:31.910> correctly

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
do them five to seven times correctly

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.900 
do them five to seven times correctly
and<00:03:32.720> then<00:03:33.290> we're<00:03:33.410> going<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.560> swap<00:03:33.799> sides<00:03:34.190> from

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
and then we're going to swap sides from

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.640 
and then we're going to swap sides from
left<00:03:35.209> to<00:03:35.269> right<00:03:35.359> or<00:03:35.570> whatever<00:03:35.959> which<00:03:36.320> way<00:03:36.470> we

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
left to right or whatever which way we

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.670 
left to right or whatever which way we
decide<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.430> start
