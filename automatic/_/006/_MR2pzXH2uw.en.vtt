 did you notice that your house has a shower 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.080
 your windows are sweating 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.330
 the apartment has mold it all 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.980
 signs of inadequate ventilation and how 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.770
 due to high humidity and 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.839
 lack of fresh air is very many 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.890
 believe that ventilation is a hood on 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.830
 kitchen and bathroom 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.169
 but it is not quite so with her 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.779
 air saturated with moisture and carbonate 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.550
 gas leaves your home but in order to 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.890
 this system worked needed 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.600
 constant fresh air 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.330
 which will create a pressure drop 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.130
 and make your hood work like 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.340
 usually we get fresh air in 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.170
 indoors we open windows but do you know 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.630
 that you are one person especially a child 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.850
 need 30 cubic meters of fresh 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.730
 oxygenated air per hour 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.040
 get that amount using windows 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.290
 only one way to open them 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.270
 wide open for five minutes every hour this 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.760
 incredibly difficult in summer and perfect 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.030
 impossible at other times of the year we 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.880
 offer you an alternative 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.710
 wall ventilator aero pack 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.140
 compact device 47 centimeters high 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.299
 and a width of 27 is made in an elegant 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.399
 modern design 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.710
 this is incredibly convenient and economical and 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.689
 compact device not only provides 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.020
 the required amount of fresh air 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.049
 but cleans it of all harmful impurities 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.359
 exhaust dust and plant pollen 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.939
 how does this wall is done 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:35.469
 a hole that is not insulated 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.810
 worry you will never feel 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.539
 that cold air penetrates through it 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.119
 indoor installation lasts only one hour 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.530
 neither dust nor dirt produces marks on 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.319
 both also does not remain 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.289
 the device is mounted on a wall in the area 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.209
 holes it works from the network at the same time 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.759
 spends electricity less than 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.459
 TV standby just five in 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.310
 see how easy it is for father to turn it on 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.120
 brine 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.040
 management is done with 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.590
 a touch display wih 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.720
 after switching it starts to force 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.820
 indoor air and cleans it 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.920
 thanks to a special filter which 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.300
 is inside 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.130
 then you can adjust the flow 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.280
 air by pressing a button or by 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.870
 side barriers have the ability 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.330
 set the time automatically 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.340
 turning the device on or off with 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.600
 using a timer 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.430
 note that the air supply 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.860
 not frontal 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.980
 holes are located on the sides of the aero until 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.410
 you are well protected from drafts except 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.110
 That dry street air is correct 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.630
 distributed over the room if you have 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.820
 there is a mold on the walls aero pack will 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.180
 extra and dry creating 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.190
 Effect 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.440
 blowing a windshield in the car at 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.920
 the mold just wo n't stand a chance 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.510
 in a comfortable wet environment 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.300
 notice the airport works practically 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.280
 silently it allows you to turn it on 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.830
 at night when oxygen is needed 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.140
 highest while 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.440
 open window we hear all the street noises 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.260
