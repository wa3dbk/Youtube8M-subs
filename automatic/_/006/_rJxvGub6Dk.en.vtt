00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
gonna make myself a hot steaming cup of

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.160 
gonna make myself a hot steaming cup of
coffee<00:00:26.460> which<00:00:26.849> actually<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.510> made<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.720> whole<00:00:27.869> pot

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
coffee which actually I made a whole pot

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.410 
coffee which actually I made a whole pot
so<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.189> off<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.519> our<00:00:29.640> coffeemaker<00:00:30.090> I

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
so this is off of our coffeemaker I

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.970 
so this is off of our coffeemaker I
recommend<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.019> get<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> coffee<00:00:31.560> maker<00:00:31.890> that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
recommend you get a coffee maker that

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.340 
recommend you get a coffee maker that
works<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.510> once<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.110> there<00:00:34.260> it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
works like this so once it's in there it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.990 
works like this so once it's in there it
doesn't<00:00:34.500> miss<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.980> holds<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> heat<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.790> and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
doesn't miss this holds the heat in and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.520 
doesn't miss this holds the heat in and
that<00:00:36.149> way<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.420> use<00:00:36.540> less<00:00:36.750> electricity<00:00:37.140> but<00:00:37.469> on

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that way we use less electricity but on

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830 
that way we use less electricity but on
day<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:37.829> today<00:00:37.980> hold<00:00:38.850> up<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.149> pot<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.809> water
