00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:10.139
 We all wait for 12 at night 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.090
 December 31 not only to start 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.570
 to a new year but to express 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.650
 our dreams and longings purposes and 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.439
 objectives in the fund we all want a 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.259
 better year and we resort to omens and 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.890
 traditions with the hope that it 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.240
 make reality 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.210
 we eat 12 grapes to ask for wishes 1 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.600
 for each month of the year 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.600
 we clean the house and bathe at 12 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.660
 at night to get the negative out of 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.120
 our lives we put coins for 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.719
 the whole house to have money and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.629
 abundance we got on a chair to 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.290
 ascend in the work we throw water by 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.470
 the window to ward off sorrows 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.370
 we put yellow or red shorts for 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.170
 attract romance love and adventures we do 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.990
 a list of the negative of the year that 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.170
 just finished and we burned it at 12 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.210
 at night so that it does not repeat itself 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.460
 we have a chair by hand and we sit down 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.070
 we separate the clock with each bell 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.700
 hoping to get married in the new 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.800
 year we left running with a suitcase to 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.160
 go around the block to travel 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.310
 we light candles we put spikes in 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.880
 our table and we prepare delicacies with 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.030
 the yearning for abundance and prosperity 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.340
 all this you can do to express 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.579
 your wishes and purposes for the new 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.530
 year and begins however what it does 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.530
 that they come true this 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.280
 conviction and your true will in 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.190
 make it happen 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.070
 do not complicate believing that you can not 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.640
 that is difficult and that you need the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.020
 force a new year to achieve it 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.180
 simplifies because everything is easier 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.150
 what it seems like 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.420
 organize your mind and your heart and throw yourself 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.640
 to the future with joy and optimism and with 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.380
 the assurance that you can achieve what 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.410
 you propose if you really want it 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.320
 perform all these holes does that 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.230
 most fun and special night always and 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.820
 when you are aware that doing so is not 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.480
 guarantee that your wishes are made 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.700
 reality but it's simply a way 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.340
 to materialize those so that they go 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.850
 taking shape so is that if you want 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.920
 takes a very light traveling maletica not 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.530
 have to allow anything inside her 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.010
 It will simply represent your 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.650
 longing to travel and leave your home or 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.170
 where are you and walk 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.720
 enjoying the landscape is not necessary 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.110
 that you run unless you want to leave with 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.610
 hurry and eagerly now every time 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.000
 you cross a street 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:06.410
 visualize that cross is an ocean I enjoyed 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.410
 the travel and the company laughs dreams loves 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.610
 and learn from every thing or person that 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.640
 find on the road 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.010
 if you want material abundance have something 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.340
 of money in your pocket in your wallet 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.420
 in your house you have the place where you work 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.820
 and logically in the bank try to have 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.640
 the least possible amount of debts 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.910
 the ideal would be to start the year at zero 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.310
 so if you owe someone something 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.950
 ask him to symbolically give it to you 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.920
 you can do it through a piece of paper 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.650
 that will be valid during the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.490
 last minutes of the old year and the 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.160
 first minutes of the new year 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.910
 in this little paper person who would 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.150
 you must write money that gives you 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:01.280
 what you drink and on a piece of paper that you 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:04.710
 you are going to write happens to confirm the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.920
 the interest or desire that you have 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:11.040
 and pay or deliver them to them 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.610
 sum of money at the agreed time of 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.240
 This form will not start the new year with 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.310
 debts but with commitments to have 

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.070
 abundance it is very important to enter 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.740
 circle of abundance where everything already 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.830
 exists and only expects you to arrive to 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.400
 share it with you to enter this 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.580
 circle you must feel yourself son of god and 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.640
 observe the abundance that surrounds you 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:41.220
 you can do it through visualizing a 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.530
 tree with its millions of leaves or 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.560
 the sea with its millions of droplets of 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:50.600
 water, the important thing is to feel part of 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.990
 that full creation in abundance 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.480
 to have a year of peace, love and harmony 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.690
 it is important to start it with peace, love and 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.660
 harmony not only with yourself but with 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.270
 every person that surrounds you and then what 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.030
 throughout the year continue with these 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.600
 purposes sowing these feelings 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.850
 in each new day because remember that 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.280
 what is sown and what is 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:20.510
 Relationships require care and attention 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.530
 constant be you are love in couple you must 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:27.110
 you have to enjoy it and receive 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.560
 especially to keep it because you're welcome 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.570
 It serves to receive it and then to lose it is 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.270
 important that it is now a space for 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.630
 that new person in your life in your 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.810
 heart and in your mind give it a place in 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:45.380
 your house and your room this will contribute 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.190
 to materialize your wish on the site of 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.960
 your room that according to the end chuy 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.540
 corresponds to the couple and that you can 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.060
 find on the internet you can place 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.030
 something that represents them both 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.790
 It can be your photo and since you do not have a 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.950
 picture of your future partner replaces the 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.290
 for a list with all the 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.620
 features that you expect to find in 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:12.650

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.980
 couple to that healthy relationship every 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.639
 tomorrow and reaffirm that this list or 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.010
 ready to find him remember that the 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.650
 Love is the only thing that when divided 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:28.130
 Multiply so is that if you want love 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:31.130
 invest love if you want money invests 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.979
 money and if you want time invest
