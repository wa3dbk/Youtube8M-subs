oh<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.460> very<00:00:26.670> interesting<00:00:27.210> because

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
oh it's very interesting because

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330 
oh it's very interesting because
obviously<00:00:27.840> she<00:00:28.380> shouldn't<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:28.920> been<00:00:29.099> born

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.370 
obviously she shouldn't have been born
yet<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:30.330> gives<00:00:30.480> us<00:00:30.630> another<00:00:30.840> example<00:00:31.230> of

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
yet and it gives us another example of

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.260 
yet and it gives us another example of
how<00:00:31.529> mast<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:31.980> time<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.610> map<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.059> maybe

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
how mast up time is in this map so maybe

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.360 
how mast up time is in this map so maybe
she's<00:00:33.570> still<00:00:33.660> trapped<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> ether<00:00:34.410> because

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
she's still trapped in the ether because

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.190 
she's still trapped in the ether because
it's<00:00:35.550> timeless<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.690> get<00:00:36.930> annoyed

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
to learn how the story ends something

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.010 
to learn how the story ends something
like<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.399> not<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> gold<00:00:41.760> digger<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.600> origin

and<00:02:37.680> cash<00:02:37.890> when<00:02:38.160> you're<00:02:38.310> using<00:02:38.460> filtrate

and cash when you're using filtrate

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.090 
and cash when you're using filtrate
maybe<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.870> collected<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.350> blood<00:02:40.560> bags<00:02:40.830> and

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
maybe you collected in blood bags and

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.590 
maybe you collected in blood bags and
then<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.370> can<00:02:41.520> use<00:02:41.700> these<00:02:41.880> bags<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.420> maybe

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
then you can use these bags to maybe

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.540 
then you can use these bags to maybe
throw<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.470> at<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.680> revived<00:02:43.950> player<00:02:44.280> like<00:02:44.520> a

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
throw it at a revived player like a

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.220 
throw it at a revived player like a
grenade<00:02:44.790> which<00:02:45.360> allows<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.810> revive<00:02:46.050> from

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
grenade which allows you to revive from

grenade which allows you to revive from
a<00:02:46.290> distance<00:02:46.710> it<00:02:47.340> says<00:02:47.940> master<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.480> disguise

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
a distance it says master of disguise

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.270 
a distance it says master of disguise
which<00:02:49.020> would<00:02:49.200> lead<00:02:49.410> me<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.710> believe<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:50.040> if

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
which would lead me to believe that if

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.650 
which would lead me to believe that if
you<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.520> throw<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:50.910> yourself<00:02:51.270> maybe<00:02:51.480> it

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
you can throw it on yourself maybe it

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.170 
you can throw it on yourself maybe it
acts<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.290> stink<00:02:53.010> from<00:02:53.220> vult<00:02:53.670> rate<00:02:53.940> and

acts like the stink from vult rate and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.210 
acts like the stink from vult rate and
then<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.930> can<00:02:55.050> also<00:02:55.170> apparently<00:02:55.560> insert<00:02:56.040> it

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
then you can also apparently insert it

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.250 
then you can also apparently insert it
maybe<00:02:56.520> if<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.090> insert<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.630> into<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.900> part<00:02:58.200> of

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
maybe if you insert it into a part of

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.470 
maybe if you insert it into a part of
the<00:02:58.380> generator<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.040> not<00:02:59.190> start<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.790> process

in<00:03:25.860> master<00:03:26.250> wizard<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.300> Origins<00:03:27.750> wield<00:03:28.050> all

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
in master wizard so in Origins wield all

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.950 
in master wizard so in Origins wield all
of<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.650> ultimate<00:03:29.130> staffs<00:03:29.370> in<00:03:29.640> one<00:03:29.850> game<00:03:30.120> so

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
of the ultimate staffs in one game so

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.240 
of the ultimate staffs in one game so
this<00:03:31.110> would<00:03:31.260> lead<00:03:31.380> me<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.500> believe<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:32.010> if

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
this would lead me to believe that if

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.340 
this would lead me to believe that if
you<00:03:32.310> guess<00:03:32.640> give<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.940> staff<00:03:33.270> a<00:03:33.450> certain<00:03:33.750> par<00:03:34.020> it

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
you guess give a staff a certain par it

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.040 
you guess give a staff a certain par it
uses<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> certain<00:03:35.670> weapon<00:03:36.030> then<00:03:36.630> maybe<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.020> can

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
uses a certain weapon then maybe you can

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.410 
uses a certain weapon then maybe you can
combine<00:03:37.440> certain<00:03:38.130> parts<00:03:38.580> or<00:03:38.730> upgrade<00:03:39.180> them

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
combine certain parts or upgrade them

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.450 
combine certain parts or upgrade them
and<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:40.230> turns<00:03:40.620> them<00:03:40.830> into<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.040> much<00:03:41.250> more

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
and it turns them into a much more

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.000 
and it turns them into a much more
potent<00:03:41.970> form<00:03:42.240> turning<00:03:42.960> it<00:03:43.080> into<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.620> Wonder

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
potent form turning it into the Wonder

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.920 
potent form turning it into the Wonder
weapon<00:03:44.130> of<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.460> map<00:03:44.580> essentially<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.690> if<00:03:45.810> you

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
weapon of the map essentially so if you

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.420 
weapon of the map essentially so if you
commit<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.470> certain<00:03:46.770> part<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.280> can

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
commit you a certain part you can

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.890 
commit you a certain part you can
upgrade<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:47.970> wonder<00:03:48.360> weapons<00:03:48.690> staff

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
upgrade it to wonder weapons staff

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.600 
upgrade it to wonder weapons staff
levels<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.470> that's<00:03:49.650> what<00:03:49.860> an<00:03:49.950> ultimate<00:03:50.370> staff
