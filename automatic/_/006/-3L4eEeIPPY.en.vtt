00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.250
 then wish you much fun now 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.250
 leaving 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.470
 for one, tools and this new one are needed 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.020
 I got tina from the tool I pack the 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.240
 website just below infobox and 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.490
 You really need that round one 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.870
 are a little thicker and small and there 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.730
 you can also take bobby pins or 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.980
 needles or anything else is looking for you 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.230
 Something in the colors I have 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.630
 right now so hot pink that is 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.339
 from the svs ii finally was reporting 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.990
 and I do not know that not even so 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.240
 really just podpinka but a very very 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.670
 warm as I think it is very nice and 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.869
 you need such a color 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.869
 each case all colors vary 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.820
 then we need such a flier sound of 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.900
 he is so baby pink and there you can 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.570
 of course, everything again 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.340
 vary as you like and the 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.270
 is called catch me is from the p2 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.270
 very nice 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.620
 Finally, we need one too 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.200
 green nail polish and that is of golden 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.670
 Great that is such a Turkish market and 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.730
 Of course you can vary that 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.440
 color in itself is a bit neon and 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.910
 on this white nail polish dialog around 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.220
 what i got out so i have this one 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:55.320
 Your nails should already be white 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.150
 be painted and I have two short ones 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.310
 packed on it and the very very good 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.930
 let it dry and what it is now as 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.820
 Material still needs just like that 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.790
 a piece of paper and there you can 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.429
 colors so the nail polishes weird 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.200
 march time just dab it on it 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.880
 you ever been I'd say all 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.050
 nail polishes before you because you will 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.050
 to work with this money 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.220
 you just take a new tool 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.020
 and dab it more gently so pure or 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.640
 you can make pretty points around 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.260
 we have to make the little flowers 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.620
 they are really very close 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.750
 together so really ran with it 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.280
 as a flower form arises and that works 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.230
 not if you like that somehow now 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.850
 hero know this is good but if he is like that 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.160
 then do you understand that? 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.170
 not nice looks ahead therefore 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.360
 always build so side by side why 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.340
 lego blocks we can start now 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.500
 goes with nella tools only in this baby 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.870
 pink and I start with that now 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.000
 Middle finger very rough with three 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.250
 small dots next to each other 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.390
 this is our first flower or stage 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.600
 I bake one more directly 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.950
 just three circles next to each other 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.050
 size and everything with her you can 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.959
 vary and this is the first step 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.550
 quite simply randomly and now 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.950
 Let's take a little e latour 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.500
 he should already be a very small one 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.620
 top have okay and with the rubber the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.080
 Hot pink and do these pink things 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.810
 right and left so just 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.310
 parallel to such semicircles easy 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.050
 as if we were the thing around apa 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.040
 and all that is now doing in the 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.040
 other flowers as well 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.480
 Just try to do that like that 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.489
 the flowers do not touch him 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.690
 is still between space and then 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.720
 grab her a little baby 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.379
 pingping hot pink in the middle so two 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.760
 PÃ¼nktchen and that's it there I have 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.340
 not just exchanged because we did that 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.900
 So much the better but that was it now 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.769
 you just take a little one like that 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.530
 round nella tool we pick the point 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.140
 you in the green and just do it now 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.329
 so small petals help there where 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.160
 you do not care where they do not have to 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.329
 look perfect just so small 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.419
 blob I say 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.220
 and it's really just about that 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.840
 Feeling mediate hey these are flowers 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.570
 white from the near the course 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.010
 not so, but from afar it looks 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.940
 So that's why it's cool 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.539
 illusion 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.590
 and it looks very beautiful from afar 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.960
 The same thing is happening on the 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.520
 ring finger and I will not go now 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.530
 great on it 1 watch it 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.880
 Simply on is super easy to have here 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.620
 I make the flowers a bit bigger 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.620
 but it works the same way 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.300
 so and then you are too 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.340
 already done it is super just great 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.900
 fast and I did not need that 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.979
 long on the left hand you know that 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.660
 do just as well 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.330
 only I would recommend you with the 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.039
 Do not overdo it like me 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.169
 Here at the thumb that did 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.060
 so it was just too much new page 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.319
 Of course you can vary as and 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.910
 then I want you a lot of fun 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:28.289
 imitate and then we'll meet 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.289
 back next friday
