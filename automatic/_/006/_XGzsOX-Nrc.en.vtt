00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
tuned for that and from drugstore I

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.740 
tuned for that and from drugstore I

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
think probably would keep my Maybelline

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.299 
think probably would keep my Maybelline
fit<00:00:58.020> me<00:00:58.079> because<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.559> really<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:59.010> how<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
fit me because I really like how the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.459 
fit me because I really like how the
finish<00:00:59.820> looks<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.329> looks<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
finish looks like looks like with that

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.670 
finish looks like looks like with that
foundation<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.609> only<00:01:03.059> downside<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
foundation the only downside is it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.170 
foundation the only downside is it
doesn't<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> pump<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.880> don't<00:01:06.030> have

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
doesn't have a pump so you don't have

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.230 
doesn't have a pump so you don't have
much<00:01:06.540> control<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> yeah<00:01:08.909> those

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240

my hair I probably would have got a
smaller<00:03:06.320> haircut<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.220> was<00:03:07.400> easier<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.820> for

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
makeup when I was a teenager so I would

makeup when I was a teenager so I would
probably<00:03:17.410> put<00:03:18.410> on<00:03:18.560> some<00:03:18.739> mascara<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.989> just

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
probably put on some mascara and just

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.449 
probably put on some mascara and just
some<00:03:21.140> concealer<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.830> conceal<00:03:22.040> my<00:03:22.430> dark
