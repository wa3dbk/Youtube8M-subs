the most easily lost parts of the actual
transformer<00:03:22.750> itself<00:03:23.040> because<00:03:24.780> as<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:25.900> can

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
transformer itself because as you can

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.630 
transformer itself because as you can
see<00:03:26.050> there's<00:03:26.650> not<00:03:26.770> much<00:03:26.950> holding<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.400> on<00:03:27.490> there

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
see there's not much holding it on there

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.080 
see there's not much holding it on there
just<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:28.060> pressure<00:03:29.020> from<00:03:29.470> those<00:03:30.340> two<00:03:30.520> pieces<00:03:30.730> I

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
just to pressure from those two pieces I

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.910 
just to pressure from those two pieces I
remember<00:03:31.570> as<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.690> kid<00:03:31.720> pulling<00:03:32.230> this<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.740> you

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
remember as a kid pulling this and you

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.560 
remember as a kid pulling this and you
can't<00:03:33.160> give<00:03:33.490> it<00:03:33.580> some<00:03:33.730> good<00:03:33.970> pressure<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.360> pull

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
can't give it some good pressure to pull

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.440 
can't give it some good pressure to pull
it<00:03:34.630> out<00:03:34.920> pulling<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.100> right<00:03:36.130> out<00:03:36.340> off<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.120> out

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
it out pulling it right out off and out

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.280 
it out pulling it right out off and out
and<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:40.060> yeah<00:03:40.300> so<00:03:40.600> then<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:40.810> just<00:03:40.960> flip<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.170> out

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
and so yeah so then you just flip it out

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.710 
and so yeah so then you just flip it out
makes<00:03:41.710> his<00:03:41.860> toes<00:03:42.210> really<00:03:43.210> really<00:03:43.600> cool

it'll pick on the inside of his hands
like<00:04:00.070> so<00:04:00.340> many<00:04:00.460> of<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.760> other<00:04:00.990> technibond<00:04:03.720> and

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
like so many of the other technibond and

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.970 
like so many of the other technibond and
then<00:04:04.840> you<00:04:04.930> could<00:04:05.080> actually<00:04:05.230> reattach<00:04:05.740> these

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
then you could actually reattach these

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.510 
then you could actually reattach these
