00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300
 and we are going to chat for a little francky dury 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.910
 at rest it will look good 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.900
 you score in 44th minute and 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.320
 then you become 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.570
 silenced in the second half 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.550
 what went wrong if something went wrong 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.330
 just went or underwent it 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.340
 game then I think we now have a good one 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.600
 much didn't play great but what one 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:35.700
 walls control the game and nature 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.399
 yes some people in my team 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.160
 outside of my team 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:47.969
 a bit the pedals lost why 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.620
 that we lost the pedals in it 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.620
 Darkness of light suddenly went 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.510
 out and I hope we like this one 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.399
 match must be able to analyze together 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.629
 but with the team how they teach you 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.399
 then I think then before 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.649
 but the better can be one 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.370
 first look at all its everything 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.199
 under control 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.600
 i think i'm in it here 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.170
 never did we see that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.180
 give hands went but yes the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.860
 in short, too many things where you 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.470
 jacket team must be strong in building 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.770
 from a new team to get there 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.770
 respond 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.600
 you say a new team 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.300
 don't all get on his leg yet 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.070
 nevertheless you bring kian and number of young ones 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.050
 players again who made a surprise 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.100
 today could not be precise 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.100
 does not make a difference 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.470
 they offered my team 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.470
 happens with heights and lows 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.870
 for me only gelish rest in between 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.910
 we are to draw lessons for we 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.950
 must know what we can and must do 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.630
 know what we can't do we can't 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.440
 say to you play then you are never allowed 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.910
 we have to do that 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.410
 draw good lessons for the future 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.710
 because everyone would expect were 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.710
 and that we bring good performance and 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.550
 something new happened at the top 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.030
 to get in 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.280
 but you also do not return 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:28.959
 when will you have to take steps 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:33.580
 well okay i wish you a lot there 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:37.239
 good luck with Frankie who is actually one 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.830
 bit after one he gets it 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.700
 cold shower and literally and figuratively 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.400
 over you in the 44th minute 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.610
 then you enter the dressing room and then 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.220
 the second half we get another one 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.890
 to see other gene also maybe 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.660
 thanks to two large switches 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.660
 twang of the players who score 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.190
 it was a copy of that china the anyway 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.660
 from the match against Mechelen with that 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.580
 difference that the first half 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.230
 each was better on our part than 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.120
 against Mechelen 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.250
 in which I especially praise 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.900
 more defenders who are against in the anyway 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.110
 however talented striker and zulte 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.519
 Waregem almost every time you why 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.709
 so men in the danger zone have that 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:28.420
 we really did very well alone 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.430
 they have yes just before the rest they can 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.830
 score on a stage where we are 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.540
 actually a minute before should 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.569
 we score but we walk outside 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.849
 game 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.739
 it must be smarter than that 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.930
 I told him several times 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.609
 So these are details details that 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.859
 maybe grind match 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.920
 country you must avoid against salty 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:52.010
 waregem 'is it about difference if you 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.889
 also likes to find out 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.299
 now just like against Mechelen we have that 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.090
 be able to realize the second half again 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:02.510
 against the windows hack your total the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.370
 western days their 55th minute and that is 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.810
 Then the 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.689
 yes the luxury that have grabbed everyone 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.040
 speaks about the wipers of the coach me 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.870
 my colleague looked in yesterday 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.239
 kortrijk you didn't have to change because 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.310
 if you're not a bank it is 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.419
 dividend i have i have a man i have 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.000
 that much 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.440
 the manga in the gallery with men who 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.930
 that are not selected 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.830
 plus a lot of hurt in which one 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.620
 hope not much 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.470
 a few important ones so I have 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.080
 material and yes then you already have to coach 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.240
 ears that that those banks is sharp that 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.440
 who are fit to be ready to go 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.970
 come 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.860
 and then you have to cross the youth the right one 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.180
 make choices and for the rest it is one 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.639
 players who make the difference on it 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.310
 further because I have put them three here 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.710
 they have worked and that we have done 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.800
 mentally strong 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.979
 also the fact afterwards a penalty miss 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.930
 keeps going and yet I can 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.340
 should not necessarily congratulate this 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.130
 group 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.440
 even hear are together to go 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.889
 We, the present head too 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.889
 quality 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.370
 various qualities and there we can 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.280
 a little meh meh play along 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.409
 and it's up to us to make the right choices 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.990
 make and that's good today 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:22.610
 fallen against a team that if you are still 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.550
 time will we get anyway 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.639
 have it back very close to the top 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.539
 6 as she might see it 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:33.169
 our competitor 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.669
 so I think we'll take the bill 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.229
 have to keep keeping the very happy 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.710
 to do 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.600
 okay thanks a lot 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.580

 then we play against kv kortrijk one 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.590
