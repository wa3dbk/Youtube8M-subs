let's go to jump onto the imac and see

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.960 
let's go to jump onto the imac and see

it's going to engage this test now keep

seconds<00:01:59.700> so<00:01:59.880> that's<00:02:00.420> actually<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.020> me<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
seconds so that's actually to me is a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.810 
seconds so that's actually to me is a
significant<00:02:01.950> improvement<00:02:02.070> from<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.579> macbook

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
significant improvement from the macbook

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.910 
significant improvement from the macbook
pro<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> save<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.229> time<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.500> most

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
pro it's going to save you time to most

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.260 
pro it's going to save you time to most
people<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.340> might<00:02:05.549> not<00:02:05.700> matter<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.210> it

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
people that might not matter so it

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.609 
people that might not matter so it
really<00:02:06.479> comes<00:02:06.750> down<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.020> whether<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.469> need

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
really comes down to whether you need

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
really comes down to whether you need
mobility<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.179> keep<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.450> at<00:02:09.569> home

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
mobility or if you can keep it at home

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.699 
mobility or if you can keep it at home
obviously<00:02:09.810> you're<00:02:10.110> gonna<00:02:10.200> get<00:02:10.319> faster

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
obviously you're gonna get faster

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.290 
obviously you're gonna get faster
performance<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.459> much<00:02:11.670> bigger<00:02:11.940> screen

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
performance and a much bigger screen

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.580 
performance and a much bigger screen
real<00:02:12.480> estate<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:13.080> I

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
real estate so I

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.350 
real estate so I
do<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.830> more<00:02:14.129> in-depth<00:02:14.519> review<00:02:14.849> kind<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.150> very
