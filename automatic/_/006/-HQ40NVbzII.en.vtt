00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
find it it is out there somewhere the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.130 
find it it is out there somewhere the
same<00:02:48.640> goes<00:02:48.910> for<00:02:48.940> theories<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.780> expansion

same goes for theories of the expansion

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.470 
same goes for theories of the expansion
of<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.380> universe<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.700> cooling<00:02:52.060> off<00:02:52.210> of

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
matter within it and for those who don't

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.190 
matter within it and for those who don't
really<00:02:54.850> care<00:02:55.150> about<00:02:55.240> the<00:02:55.450> science<00:02:55.780> but<00:02:56.110> are

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
really care about the science but are

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.820 
really care about the science but are
just<00:02:56.380> awed<00:02:56.620> by<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.950> art<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.760> does<00:02:58.090> look<00:02:58.300> really

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
just awed by the art it does look really

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.770 
just awed by the art it does look really
really<00:02:59.830> cool<00:03:00.160> so<00:03:01.030> if<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.270> like<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:01.540> video

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
really cool so if you like this video

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.470 
really cool so if you like this video
watch<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.410> again<00:03:02.770> otherwise<00:03:03.640> pick<00:03:03.940> one<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.300> the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
watch it again otherwise pick one of the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.330 
watch it again otherwise pick one of the
boxes<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.380> my<00:03:05.470> side<00:03:05.650> right<00:03:05.830> now<00:03:05.890> which<00:03:06.190> I'll

boxes to my side right now which I'll

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.860 
boxes to my side right now which I'll
take<00:03:06.550> you<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.760> something<00:03:06.970> else<00:03:07.270> we've<00:03:07.480> done
