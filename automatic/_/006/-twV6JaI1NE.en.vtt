00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
just wasn't a great experience and I

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.039 
just wasn't a great experience and I
probably<00:01:36.210> would<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.479> never<00:01:36.659> brought

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
probably would have never brought

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.469 
probably would have never brought
another<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.530> except<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.460> met<00:01:38.670> my<00:01:38.759> wife<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:39.240> year

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
another one except I met my wife a year

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.569 
another one except I met my wife a year
later<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.020> she<00:01:40.470> at<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> time<00:01:40.860> happened<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> be

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
later and she at the time happened to be

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.880 
later and she at the time happened to be
training<00:01:41.790> for<00:01:41.880> her<00:01:42.090> first<00:01:42.270> marathon<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.990> she

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
training for her first marathon and she

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.319 
training for her first marathon and she
also<00:01:43.920> worked<00:01:44.310> at<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> running<00:01:44.670> store<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.180> just

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
also worked at a running store and just

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.580 
also worked at a running store and just
knew<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> whole<00:01:45.780> lot<00:01:45.930> more<00:01:46.079> about<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.380> than<00:01:46.409> I

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
knew a whole lot more about it than I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.520 
knew a whole lot more about it than I
did<00:01:46.820> like<00:01:47.820> without<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.090> train<00:01:48.360> properly<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.020> she

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
did like without a train properly so she

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.710 
did like without a train properly so she
kind<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.740> got<00:01:49.860> me<00:01:50.009> back<00:01:50.159> into<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:51.420> um

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
kind of got me back into it and then um

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.990 
kind of got me back into it and then um
I<00:01:52.079> did<00:01:52.530> two<00:01:52.979> or<00:01:53.040> three<00:01:53.159> marathons<00:01:53.430> after<00:01:53.850> that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
I did two or three marathons after that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.139 
I did two or three marathons after that
and<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.990> guess<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.649> actually<00:01:55.890> run<00:01:56.040> about<00:01:56.790> five

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and I guess that actually run about five

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.120 
and I guess that actually run about five
different<00:01:57.329> marathons<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> process<00:01:59.070> of

different marathons in the process of

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.410 
different marathons in the process of

after i went vegetarian because it just
kind<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.760> seemed<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.030> an<00:02:45.209> interesting<00:02:45.420> thing

much I thought I thought maybe there are
plenty<00:02:57.269> of<00:02:57.360> people<00:02:57.570> who<00:02:57.600> might<00:02:57.989> be<00:02:58.140> vegetarian

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
plenty of people who might be vegetarian

plenty of people who might be vegetarian
for<00:02:58.739> ethical<00:02:59.069> reasons<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.519> just<00:02:59.670> wanted<00:02:59.910> to

for ethical reasons and just wanted to
know<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.840> best<00:03:01.110> way<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.410> make<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.100> work<00:03:02.310> with

your<00:03:34.890> performance<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:35.459> much<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.880> think<00:03:36.299> to

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
your performance so much I think to

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.789 
your performance so much I think to
start<00:03:36.690> off<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.049> kind<00:03:37.140> of<00:03:37.230> ease<00:03:37.380> into<00:03:37.590> things

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
start off and kind of ease into things

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.060 
start off and kind of ease into things
because<00:03:38.340> probably<00:03:38.850> most<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.150> our<00:03:39.239> listeners

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
because probably most of our listeners

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.470 
because probably most of our listeners
maybe<00:03:41.070> have<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.430> distant<00:03:41.880> goal<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.329> a

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
maybe have that distant goal of a

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.470 
maybe have that distant goal of a
marathon<00:03:43.200> or<00:03:43.380> half-marathon<00:03:44.239> but<00:03:45.239> most<00:03:45.390> of

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
marathon or half-marathon but most of

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.120 
marathon or half-marathon but most of
them<00:03:45.540> are<00:03:45.600> probably<00:03:45.900> novices<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.470> pretty

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
them are probably novices and pretty

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.800 
them are probably novices and pretty
early<00:03:47.430> on<00:03:47.459> if<00:03:47.790> they're<00:03:47.940> runners<00:03:48.180> at<00:03:48.420> all<00:03:48.570> and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
early on if they're runners at all and

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.420 
early on if they're runners at all and
i'm<00:03:49.380> sure<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.620> encounter<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.010> lot<00:03:50.100> of<00:03:50.310> that
