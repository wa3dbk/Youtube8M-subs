 stability g sail all to their honor I 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:21.259
 I'm not even all that and when I was 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.570

 did it's a single voice disorder 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.860
 at the level of the brain I mean 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.479
 except that I came across a 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.640
 psychiatrist doctor who wanted 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.619
 absolutely treat me with 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.700
 pharmaceuticals 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.960
 that's what I told you about in all 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.479
 first is that drugs is 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:04.110
 a real bastard zyprexa xanax 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:07.229
 dividing ctia the tercian all these 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.250
 stuff there the sun years and so on and 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.200
 I go because there are still some 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.550
 a lot it's a real bastard 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.810
 it's a real joke because it's 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.090
 do not treat you that puts you in a 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.110
 second state and these drugs are 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.129
 how to say 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.050
 and if we create on the idea of sailing to his 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.410
 defense the mouth is cool we can 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.440
 to sell 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.030
 it is a good pretext point bar the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.849
 pharmaceutical companies sell its 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.130
 share through all and all these 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.780
 psychiatrists that he is who he is and 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.099
 prescribe to their patients they will tell me 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.290
 boiled valence because you're not 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.299
 aarhus against psychiatry that no no 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.340
 a sincerely business 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.720
 pharmaceutical create these drugs 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.099
 like a bakery creating 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:58.220
 chopsticks and its purpose is to sell the 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.750
 stock in the day or for a 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.260
 pharmaceutical company it's simple 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.560
 she creates so many a year and the goal according to 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.860
 the minimum flows 75% 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.690
 that's how it happens and if that 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.980
 do not go away well we 'll find 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.109
 something or their son and we're going 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.790
 to go but it's necessary that people 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.889
 take these crap because it's 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.290
 just a question of money it's not there 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:29.870
 to cure one's a matter of 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:32.389
 cash it's from the dough psychiatry a 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.209
 psychiatrist who will make you a 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.160
 basic diagnosis Thursday by a 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.780
 complete diagnosis g that will make you 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.850
 a diagnosis about your problem 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.739
 seeing you half an hour not even 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.620
 seeing you 15 minutes me it was 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.510
 my case the first time and in you 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.299
 asking what you have my luck that 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.639
 you feel what is the end or giving 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.620
 a prescription it does not matter if kate 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.019
 to the raid 6 4 it's someone who takes the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.099
 time you listen to someone who takes 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.170
 marks 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.430
 but only important things and 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.560
 only if you ask him to 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.269
 note because normally in 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.540
 psychiatry psychology take some 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.139
 Notes 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.359
 it's very very very stupid because that's it 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.400
 it proves that not necessarily a very 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:18.729
 good doctor 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:21.479
 brief is so a psychiatrist who does his 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.539
 work in 15 minutes even in 20 minutes 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.380
 he's not a psychiatrist without quacks 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.750
 and I can tell you that there are some 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.870
 a lot of doctors like that yeah 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:36.190
 I met a guy once 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.900
 my age who who spit on the 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.120
 psychologist ten but they do not 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.949
 serve their purpose is to talk 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.990
 to people so saying to treat them no 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.220
 we psychiatrists we're here we're here 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.260
 with our drugs a shame it 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.630
 people he was in first year of 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.820
 medicine and already considered himself 6 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.250
 While he was not, he had 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.870
 already the same speech that you know big 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.600
 asshole of quacks who are around 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.419
 it is crazy anyway that is to say that the 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.690
 problem is not the guy in himself 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.240
 it's school and school that's what 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.729
 shape the doctor so try to imagine 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.120
 how many psychiatrists we son of 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.180
 bitch 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.669
 fucked ravenous that there are around 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.000
 we in france and belgium in switzerland 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.620
 and in other countries so here are the 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.770
 drugs it's a pure bastard 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.130
 it's just an invention to win 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.440
 money 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.240
 point bar because since when is 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.070
 what we will allow someone to 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.780
 no longer thinking about committing suicide by giving him 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.699
 a stamp excuse me but for me 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.699
 it's not possible it's just 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:40.240
 theoretically impossible and physically 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:43.870
 with horns chemically still far from 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.310
 at home and also finally a hospital just 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.720
 to make it short because it's already 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.080
 more than five minutes is that guy has to 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.130
 recover a moment it's really not 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.639
 the best place to send a 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.530
 child is a trauma that me 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.210
 sir yet yet despite the fact 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.270
 that I have a life in quotation marks I 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.240
 Normal repeat today it myself 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.970
 still the trauma of the hospital and I 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.150
 can you say that it's scary 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:12.159
 it's really creepy good here just 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.389
 think carefully if you are if you 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:14.710
 not feeling well but where prices 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.300
 if you want to see a psychiatrist 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.220
 think carefully see a psychologist 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.630
 before and specify that you do not want 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.320
 take medication you know that 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.659
 it's a bastard 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.720
 it's a bastard if a day 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.800
 someone says 'yes' 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.750
 and this you internal to the hospital or 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.190
