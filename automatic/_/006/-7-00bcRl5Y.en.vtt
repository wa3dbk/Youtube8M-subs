00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.590 
to medium which is the lightest and then
the<00:01:55.049> other<00:01:55.350> one<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:56.009> medium<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.880> dark<00:01:57.119> so

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
the other one is medium to dark so

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.440 
the other one is medium to dark so
obviously<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.680> didn't<00:01:59.340> get<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.729> one<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.210> I'm

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
obviously I didn't get that one so I'm

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.569 
obviously I didn't get that one so I'm
assuming<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.250> kind

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
assuming that this is going to be kind

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.780 
assuming that this is going to be kind
of<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:03.030> powder<00:02:03.810> consistency<00:02:04.799> at<00:02:05.189> least<00:02:05.579> that's

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
of a powder consistency at least that's

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.310 
of a powder consistency at least that's
what<00:02:05.880> I'm<00:02:06.060> hoping<00:02:06.090> I'm<00:02:06.780> hoping<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.259> not

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
what I'm hoping I'm hoping it's not

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.130 
what I'm hoping I'm hoping it's not
gonna<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:07.950> oily<00:02:08.700> or<00:02:08.729> greasy<00:02:09.000> feeling<00:02:09.989> or

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
gonna be like oily or greasy feeling or

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.510 
gonna be like oily or greasy feeling or
anything<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.800> even<00:02:11.160> though<00:02:11.370> it's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
anything like that even though it's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.280 
anything like that even though it's
supposed<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.970> kind<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.209> be<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.540> BB<00:02:12.930> cream

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
supposed to kind of be like a BB cream

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.809 
supposed to kind of be like a BB cream
I<00:02:13.349> don't<00:02:13.769> know<00:02:13.829> I'm<00:02:14.040> hoping<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.459> it's<00:02:14.610> more

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.819 
like a powder the only makeup that I
have<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:16.980> my<00:02:17.010> face<00:02:17.280> right<00:02:17.489> now<00:02:17.549> is<00:02:18.060> my

have on my face right now is my
foundation<00:02:19.829> which<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.579> just<00:02:20.969> a<00:02:21.209> tinted<00:02:22.200> primer

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
foundation which is just a tinted primer

foundation which is just a tinted primer
I've<00:02:23.310> cut<00:02:23.670> out<00:02:23.819> all<00:02:24.120> other<00:02:24.359> foundations

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
is actually too light for my skin

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.759 
is actually too light for my skin
other<00:04:14.939> than<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.269> little<00:04:15.870> possibility<00:04:16.289> which

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
other than that little possibility which

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.110 
other than that little possibility which
like<00:04:17.009> I<00:04:17.130> said<00:04:17.159> I<00:04:17.340> think<00:04:17.459> could<00:04:17.729> probably<00:04:18.030> be

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
like I said I think could probably be

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.939 
like I said I think could probably be
fixed<00:04:18.329> away<00:04:18.599> the<00:04:18.659> bronzer<00:04:19.229> or<00:04:19.470> something<00:04:19.859> like

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
fixed away the bronzer or something like

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.339 
fixed away the bronzer or something like
that<00:04:20.009> I<00:04:20.190> have<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.699> say<00:04:20.909> I<00:04:20.940> really<00:04:21.479> like<00:04:21.870> this

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
that I have to say I really like this

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.440 
that I have to say I really like this
product<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:23.219> really<00:04:23.279> does<00:04:23.729> have<00:04:24.000> like<00:04:24.240> a

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
product it really does have like a

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.620 
product it really does have like a
mattifying<00:04:24.930> feel<00:04:25.889> to<00:04:26.219> it

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
mattifying feel to it

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.810 
mattifying feel to it
it's<00:04:26.900> not<00:04:27.140> creamy<00:04:27.710> or<00:04:28.250> anything<00:04:28.460> like<00:04:28.760> that

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
it's not creamy or anything like that

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.060 
it's not creamy or anything like that
which<00:04:29.300> is<00:04:29.330> kind<00:04:29.660> of<00:04:29.780> what<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:29.990> was<00:04:30.230> expecting<00:04:30.590> I

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
which is kind of what I was expecting I

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.460 
which is kind of what I was expecting I
don't<00:04:31.520> know<00:04:31.640> why<00:04:31.970> I<00:04:32.480> guess<00:04:32.930> it's<00:04:33.140> because<00:04:33.440> I

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
don't know why I guess it's because I

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.310 
don't know why I guess it's because I
have<00:04:33.920> encountered<00:04:34.250> other<00:04:34.750> powders<00:04:35.750> on<00:04:36.170> the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
have encountered other powders on the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.280 
have encountered other powders on the
market<00:04:36.710> that<00:04:37.010> are<00:04:37.130> kind<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.430> like<00:04:37.670> a<00:04:38.110> wet<00:04:39.110> to

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
market that are kind of like a wet to

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.290 
market that are kind of like a wet to
dry<00:04:39.320> finish<00:04:39.860> so<00:04:40.610> I<00:04:40.640> was<00:04:40.940> kind<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.150> thinking

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
dry finish so I was kind of thinking

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.750 
dry finish so I was kind of thinking
since<00:04:41.720> this<00:04:41.900> is<00:04:42.080> BiBi<00:04:42.500> maybe<00:04:42.770> this<00:04:43.250> was<00:04:43.520> one<00:04:43.730> of

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
since this is BiBi maybe this was one of
