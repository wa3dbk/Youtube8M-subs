00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.519
 the stage top it is super good we have 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.650
 good football facilities on 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.510
 has a good room to spin him a 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.550
 little rotten but hey we will not launch 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.590
 have everything but not stop 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.700
 I prefer I prefer to be here than to the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.829
 manga so 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.180
 so here I hope we'll come back if 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.200
 depression but apparently the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.290
 players were tired so it's good 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.370
 sign it means we worked hard 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.820
 it was necessary to put a layer this point of 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.399
 physical view 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.969
 it was done we worked football 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.579
 also because i think ivan for a 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.260
 grounded and disciplined football in the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.149
 sense where he wants that a tactical scheme 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.370
 who lost themselves in possession of 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.789
 bullet we worked these two aspects there 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.760
 and the physical it's sure he's been 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.930
 engendered and well because all the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.390
 world was tired against the 10 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.770
 now I hope the bottom of the glass 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.780
 come on over matches shown from 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.409
 qualities that we showed during 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.960
 last two matches 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.210
 erase the mistakes we could make and 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.649
 enjoy what we did this observation 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.450
 I showed on the ground 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.609
 in the beginning everyone moaned even me 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.960
 when we have to run do not know it's not 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.359
 nice but here you have to do it 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.130
 it is a job like this it here 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.929
 it's more mental than physical because 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.709
 that I think that from the moment we 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.349
 is a professional player 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.770
 there are no physical worries to run 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:37.959
 so 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.000
 So here it is, but it's part of being 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.619
 human cider go so we rattle a 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.149
 little and then worked after 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.170
 training we say we say thank you to 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.369
 carlos and that made us feel good 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.129
 you get along well with most 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.379
 players after bah that's for sure that with 

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:53.379
 dino in the sense that we play together 

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:54.640
 in lax there are some atoms 

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:58.629
 hooked after I get along well with 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.649
 thuram also very beautiful faty this is it 

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:02.170
 still the boss of the table so 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.239
 it's people with whom I 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.390
 often share dinner at the academy 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:08.019
 so here it is go auriel I hear myself 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.479
 well with everyone 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.400
 after you had to come out and 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.629
 Julian because it's with him that I 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.319
 share the most time because we have 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.700
 all the time together in the room 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.139
 that means there are bros and fights 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.030
 often it's thuram she worked months 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.500
 in relation to seniority here is there 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.389
 rules to follow and when I am 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.739
 not or another and threaded good on the 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.250
 field and give way to bring my 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.260
 experience 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.480
 after I think it 's not just me 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.750
 also to rigaud riel this is it's 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.790
 players who know the job so 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.470
 I said well and I left so I 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.480
 lead my teammates on the field 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.090
 in the sense that I am the player who 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.220
 best seen the game since I'm the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.750
 more indented so here I have this role 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.510
 because I have a big mouth 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.220
 so the meije the sea the front for 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.470
 for my teammates after that there is 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.560
 sometimes also or where I am and 3 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.420
 must know how to tell me too 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.700
 It's this week that she 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.959
 been the most seen on his good arrival then 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.670
 it's going to be like who had an illness 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.890
 the rod that I like a 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.020
 treatment for the constant rarely my 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.150
 luck I wanted to clear the ball is 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.349
 now in the goal obviously this makes 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.819
 the second time after the devils 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.959
 threat standard tools that's how we 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.920
 never say two without three I hope that 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.920
 the third time will be beaten
