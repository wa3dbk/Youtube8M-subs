00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.610 
it's there mmm so there are two the
47-44<00:02:19.739> or<00:02:20.040> they<00:02:20.580> almost<00:02:20.820> look<00:02:21.269> identical<00:02:21.620> what

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
47-44 or they almost look identical what

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.500 
47-44 or they almost look identical what
are<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.799> features<00:02:23.180> apart<00:02:24.180> from<00:02:24.299> the<00:02:24.420> obvious

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
are the features apart from the obvious

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.350 
are the features apart from the obvious
size<00:02:24.989> difference<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:26.790> can<00:02:27.030> differentiate

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
size difference that can differentiate

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.240 
size difference that can differentiate
these<00:02:27.660> two<00:02:27.870> they<00:02:28.380> both<00:02:28.440> have<00:02:28.829> that<00:02:29.010> wonderful

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
these two they both have that wonderful

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.550 
these two they both have that wonderful
ceramic<00:02:30.180> bezel

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
ceramic bezel

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.940 
ceramic bezel
as<00:02:30.950> we've<00:02:31.160> said<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:32.450> main<00:02:32.840> difference<00:02:33.260> is

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
as we've said the main difference is

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.580 
as we've said the main difference is
visually<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> dial<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.390> forty<00:02:36.260> seven

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
visually in the dial the forty seven

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.070 
visually in the dial the forty seven
millimeter<00:02:36.770> has<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.459> wonderful<00:02:38.330> inner<00:02:38.780> bezel

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
millimeter has a wonderful inner bezel

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.620 
millimeter has a wonderful inner bezel
that<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.770> like<00:02:40.310> stainless<00:02:40.760> steel<00:02:40.970> mm-hmm<00:02:41.540> and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
that is like stainless steel mm-hmm and

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.140 
that is like stainless steel mm-hmm and
also<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.620> ring<00:02:42.800> around<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.220> small<00:02:43.640> seconds

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
also the ring around the small seconds

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.300 
also the ring around the small seconds
is<00:02:44.330> also<00:02:44.690> like<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.870> silver<00:02:45.680> stainless<00:02:46.160> steel

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
is also like a silver stainless steel

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.180 
is also like a silver stainless steel
and<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:47.030> just<00:02:47.780> sort<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.260> adds<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.620> dressy

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
and that just sort of adds a dressy

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.820 
and that just sort of adds a dressy

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
can wear in the boardroom it's a

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.570 
can wear in the boardroom it's a
fantastic<00:02:57.769> design<00:02:58.040> for<00:02:58.250> them

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
fantastic design for them

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.400 
fantastic design for them
it's<00:02:58.790> great<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.390> 44<00:02:59.870> millimeter<00:03:00.260> that

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
it's great and on the 44 millimeter that

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.979 
it's great and on the 44 millimeter that
in<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:00.739> small<00:03:01.370> second<00:03:01.819> ring<00:03:02.420> around<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.780> small

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
in a small second ring around the small

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.620 
in a small second ring around the small
second<00:03:03.380> is<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.739> darker<00:03:04.220> color<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:05.030> is<00:03:05.239> it's<00:03:05.480> just

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
second is a darker color it is it's just

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.420 
second is a darker color it is it's just
basically<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.110> same<00:03:06.380> color<00:03:06.769> as<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.010> dial

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
basically the same color as the dial

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.970 
basically the same color as the dial
itself<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.260> same<00:03:09.470> with<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.739> small

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
itself and the same with the small

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.190 
itself and the same with the small
seconds<00:03:10.489> they<00:03:10.880> haven't<00:03:11.110> differentiated<00:03:12.110> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
seconds they haven't differentiated the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.140 
seconds they haven't differentiated the
ring<00:03:12.380> around<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:13.310> obvious<00:03:13.640> difference

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
ring around it the obvious difference

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.330 
ring around it the obvious difference
between<00:03:14.660> these<00:03:14.959> two<00:03:15.200> watches<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.160> other

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
between these two watches and the other

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.000 
between these two watches and the other
two<00:03:16.760> small<00:03:17.060> seconds<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.750> range<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.290> that

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
two small seconds in the range is that

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.740 
two small seconds in the range is that
the<00:03:19.160> movement<00:03:19.519> has<00:03:19.610> been<00:03:19.760> rotated<00:03:20.000> 90<00:03:20.720> degrees

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
the movement has been rotated 90 degrees

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.050 
the movement has been rotated 90 degrees
and<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.799> believe<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.160> gives<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.489> gives<00:03:22.880> the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
and I believe it gives it gives the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.479 
and I believe it gives it gives the
watch<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.420> bit<00:03:23.750> better<00:03:23.959> balance<00:03:24.500> where<00:03:25.280> that

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
watch a bit better balance where that

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.759 
watch a bit better balance where that
small<00:03:25.730> second<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.239> located<00:03:26.780> that's<00:03:27.530> right

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
small second is located that's right

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.900 
small second is located that's right
they've<00:03:27.950> dropped<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.340> from<00:03:28.459> around<00:03:28.670> about<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
they've dropped it from around about the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.970 
they've dropped it from around about the
10<00:03:29.090> o'clock<00:03:29.209> position<00:03:30.080> down<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.500> bit<00:03:30.860> below

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
10 o'clock position down to a bit below

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.039 
10 o'clock position down to a bit below
the<00:03:31.099> 9<00:03:31.370> o'clock<00:03:31.519> position<00:03:32.120> because<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.930> other

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
the 9 o'clock position because the other

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.569 
the 9 o'clock position because the other
thing<00:03:33.260> with<00:03:33.590> these<00:03:33.709> two<00:03:33.769> new<00:03:34.220> ones<00:03:34.430> that

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
thing with these two new ones that

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.759 
thing with these two new ones that
that's<00:03:34.970> ceramic<00:03:35.480> bezel<00:03:35.870> just<00:03:36.620> looks

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
that's ceramic bezel just looks

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.520 
that's ceramic bezel just looks
fantastic<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:38.030> think<00:03:38.299> it<00:03:38.390> is<00:03:38.510> it<00:03:39.019> is<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.200> step

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
fantastic and I think it is it is a step

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.890 
fantastic and I think it is it is a step
up<00:03:39.680> in<00:03:39.829> quality<00:03:40.070> for<00:03:40.459> us<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:41.359> I<00:03:41.390> think<00:03:41.570> we

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
up in quality for us that I think we

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.020 
up in quality for us that I think we
