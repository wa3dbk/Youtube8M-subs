00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.830 
thing i noticed that maybe most people
overlook<00:04:50.740> or<00:04:51.190> don't<00:04:51.729> care<00:04:51.970> about<00:04:52.090> as<00:04:52.360> much<00:04:52.509> but

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
overlook or don't care about as much but

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.310 
overlook or don't care about as much but
the<00:04:53.639> xbox<00:04:54.639> one<00:04:54.850> controller<00:04:55.449> looks<00:04:55.780> very<00:04:56.199> very

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
the xbox one controller looks very very

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.460 
the xbox one controller looks very very
similar<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.669> xbox<00:04:58.120> 360<00:04:58.570> controller<00:04:58.660> now<00:04:59.199> i

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
similar to the xbox 360 controller now i

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.830 
similar to the xbox 360 controller now i
think<00:04:59.860> it<00:05:00.039> looked<00:05:00.220> like<00:05:00.310> it<00:05:00.460> i<00:05:00.669> I<00:05:01.000> don't<00:05:01.720> know

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
think it looked like it i I don't know

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.779 
think it looked like it i I don't know
to<00:05:01.930> me<00:05:02.080> looked<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.740> don't<00:05:03.039> have<00:05:03.160> like<00:05:03.310> a<00:05:03.370> picture

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
to me looked I don't have like a picture

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:04.830 
to me looked I don't have like a picture
in<00:05:03.850> front<00:05:03.970> of<00:05:04.120> me<00:05:04.180> or<00:05:04.240> anything<00:05:04.389> but<00:05:04.570> I<00:05:04.660> think

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
in front of me or anything but I think

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.810 
in front of me or anything but I think
it<00:05:04.900> had<00:05:05.020> like<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:05.410> little<00:05:06.130> bit<00:05:06.250> of<00:05:06.340> extra<00:05:06.639> space

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
it had like a little bit of extra space

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.279 
it had like a little bit of extra space
may<00:05:07.210> be<00:05:07.240> on<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.510> top<00:05:07.720> in<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:07.990> middle<00:05:08.199> of<00:05:08.229> the

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
may be on the top in the middle of the

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:09.570 
may be on the top in the middle of the
controller<00:05:08.650> or<00:05:08.830> something<00:05:09.100> I<00:05:09.190> don't<00:05:09.250> know<00:05:09.370> but

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
controller or something I don't know but

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.189 
controller or something I don't know but
as<00:05:09.669> far<00:05:09.820> as<00:05:09.880> like<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.240> layout<00:05:10.419> and<00:05:10.780> holding<00:05:11.110> it

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
as far as like the layout and holding it

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.750 
as far as like the layout and holding it
and<00:05:11.320> buttons<00:05:11.620> and<00:05:11.680> everything<00:05:12.010> it's<00:05:12.580> almost

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
and buttons and everything it's almost

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.540 
and buttons and everything it's almost
the<00:05:12.970> exact<00:05:13.330> same<00:05:13.419> and<00:05:14.340> that's<00:05:15.340> actually

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
the exact same and that's actually

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.490 
the exact same and that's actually
exciting<00:05:16.210> to<00:05:16.300> me<00:05:16.419> because<00:05:16.449> I<00:05:16.720> think<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.199> xbox

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
exciting to me because I think the xbox

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.890 
exciting to me because I think the xbox
360<00:05:17.919> controller<00:05:17.979> is<00:05:18.460> great<00:05:18.789> and<00:05:19.090> maybe<00:05:19.660> it's

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
360 controller is great and maybe it's

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.420 
360 controller is great and maybe it's
just<00:05:19.960> because<00:05:20.110> I'm<00:05:20.289> so<00:05:20.470> used<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:20.919> it<00:05:20.949> I<00:05:21.250> know

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
just because I'm so used to it I know

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.370 
just because I'm so used to it I know
whenever<00:05:21.940> I<00:05:22.090> played<00:05:22.419> playstation<00:05:22.660> I<00:05:23.080> was<00:05:23.229> used

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
whenever I played playstation I was used

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.159 
whenever I played playstation I was used
to<00:05:23.470> that<00:05:23.650> controller<00:05:24.039> but<00:05:24.910> I<00:05:24.940> like<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.509> 360<00:05:26.139> a

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
to that controller but I like the 360 a

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:27.629 
to that controller but I like the 360 a
lot<00:05:26.349> better<00:05:26.470> I<00:05:26.620> like<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:26.889> feel<00:05:27.009> the<00:05:27.070> triggers

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
lot better I like to feel the triggers

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.490 
lot better I like to feel the triggers
and<00:05:27.970> I<00:05:28.120> don't<00:05:28.300> like<00:05:28.419> having<00:05:28.780> four<00:05:29.110> shoulder

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
and I don't like having four shoulder

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.370 
and I don't like having four shoulder
buttons<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.070> stuff<00:05:30.220> like<00:05:30.400> that<00:05:30.460> but<00:05:31.169> so<00:05:32.169> I<00:05:32.199> was

actually<00:05:32.680> excited<00:05:32.919> to<00:05:33.190> see<00:05:33.310> the<00:05:33.460> controller

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
actually excited to see the controller

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.350 
actually excited to see the controller
hasn't<00:05:34.240> changed<00:05:34.599> much<00:05:34.900> and<00:05:35.610> no<00:05:36.610> no<00:05:36.820> like<00:05:37.030> crazy
