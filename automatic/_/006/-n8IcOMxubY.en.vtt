00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.240
 with the duels pokerstars we go to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.770
 looking for natural born poker 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.360
 player so this week we're going 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.500
 duty if our two candidates arrive at 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.720
 think logically 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.540
 so here you see a container with 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.820
 the water so I'm going to ask you to 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.700
 emptying is to spill this container without 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.470
 never use your body basically you 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:39.590
 will have to use only the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.590
 attributes that I gave you 3 2 1 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.130
 you can not buy ten seconds 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:00.030
 thirty seconds like that I can not 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.720
 touch if you can touch but you do not 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.299
 can not throw to the object 3 2 it's not 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.789
 good no good at all we'll see if our 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.210
 me sophie is better than you can not 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.380
 do worse 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.470
 3 2 1 it's gone 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:27.569
 is it drinking at the yes ten 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:31.310
 seconds no but it's not over there 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.310
 must empty and reverse 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:45.280
 sophie what are we doing for 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:48.539
 reverse a few strides in the 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.829
 time but to the near unbelievable 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.049
 do you, too, like sophie 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.719
 think logically then vast 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.679
 roof on pokerstars this point b good 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.679
