00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello friends welcome are to another 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.930
 new video I think they are not blind as 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.300
 to not see the title but probably 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.160
 you who are watching the video you will give 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.139
 yourself that all this you already saw in 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.849
 other videos of the shopkeepers but you 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.130
 I will say it will be worth it since many of 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.130
 these data are not mentioned by the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.160
 same without further pretexts 5 data 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.010
 curious about dragon ball gt let's start 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.010
 1 what was the reason to be a goku 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.779
 small because the reason was simple the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.430
 betrayed and wanted something that a child of 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.770
 new to be able to face the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.360
 villains that obviously had in mind 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.489
 in your search for the spheres of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.440
 dragon since they knew that the goku 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.870
 current was so powerful up to limits 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.030
 unsuspected then they decided 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.800
 shrink this new goku so that these 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.379
 villains in mind have some 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.300
 opportunity with these fans is more 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.520
 that clear that goku loses his powers to 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.469
 be small but I will clarify something 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.039
 this is until you get the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.260
 transformation of ssj 4 ie the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.920
 goku gt was weaker than the saga 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.810
 debut in ssj an equal in ssj 2 equal and 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.030
 in ssj 3 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.630
 because in this transformation it was noticed 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.520
 more but in ssj 4 his powers increase 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.770
 just because he gave them away and they decided 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.110
 thus evading any kind of logic 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.020
 how much the series really 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.840
 these producers two years 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.880
 they passed in the vejete for the people 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.950
 that still does not understand this point the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.289
 truth is that they spent five years and not 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.170
 ten as rumored as I can 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.210
 confirm simple look for the wikis of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.189
 dragon ball gt in English and Japanese and 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.170
 they will have the answer but in other 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.909
 sources of the same language 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.130
 here the producers seem to be 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.140
 they were wrong or you are simply 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.959
 the Latin American fans that 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.479
 they still believe that they spent 10 years a 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.789
 Clear example would be if they spent 10 years 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.729
 because in the saga of google I had 10 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.700
 years would happen to be 20 years old which is 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.610
 illogical kept four years in de bz and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.009
 would have 14 in gt having the stature of 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.860
 a girl and the body of it does not 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.769
 had trunks would have between 27 and 28 years 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.810
 being that they look 18 years old besides 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.360
 the immaturity of them 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.239
 it seems that spent ten years 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.580
 please three because it made me small to 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.569
 Goku the truth to this day 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.300
 I ask this question 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.160
 in principle this desire would never have 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.860
 to have been fulfilled by three things 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.450
 keys the first how is it possible that 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.630
 batteries and your band know of the existence 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.640
 of the sacred temple second how is 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.680
 possible that they come flying in a ship 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.900
 without it being redirected towards 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.880
 down since you need to scale the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.860
 tower to get to the temple just this 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.530
 method is included to the warriors z 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.690
 because they already fulfilled that task and 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.090
 third goku is supposed to be stronger 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.739
 that kamisama is supposed to be the no 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.019
 fulfills any kind of desire that 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.030
 surpass kamisama's powers as 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.160
 it is possible that it could harm a being 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.099
 which is tens of times stronger in 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.440
 this case is boko the injured 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.470
 aitor the truth is that I weigh more than 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.430
 who believed 4 because vegetable reaches the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.410
 ssj 4 without going through it ssj 3 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.660
 probably many will jump me with that 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.579
 vegeta came to the state god without possessing 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.950
 said transformation but this is 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.020
 totally wrong 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.780
 its part since the transformation of 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.000
 ssj god has nothing to do with the 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.800
 other transformations since the only thing 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.140
 what is needed to achieve it is 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.900
 train with guys a being at the level of a 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.819
 God probably this one has 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.430
 some kind of training for 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.400
 achieve that state and if you put 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.530
 for example the red god ssj as well as what 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.709
 I said earlier in one of my videos 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.230
 it's just a metamorphosis of the true 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.599
 ssj god in other words was not 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.180
 necessary to gather the power of five super 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.459
 saiyan to achieve something incomplete 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.010
 going back to vegeta if you say that 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.380
 the transformation of ssj 4 is cam 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.230
 powerful then how is it possible that 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.209
 vegeta without going through the state of ssj 3 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.640
 can withstand so much hitting power 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.220
 when not even at any time 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.170
 dragon ball gt was seen training the 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.720
 less if we had seen him train 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.070
 it would be something else but they only put it 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.500
 gluts rays and pum ssj 4 for vegeta 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.590
 Jesus Christ 5 is so powerful super 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.139
 number 17 you really believe that 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.530
 this guy is very powerful 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.530
 So if the ssj 4 is violated this only me 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.449
 indeed it shows that SJS 4 is only 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.479
 one more transformation of the rest 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.129
 and on top of that it is not so powerful because 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.749
 warriors it's been a long time 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.699
 outdone the androids 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:44.800
 besides the powers of the androids not 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.629
 they increase and they feel like the serious 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.699
 error that the tower showed us and in this 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:51.580
 saga by saying to trunks that I could 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.199
 feel the ki of android 17 being that 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.080
 he had never met him 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:58.479
 besides the androids do not possess that without 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.520
 deviations let's suppose that androids 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.340
 have in this case the ki of 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.710
 Android 17 should be lower deplete 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.629
 and trunks in super saiyans since these 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.120
 of children they had overcome long ago in 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.740
 force the androids but of course gta 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.259
 iv done by the towel so I do not know 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.750
 what bothered me in conclusion the 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:19.990
 fusion of the androids 17 should not 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.550
 be stronger than ssj 4 if it's supposed 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.650
 who has the fighting power that 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.870
 argue those who idolize it 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.939
 I had planned to do 10 data but the 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.669
 truth is that I forgot the others 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.190
 five remaining xd but maybe upload them 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.590
 in another moment 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.630
 friends that was all I hope to have left 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.580
 in clear some things about this series 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.650
 that they should be grateful for 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.510
 dedicate a video as it is the minimum 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.610
 what fans can we do for this 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.620
 series that practically all threw it 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.660
 in the trash and does not even value it 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.520
 wrong for these producers who do not accept 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.530
 the shit that was sent and how 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.630
 easy is to throw something away just for the 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.240
 money like this is the people of today 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.730
 but well this was not a video for 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.590
 reflect on the people this video is 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.480
 dedicated with the intention of giving them 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.210
 know my point of view about this 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.360
 series Needless to say we are in the 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.520
 next video on purpose do not forget 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.320
 follow me on my facebook page that 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.740
 I leave you below in the description of 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.440
 video 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.180
 there I will mostly let you know if I will upload a 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.420
 new video and if for any inconvenience 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.220
 I could not do it also visit my other 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.740
 video channel that is between 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.690
 the links of my channel through that 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.340
 channel I'm in charge of uploading the best 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.340
 moments and battles of the anime
