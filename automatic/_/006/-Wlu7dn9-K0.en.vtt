00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 we are now referent for horticulture 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.629
 The Chamber of Agriculture Harald Rammel 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.380
 how does it look at the moment in the country 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.610
 Regarding Buchholzzünsler how is he 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.820
 on the rise or how many 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.740
 Plants have already fallen so exactly 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.750
 the number of infected plants can 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.330
 leave the line but we ask 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.500
 It states that there are massive eating activities in the country 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.519
 The whole country is the focus this year 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.800
 the lowlands and the regions that date 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.840
 So these are not yet affected 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.320
 champagne the caterpillars have now mature 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.840
 Mrs and I were tracking 3 of them yesterday 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.540
 mm is up to three inches from that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.950
 You can already have everything available 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.780
 any comparisons to the last one 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.780
 achieve it is stronger or or 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.820
 I can not do that much less 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.420
 really say it is strong enough 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.699
 the whole country invades and it is 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.530
 dramatic 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.550
 what can you do against that 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.420
 Buchholzzünsler do exist there 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.280
 any tips or tricks that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.240
 reasoning is how important you are 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.530
 the bux would like to get into buchs then 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.140
 I have several options 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.180
 individual plants , I can structure mobile phone 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.340
 press the caterpillar together and off 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.810
 Believe in bigger plants 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.880
 Of course the problem is 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.400
 time consuming and the animals live 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.720
 hidden that means there we have then 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.350
 the possibility with one 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.119
 High pressure washer in should be appropriate 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.979
 distance to spray the plants through 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.290
 that part of the caterpillar at least 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.729
 breaks down and if all that nothing 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.869
 helps then there is still the possibility 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.670
 that one with chemical 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.790
 pesticides against this insect 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.520
 here are possible biological 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.590
 medium that can be used so the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.630
 pesticides brought out there 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.210
 There will be two big groups 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.430
 a look he biologically act the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.530
 the other is chemical 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.930
 so the biological ones of course work 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.079
 even if just as sprayed act as 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.750
 even against the insect's effect was like that 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.149
 that the insect will eat this medium 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.159
 that must be recorded and so 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.610
 Refers to the data of the insect 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.720
 under then performs the caterpillar with the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.270
 fr activity so far hampered 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.940
 or it that such severe violations 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.680
 broken is now very slow 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.660
 Buchholzzünslers already several years 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.140
 in the country when we are in the future 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.550
 In any case, you have to get used to it 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.250
 The Buchbaumzünsler feels well 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.620
 had a rich food offer and 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.090
 thus, so will the next 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.300
 years of dealing with the insect therefore 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.040
 My initial question we want the 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.410
 Bux is keeping us that factory 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.960
 several times a year treatments 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.240
 to perform or say you change times 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.310
 plant then takes the plant in general 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.660
 out of the garden 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.510
 now the boxwood calculator got out 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.300
 asia is introduced to us 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.550
 Ever natural enemies has of 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.020
 fuck different but reports the 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.209
 read that mice on mice the west 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.930
 single caterpillars have been treated but 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.730
 or have eaten just the right one 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.870
 So our nature is on this 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.880
 pest is not yet 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.190
 prepared and adjusted and therefore 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.690
 starter treatment success relative 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.870
 weak out there are more 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.269
 plants affected by the infestation of the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.500
 Buchholzzünsler so is with us 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.780
 nothing known 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.330
 has reported that puff and the 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.010
 capitals attack as euronews species 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.660
 but we can have Vorarlberg 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.900
 in this regard, no observations 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.900
 made
