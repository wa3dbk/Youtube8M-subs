00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.780 
high ends a little tiny bit lacking in
one<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.180> these<00:03:33.329> about<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.290> said<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.190> overall

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
one of these about that said the overall

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.970 
one of these about that said the overall
sound<00:03:36.030> stage<00:03:36.389> is<00:03:36.660> very<00:03:37.019> very<00:03:37.290> impressive<00:03:37.620> I

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
sound stage is very very impressive I

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.800 
sound stage is very very impressive I
think<00:03:38.579> they're<00:03:38.730> more<00:03:38.910> suited<00:03:39.359> to<00:03:39.389> sort<00:03:39.720> of

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
think they're more suited to sort of

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.740 
think they're more suited to sort of
like<00:03:40.560> heavy<00:03:40.950> sword<00:03:41.370> rap<00:03:41.609> music<00:03:41.910> site<00:03:42.450> we<00:03:42.660> were

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
like heavy sword rap music site we were

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.960 
like heavy sword rap music site we were
a<00:03:42.780> lot<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.109> basing<00:03:43.680> or<00:03:44.459> indeed<00:03:44.730> if<00:03:44.849> you're

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
a lot of basing or indeed if you're

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.059 
a lot of basing or indeed if you're
using<00:03:45.209> them<00:03:45.389> for<00:03:45.419> gaming<00:03:45.930> those<00:03:46.560> explosions

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
using them for gaming those explosions

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.099 
using them for gaming those explosions
really<00:03:47.849> are<00:03:48.060> going<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.359> come<00:03:48.540> through<00:03:48.569> with

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
really are going to come through with

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.020 
really are going to come through with
the<00:03:49.230> Plantronics<00:03:49.889> rig<00:03:49.980> they're<00:03:50.849> very

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
the Plantronics rig they're very

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.470 
the Plantronics rig they're very
comfortable<00:03:51.569> headset<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.139> very<00:03:53.069> good<00:03:54.000> idea<00:03:54.120> as

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
comfortable headset a very good idea as

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.900 
comfortable headset a very good idea as
well<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.690> do<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.500> combination<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:56.430> these

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
well I do like the combination of these

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.449 
well I do like the combination of these
in<00:03:57.329> combination<00:03:58.290> with<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.739> sort<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.040> control

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
in combination with the sort of control

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.849 
in combination with the sort of control
center<00:03:59.849> this<00:04:00.000> or<00:04:00.180> shuttle<00:04:00.599> mixer<00:04:01.109> I<00:04:01.290> think

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
center this or shuttle mixer I think

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.949 
center this or shuttle mixer I think
it's<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.069> very<00:04:02.459> very<00:04:02.609> good<00:04:02.940> idea<00:04:03.329> and<00:04:03.630> they

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
it's a very very good idea and they

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.960 
it's a very very good idea and they
really<00:04:04.470> do<00:04:04.590> deliver<00:04:04.950> if<00:04:05.250> you're<00:04:05.639> looking<00:04:05.910> for

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
really do deliver if you're looking for

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.210 
really do deliver if you're looking for
something<00:04:06.239> that's<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.630> good<00:04:06.900> mix<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.440> good

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
something that's a good mix of good

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.339 
something that's a good mix of good
quality<00:04:08.669> sound<00:04:08.910> good<00:04:09.480> quality<00:04:09.900> outgoing

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
quality sound good quality outgoing

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.440

audio<00:04:10.739> via<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.160> microphone<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.000> something<00:04:12.419> a

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
audio via the microphone and something a

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.670 
audio via the microphone and something a
little<00:04:12.569> bit<00:04:12.750> different<00:04:13.079> so<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.319> can<00:04:13.440> really

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
little bit different so you can really

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.250
