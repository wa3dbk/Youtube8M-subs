 the most surprising is that 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:08.460
 for example, parents that polish your question 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.900
 don't take the teeth so that I think yes 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.129
 it is also a task of the parents to 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.020
 technology and his teeth must 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.580
 cleaning it can start igniting and that 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.560
 inflammation can continue work on 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.330
 so other parts of the body 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.919
 actually very important to make you one 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.689
 good teeth and we notice 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.560
 just in for example morocco where the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.419

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.429
 yes is not accessible to everyone 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.019
 but information is also very important 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.699
 is so that you have a children's toothbrush 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.099
 also shows how to brush 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.780
 also and that is very important and we 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.090
 They notice that that message is quite 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.180
 good pick up and I hope they do that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.710
 pass it on to others because yes 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.750
