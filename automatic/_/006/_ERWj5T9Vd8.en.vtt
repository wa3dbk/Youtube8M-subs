Thousands of years ago,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.880
Kesari, the king of monkeys and his wife Anjana lived on the mountain Sumeru.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.600
Despite all there well, they were not blessed with a child.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.980
They went to sage Mathanka,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.380
Take a bath in holy Akash Ganga at Thirumala,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.820
and pray to Lord Venkateshwara.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.000
You will find a solution to your problem.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.820
Om Sri Venkateshwaraya Namaha!

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.740
Om Sri Venkateshwaraya Namaha!

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.680
You will soon get a gift of life from the Holy Lord of wind...

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.380
an indomitable Vaayuputra.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.980
He shall cristen him Hanuman.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.680
Pranams to you Lord Venkateshwara!

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.640
You are indeed the saviour of our life.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.180
Om Sri Venkateshwaraya Namaha!
