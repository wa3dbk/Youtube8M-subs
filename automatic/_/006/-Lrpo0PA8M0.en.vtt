potassium sorbate for instance so they

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.770

creating<00:01:50.149> a<00:01:50.389> hard<00:01:50.600> cider<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:52.310> like<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:52.880> said<00:01:52.999> you

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
creating a hard cider so like I said you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.389 
creating a hard cider so like I said you
10:52<00:01:54.079> is<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.469> starting<00:01:54.859> gravity<00:01:55.219> that's

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
10:52 is the starting gravity that's

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.129 
10:52 is the starting gravity that's
important<00:01:55.849> to<00:01:55.939> know<00:01:56.119> because<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.899> want<00:01:57.079> to

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:57.139 
important to know because you want to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.779 
important to know because you want to
kind<00:01:57.349> of<00:01:57.380> figure<00:01:57.619> out<00:01:57.679> what<00:01:58.189> your<00:01:58.459> final

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
kind of figure out what your final

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.419 
kind of figure out what your final
alcohol<00:01:59.060> level<00:01:59.689> is<00:01:59.749> going<00:01:59.869> to<00:01:59.929> be<00:02:00.069> also<00:02:01.069> what

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
alcohol level is going to be also what

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.580 
alcohol level is going to be also what
your<00:02:01.579> flavor<00:02:01.969> profile<00:02:02.479> is<00:02:02.630> going<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.869> be<00:02:03.020> with

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
your flavor profile is going to be with

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.230 
your flavor profile is going to be with
a<00:02:03.619> 1052<00:02:04.399> they're<00:02:04.670> certainly<00:02:04.999> in

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
a 1052 they're certainly in

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.589 
a 1052 they're certainly in
sugar<00:02:05.540> in<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.290> apples<00:02:06.680> apple<00:02:07.460> juice<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:08.270> go

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
sugar in the apples apple juice to go

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.150 
sugar in the apples apple juice to go
ahead<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:08.899> start<00:02:09.140> fermenting<00:02:09.319> just<00:02:09.920> straight

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
ahead and start fermenting just straight

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.890 
ahead and start fermenting just straight
from<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.429> apple<00:02:10.700> juice<00:02:10.849> add<00:02:11.270> in<00:02:11.540> maybe<00:02:11.660> some

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
from the apple juice add in maybe some

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.809 
from the apple juice add in maybe some
flavor<00:02:12.230> pairings<00:02:12.680> if<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:12.920> wanted<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.340> like<00:02:13.700> the

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
flavor pairings if I wanted to like the

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.780 
flavor pairings if I wanted to like the
cinnamon<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:14.300> have<00:02:14.420> here<00:02:15.190> but<00:02:16.190> that's<00:02:16.550> gonna

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
cinnamon I have here but that's gonna

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.210 
cinnamon I have here but that's gonna
end<00:02:17.000> up<00:02:17.150> leaving<00:02:17.330> you<00:02:17.540> with<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> very<00:02:18.380> dry<00:02:18.860> very

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
end up leaving you with a very dry very

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.650 
end up leaving you with a very dry very
crisp<00:02:19.880> maybe<00:02:20.599> even<00:02:20.930> tart<00:02:21.730> apple<00:02:22.730> cider<00:02:22.940> which

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
crisp maybe even tart apple cider which

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.600 
crisp maybe even tart apple cider which
for<00:02:24.110> me<00:02:24.200> personally<00:02:24.230> that's<00:02:25.130> not<00:02:25.340> what<00:02:25.519> I'm

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
for me personally that's not what I'm

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.220 
for me personally that's not what I'm
careful<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.120> don't<00:02:26.330> like<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.720> kind<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:26.989> try

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
careful I don't like it I kind of try

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.620 
careful I don't like it I kind of try
and<00:02:27.260> design<00:02:27.530> mine<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.670> go<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.819> little<00:02:29.209> more<00:02:29.390> like

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
and design mine to go a little more like

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.690 
and design mine to go a little more like
an<00:02:29.870> apple<00:02:30.140> pie<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.530> glass<00:02:30.560> with<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.370> little

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
an apple pie in a glass with a little

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.130 
an apple pie in a glass with a little
bit<00:02:31.819> of<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.060> alcohol<00:02:32.269> to<00:02:32.660> kick<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.989> in<00:02:33.019> the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
bit of that alcohol to kick you in the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.120 
bit of that alcohol to kick you in the
tail<00:02:33.410> so<00:02:34.959> what<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:35.989> do<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.560> end<00:02:36.739> up<00:02:36.920> adding

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
tail so what I do is I end up adding

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.449 
tail so what I do is I end up adding
sugar<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.700> mine<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.390> had<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.870> nice<00:02:39.350> brown<00:02:39.980> sugar

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
sugar to mine I had a nice brown sugar

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.059 
sugar to mine I had a nice brown sugar
not<00:02:41.060> all<00:02:41.269> of<00:02:41.450> this<00:02:41.569> of<00:02:41.780> course<00:02:41.810> seven<00:02:42.620> pounds

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
not all of this of course seven pounds

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.920 
not all of this of course seven pounds
but<00:02:43.610> I'm<00:02:43.760> going<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:43.940> add<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.390> get<00:02:44.720> my

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
but I'm going to add that to get my

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.670 
but I'm going to add that to get my
final<00:02:45.709> gravity<00:02:46.150> up<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.569> right<00:02:48.080> around<00:02:48.319> ten

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
final gravity up to right around ten

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.740 
final gravity up to right around ten
seventy<00:02:49.250> two<00:02:49.670> ten<00:02:49.880> eighty<00:02:50.090> depending<00:02:50.630> on

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
seventy two ten eighty depending on

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.980 
seventy two ten eighty depending on
where<00:02:50.930> which<00:02:51.500> how<00:02:51.739> much<00:02:51.890> I'll<00:02:52.100> probably<00:02:52.310> want

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
where which how much I'll probably want

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.320 
where which how much I'll probably want
I<00:02:53.020> find<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:53.980> gives<00:02:54.160> me<00:02:54.340> enough<00:02:54.580> alcohol<00:02:55.120> to

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
I find that gives me enough alcohol to

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.080 
I find that gives me enough alcohol to
get<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.690> at<00:02:55.840> 6%<00:02:56.320> or<00:02:56.890> better<00:02:57.100> drink<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.940> you

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
get that at 6% or better drink that you

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.630 
get that at 6% or better drink that you
want<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.600> then<00:02:59.230> still<00:02:59.620> leave<00:02:59.860> that<00:03:00.070> residual

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
want and then still leave that residual

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.870 
want and then still leave that residual
sweetness<00:03:00.850> behind<00:03:01.570> that<00:03:02.230> lets<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.800> know<00:03:03.010> it's

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
sweetness behind that lets you know it's

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.090 
sweetness behind that lets you know it's
an<00:03:04.030> apple<00:03:04.420> cider<00:03:04.750> it's<00:03:05.590> not<00:03:05.800> an<00:03:05.950> apple

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
an apple cider it's not an apple

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.610 
an apple cider it's not an apple
champagne<00:03:06.700> so<00:03:07.180> anyway<00:03:07.960> that's<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:08.440> my

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
champagne so anyway that's just my

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.980 
champagne so anyway that's just my
personal<00:03:09.490> profile<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.210> could<00:03:10.510> suit<00:03:10.810> your

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
personal profile you could suit your

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.930 
personal profile you could suit your
recipe<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.440> however<00:03:11.860> you<00:03:12.070> like<00:03:12.310> one<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
recipe to however you like one of the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.130 
recipe to however you like one of the
other<00:03:13.060> things<00:03:13.270> I<00:03:13.390> like<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.660> add<00:03:13.750> also

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
other things I like to add also

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.990 
other things I like to add also
fermentable<00:03:14.740> but<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.040> also<00:03:15.220> like<00:03:15.460> that<00:03:15.490> nfo

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
fermentable but I also like that nfo

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.090 
fermentable but I also like that nfo
flavor<00:03:16.330> is<00:03:16.630> molasses<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.380> love<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.830> flavor

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
flavor is molasses I love the flavor

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.190 
flavor is molasses I love the flavor
again<00:03:18.340> kind<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.090> going<00:03:19.330> with<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:19.630> apple<00:03:19.990> pie

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
again kind of going with that apple pie

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.680 
again kind of going with that apple pie
type<00:03:20.620> flavoring<00:03:21.220> I've<00:03:21.760> got<00:03:22.090> some<00:03:22.390> fresh

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
type flavoring I've got some fresh

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.560 
type flavoring I've got some fresh
broken<00:03:23.620> cinnamon<00:03:24.070> bark<00:03:24.220> right<00:03:25.090> there<00:03:25.390> the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
broken cinnamon bark right there the

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.420 
broken cinnamon bark right there the
cinnamon<00:03:25.930> stick<00:03:26.140> so<00:03:26.740> I'll<00:03:26.830> break<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.190> up<00:03:27.250> a

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
cinnamon stick so I'll break that up a

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.010 
cinnamon stick so I'll break that up a
little<00:03:27.610> bit<00:03:27.850> more<00:03:28.030> into<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.390> few<00:03:28.600> more<00:03:28.750> chunks

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
little bit more into a few more chunks

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.040 
little bit more into a few more chunks
before<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.470> add<00:03:29.710> those<00:03:29.950> in<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.660> have<00:03:31.660> some<00:03:31.870> whole

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
before I add those in I have some whole

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.350 
before I add those in I have some whole
cloves<00:03:32.080> I<00:03:32.890> also<00:03:33.430> have<00:03:33.670> some<00:03:33.820> freshly<00:03:34.030> ground

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
cloves I also have some freshly ground

added to the apple juice now again is it

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.780 
added to the apple juice now again is it
this<00:04:17.440> apple<00:04:17.799> juice<00:04:17.950> is<00:04:18.160> already<00:04:18.549> pre

pasteurized that makes it sit on the

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.910 
pasteurized that makes it sit on the
shelf<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:21.790> don't<00:04:22.060> have<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.630> sterilize<00:04:23.140> this

I would Savannah ties the outside of
your<00:04:31.360> bottle<00:04:31.660> before<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.020> open<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.530> just<00:04:32.710> to

your bottle before you open it just to

right into the fermenter because it is

the 1070 1080 range without any problem

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.840 
the 1070 1080 range without any problem
and<00:05:36.560> it<00:05:37.130> leaves<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:37.490> very<00:05:37.520> neutral<00:05:38.530> type<00:05:39.850> flavor

much it right there now I'm going to

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.000 
much it right there now I'm going to
start<00:06:16.090> measuring<00:06:16.300> some<00:06:16.720> stuff<00:06:16.930> out<00:06:17.170> and<00:06:17.680> get

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
start measuring some stuff out and get

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:29.760 
start measuring some stuff out and get
the<00:06:18.130> water<00:06:26.850> to<00:06:27.850> a<00:06:27.880> boil<00:06:28.470> key<00:06:29.470> thing<00:06:29.740> to

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
the water to a boil key thing to

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.070 
the water to a boil key thing to
remember<00:06:30.130> and<00:06:30.430> turn<00:06:30.700> the<00:06:30.850> heat<00:06:31.030> off<00:06:31.060> you<00:06:31.900> do

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
remember and turn the heat off you do

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.870 
remember and turn the heat off you do
not<00:06:32.260> want<00:06:32.500> the<00:06:32.650> sugar<00:06:32.860> to<00:06:33.070> sink<00:06:33.670> to<00:06:33.760> the<00:06:33.850> bottom

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
not want the sugar to sink to the bottom

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.440 
not want the sugar to sink to the bottom
because<00:06:34.330> it<00:06:34.450> doesn't<00:06:34.750> dissolve<00:06:34.960> instantly

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
because it doesn't dissolve instantly

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.920 
because it doesn't dissolve instantly
does<00:06:37.450> this<00:06:37.600> all<00:06:37.780> quick<00:06:39.450> when<00:06:40.450> you<00:06:40.570> dump<00:06:40.780> that

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
does this all quick when you dump that

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.550 
does this all quick when you dump that
in<00:06:41.140> there

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
in there

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.640 
in there
then<00:06:41.980> it's<00:06:42.250> going<00:06:42.520> to<00:06:42.870> end<00:06:43.870> up<00:06:44.050> sticking<00:06:44.380> to

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
then it's going to end up sticking to

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.440 
then it's going to end up sticking to
the<00:06:44.740> bottom<00:06:44.919> caramelizing<00:06:45.880> and<00:06:45.940> burning<00:06:46.330> and
