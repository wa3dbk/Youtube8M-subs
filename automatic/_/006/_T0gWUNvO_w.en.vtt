00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
training video for biking now we notice

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.280 
training video for biking now we notice
a<00:00:06.089> biking<00:00:06.480> here<00:00:06.690> at<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.839> beginning<00:00:07.140> there's

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
a biking here at the beginning there's

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.009 
a biking here at the beginning there's
no<00:00:07.410> sharps<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:07.830> flats<00:00:07.919> in<00:00:08.309> our<00:00:08.429> key<00:00:08.610> signature

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
no sharps and flats in our key signature

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.060 
no sharps and flats in our key signature
which<00:00:10.019> would<00:00:10.230> lead<00:00:10.410> us<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.559> believe<00:00:10.740> we're<00:00:11.010> in

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
which would lead us to believe we're in

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.970 
which would lead us to believe we're in
the<00:00:11.160> key<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.340> C<00:00:11.670> major<00:00:11.910> but<00:00:12.679> when<00:00:13.679> we<00:00:13.769> look

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
the key of C major but when we look

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.440 
the key of C major but when we look
closely<00:00:14.250> at<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:14.969> listen<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.330> it

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
closely at this and we listen to it

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.910 
closely at this and we listen to it
we're<00:00:15.690> gonna<00:00:15.750> realize<00:00:16.139> we're<00:00:16.320> not<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.560> C<00:00:16.740> major

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
we're gonna realize we're not in C major

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.420 
we're gonna realize we're not in C major
we're<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.460> key<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.940> minor<00:00:18.890> okay<00:00:20.539> so<00:00:22.430> key

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
we're in the key of a minor okay so key

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.460 
we're in the key of a minor okay so key
of<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.730> minor<00:00:24.000> means<00:00:24.660> we're<00:00:24.869> gonna<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> half

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
of a minor means we're gonna have a half

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.210 
of a minor means we're gonna have a half
step<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.769> pattern<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> D<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:28.220> okay

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
step to pattern on the D on the a okay

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.700 
step to pattern on the D on the a okay
over<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> E<00:00:30.119> we're<00:00:30.960> gonna<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> half

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
over on the E we're gonna have a half

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.380 
over on the E we're gonna have a half
step<00:00:32.009> one<00:00:32.250> which<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.430> finger<00:00:32.759> pattern<00:00:33.059> three

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
step one which is finger pattern three

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.630 
step one which is finger pattern three
and<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:34.290> when<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.469> come<00:00:34.590> over<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.370> G

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and then when we come over here to the G

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.250 
and then when we come over here to the G
this<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:36.300> that's<00:00:36.480> kind<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.690> strange

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
this is the one that's kind of strange

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.110 
this is the one that's kind of strange
for<00:00:37.469> us<00:00:37.530> because<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> natural<00:00:38.670> whole

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
for us because this is the natural whole

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.540 
for us because this is the natural whole
step<00:00:39.420> where<00:00:40.260> these<00:00:40.649> are<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> natural<00:00:41.129> half

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
step where these are the natural half

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.080 
step where these are the natural half
steps<00:00:41.879> okay<00:00:42.860> alright<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.610> let's<00:00:44.820> kind<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> go

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
steps okay alright so let's kind of go

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.279 
steps okay alright so let's kind of go
through<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.660> under<00:00:45.870> our<00:00:45.899> fingers

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
through this get this under our fingers

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.270 
through this get this under our fingers
kind<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.680> slow<00:00:46.879> about<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.300> two<00:00:48.899> three<00:00:49.620> four
