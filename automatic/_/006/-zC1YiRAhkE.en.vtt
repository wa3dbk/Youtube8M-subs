00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:05.620
 to football concept I am certain 

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:07.120
 Welcome to my channel welcome to 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.250
 new chrome in real life there you are 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.410
 watching that survey that I proposed 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.000
 as you are watching, won a side and 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.280
 personally I liked it but 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.019
 let's give wax to this good player 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.970
 that and as you know everything, it is a 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.650
 silver killer in the ultimate team 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.329
 where skinner that for the people who 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.429
 He gives the skills, obviously, 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.159
 will like to have five stars of 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.439
 filigree skills forgiveness better said 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.479
 and good is a player very much given to 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.640
 bargaining not so much in real life as 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:35.559
 in the game I could see few videos 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.480
 I have not found many sincerely the 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.829
 I found little ones because I am 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.750
 sharing with you as you are 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.699
 seeing in the beginning I've seen some 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.920
 goals that show a pretty punch 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.129
 interesting not a good placement and 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.020
 a considerable power sincerely to 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:55.140
 It has not finished convincing me 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.480
 to see some clips that good looks 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.000
 that seems to have skill and others 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.830
 I did not like the way to run 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 I know, I say, a little stooped like 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.030
 if I run a bit to the organs that 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.010
 are you know so you can have an idea 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.480
 yes it is true that it is skillful yes that is 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.880
 true that I've seen other plays in 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.500
 which has done very well and others 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.660
 but personally I do not like the way 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.380
 he has I do not know about controlling the ball 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.320
 to see him in the race and to define him 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.310
 seen more times fail goals than 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.890
 accept them here as I'm seeing moses 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.110
 force very fast not super fast fixed 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.970
 here the break grace and now it takes for 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.740
 rita very well but here come the bad guys 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.570
 the definition then does not reach it 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.700
 convert no 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.140
 good to tell you that that extreme left 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.760
 as you are watching plays that always 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.040
 flying left to leg changed 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.870
 I've seen mostly use the right 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.660
 I do not know very well how it will go with the leg 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.220
 bad honestly because I've seen 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.380
 always using the right leg let's say 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.550
 look right here makes a shot with the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.940
 left of the nail to leave me for 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.830
 the bastard and well you know how it is 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.300
 all the fifa because the subject of the scouts 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.350
 and others will have seen him bargain very 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.120
 well and that's why migration with 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.970
 watermarks that I think on the other hand 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.590
 from what I've seen that is justified 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.570
 then another thing is how the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.000
 player in big leagues to the game of 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.850
 xerez min as it would be in come let's 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.370
 put it like that and he signed the liverpool and the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.320
 liverpool has not triumphed is worth to this 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.210
 stoke action and now I read that 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.540
 there are rumors that he will go to the league 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.580
 Uruguayan or not will be true although it has 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.130
 gone but has not been able to tell 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.840
 information about this is ok I can not 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.550
 secure anything from where exactly it is 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.550
 now 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.840
 the issue because I have investigated as I say 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.950
 online and I could not find it 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.110
 certain science is worth 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.459
 As you are seeing here, well, it is 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.140
 also sometimes develops in the 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.870
 front to try to catch some 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.670
 rejection hitting or 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.349
 enter from the left band towards the 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.140
 right let's say diagonally to mark 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.819
 the goal he is directly worth and good 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.140
 have bad punching we will see also 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.300
 good images 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.340
 there is some that is a virguerÃ­a 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.470
 directly not something they say 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.940
 bad that miami of my heart as it ends 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.739
 of doing this this man does not but like 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.750
 I say to myself personally does not finish me 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.120
 convince worth of the fact of the list that 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.560
 I showed and that I put you in the survey is 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.239
 the one that I like the least and I tell you because 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.069
 for example more street steven that 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.019
 practically average vote is authentic 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.120
 madness is worth what I have seen to be 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.470
 crazy but with all the letters 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.380
 well here is the partner who does not 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.329
 we get to define it worth and good 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.849
 let's see here turning around cropping 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.549
 haggling if the watermarks as I say 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.930
 are justified I think there's no 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.420
 no doubt the truth, look what 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.440
 speed here at the end they end up pulling 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.120
 but good 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.800
 this is a ball, look how it is 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.570
 unmarked wins the back to the defense to 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.240
 the time to break up there we have you as 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.890
 break 12 times it breaks again and 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.390
 perfectly defines this I think with 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.750
 your selection that I think is 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.080
 Moroccan 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.780
 OK 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.800
 the error here ping and again and now 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.230
 already leaves me for the end the best without 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.090
 doubt here you have it 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.500
 this goal this goal is the good set 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.300
 how to break them that the goal now 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.440
 so nothing guys like the video to give 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.440
 like share a greeting
