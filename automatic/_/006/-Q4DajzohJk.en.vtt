choose<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.430> film<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.910> want<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> test<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
choose the film you want to test and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.700 
choose the film you want to test and
place<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> clean<00:00:53.039> cutting<00:00:53.460> surface

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
place it on a clean cutting surface

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.439

using the template and scalpel you cut

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.569 
using the template and scalpel you cut
out<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> film<00:00:58.050> leaving<00:00:58.590> tabs<00:00:58.890> either<00:00:59.190> side
