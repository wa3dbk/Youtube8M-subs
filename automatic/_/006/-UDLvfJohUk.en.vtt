of<00:01:19.430> mark<00:01:19.700> inside<00:01:20.180> there<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.689> that<00:01:21.170> way<00:01:21.290> I'll

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
of mark inside there and that way I'll

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.899 
of mark inside there and that way I'll
always<00:01:21.530> know<00:01:22.070> that<00:01:22.310> when<00:01:22.430> I<00:01:22.460> go<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:22.729> put

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
always know that when I go to put

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.090

at beadaholique and I just want to show
you<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.190> couple<00:02:15.430> measurements<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.600> on<00:02:17.230> our<00:02:17.560> site

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
you a couple measurements so on our site

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.340 
you a couple measurements so on our site
you'll<00:02:18.010> notice<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:19.030> we<00:02:19.480> tell<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.959> that<00:02:20.170> this

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
you'll notice that we tell you that this

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.170 
you'll notice that we tell you that this
is<00:02:20.910> 2<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.209> 3/4<00:02:23.080> inch<00:02:23.319> diameter<00:02:24.069> as<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:25.030> can

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
is 2 and 3/4 inch diameter as you can

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.240 
is 2 and 3/4 inch diameter as you can
see<00:02:25.390> right<00:02:25.569> there<00:02:25.600> it's<00:02:26.050> measuring<00:02:26.560> from<00:02:27.069> the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
see right there it's measuring from the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.280 
see right there it's measuring from the
two<00:02:27.490> outside<00:02:28.030> points<00:02:29.250> now<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.450> what<00:02:32.080> we

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
two outside points now this is what we

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.550 
two outside points now this is what we
call<00:02:32.560> an<00:02:32.740> 8-inch<00:02:33.250> bangle<00:02:33.760> because<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.240> fits

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
call an 8-inch bangle because it fits

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.699 
call an 8-inch bangle because it fits
over<00:02:35.560> an<00:02:35.770> eight<00:02:36.220> inch<00:02:36.400> wrist

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
over an eight inch wrist

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.070 
over an eight inch wrist
just<00:02:38.709> like<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.070> now<00:02:39.850> I'm<00:02:40.690> going<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.930> measure

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
just like that now I'm going to measure

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.810 
just like that now I'm going to measure
on<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.830> outside<00:02:42.400> here<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:44.640> you're<00:02:45.640> actually

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
on the outside here and you're actually

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.330 
on the outside here and you're actually
going<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.239> see<00:02:46.570> that<00:02:47.260> it's<00:02:47.440> 9<00:02:48.070> inches<00:02:48.459> but<00:02:50.340> for

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
going to see that it's 9 inches but for

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.729 
going to see that it's 9 inches but for
the<00:02:51.430> inner<00:02:51.640> diameter<00:02:51.970> I'm<00:02:52.750> going<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.560> measure

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
the inner diameter I'm going to measure

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.440 
the inner diameter I'm going to measure
8<00:02:54.519> inches<00:02:55.060> here<00:02:56.100> on<00:02:57.100> my<00:02:57.400> tape<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:57.910> you're

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
8 inches here on my tape and you're

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.470 
8 inches here on my tape and you're
going<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.810> see<00:02:59.019> how<00:02:59.890> 8<00:03:00.190> inches<00:03:00.640> is<00:03:00.910> actually

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
going to see how 8 inches is actually

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.110 
going to see how 8 inches is actually
the<00:03:01.810> inner<00:03:01.989> diameter<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:03.489> it's<00:03:03.670> actually

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
the inner diameter so it's actually

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.699 
the inner diameter so it's actually
about<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.330> difference<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.870> an<00:03:04.989> entire<00:03:05.380> inch

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
about the difference of an entire inch

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.680 
about the difference of an entire inch
between<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.640> inner<00:03:06.820> diameter<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.540> outer

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
between the inner diameter and the outer

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.020 
between the inner diameter and the outer
diameter<00:03:07.989> now<00:03:08.920> most<00:03:09.519> often<00:03:09.700> when<00:03:09.940> you're

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
diameter now most often when you're

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.520 
diameter now most often when you're
measuring<00:03:10.330> your<00:03:10.480> wrist<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:11.080> need<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.500> fit

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
measuring your wrist you need it to fit

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.710 
measuring your wrist you need it to fit
on<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.220> inner<00:03:12.400> diameter<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:13.390> I'm<00:03:13.510> going<00:03:13.660> to

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
on the inner diameter so I'm going to

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.699 
on the inner diameter so I'm going to
show<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.840> really<00:03:14.050> quick<00:03:14.320> how<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.500> measure

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
show you really quick how to measure

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.550 
show you really quick how to measure
your<00:03:14.980> wrist<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.489> it's<00:03:16.300> just<00:03:16.600> so<00:03:17.079> you<00:03:17.170> saw<00:03:17.440> me

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
your wrist and it's just so you saw me

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.050 
your wrist and it's just so you saw me
put<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.829> bangle<00:03:17.980> on<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.519> kind<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.790> put<00:03:18.970> it

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
put the bangle on and you kind of put it

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.580 
put the bangle on and you kind of put it

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
on like that that's sort of like the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.020 
on like that that's sort of like the
position<00:03:20.769> that<00:03:21.130> your<00:03:21.250> hand<00:03:21.489> takes<00:03:21.730> on<00:03:21.910> when

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
position that your hand takes on when

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.910 
position that your hand takes on when
you<00:03:22.120> put<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.299> bangle<00:03:22.630> on<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:23.350> just<00:03:23.470> go<00:03:23.620> ahead<00:03:23.709> and

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
you put a bangle on so just go ahead and

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.220 
you put a bangle on so just go ahead and
make<00:03:24.040> that<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.700> then<00:03:25.540> you're<00:03:25.660> gonna<00:03:25.750> take<00:03:26.019> the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
make that and then you're gonna take the

make that and then you're gonna take the
tape<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.650> sort<00:03:27.579> of<00:03:27.670> just<00:03:27.820> wrap<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.090> around<00:03:28.890> and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
tape and sort of just wrap it around and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.650 
tape and sort of just wrap it around and
you're<00:03:30.040> gonna<00:03:30.130> find<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.670> biggest<00:03:30.910> part<00:03:31.480> of

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660
