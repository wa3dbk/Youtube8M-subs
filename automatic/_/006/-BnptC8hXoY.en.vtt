 many and big bench but the padua part 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.860
 immediately strong in the fifth single minute 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.990

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.940
 biancoscudato in the first half we are at 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.100

 sideways position touches the pole 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.089
 Petrilli is one of the most active of the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.100
 white in the first 45 minutes 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:37.260
 here is the cross that sees just the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.879
 head of the Turin exterior must 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.249
 relax the porter to parry 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.409
 32nd minute cunico corner kick 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.239

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.460
 his third goal in the championship is padua 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.069
 deservedly takes the lead against 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.800
 the mori santo stefano is 1 0 for i 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:55.140
 biancoscudati we review the 32nd 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.179
 minute this corner of cunico shot of 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.339
 head in the net of sentinels passes a 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.649
 minute and already this foul from the river 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.359
 half field on nickel was already admonished on 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.790
 defender of the mori second card 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.100
 yellow and the Trentino formation remains in 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.350
 ten men after just over half an hour 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.759
 things are complicated by the way of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.009
 Santo Stefano is reached in the second 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.869
 time here loses the ball maybe with a foul 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.119
 not so for the referee petrilli can 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.280
 go bagging the 2 to 0 after just 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.189
 one minute of the second half the padua si 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.170
 already leads on 2 to 0 can celebrate the 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.360
 formation of the match after the game 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.159
 seems downhill but in the twelfth 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.070
 minute there is this beautiful punishment 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.200
 of 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.720
 means shortens the distance consumption a 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.970
 sign also to the first sign the 2 to 1 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.920
 with which the saint died Stefano test 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.750
 to return to the game but it is not so 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.180
 because the padua accelerates again and is there 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.820
 the first goal in emil's biancoscudato 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.830
 zubin, who uses an assist yesterday 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.720
 to beat the goalkeeper to bring the 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.060
 padova two goals ahead 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.700
 the game in practice seems to be over 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.200
 padova also tries to have fun cunico 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.240
 wants to get into the scoresheet 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.270
 markers but here the goalkeeper denies him the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.090
 joy of the goal but the Padova continues to 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.640
 attack there is zubin on the right the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.860
 cross for almirante just entered signature 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.230
 his third goal in the biancoscudato poker 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.530
 of Padua with the header of 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.450
 wise almirante 4 to 1 for a padua ed 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.060
 also show at the stadium of a 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.500
 however, Padua is distracted here 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.459
 there is a foul not recognized by the referee 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.900
 the counter-attack can start on salvadori 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.850
 of love is very fast deimichei on 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.580
 right who manages to beat lanzotti 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.590
 mark the 4 to 2 for the holy Moors 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.660
 stefano in the second half happens to 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.940
 everything also happens that you find petrilli 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.470
 so almirante discards the goalkeeper in 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.500
 exit a little hasty and from position 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.200
 very angled manages to mark her 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.360
 shotgun still very cold underneath 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.579
 leads to almonds of the fifth goal 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.760
 biancoscudato at the twenty-ninth minute 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:54.130
 the second half the padua is having fun and 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.620
 also enjoys the visa takers 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.350
 that to the 42nd there is glory also for a 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.989
 peri which marks its fifth in split 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.120
 goal in the padova the fourth goal arrived 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.820
 starting from the outside bench 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.130
 Sicilian is 6 to 2 for the biancoscudati 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.380
 aperi also celebrates with his companions 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.690
 of the bench and goals could also 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.610
 be 7 because the same aperi of head 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.920
 we see denied the joy of scoring by 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.350
 rosati ends after three minutes of 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.090
 recovery the padova says 6 to 2 finds again 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.590
 also the summit of the visa classification 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.010
 that the high Vicenza lost against the
