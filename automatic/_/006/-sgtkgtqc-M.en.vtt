smaller chart six steps to do the bigger
one<00:00:45.019> and<00:00:45.229> the<00:00:45.890> visual<00:00:46.190> acuity<00:00:46.400> is<00:00:46.699> so

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
one and the visual acuity is so

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.750 
one and the visual acuity is so
important<00:00:47.479> if<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:48.500> check<00:00:48.799> it<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.159> it's<00:00:49.430> fine

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
important if you check it and it's fine

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.119 
important if you check it and it's fine
that<00:00:50.239> means<00:00:50.269> all<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:50.960> visual<00:00:51.229> pathways<00:00:51.710> from

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
that means all the visual pathways from

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.979 
that means all the visual pathways from
the<00:00:52.280> front<00:00:52.549> of<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.820> eye<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.449> brain<00:00:53.479> are

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
the front of the eye to the brain are

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.380 
the front of the eye to the brain are
okay<00:00:54.650> so<00:00:55.339> that<00:00:55.489> will<00:00:55.670> gives<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:55.970> good<00:00:56.150> clue

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
okay so that will gives you a good clue

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.680 
okay so that will gives you a good clue
so<00:00:56.839> that's<00:00:57.080> the<00:00:57.199> first<00:00:57.440> end<00:00:57.799> examination<00:00:58.690> the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
so that's the first end examination the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.259 
so that's the first end examination the
second<00:01:00.110> one<00:01:00.260> is<00:01:00.409> to<00:01:00.489> have<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.549> look<00:01:01.729> at<00:01:01.909> the<00:01:02.059> eye

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
second one is to have a look at the eye

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.350 
second one is to have a look at the eye
if<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:02.869> is<00:01:02.989> read<00:01:03.229> what<00:01:04.040> sort<00:01:04.430> of<00:01:04.580> redness<00:01:05.000> is<00:01:05.210> it

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
if it is read what sort of redness is it

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.230 
if it is read what sort of redness is it
is<00:01:05.930> it<00:01:06.110> around<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.530> cornea<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:07.220> it<00:01:07.730> a<00:01:07.760> sector

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
is it around the cornea is it a sector

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.140 
is it around the cornea is it a sector
or<00:01:08.450> is<00:01:08.690> it<00:01:08.780> full<00:01:09.310> circumference<00:01:10.310> or<00:01:10.790> is<00:01:11.060> it

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
or is it full circumference or is it

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.120 
or is it full circumference or is it
peripheral<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:12.110> that<00:01:12.290> gives<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:12.650> clues<00:01:12.860> as

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
peripheral and that gives you clues as

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.460 
peripheral and that gives you clues as
to<00:01:13.160> the<00:01:13.460> severity<00:01:13.730> of<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.390> condition<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.200> the

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
to the severity of the condition and the

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.860 
to the severity of the condition and the
referral<00:01:15.920> in<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:16.640> end<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:17.420> if<00:01:17.480> it<00:01:17.540> is<00:01:17.630> around

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
referral in the end so if it is around

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.300 
referral in the end so if it is around
the<00:01:17.990> cornea<00:01:18.410> what<00:01:18.620> we<00:01:18.740> call<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:18.950> cilia

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
the cornea what we call a cilia

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.700 
the cornea what we call a cilia
injection<00:01:19.880> that<00:01:20.630> means<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:21.110> have<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:21.470> refer

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
injection that means you have to refer

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.260

it's<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:05.040> good<00:04:05.190> idea<00:04:05.370> really<00:04:05.760> if<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.209> have

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
it's a good idea really if you have

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.540 
it's a good idea really if you have
anything<00:04:06.630> like<00:04:06.930> for<00:04:07.530> example<00:04:07.980> somebody<00:04:08.310> with

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
anything like for example somebody with

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.740 
anything like for example somebody with
red<00:04:08.730> eye<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.120> photophobia<00:04:10.520> it<00:04:11.569> gives<00:04:12.569> you

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
red eye and photophobia it gives you

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.570 
red eye and photophobia it gives you
towards<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.290> cornea<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:14.100> then<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.550> to

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
towards the cornea so then you have to

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.580 
towards the cornea so then you have to
stain<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.360> think<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:15.900> should<00:04:16.079> have<00:04:16.260> flora

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
stain it I think you should have flora

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.009 
stain it I think you should have flora
seen<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.519> very<00:04:17.669> innocent<00:04:17.970> doesn't<00:04:18.690> cause

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
seen it is very innocent doesn't cause

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.170 
seen it is very innocent doesn't cause
any<00:04:19.200> problems<00:04:19.370> doesn't<00:04:20.370> go<00:04:20.519> rarely<00:04:20.970> cause

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
any problems doesn't go rarely cause

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
allergies it doesn't sting the eye so

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.580 
allergies it doesn't sting the eye so
you<00:04:23.940> have<00:04:24.090> flora<00:04:24.360> seen<00:04:24.540> in<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.780> fridge<00:04:25.020> stick

a drop and use blue light and then
you'll<00:04:28.380> see<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.620> lot<00:04:28.889> of<00:04:29.090> if<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:30.240> is<00:04:30.389> punctate
