00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.960
 Hi loves 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.390
 Today I'm going to do the review of 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.199
 avon secretary who is actually a 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.930
 cream base broker and so it has 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.180
 many benefits beyond 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.609
 so the packaging will start with the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.140
 packaging is start at the beginning is good 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.100
 start there 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.050
 good the packaging it is so plastic 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.230
 has 30 ml 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.230
 there is mine already happens because I 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.200
 I used direct talk a lot 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.270
 it contains the fps 50 which for being a base 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.399
 has a very high protection factor that I 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.870
 I think it's cool, especially for who 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.190
 Any treatments now to the acid and base 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.989
 everything but have to wear sunscreen 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:11.250
 then this one already has fps 50 and fp and sees it 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:14.460
 the fpv to 20.4 stv to it that exactly 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.799
 these white lights are not that everyone 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.280
 have at home or work in the office 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.759
 that you have these you emit the rays 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.430
 government is also so he is 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.080
 multibenefice it has whitening effect 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.259
 in the skin 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.040
 not that it is bleaching but it has 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.820
 an effect that in the long run it will clear 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.460
 the skin 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.530
 he has vitamin C which is a powerful 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.079
 antioxidant for the skin right 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.210
 mainly to prevent the 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.360
 premature aging 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.079
 his coverage I say is not high 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.119
 coverage is an average coverage of 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.850
 disadvantage of him that I see so in the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.250
 my 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.890
 It's because it takes a while to 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.170
 adhere well to the skin know to stay like this 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.750
 the one he touches more like this 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.229
 It takes a lot of cello with a powder. 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.140
 compact solved know hi 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.900
 It hurt all day but to cimpor it leaves 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.480
 the skin like that but take a while to stay 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.440
 it also does not transfer oil anymore 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.970
 of the skin it is also for oily skin 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.770
 leaves the skin with that glow is who 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.650
 have oily skin usually do not like 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.840
 of the shine then just passes a cook 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.080
 That will resolve the matter soon 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.540
 his texture is very fluid and so he 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.640
 It is easy to spread can not here 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.519
 It was not even like this to spread 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.299
 his skill is great is excellent 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:51.040
 the skill is also very very very 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:55.799
 well then I 'll apply in half the br 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.799
 so the texture of it is very fluid 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.190
 so I 'm going to stay here in the middle of 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:08.260
 face to you have a notion of how 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:10.950
 this is my natural beige color 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.950
 number 3 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.820
 at first it seems like it will stay 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:26.260
 like this 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:31.810
 white but later elected 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.810
 the effectiveness of water to skin color 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:56.420
 notice why he stays he has not been 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:04:00.410
 that coverage to him that way. 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:07.520
 texture that shine on the skin 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:12.740
 so he does not stay like this in he knows not 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:15.530
 something that bothers and both but 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.660
 that it does not bother you then 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.030
 I do not like it much anymore 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.150
 Here is how the day had a little bit of 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.410
 of red that cold allergy 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.840
 the little maison here but the margin I 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.930
 I say she played a bit like 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.980
 looking at the forgiving state does not have 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.860
 so much difference in coverage and must 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.380
 light to medium coverage I know 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.820
 I'll stay here another side 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:51.560
 quick for you but for the benefits 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.130
 providing 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:00.970
 I think it's still worth it for 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:04.569
 contain vitamins and antioxidants is and ii 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.679
 this high protection factor 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:18.369
 already worth it because not a light 

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:24.639
 coverage and protects from the cold 

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:28.599
 protects from the sun by the way I'm so crazy 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:38.409
 Br and placed so cold speaking 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:40.629
 without thinking johann so i 'll finish 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:46.149
 to prepare the skin of how I use and 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:50.289
 my day to day life is usually the use of 

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:53.939
 corrective is then abela today are 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:58.599
 usually I can corrective in the areas 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:06:00.729
 imperfections is that so my 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.889
 corner nasdaq mainly in 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:11.069
 winter is something else 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:14.069
 Red is always there knows 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.069
 little beats 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.770
 and apply the powder 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.370
 this one daad cost you believe also 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:31.790
 I counted fps 30 so I quite like it 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.960
 time to be able to replicate during the 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:37.130
 day 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:43.640
 I just so step with the brush 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:45.530
 just to give a slight modify it skin and 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:50.780
 apply the powder to avoid that face 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:53.210
 I know a lot of mummy's day 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:07:00.550
