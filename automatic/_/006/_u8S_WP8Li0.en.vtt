that<00:00:22.730> you're<00:00:22.850> dealing<00:00:23.300> with<00:00:23.330> so<00:00:24.200> the<00:00:24.320> first

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
that you're dealing with so the first

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.440 
that you're dealing with so the first
suggestion<00:00:24.950> is<00:00:25.279> to<00:00:25.340> talk<00:00:25.760> openly<00:00:26.330> and

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
suggestion is to talk openly and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.630 
suggestion is to talk openly and
directly<00:00:26.779> with<00:00:27.290> them<00:00:27.500> now<00:00:28.070> if<00:00:28.189> this<00:00:28.369> is<00:00:28.490> your

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
directly with them now if this is your

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.760 
directly with them now if this is your
boss<00:00:28.790> I<00:00:29.240> would<00:00:29.840> not<00:00:30.020> recommend<00:00:30.170> this<00:00:30.619> because

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
boss I would not recommend this because

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.280 
boss I would not recommend this because
it's<00:00:31.009> probably<00:00:31.279> not<00:00:31.489> the<00:00:31.520> best<00:00:31.669> career<00:00:32.210> move

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
it's probably not the best career move

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.510 
it's probably not the best career move
but<00:00:33.290> if<00:00:33.410> this<00:00:33.530> is<00:00:33.710> somebody<00:00:34.040> that<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:34.310> have<00:00:34.489> a

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
but if this is somebody that you have a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.850 
but if this is somebody that you have a
really<00:00:34.790> good<00:00:35.060> open<00:00:35.480> relationship<00:00:36.110> with<00:00:36.290> then

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
really good open relationship with then

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.290 
really good open relationship with then
this<00:00:37.250> is<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:37.430> approach<00:00:37.760> that<00:00:37.880> I<00:00:38.090> would

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
this is the approach that I would

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.080 
this is the approach that I would
recommend<00:00:38.630> and<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:39.710> way<00:00:39.829> to<00:00:39.890> go<00:00:40.100> into<00:00:40.340> it<00:00:40.640> is<00:00:40.820> I

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
recommend and the way to go into it is I

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.540 
recommend and the way to go into it is I
always<00:00:41.329> say<00:00:41.780> believe<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.410> best<00:00:42.649> so<00:00:43.370> believe

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
always say believe the best so believe

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.340 
always say believe the best so believe
that<00:00:43.850> that<00:00:43.970> person<00:00:44.390> doesn't<00:00:44.510> even<00:00:44.809> know<00:00:45.110> that

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
that that person doesn't even know that

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.560 
that that person doesn't even know that
they<00:00:45.440> come<00:00:45.590> across<00:00:45.800> negatively<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.179> maybe<00:00:47.390> the

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
they come across negatively so maybe the

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.180 
they come across negatively so maybe the
way<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:47.750> start<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.199> conversation<00:00:48.829> would<00:00:49.010> be

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
way to start the conversation would be

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.490 
way to start the conversation would be
to<00:00:49.309> ask<00:00:49.489> them<00:00:49.850> are<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.420> aware<00:00:50.840> that<00:00:50.899> you<00:00:51.320> come

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
to ask them are you aware that you come

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.709 
to ask them are you aware that you come
across<00:00:51.710> quite<00:00:52.070> negative<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:52.850> see<00:00:53.480> what<00:00:53.600> they

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
across quite negative and see what they

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.840 
across quite negative and see what they
have<00:00:53.899> to<00:00:54.079> say<00:00:54.109> and<00:00:54.530> if<00:00:54.949> it's<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.190> good<00:00:55.399> open

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
have to say and if it's a good open

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.549 
have to say and if it's a good open
dialogue<00:00:56.329> with<00:00:56.359> a<00:00:56.600> friend<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:57.140> you<00:00:57.410> get

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
dialogue with a friend that you get

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.619 
dialogue with a friend that you get

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
along with and are very close with they

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.479 
along with and are very close with they
may<00:00:59.780> use<00:00:59.929> it<00:01:00.079> as<00:01:00.199> an<00:01:00.320> opportunity<00:01:00.559> to<00:01:00.980> improve

may use it as an opportunity to improve

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.130 
may use it as an opportunity to improve
themselves<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.210> they<00:01:02.269> may<00:01:02.420> ask<00:01:02.629> you<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:02.929> help

point it out when you see that they're

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.230 
point it out when you see that they're
being<00:01:05.540> negative<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.920> second<00:01:07.340> suggestion<00:01:07.760> is

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
being negative the second suggestion is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.060 
being negative the second suggestion is
to<00:01:09.550> not<00:01:10.550> engage<00:01:10.909> with<00:01:11.360> them<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:12.290> if<00:01:12.770> they<00:01:13.010> are

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
to not engage with them so if they are

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.149 
to not engage with them so if they are
going<00:01:13.280> on<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.760> on<00:01:13.820> about<00:01:14.150> something<00:01:15.159> just

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
going on and on about something just

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:24.240 
going on and on about something just
give<00:01:16.490> very<00:01:17.350> limited<00:01:18.850> answers<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:20.149> hmm<00:01:21.049> I<00:01:22.509> see

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
give very limited answers of hmm I see

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.429 
give very limited answers of hmm I see
really<00:01:25.250> don't<00:01:26.240> encourage<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.869> dialogue

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
really don't encourage the dialogue

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.830 
really don't encourage the dialogue
hopefully<00:01:28.430> they<00:01:28.610> will<00:01:28.759> pick<00:01:28.970> up<00:01:29.119> on<00:01:29.299> that<00:01:29.509> and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
hopefully they will pick up on that and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.450 
hopefully they will pick up on that and
realize<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:30.590> weren't<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.009> person<00:01:31.189> to

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
realize that you weren't the person to

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.700 
realize that you weren't the person to
go<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.670> when<00:01:32.060> they<00:01:32.180> want<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.540> be<00:01:33.229> negative

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
go to when they want to be negative

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.920 
go to when they want to be negative
about<00:01:33.890> different<00:01:34.460> topics<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:35.659> third

about different topics the third

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.260 
about different topics the third
suggestion<00:01:36.409> that<00:01:36.740> i<00:01:36.770> have<00:01:37.070> is<00:01:37.430> gloating

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
suggestion that i have is gloating

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.600 
suggestion that i have is gloating
groups<00:01:38.750> when<00:01:39.590> you're<00:01:39.740> out<00:01:39.860> in<00:01:39.890> groups<00:01:40.219> it's<00:01:40.490> a

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
groups when you're out in groups it's a

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.030 
groups when you're out in groups it's a
lot<00:01:40.790> easier<00:01:40.820> because<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:42.290> have<00:01:42.590> other<00:01:42.740> people

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
lot easier because you have other people

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.760 
lot easier because you have other people
who<00:01:43.130> can<00:01:43.310> help<00:01:43.430> deflect<00:01:43.820> that<00:01:44.299> person<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:45.259> you

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
who can help deflect that person and you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.410 
who can help deflect that person and you
don't<00:01:45.950> have<00:01:46.039> to<00:01:46.189> engage<00:01:46.310> with<00:01:46.520> them<00:01:46.909> a<00:01:47.090> hundred

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
percent so that all of their negativity

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.959 
percent so that all of their negativity
is<00:01:49.789> focused<00:01:50.659> on<00:01:50.840> venting<00:01:51.649> towards<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:52.340> so
