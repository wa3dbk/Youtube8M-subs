especially<00:01:59.310> outside<00:01:59.820> of<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.630> USA<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.200> know

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
especially outside of the USA you know

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.959 
especially outside of the USA you know
in<00:02:01.409> Britain<00:02:01.680> amanha<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.979> believe<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.729> these

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
in Britain amanha I believe all of these

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.469 
in Britain amanha I believe all of these
contracts<00:02:03.540> are<00:02:03.750> not<00:02:04.259> valid<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.710> Asia<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:06.270> they

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
contracts are not valid in Asia but they

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.600 
contracts are not valid in Asia but they
are<00:02:06.600> valid<00:02:06.960> here<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.649> States<00:02:07.890> Britain<00:02:08.310> and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
are valid here in the States Britain and

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.400 
are valid here in the States Britain and
everywhere<00:02:09.209> else<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> be

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
everywhere else and it's going to be

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.660 
everywhere else and it's going to be
really<00:02:10.890> really<00:02:11.099> big

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
really really big

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.770 
really really big
to<00:02:11.819> see<00:02:11.970> what<00:02:12.120> people<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.660> say<00:02:12.690> about

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
to see what people have to say about

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.390 
to see what people have to say about
this<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:13.830> probably<00:02:14.010> some<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
this so this is probably some of the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.100 
this so this is probably some of the
biggest<00:02:14.640> geo<00:02:15.090> news<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.540> we've<00:02:15.660> seen<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.020> a

very long time especially in terms of

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.479 
very long time especially in terms of
you<00:02:18.660> know<00:02:18.690> another<00:02:19.560> game<00:02:19.860> actually<00:02:20.130> getting

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
stuff inside of it and I'm very curious

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.210

Magician<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:30.270> know<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.720> believe<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.470> quote

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650
