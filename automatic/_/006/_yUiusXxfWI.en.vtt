ends<00:00:29.410> now<00:00:30.210> I've<00:00:31.210> broken<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.810> fibers<00:00:32.169> up<00:00:32.320> and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
ends now I've broken the fibers up and

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.950 
ends now I've broken the fibers up and
made<00:00:32.890> them<00:00:33.040> into<00:00:33.129> a<00:00:33.340> bird's<00:00:33.550> nest<00:00:34.379> okay<00:00:35.730> no<00:00:36.960> we

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
made them into a bird's nest okay no we

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.119 
made them into a bird's nest okay no we
have<00:00:38.080> been<00:00:38.110> doing<00:00:38.440> now<00:00:38.590> I'll<00:00:38.739> show<00:00:38.890> you<00:00:38.949> how

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
have been doing now I'll show you how

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:48.600 
have been doing now I'll show you how
about<00:00:39.820> left<00:00:46.470> ia<00:00:47.470> officers<00:00:48.280> we've<00:00:48.430> got<00:00:48.520> my

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
about left ia officers we've got my

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.459 
about left ia officers we've got my
knife<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:49.030> put<00:00:49.390> it<00:00:49.510> up<00:00:49.690> so<00:00:49.899> that's<00:00:49.989> a<00:00:50.140> bit<00:00:50.290> daft

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
knife to put it up so that's a bit daft

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.430 
knife to put it up so that's a bit daft
me<00:00:50.710> but<00:00:51.460> it's<00:00:51.579> dead<00:00:52.090> simple<00:00:52.300> I've<00:00:53.140> trusted

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
me but it's dead simple I've trusted

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.069 
me but it's dead simple I've trusted
that<00:00:53.739> and<00:00:54.250> then<00:00:55.059> it<00:00:55.149> opens<00:00:55.450> the<00:00:55.540> fibers<00:00:55.930> up

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
that and then it opens the fibers up

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.500 
that and then it opens the fibers up
into<00:00:56.320> three<00:00:56.590> sections

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
into three sections

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.299 
into three sections
well<00:00:58.510> then<00:00:58.809> done<00:00:59.020> as<00:00:59.590> I've<00:00:59.800> taken<00:01:00.040> those

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
well then done as I've taken those

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.580 
well then done as I've taken those
sections<00:01:00.790> apart<00:01:01.090> though<00:01:01.809> this<00:01:01.989> is<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.230> bit<00:01:02.410> too

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
sections apart though this is a bit too

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.740 
sections apart though this is a bit too
long<00:01:02.860> what<00:01:03.460> does<00:01:03.670> break<00:01:04.030> into<00:01:04.330> three<00:01:04.449> sections

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
long what does break into three sections

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.830 
long what does break into three sections
so<00:01:05.680> that<00:01:05.740> gives<00:01:06.009> me<00:01:06.100> 1/3<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.270> section<00:01:07.660> no

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
so that gives me 1/3 of a section no

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.540 
so that gives me 1/3 of a section no
those<00:01:08.020> are<00:01:08.229> at<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.410> back<00:01:08.590> here<00:01:09.240> okay<00:01:11.009> and<00:01:12.009> to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
those are at the back here okay and to

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.210 
those are at the back here okay and to
get<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.700> fan<00:01:12.910> of<00:01:13.030> stuff<00:01:13.270> what<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.840> ended<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
get a fan of stuff what the ended the

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.130 
get a fan of stuff what the ended the
exact<00:01:15.580> same<00:01:15.819> process<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.660> individual

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
exact same process to the individual

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.050 
exact same process to the individual
fibers

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
fibers

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.820 
fibers
what's<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:19.209> break<00:01:19.509> into<00:01:19.959> and<00:01:20.229> that<00:01:20.440> gives<00:01:20.709> me

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
what's that break into and that gives me

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.100 
what's that break into and that gives me
a<00:01:21.220> favor<00:01:22.149> of<00:01:22.330> step<00:01:23.910> okay<00:01:24.910> so<00:01:25.660> I'm<00:01:25.750> going<00:01:25.899> to<00:01:25.990> try

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
a favor of step okay so I'm going to try

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.210 
a favor of step okay so I'm going to try
and<00:01:26.229> do<00:01:26.319> it<00:01:26.410> for<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.800> later<00:01:26.950> sphere<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:29.220> what
