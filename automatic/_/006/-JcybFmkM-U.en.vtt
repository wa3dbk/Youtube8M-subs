00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
not here but if it does then it's only

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.780 
not here but if it does then it's only
going<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.560> take<00:01:54.620> you<00:01:54.830> a<00:01:54.890> few<00:01:54.980> seconds<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.640> be

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
going to take you a few seconds to be

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.000 
going to take you a few seconds to be
fully<00:01:56.150> protected<00:01:56.390> from<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:56.930> elements<00:01:57.050> inside

fully protected from the elements inside
this<00:01:58.160> Audi<00:01:58.460> a3<00:01:58.730> convertible

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.289 

well<00:02:04.560> looks<00:02:05.010> like<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.250> clearing<00:02:05.820> up<00:02:06.150> a

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
well looks like it's clearing up a

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.359 
well looks like it's clearing up a
little<00:02:06.540> bit<00:02:06.690> so<00:02:06.960> time<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.680> get<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.950> roof<00:02:08.130> back

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
little bit so time to get the roof back

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.520 
little bit so time to get the roof back
down<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.060> course<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:10.020> do<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.289> while

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
down and of course you can do this while

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.980 
down and of course you can do this while
you're<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.950> move<00:02:11.160> at<00:02:11.610> any<00:02:11.760> speed<00:02:12.150> up<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.630> 50

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
you're on the move at any speed up to 50

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.780 
you're on the move at any speed up to 50
kilometers<00:02:13.500> an<00:02:13.530> hour<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.400> that's<00:02:14.550> good

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
kilometers an hour and that's good

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.330 
kilometers an hour and that's good
enough<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.270> be<00:02:15.630> inside<00:02:16.020> most<00:02:16.530> urban<00:02:17.069> speed

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
enough to be inside most urban speed

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.970 
enough to be inside most urban speed
limits<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.180> within<00:02:18.420> 18<00:02:18.900> seconds<00:02:19.470> there's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
limits and within 18 seconds there's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.949 
limits and within 18 seconds there's
nothing<00:02:20.160> separating<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.150> from<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.750> great
