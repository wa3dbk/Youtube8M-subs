00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
beep to start and end the round within

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.809 
beep to start and end the round within
the<00:02:09.509> round<00:02:09.780> you'll<00:02:10.289> hear<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> beep<00:02:10.830> go<00:02:11.310> quick

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
you'll have one and a half

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.309 
you'll have one and a half
seconds<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.069> execute<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.640> combo<00:02:15.110> once<00:02:16.110> that

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
seconds to execute the combo once that

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.199 
seconds to execute the combo once that
one<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> half<00:02:16.830> seconds<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.970> hear<00:02:18.150> a

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
one and a half seconds is up you hear a

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.910 
one and a half seconds is up you hear a
second<00:02:18.659> beep<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.110> basically<00:02:19.769> that<00:02:19.890> just

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
second beep and basically that just

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.520 
second beep and basically that just
means<00:02:20.310> times<00:02:20.940> up<00:02:21.269> you'll<00:02:21.989> have<00:02:22.110> three<00:02:22.379> or<00:02:22.470> four

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
means times up you'll have three or four

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.500 
means times up you'll have three or four
seconds<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.280> maybe<00:02:23.400> take<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> step<00:02:23.970> here<00:02:24.360> step

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
seconds and maybe take a step here step

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.210 
seconds and maybe take a step here step
there<00:02:24.900> move<00:02:25.080> around<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.650> then<00:02:26.040> you're<00:02:26.129> going

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
there move around and then you're going

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.830 
there move around and then you're going
to<00:02:26.280> hear<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.489> beep<00:02:26.700> again<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.629> have<00:02:27.750> to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
to hear the beep again and you have to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.990 
to hear the beep again and you have to
execute<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.379> combo<00:02:28.620> before<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.430> beep<00:02:29.670> hits

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
execute the combo before the beep hits

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000 
execute the combo before the beep hits
you'll<00:02:30.690> basically<00:02:31.110> know<00:02:31.319> when<00:02:31.560> you've<00:02:31.709> caught

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
you'll basically know when you've caught

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.559 
you'll basically know when you've caught
it<00:02:32.040> because<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.579> punch<00:02:32.849> will<00:02:33.150> your<00:02:33.360> punch

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
it because the punch will your punch

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.649 
it because the punch will your punch
will<00:02:33.840> finish<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:34.920> hear<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.430> last<00:02:36.090> beat<00:02:36.420> or

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
will finish as you hear the last beat or

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.330 
will finish as you hear the last beat or
if<00:02:36.989> you're<00:02:37.140> hitting<00:02:37.349> on<00:02:37.409> the<00:02:37.560> bag<00:02:37.769> your<00:02:38.280> bag

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
if you're hitting on the bag your bag

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.490 
if you're hitting on the bag your bag
hitting<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.420> beep<00:02:39.659> will<00:02:39.900> go<00:02:40.049> at<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.290> same

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
hitting and the beep will go at the same

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.610 
hitting and the beep will go at the same
time<00:02:40.799> obviously<00:02:41.610> more<00:02:42.480> combos<00:02:42.959> more<00:02:43.290> slips

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
time obviously more combos more slips

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.410 
time obviously more combos more slips
more<00:02:43.980> techniques<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.730> it's<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.329> be

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
more techniques and it's going to be

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.630 
more techniques and it's going to be
harder<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.810> fit<00:02:46.079> them<00:02:46.230> all<00:02:46.349> in<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.769> find<00:02:47.519> that

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
harder to fit them all in I find that

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.940 
harder to fit them all in I find that
head<00:02:47.879> movements<00:02:48.450> are<00:02:48.629> harder<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.500> take<00:02:49.920> a

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
head movements are harder and take a

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.400 
head movements are harder and take a
little<00:02:50.099> bit<00:02:50.190> more<00:02:50.340> out<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:50.670> than<00:02:50.819> punches

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
little bit more out of you than punches

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.869 
little bit more out of you than punches
so<00:02:52.410> work<00:02:52.859> with<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.129> combos<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.640> I've<00:02:53.700> given

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
so work with the combos that I've given

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.569 
so work with the combos that I've given
or<00:02:54.480> make<00:02:54.780> up<00:02:54.930> your<00:02:55.109> own<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.920> key<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.459> only

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
or make up your own the key is not only

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.369 
or make up your own the key is not only
to<00:02:56.760> last<00:02:57.000> one<00:02:57.239> round<00:02:57.450> but<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.780> try<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.019> last<00:02:58.230> at

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
to last one round but it try to last at

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.500 
to last one round but it try to last at
least<00:02:58.409> three<00:02:58.620> rounds<00:02:59.250> or<00:02:59.370> if<00:02:59.849> you<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.239> can<00:03:00.390> go

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
least three rounds or if you you can go

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.020 
least three rounds or if you you can go
that<00:03:00.690> long<00:03:00.989> then<00:03:01.440> do<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.709> even<00:03:01.920> longer<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.549> go

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
that long then do it even longer and go

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.089 
that long then do it even longer and go
through<00:03:03.329> three<00:03:03.569> or<00:03:03.599> four<00:03:03.750> rounds<00:03:04.079> alright<00:03:04.890> so

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
through three or four rounds alright so

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.390 
through three or four rounds alright so
let's<00:03:05.310> get<00:03:05.430> started<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:05.909> give<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.180> shot
