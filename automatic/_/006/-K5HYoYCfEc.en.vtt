00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
about how taking up sir makeup is

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.480 
about how taking up sir makeup is
difficult<00:00:10.380> but<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.710> always<00:00:10.950> look<00:00:11.099> at<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.340> like

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
difficult but I always look at that like

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.879 
difficult but I always look at that like
how<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.179> difficult<00:00:12.690> but<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.170> guess<00:00:13.349> that's

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
how is difficult but I guess that's

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.340 
how is difficult but I guess that's
because<00:00:14.099> I've<00:00:14.849> been<00:00:14.910> using<00:00:15.269> these<00:00:15.540> for<00:00:15.599> years

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
because I've been using these for years

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.710 
because I've been using these for years
and<00:00:16.740> they've<00:00:17.130> never<00:00:17.310> failed<00:00:17.670> me<00:00:17.789> Mac<00:00:18.480> whips

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720

are<00:00:18.869> fantastic<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> pack<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
are fantastic this is a pack of a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.390 
are fantastic this is a pack of a
hundred<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> retails<00:00:22.260> about<00:00:22.500> $24<00:00:23.220> which

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
hundred and it retails about $24 which

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.980 
hundred and it retails about $24 which
is<00:00:23.519> kind<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.880> expensive<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.630> think<00:00:24.869> it

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
is kind of expensive but I think it

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.839 
is kind of expensive but I think it
comes<00:00:25.350> out<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.619> be<00:00:25.680> like<00:00:25.800> around<00:00:26.070> ten<00:00:26.340> cents<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
comes out to be like around ten cents a

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.269 
comes out to be like around ten cents a

smells like lavender and chamomile and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.520 
smells like lavender and chamomile and
mmm<00:01:32.700> smells<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:33.240> good<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:33.990> i<00:01:34.170> think<00:01:34.229> one

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
mmm smells really good but i think one

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.630 
mmm smells really good but i think one
of<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> reasons<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.040> works<00:01:35.189> better<00:01:35.430> than<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
of the reasons it works better than a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.760 
of the reasons it works better than a
mac<00:01:35.790> life<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.869> sturdier<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:37.650> it

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
mac life is it is it is sturdier but it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.640 
mac life is it is it is sturdier but it
also<00:01:37.920> has<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.400> textured<00:01:39.150> side<00:01:39.420> which<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.470> mac

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
also has this textured side which a mac

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.620 
also has this textured side which a mac
wife<00:01:40.860> doesn't<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.640> all<00:01:41.790> smooth<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.600> i

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
wife doesn't it's just all smooth so i

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.999 
wife doesn't it's just all smooth so i
think<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.290> helps<00:01:43.530> grab<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
think that this really helps grab the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.060 
think that this really helps grab the
