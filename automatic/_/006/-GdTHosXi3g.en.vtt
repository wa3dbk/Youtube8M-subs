00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.270
 hello I am will not be described a point is 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.050
 and with sports like then we're going to teach 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:14.740
 today to make the trouble of writing the 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.740
 singing angle 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.310
 I caught the ski stretched because before 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.529
 We are working with the touring 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.140
 now let's work this other side 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.520
 say that normally he does not suffer so much 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.520
 like the flat part 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.320
 question is why not about so much 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.170
 because when you go skiing you go badly 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.200
 flat on the edges then you 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.380
 you go above the yes and to get 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.020
 work this one launches a lot the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.030
 kneeling down work on 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.120
 all exterior interior then it is 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.120
 Normally what we least spoil 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.250
 then procedure the same but in 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.220
 instead of using the touring we are going to 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.130
 use the angula door player in this 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.700
 case we use tools 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.920
 that you can record yourself here to what 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.780
 degree that is to work singing and also 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.850
 there are other tools that you can 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.729
 see on websites selling stuff 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.340
 of skiing that are a particular grade is 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.729
 say 90 degrees 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.860
 89 medium 89 88 well we do not 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.200
 we work with this one and with a 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.789
 flat screwdriver we get search 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.600
 the degree that interests us examples now 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:38.000
 let's observe let's see what is the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.770
 angle that we have our singing before 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.049
 then they meet with two other celebrities 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.640
 of the same procedure but put with 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.490
 another tool is called 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.250
 angled and as you see here below we have 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.450
 the grams to the ass we can the uar 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.450
 let's do same procedure 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.310
 let's collectively 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.310
 here in the middle of the skate 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.950
 and here I am accommodated 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.060
 let's put a simple diamond in 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.060
 Here is the 200 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.890
 I had placed 90 degrees and we're going 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.890
 to see with this 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.700
 yes 690 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.910
 if it was not 90 what would happen is that the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.640
 marker would only be there you will not have 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.980
 given in half or inwards 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.590
 towards both the explanations 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.540
 or else outwards then that would want 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.270
 say that we have to look for either a 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.190
 aroma or a degree less worth I'm then what 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.070
 we will explain in more detail 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.170
 now that we've seen where we are with 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.480
 that we have to take we get relevant 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.420
 that this is for drafts 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.540
 and we put our first file as 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.190
 we have done before that is the pasta 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.220
 in this case we continue making the theme 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.600
 of the arrows because because we 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.850
 we will go forward back the same 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.770
 but in this case we have any one 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.020
 arrow that tells us where you have 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.590
 that being ourselves contacted 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.590
 We can see 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.350
 so 2 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.690
 for now that we have already done this part 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.690
 with the truth let's move on to the houses 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.569
 this side as you see the angle we have it 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.930
 that work much less than the plane 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.690
 because as I did not work so much before 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.750
 we were driving so there are many 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.750
 less past we have it quite well 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.420
 we are from a band we are going to do 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.100
 one thing we are going to rotate the script 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.950
 we have gone another way now we have already 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.190
 finished we have done the author or side of the 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:47.230
 angle in the same way as before from 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.650
 back to tail and we will go to do the 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.650
 diamonds
