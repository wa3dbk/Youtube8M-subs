00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.490
 its form and activity suggests that it is 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.920
 more than a hill but it is a 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.300
 volcano turned off for many years has 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.610
 thought that the little mole hill 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.520
 it keeps some type of volcanic activity 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.170
 it has a very atomic form 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.740
 characteristic 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.400
 that only arises when in the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.160
 subsoil 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:40.720
 there are steam deposits and you're either 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.960
 salts of the alkaline type such as sodium 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.489
 calcium potassium according to experts is in 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.129
 the heart of the little mole hill 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.320
 where there is an evaporitic bed 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.310
 plaster and salt that is the one that precisely gives 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.470
 origin to all the hot springs 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.780
 but these manifestations are not only 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.520
 typical of the mole hill but also 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.460
 from other areas near the area 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.460
 metropolitan also the area of 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.490
 of the Huasteca there is also injection 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.460
 of plaster and some parts with plaster is 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.640
 the hill of the friar who is also a 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.130
 old dome salt and nothing else was 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.350
 very excited to his from his central area 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.510
 in the same way the hill of the chair and 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.130
 that of the mitres what confuses 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.990
 many people when they are observed 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.150
 some manifestations of water vapor 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.430
 that are dissolved by salts 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.590
 existing experts on the subject 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.740
 they indicate that there is nothing to worry about 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.740
 that comes from the veracruz part 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.860
 the sierra de san carlos that are so 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.580
 lists the sierra de tamaulipas 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.150
 also and it comes up to what is the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.070
 mountain range that is here in the 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.110
 north of monterrey although nowadays 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.330
 specialists analyze whether the activity 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.420
 recent seismic is related or not to 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.570
 this situation of the Aztec vine 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.570
