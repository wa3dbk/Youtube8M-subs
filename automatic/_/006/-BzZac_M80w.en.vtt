00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.320
 also became an earthquake 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.539
 quite a bit 13 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.879
 both teams have four points 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.949

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.269
 to that end what do you think 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.740
 oh well the dimensions 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.720
 9 i can't wait 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.610
 I was not really extended for a year, I don't know 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.510
 that's just like a little kid 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.750
 that is why I want the same thing while analysts in general did not calculate it 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.870
 it is not always easy to talk, it is not always expected 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.270
 the project 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.530

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.930

 wouter and here is the new four there the men we have only here 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.800

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.540
 to work 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.540
 the device but still grab it 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.380
 yes that was 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.610
 oh well oh yes and I will certainly not help this 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 this project 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.479

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.850
 the field 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.270

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.480
 Atalanta did not unnecessarily call the emergency number further 230 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.809
 it is already being involved 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.129
 I have just come to Amsterdam for a day in Groningen 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.709
 you don't hear 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.649
 throughout the country of Zeeland 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.679
 the but the creator source ap in the church 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.439
 I have built up 8 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:41.729
 because this is not 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.159

00:02:55.429 --> 00:03:00.319

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.859

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.859
 that reports the 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.549
 and all that always 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.749
 no idea 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.779
 the tour operator can do this every minute 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:27.959
 which can 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.979

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:39.629
 8 I set off 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.459
 is getting way too high 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.359
 the domain name by being little confident that we will deal with less 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:53.009

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:59.539

 No 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.430

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.990

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.680

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:51.229
 England takes it is a feeding probe flashlight 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.349
 after a dynamic reform on the internet 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.559
 in Seoul and Hong Kong 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:58.740
 to do that 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.539
 was considered 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.539
 yes, because home production 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.330

 it took lse under his leadership 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.349

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.349

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.449
 I do not like it 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:34.729
 thoughtless 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.729
 though hear 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:40.439

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:43.439

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.679
 another way her young starter just someone or so i have in my 

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:51.740
 children can go 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.740

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.219
 the key to my time and then 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.219
 jamaica but life 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.879
 this is no longer fun 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:19.270
 and then 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.460
 I'm kind of skating a lot 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.150
 3 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.219
 teenagers 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.449
 in how 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:28.610
 and ecolo green 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.610
 for my part nothing remains of it 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.040
 market leader among the young and the elderly 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.470

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.470
 turning back though he thinks

 3 the box 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.259
 He feels it all agrees 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:03.809
 not allowed no longer cleaned 

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:05.069
 shoot 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:07.809
 I then think it was 

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:11.550
