00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 from right to reply as I also 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.810
 would give the same right to reply but 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.570
 put in the mouth of susana giménez someone 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.780
 of the production has asked for them today 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.199
 the holiday they call after what 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.539
 he said after pressing the test 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.570
 to clarify and not clarify 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.630
 in the judges susana they go further they speak 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.250
 of the phrases talk about what happened 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.350
 internally in that meeting yes you 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:39.000
 we listen well to everything you say 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:41.460
 marine than yesterday but that also now 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.960
 I do not expect that I had clogged and what 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.570
 had commented the girl acted in this 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.480
 channel told me if we can make a note 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.820
 denying this one was wrapped up by the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.320
 mine that I am so happy with your 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.360
 last product and more or less what I 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.360
 it cost because it is 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:08.340
 Humor is the voice of these will 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.920
 thousands per day of people asking you for a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.320
 right to reply or ask you to explain 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.899
 a denial about something called the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.240
 attention that a person who of some 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.460
 way is telling you an incidence 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.920
 is to say something that happened in a meeting of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.299
 production behind closed doors and some 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.860
 what only the circle learned 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.310
 most intimate of susana's production 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.039
 that this person chooses to finish the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.679
 words that he transmits and he knows that 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.170
 they're going to be published top it by saying 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:41.000
 susana said is crazy should be the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.350
 I can not deny saying, and the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.399
 public that susana is not angry with 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.140
 us points but I say this textual 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.659
 It is not uncommon, it is not uncommon for someone to do 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.100
 a denial chicanery with a 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.930
 dark sensitive sensitive cloudy issue 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.390
 I do not know how you take it we have to have 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.040
 that hear this testimony to thousands 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.200
 Entidade is strange because we have been 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.700
 denied if automatically from the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.710
 that reality was checking and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.390
 contrasting I miss you in these 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.819
 following words in relation to the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.220
 speed or the alleged madness 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.170
 there are people who suffer from madness like 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.260
 diagnosis and there are people who also 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.610
 suffer from the use of amphetamines say 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.610
 they are things that you do not play with 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.390
 on several occasions 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.230
 but it is striking that when 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.180
 someone from production if to me to a 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.490
 producer of mine called you to tell me a 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.850
 reaction that I had the good one good 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.320
 always these things adapt to what 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.360
 it's a frame that has to do with medium 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.620
 of communication with premises to it 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.150
 simply what they would have what 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.090
 They should have done to not get me a 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.340
 scandal susana is this never existed 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.300
 that's just happy with the production and 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.730
 nothing more 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.280
 now alter data as marin is 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.980
 crazy consume feta mine that is 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.140
 giving extra information that is not 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.180
 well I do not know what's going to happen and some 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.700
 way he does it very well his work is 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.020
 a person, let's say , meaningless 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.790
 common to reality 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.810
 or is exposing and sending 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.420
 directly to the diva dies 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.950
 clear that with this person directly 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.650
 this person communicated with me 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.630
 directly a technology search and 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.630
 on this topic because I repeat 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:04:15.360
 is directly from publishing internal of 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:17.340
 this topic is not feeling that it is very 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.530
 happy and congratulated this peak of 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.770
 production and then threw this 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.770
 comment to see what he said 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.730
 and you know Pablo does not understand that when 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.660
 it's not a denial in general it puts you 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:40.170
 the body is to say if tomorrow they say about me 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.090
 x thing I go out to put in my mouth the 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.130
 denial is saying what is not 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.110
 understands is that they make a denial in 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.210
 name of production team 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.460
 susana but nobody signs the 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.160
 denied me explained this person has 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.080
 that preserve their identity that would have 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.090
 bad that I go out and say with the 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.040
 team head as part of the team 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.840
 from zone jiménez I say that the information 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.540
 of navy cataloged that erroneous and I do 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.280
 charge of going out to cross what he said 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.280
 Calabrian marine explained to me weird
