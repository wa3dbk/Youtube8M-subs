00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.069
 well this is a video of the different 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.500
 screens that has the kart bach and no 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.010
 I'm going to start the car 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.010
 to 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.740
 is giving us the pain with the belt 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.810
 of security this is the initial screen 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.000
 that if you do not put the radio is the one that goes 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.840
 throughout the entire trip 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.840
 of the car 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.149
 would be like that unless we put the 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:42.020
 air conditioner for example in which case 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:45.430
 would mark the temperature the fan 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.430
 would mark the fan 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.019
 well we put the radio on we turn on the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.019
 Car radio with volume button 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.480
 at the exit of the capital 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.300
 As you can see, it's pretty ugly, dial the dial 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.800
 of the station 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.130
 but it does not mark the name of the 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.469
 station 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.659
 that has occurred at the exit of the 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:20.460
 capital for that road from Barcelona to 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.320
 the height of the kilometer has networks in 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.500
 the sense that I do change 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.630
 province for example if it keeps me 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.090
 station but the name is not sold and 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.369
 is at the wheel 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.079
 the usual buttons we can go 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.069
 changing the different screens that 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.069
 have 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.789
 let's see the disease 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.159
 we went to the cb 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.220
 this would be the bluetooth that I thank 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.810
 fontana lathe I am using it but 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.060
 it seems to work pretty well 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.730
 to mark the numbers it seems that 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.760
 identifies incoming calls and 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.760
 outgoing 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.980
 not signal because it should not be for him 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.670
 if you have an ipad or an ipod or something 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.670
 it's not exactly 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.020
 this would be the one of the navigator that we will go 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.020
 then 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.220
 this because the same thing I do not know exactly 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.520
 for a memory stick or something like 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.170
 I do not have it then nothing 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.010
 this is a screen on which you can 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.900
 memorize I think up to 5 or 5 cds 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.150
 different ones inside the hard disk of the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.040
 apparatus 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.040
 I do not have any memorized 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.349
 the usb would be this I do not have any no 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.349
 I have none of seve 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.480
 I do not have a memory card either 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.480
 with songs or whatever 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.050
 also some connection that you 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.340
 we return to the relationship 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.240
 these are the different screens that 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.490
 I had in my corner I usually 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.460
 logically shelter in this which is that of 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.050
 the radio on the one who does not on the cd or 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.050
 if we do not understand the browser 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:39.870
 understands the glove compartment unit that 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.870
 it carries 1000 where it goes 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.850
 we put the browser 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.689
 let's go to map 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.780
 they are locked up all day in the 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.900
 social networks like a window but 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.299
 profitable because there are no houses because the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.579
 young girls do not have houses no 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.049
 they have independence they have to be in 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:16.000
 the bottle and on the street because in the 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.000
 night street 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.150
 I'm without coverage because it's inside the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.650
 garage 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.460
 inside the browser because it helps with 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:36.470
 dynamic imagine that as a lot of 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.150
 things that can be done and parameters and 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.100
 basically this is me the truth that what 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.380
 I use only for gps 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.680
 to see the radio logically but good 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.680
 For that 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.669
 599 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.050
 up the phs a hug to all
