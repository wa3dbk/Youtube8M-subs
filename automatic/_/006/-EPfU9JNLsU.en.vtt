00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.249

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.159
 a city the size of coach art 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.019
 I'm looking for a statement to say 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.019
 so it goes in brussels once a piece that too much was taxed 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.490
 then you still expect on his website 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.140
 doing so well 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.870
 from then on that will not be because the cyclists who meet the cyclist 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.870
 bernard hinault increased louder than expected 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.700
 altintop 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.660
 only then can there be a sophisticated one 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.740
 the time 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.740
 matthijs editors

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 my baby 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.280
 but nice that there are noises 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.280
 and just too little location 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.510
 that's the biggest introductions that 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.510
 that has since been informed and greece 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.020
 heerenveen 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.020
 If that's true a missed opportunity that doesn't work 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.990
 just the moment that not so then deposit 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.890
 the group to settle down 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.890
 shave away 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.850
 the manager wants the king 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.939
 that system 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.339
 sitting 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.449
 and enjoy the shed 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.449
 it's too small to be so happy 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.589
 next winter 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:21.729
 after a kick 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.979
