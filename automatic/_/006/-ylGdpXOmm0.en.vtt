00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
anywhere else so I'm excited to see how

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.000 
anywhere else so I'm excited to see how
this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.840> going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> work<00:01:10.260> any<00:01:10.530> differently

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
this is going to work any differently

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.789 
this is going to work any differently
from<00:01:11.760> other<00:01:12.240> mascaras<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.140> used<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.590> might

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
from other mascaras I have used it might

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
from other mascaras I have used it might
be<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> formula<00:01:14.460> that's<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.880> great<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.689> we'll

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
be the formula that's so great but we'll

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:38.060 
be the formula that's so great but we'll
see<00:01:16.229> once<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.650> first<00:01:16.920> apply<00:01:17.220> it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.740 

okay<00:01:39.070> so<00:01:39.130> for<00:01:39.550> now<00:01:39.700> i<00:01:39.730> have<00:01:40.030> only<00:01:40.240> applied<00:01:40.570> it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
okay so for now i have only applied it

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.660 
okay so for now i have only applied it
on<00:01:40.870> this<00:01:41.230> side<00:01:41.290> and<00:01:41.800> not<00:01:41.950> on<00:01:42.010> this<00:01:42.250> side<00:01:42.430> and

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
on this side and not on this side and

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.150 
on this side and not on this side and
you<00:01:42.820> can<00:01:42.970> really<00:01:43.480> see<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.870> difference<00:01:44.200> on<00:01:44.560> my

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
you can really see a difference on my

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.090 
you can really see a difference on my
top<00:01:45.430> lash<00:01:45.760> or<00:01:46.030> very<00:01:46.300> long<00:01:46.660> they're<00:01:47.350> very<00:01:47.560> full

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
top lash or very long they're very full

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.250 
top lash or very long they're very full
they<00:01:48.550> just<00:01:48.790> look<00:01:49.030> really<00:01:49.060> great<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.050> was

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
they just look really great and I was

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.960 
they just look really great and I was
not<00:01:50.560> expecting<00:01:50.800> that<00:01:51.100> from<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.550> brush<00:01:51.790> they

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
not expecting that from the brush they

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.090 
not expecting that from the brush they
had<00:01:52.240> but<00:01:52.420> I'm<00:01:52.540> assuming<00:01:52.720> it's<00:01:53.260> because<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:54.010> the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
had but I'm assuming it's because of the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.240 
had but I'm assuming it's because of the
formula<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.720> was<00:01:56.380> able<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.710> achieve<00:01:56.830> this

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
formula that I was able to achieve this

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.120 
formula that I was able to achieve this
really<00:01:57.610> nice<00:01:57.790> look<00:01:58.120> on<00:01:58.270> my<00:01:58.420> lashes<00:01:58.890> before<00:01:59.890> I

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
really nice look on my lashes before I

a<00:02:33.340> liquid<00:02:33.580> type<00:02:34.170> formula<00:02:35.170> which<00:02:35.650> i<00:02:35.770> really

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
a liquid type formula which i really

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.470 
a liquid type formula which i really
like<00:02:36.070> because<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.670> just<00:02:36.790> glides<00:02:37.000> on<00:02:37.270> very

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
smoothly you don't have to take a long

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.910 
smoothly you don't have to take a long
time<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> apply<00:02:40.270> it<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:41.200> just<00:02:41.230> ends<00:02:41.860> up

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
time to apply it and it just ends up

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
stuff like that it hit my eyes so the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.449 
stuff like that it hit my eyes so the
mascara<00:03:43.420> transferred<00:03:43.930> onto<00:03:44.110> my<00:03:44.410> skin<00:03:44.470> so

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
mascara transferred onto my skin so

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.100 
mascara transferred onto my skin so
that's<00:03:45.640> one<00:03:45.819> thing<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.450> keep

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
that's one thing to keep

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.530 
that's one thing to keep
in<00:03:47.230> mind<00:03:47.770> when<00:03:48.130> using<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.610> mascara<00:03:49.030> or<00:03:49.300> any

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
in mind when using this mascara or any

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.900 
in mind when using this mascara or any
wet<00:03:49.810> mascara<00:03:50.200> but<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:50.890> far<00:03:51.130> I'm<00:03:51.280> really<00:03:51.490> liking

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
wet mascara but so far I'm really liking

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.700 
wet mascara but so far I'm really liking
it<00:03:52.150> it's<00:03:52.330> definitely<00:03:52.750> not<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:52.900> natural<00:03:53.440> looking

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
it it's definitely not a natural looking

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.440 
it it's definitely not a natural looking
mascara<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.430> think<00:03:54.700> you<00:03:54.790> can<00:03:54.940> definitely<00:03:55.120> tell

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
mascara I think you can definitely tell

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.910 
mascara I think you can definitely tell
that<00:03:55.510> I'm<00:03:55.780> wearing<00:03:55.930> mascara<00:03:56.110> but<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:56.620> really

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
that I'm wearing mascara but I really

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.190 
that I'm wearing mascara but I really
like<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.250> because<00:03:57.400> it's<00:03:58.030> not<00:03:58.240> too<00:03:58.510> extravagant

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
like it because it's not too extravagant

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.680 
like it because it's not too extravagant
where<00:03:59.710> it<00:03:59.920> looks<00:04:00.280> fake<00:04:00.610> but<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.150> still<00:04:01.450> makes

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
where it looks fake but it still makes

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.600 
where it looks fake but it still makes
your<00:04:01.810> eyelashes<00:04:02.290> look<00:04:02.380> really<00:04:02.680> nice<00:04:02.830> so<00:04:03.340> I

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.440 
yeah so i'm going to zoom you guys in
really<00:04:24.160> quickly<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:24.490> we<00:04:24.669> can<00:04:24.790> look<00:04:25.030> at<00:04:25.180> how<00:04:25.390> the

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
really quickly so we can look at how the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.940 
really quickly so we can look at how the
mascara<00:04:25.900> has<00:04:26.020> held<00:04:26.260> up<00:04:26.380> throughout<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.770> day

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
mascara has held up throughout the day

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.700 
mascara has held up throughout the day
so<00:04:27.160> this<00:04:28.090> is<00:04:28.210> how<00:04:28.360> my<00:04:28.510> lashes<00:04:28.720> look<00:04:28.960> after<00:04:29.380> nine

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
so this is how my lashes look after nine

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.800 
so this is how my lashes look after nine
hours<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:30.430> i<00:04:30.730> think<00:04:31.150> they<00:04:31.270> look<00:04:31.450> really

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
hours and i think they look really

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.840 
hours and i think they look really
really<00:04:32.110> good<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.770> mascara<00:04:33.130> held<00:04:33.340> up<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.580> curl

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
really good the mascara held up the curl

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.550 
really good the mascara held up the curl
really<00:04:34.270> well<00:04:34.540> i<00:04:34.570> think<00:04:34.840> they're<00:04:35.169> perfectly

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
really well i think they're perfectly

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.010 
really well i think they're perfectly
curled<00:04:35.919> i<00:04:36.250> didn't<00:04:36.730> get<00:04:36.790> any<00:04:37.000> smudging<00:04:37.630> on<00:04:37.840> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
curled i didn't get any smudging on the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.150 
curled i didn't get any smudging on the
bottom<00:04:38.320> which<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:38.560> was<00:04:38.680> really<00:04:38.890> afraid<00:04:38.980> of

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
bottom which I was really afraid of

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.740 
bottom which I was really afraid of
because<00:04:39.460> i<00:04:39.490> typically<00:04:39.850> go<00:04:39.940> for<00:04:40.120> waterproof

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
because i typically go for waterproof

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.240 
because i typically go for waterproof
and<00:04:40.960> i'm<00:04:41.080> pretty<00:04:41.230> sure<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.500> this<00:04:41.770> one's<00:04:42.010> not

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
and i'm pretty sure that this one's not

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.480 
and i'm pretty sure that this one's not
waterproof<00:04:42.640> and<00:04:43.150> um<00:04:44.140> after<00:04:44.830> it<00:04:45.160> dried<00:04:45.460> I

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
waterproof and um after it dried I

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.550 
waterproof and um after it dried I
didn't<00:04:45.880> do<00:04:46.000> any<00:04:46.210> weird<00:04:46.630> like<00:04:46.870> smudging<00:04:47.320> on<00:04:47.410> my

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
didn't do any weird like smudging on my

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.990 
didn't do any weird like smudging on my
I<00:04:47.590> like<00:04:47.890> it<00:04:48.010> did<00:04:48.160> when<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:48.340> was<00:04:48.430> still<00:04:48.669> drying

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
I like it did when it was still drying

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.150 
I like it did when it was still drying
so<00:04:49.330> overall<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:49.870> think<00:04:50.110> this<00:04:50.350> mascara<00:04:50.710> worked

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
so overall I think this mascara worked

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.530 
so overall I think this mascara worked
really<00:04:51.400> well<00:04:51.520> throughout<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:52.000> day<00:04:52.120> so<00:04:52.270> now

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
really well throughout the day so now

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.450 
really well throughout the day so now
just<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:52.900> go<00:04:53.050> over<00:04:53.080> some<00:04:53.440> quick<00:04:53.800> points<00:04:54.190> about

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
just to go over some quick points about

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.250 
just to go over some quick points about
this<00:04:54.669> mascara<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.300> see<00:04:55.570> what<00:04:55.750> my<00:04:55.870> final

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
this mascara and see what my final

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.290 
this mascara and see what my final
rating<00:04:56.410> of<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.830> is<00:04:57.070> just<00:04:57.490> remember<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.150> this

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
rating of it is just remember that this

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.300 
rating of it is just remember that this
mascara<00:04:58.690> is<00:04:58.840> for<00:04:59.260> volume<00:04:59.710> that's<00:04:59.979> what<00:05:00.190> it's

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
mascara is for volume that's what it's

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.150 
mascara is for volume that's what it's
made<00:05:00.370> for<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:01.030> I<00:05:01.180> think<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.570> do<00:05:01.630> see<00:05:02.350> that<00:05:02.530> I<00:05:02.770> see

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
made for and I think I do see that I see

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.070 
made for and I think I do see that I see
a<00:05:03.190> lot<00:05:03.400> of<00:05:03.460> lengthening<00:05:03.970> as<00:05:04.270> well<00:05:04.510> so<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:04.720> really

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
a lot of lengthening as well so I really

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.050 
a lot of lengthening as well so I really
like<00:05:05.290> it<00:05:05.500> also<00:05:06.310> keep<00:05:06.460> in<00:05:06.580> mind<00:05:06.640> that<00:05:06.850> this

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
like it also keep in mind that this

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.150 
like it also keep in mind that this
mascara<00:05:07.390> it's<00:05:07.690> very<00:05:08.020> liquidy<00:05:08.650> so<00:05:08.950> you're

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
mascara it's very liquidy so you're

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.260 
mascara it's very liquidy so you're
going<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.310> want<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:09.610> have<00:05:09.820> it<00:05:09.940> be<00:05:10.060> completely

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
going to want to have it be completely

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.150 
going to want to have it be completely
dry<00:05:10.720> before<00:05:10.750> you<00:05:11.110> do<00:05:11.440> anything<00:05:11.680> else<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:12.040> your

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160

the<00:05:23.950> packaging<00:05:24.160> of<00:05:24.490> this<00:05:24.640> product<00:05:24.850> and<00:05:25.060> also

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
the packaging of this product and also

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.700 
the packaging of this product and also
the<00:05:25.570> brush<00:05:25.780> on<00:05:25.930> this<00:05:26.080> product<00:05:26.290> because<00:05:26.530> I

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
the brush on this product because I

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.550 
the brush on this product because I
think<00:05:26.830> it's<00:05:27.100> very<00:05:27.160> basic<00:05:27.850> and<00:05:27.970> simple<00:05:28.660> but<00:05:29.380> it

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
think it's very basic and simple but it

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.190 
think it's very basic and simple but it
still<00:05:29.860> does<00:05:30.040> a<00:05:30.070> job<00:05:30.370> really<00:05:30.610> well<00:05:31.000> so<00:05:31.810> overall

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
still does a job really well so overall

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.590 
still does a job really well so overall
i<00:05:32.350> would<00:05:32.530> give<00:05:32.830> this<00:05:32.860> product<00:05:33.250> a<00:05:33.580> 8<00:05:34.030> out<00:05:34.300> of<00:05:34.330> 10

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
i would give this product a 8 out of 10

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.270 
i would give this product a 8 out of 10
and<00:05:34.810> the<00:05:34.930> reason<00:05:35.200> I'm<00:05:35.290> giving<00:05:35.410> it<00:05:35.620> an<00:05:35.800> 8<00:05:36.070> is

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
and the reason I'm giving it an 8 is

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.280 
and the reason I'm giving it an 8 is
because<00:05:36.790> it<00:05:37.060> is<00:05:37.090> a<00:05:37.210> little<00:05:37.390> too<00:05:37.630> liquidy<00:05:38.080> for

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
because it is a little too liquidy for

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.260 
because it is a little too liquidy for
me<00:05:38.410> typically<00:05:39.070> I'm<00:05:39.280> on<00:05:39.400> the<00:05:39.520> go<00:05:39.669> especially<00:05:40.030> in

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
me typically I'm on the go especially in

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.460 
me typically I'm on the go especially in
the<00:05:40.360> morning<00:05:40.660> when<00:05:40.780> I<00:05:40.810> have<00:05:40.960> to<00:05:41.080> rush<00:05:41.229> to<00:05:41.260> class

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
the morning when I have to rush to class

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.290 
the morning when I have to rush to class
so<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:41.770> just<00:05:42.010> quickly<00:05:42.160> apply<00:05:42.460> it<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:42.760> go<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.240> I

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
so I just quickly apply it and go and I

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.550 
so I just quickly apply it and go and I
feel<00:05:43.479> like<00:05:43.600> I<00:05:43.720> can't<00:05:43.960> really<00:05:44.020> do<00:05:44.290> that<00:05:44.320> with

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
feel like I can't really do that with

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.950 
feel like I can't really do that with
this<00:05:44.590> mascara<00:05:45.070> because<00:05:45.580> it<00:05:45.880> might<00:05:46.090> transfer

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
this mascara because it might transfer

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.510 
this mascara because it might transfer
onto<00:05:47.110> my<00:05:47.290> skin<00:05:47.350> and<00:05:47.800> then<00:05:47.950> it<00:05:48.100> would<00:05:48.190> look<00:05:48.310> kind

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
onto my skin and then it would look kind

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.969 
onto my skin and then it would look kind
of<00:05:48.580> weird<00:05:48.640> like<00:05:48.940> it<00:05:49.180> did<00:05:49.330> today<00:05:49.450> but<00:05:49.930> overall<00:05:50.710> I

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
of weird like it did today but overall I

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.620 
of weird like it did today but overall I
do<00:05:51.040> really<00:05:51.340> like<00:05:51.550> it<00:05:51.760> the<00:05:51.880> quality<00:05:52.270> is<00:05:52.390> great

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630

the<00:05:52.960> longevity<00:05:53.140> of<00:05:53.590> it<00:05:53.770> is<00:05:53.919> great<00:05:54.160> and<00:05:54.400> overall

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
the longevity of it is great and overall

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.540 
the longevity of it is great and overall
it<00:05:55.419> just<00:05:55.450> worked<00:05:55.810> really<00:05:56.050> well<00:05:56.169> on<00:05:56.349> me<00:05:56.680> I<00:05:56.919> also

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
it just worked really well on me I also

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.999 
it just worked really well on me I also
would<00:05:57.940> like<00:05:58.090> to<00:05:58.150> see<00:05:58.539> mally<00:05:58.810> beauty<00:05:58.960> maybe

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
would like to see mally beauty maybe

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.350 
would like to see mally beauty maybe
put<00:06:00.099> in<00:06:00.219> some<00:06:00.249> different<00:06:00.699> colors<00:06:01.029> because

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
put in some different colors because

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.879 
put in some different colors because
people<00:06:01.689> don't<00:06:01.839> always<00:06:02.020> like<00:06:02.259> to<00:06:02.379> go<00:06:02.529> for<00:06:02.740> black

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
people don't always like to go for black

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.200 
people don't always like to go for black
mascara<00:06:03.189> because<00:06:03.490> they<00:06:03.729> think<00:06:03.789> it's<00:06:04.059> too

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
mascara because they think it's too

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.029 
mascara because they think it's too
harsh<00:06:04.479> so<00:06:05.050> maybe<00:06:05.199> they<00:06:05.409> should<00:06:05.559> try<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.800> make<00:06:06.009> a

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
harsh so maybe they should try to make a

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:07.619 
harsh so maybe they should try to make a
brown<00:06:06.339> one<00:06:06.580> or<00:06:06.729> something<00:06:06.999> like<00:06:07.089> that<00:06:07.150> to<00:06:07.509> make

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:07.629 
brown one or something like that to make

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:09.779 
brown one or something like that to make
the<00:06:07.839> range<00:06:08.080> a<00:06:08.229> little<00:06:08.439> bit<00:06:08.559> wider<00:06:08.800> and<00:06:09.129> open<00:06:09.699> it

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
the range a little bit wider and open it

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.089 
the range a little bit wider and open it
up<00:06:09.909> to<00:06:09.939> more<00:06:10.330> customers<00:06:10.899> I<00:06:11.139> think<00:06:11.830> the<00:06:11.919> price

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
up to more customers I think the price

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.709 
up to more customers I think the price
of<00:06:12.279> this<00:06:12.399> as<00:06:12.580> well<00:06:12.759> is<00:06:12.819> really<00:06:13.360> great<00:06:13.539> because

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
of this as well is really great because

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:15.179 
of this as well is really great because
it's<00:06:14.020> not<00:06:14.139> too<00:06:14.379> expensive<00:06:14.680> where<00:06:15.069> its

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:15.189 
it's not too expensive where its

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:16.499 
it's not too expensive where its
high-end<00:06:15.580> but<00:06:15.759> it's<00:06:15.879> not<00:06:16.059> cheap<00:06:16.300> words

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:16.509 
high-end but it's not cheap words

high-end but it's not cheap words

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889
