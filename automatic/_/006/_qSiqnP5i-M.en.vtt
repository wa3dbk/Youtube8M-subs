00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.850 
see it's pretty much like a tablet pc
now<00:02:03.780> if<00:02:03.840> you've<00:02:04.020> used<00:02:04.229> an<00:02:04.500> Android<00:02:04.829> tablet

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
now if you've used an Android tablet

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.069 
now if you've used an Android tablet
you'll<00:02:05.850> notice<00:02:06.360> you've<00:02:06.659> got<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> home

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
you'll notice you've got the home

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.300 
you'll notice you've got the home
screens<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.649> things

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
screens and things

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.880 
screens and things
so<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.610> pretty<00:02:08.759> much<00:02:08.970> exactly<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.569> same<00:02:09.890> now

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
so it's pretty much exactly the same now

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.120 
so it's pretty much exactly the same now
as<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.069> said<00:02:11.220> before<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:13.080> use<00:02:13.130> any

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
as I said before you can use any

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.030 
as I said before you can use any
keyboard<00:02:14.430> as<00:02:15.300> long<00:02:15.450> as<00:02:15.569> it's<00:02:15.690> USB<00:02:15.989> keyboard<00:02:16.950> or

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
keyboard as long as it's USB keyboard or

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.699 
keyboard as long as it's USB keyboard or
mouse<00:02:17.250> plug<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:17.970> straight<00:02:18.120> into<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.709> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
mouse plug it straight into the the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.850 
mouse plug it straight into the the
android<00:02:20.040> box<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.700> your<00:02:21.239> way<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.480> go<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.989> just

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
android box and your way to go I just

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.820 
android box and your way to go I just
simply<00:02:23.370> used<00:02:23.849> one<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.720> these<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.440> like<00:02:25.800> a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
simply used one of these this is like a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.210 
simply used one of these this is like a
bluetooth<00:02:26.760> wireless<00:02:27.060> keyboard<00:02:27.750> I've<00:02:27.930> used<00:02:28.380> of

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
bluetooth wireless keyboard I've used of

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.339 
bluetooth wireless keyboard I've used of
plug<00:02:29.489> be<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.120> dongle<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.780> front<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.200> it

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
plug be the dongle in the front of it

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.440 
plug be the dongle in the front of it
and<00:02:31.500> use<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.220> unlike<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.940> because<00:02:33.269> it's

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
and use that unlike this because it's

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.690 
and use that unlike this because it's
got<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.900> keyboard<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.950> little<00:02:35.489> mouse

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
got the keyboard and a little mouse

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.030 
got the keyboard and a little mouse
trackpad<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.230> said<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.650> could<00:02:37.800> use<00:02:37.830> a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
trackpad but like I said you could use a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.130 
trackpad but like I said you could use a
mouse<00:02:38.340> if<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.670> wanted<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.300> wide<00:02:39.660> mouth<00:02:39.900> or

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
mouse if you wanted to a wide mouth or

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.250 
mouse if you wanted to a wide mouth or
wireless<00:02:40.530> mouse<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.980> work<00:02:41.130> absolutely<00:02:41.370> fine

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
wireless mouse it work absolutely fine

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.900 
wireless mouse it work absolutely fine
so<00:02:43.260> there<00:02:43.830> we<00:02:43.950> have<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.580> running

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
so there we have it this is running

that or from here there's no needing to
go<00:03:17.430> elsewhere<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.910> install<00:03:18.420> things<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.760> one<00:03:20.760> of

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
go elsewhere to install things so one of

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.970 
go elsewhere to install things so one of
the<00:03:20.940> things<00:03:21.000> i<00:03:21.299> would<00:03:21.359> say<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.680> should

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.390 
the things i would say that you should
install<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:24.540> shutdown<00:03:25.170> button<00:03:25.739> because

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
install is a shutdown button because

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.729 
install is a shutdown button because
unfortunately<00:03:26.549> this<00:03:27.180> doesn't<00:03:27.690> come<00:03:27.900> with<00:03:28.500> a

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
unfortunately this doesn't come with a

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.030 
unfortunately this doesn't come with a
shutdown<00:03:29.269> button<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:31.350> it's<00:03:31.470> important<00:03:31.890> you

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
shutdown button and it's important you

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.599 
shutdown button and it's important you
shut<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.280> down<00:03:32.579> properly<00:03:33.560> because<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:35.489> know

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
shut it down properly because you know

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.960 
shut it down properly because you know
you<00:03:35.850> don't<00:03:36.000> know<00:03:36.209> corrupt<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:38.519> operating

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
system of the android box so let's find

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.420 
system of the android box so let's find
one<00:03:45.090> but<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:46.139> is<00:03:46.319> Senator<00:03:46.560> only<00:03:46.980> works<00:03:47.220> on

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
one but this is Senator only works on

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
rooted phones android box i don't thing

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.140 
rooted phones android box i don't thing
is<00:03:50.400> rooted<00:03:50.850> so<00:03:51.299> let's<00:03:51.540> found<00:03:51.870> find<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.620> shutdown

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
is rooted so let's found find a shutdown

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.330 
is rooted so let's found find a shutdown
button<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.840> works<00:03:55.200> without<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:56.130> being

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
button that works without it being

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:06.630 
button that works without it being
rooted<00:03:56.989> let's<00:03:57.989> search<00:03:58.230> where<00:03:58.560> again

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:15.459 

let's<00:04:07.640> try<00:04:07.819> this<00:04:07.939> quick<00:04:08.359> shut<00:04:08.629> down<00:04:08.900> here<00:04:14.469> it

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:15.469 
let's try this quick shut down here it

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:19.349 
let's try this quick shut down here it
seems<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.859> be<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.070> one<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:16.669> we'll<00:04:16.850> install<00:04:17.600> it

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
seems to be the one so we'll install it

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.849 
seems to be the one so we'll install it
okay<00:04:20.359> now<00:04:20.539> now<00:04:20.900> that<00:04:21.079> the<00:04:21.259> the<00:04:21.650> shut<00:04:21.829> down

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
okay now now that the the shut down

iplayer works it I'd be honest it is a
bit<00:05:37.939> sketchy<00:05:38.210> sometimes<00:05:38.810> but<00:05:39.050> that's<00:05:39.199> more<00:05:39.469> to

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
bit sketchy sometimes but that's more to

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.580 
bit sketchy sometimes but that's more to
do<00:05:39.830> with<00:05:40.039> the<00:05:40.280> BBC<00:05:40.819> player<00:05:41.210> app<00:05:41.419> but<00:05:42.409> they're

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
do with the BBC player app but they're

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.709 
do with the BBC player app but they're
always<00:05:42.770> constantly<00:05:43.430> updating<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.300> year<00:05:44.569> at
