00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.641
 We have this one here: two thirds. 

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:05.614
 I want you to stop the video 

00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:08.979
 and try to think about other fractions, 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:11.213
 which are equal (equivalent) to the one here. 

00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:14.733
 And they represent the same number. 

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:19.143
 To do this, imagine what two-thirds are. 

00:00:19.143 --> 00:00:25.674
 Let me draw a whole here. And I will try to divide it into three equal parts. 

00:00:25.674 --> 00:00:29.811
 This is my whole. Three equal parts. 

00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:32.181
 Let me try to make them equal as far as I can. 

00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:33.557
 I can do it better than that. 

00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:40.628
 These are one, two, three equal parts. 

00:00:40.628 --> 00:00:44.626
 Two-thirds are two of these three equal parts. 

00:00:44.626 --> 00:00:47.040
 Let me paint them. 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.074
 This is one third, 

00:00:49.074 --> 00:00:51.212
 these are two-thirds 

00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:55.151
 and now we have two of three equal parts. 

00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:56.387
 And that's two-thirds. 

00:00:56.387 --> 00:00:57.688
 I will copy and paste them, 

00:00:57.688 --> 00:01:01.960
 so we can see another way of presenting this liver. 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.105
 Copy and set. 

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:08.458
 I will do it once, and once more. 

00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:11.762
 I can do it many times, but I'll do it twice more here. 

00:01:11.762 --> 00:01:13.764
 There are a few things we can do. 

00:01:13.764 --> 00:01:21.057
 The first option is to make a horizontal line that divides all 

00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:23.005
 three parts in two parts. 

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:23.764
 Let's do that. 

00:01:23.764 --> 00:01:26.285
 Two parts. 

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:29.532
 Now how many equal parts do I have? 

00:01:29.532 --> 00:01:33.594
 I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 equal parts. 

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:38.848
 And how many of them are now crossed out? 

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.605
 We see 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 

00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:43.360
 Four sixth. 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.977
 Note, four six is ​​the same liver 

00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:48.195
 as two-thirds. 

00:01:48.195 --> 00:01:49.522
 These are equal fractions. 

00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:53.414
 Two thirds equals four six. 

00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:55.480
 We can now draw something very similar. 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.195
 Instead of dividing each one into two, 

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:01.393
 we can divide every third. 

00:02:01.393 --> 00:02:03.813
 Draw a horizontal line here. 

00:02:03.813 --> 00:02:08.562
 Here, see 1, 2, 3. 

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:12.907
 I now divided into three equal parts 

00:02:12.907 --> 00:02:15.533
 and I have three parts. 

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:20.471
 I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine identical parts. 

00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:22.954
 and which of these are crossed out? 

00:02:22.954 --> 00:02:26.376
 We have one, two, three, four, five, six. 

00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:33.574
 Two thirds, equal to four sixths, equals six nines. 

00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:37.677
 All these are the same fractions. 

00:02:37.677 --> 00:02:39.549
 Two thirds, four sixth, six ninths. 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.430
 And if we put them on the numerical axis, 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.499
 we will see this. 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:43.606
 Let me do it. 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.064
 Let me draw a numerical axis here. 

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:48.496
 Let's say here is zero and I will focus between zero and one, 

00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:50.405
 and of course you can go there. 

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:52.009
 Much there. 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:03:00.242
 Let's divide the unit to thirds, this is one third, and two thirds. 

00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:03.215
 We already know that this is a third, 

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:07.499
 and two-thirds. We have two identical parts 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.061
 from three to one. 

00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:13.580
 We split the space between zero and one in three equal parts. 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.126
 Where will the sixth be? 

00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:18.980
 Now we have to divide into six equal parts. 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.880
 One two three four five six, 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.479
 and four sixth, that will be 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.574
 four of the six parts that are up to one. 

00:03:29.574 --> 00:03:34.713
 One two three four. This number is equal to four six. 

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:36.054
 And you can do the same, 

00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:38.123
 if you want to think about the ninth. 

00:03:38.123 --> 00:03:40.164
 Instead of dividing each, 

00:03:40.164 --> 00:03:42.848
 we can put it 

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:51.746
 one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. 

00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:55.315
 I now divided the space between zero and one 

00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:56.975
 in nine equal parts. 

00:03:56.975 --> 00:03:58.478
 Where are six ninth? 

00:03:58.478 --> 00:04:03.021
 One two three four five six. 

00:04:03.021 --> 00:04:05.734
 Again, the same on the numerical axis. 

00:04:05.734 --> 00:04:09.075
 The same sixth ninth is equal to two-thirds, 

00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:11.160
 which is equal to four six.
