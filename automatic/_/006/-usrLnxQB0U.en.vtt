on<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.690> clock<00:02:01.940> we<00:02:02.940> can<00:02:03.150> date<00:02:03.330> this<00:02:03.540> clock<00:02:03.810> to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
on this clock we can date this clock to

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.730 
on this clock we can date this clock to
the<00:02:04.140> first<00:02:04.410> couple<00:02:04.800> years<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:07.350> trumpeter

the first couple years of the trumpeter
clock<00:02:07.980> being<00:02:08.220> produced<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.360> clock

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
clock being produced and so this clock

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.780 
clock being produced and so this clock
was<00:02:09.780> made<00:02:09.840> right<00:02:10.230> about<00:02:10.470> 1859<00:02:11.460> 1860<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.700> it

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
was made right about 1859 1860 and it

during<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.739> call<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.870> same<00:04:07.110> setup

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
during the call this is the same setup

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.589 
during the call this is the same setup
that's<00:04:07.799> seen<00:04:08.099> in<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.549> early<00:04:08.940> black<00:04:09.239> force

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
that's seen in the early black force

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.509 
that's seen in the early black force
flute<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.200> organ<00:04:10.560> clocks<00:04:10.829> they're

flute and organ clocks they're

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.369 
flute and organ clocks they're
frequently<00:04:12.060> decorated<00:04:12.660> with<00:04:12.720> large<00:04:13.019> oil

function<00:04:17.489> in<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.789> same<00:04:18.000> way<00:04:18.380> so<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.709> also

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
function in the same way so this is also

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.039 
function in the same way so this is also
you<00:04:20.609> know<00:04:20.700> just<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:21.000> hybrid<00:04:21.450> clock<00:04:21.750> in<00:04:21.959> the

you know just a hybrid clock in the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.460 
you know just a hybrid clock in the
early<00:04:22.380> stages<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:24.360> still<00:04:24.630> retains<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.289> lot

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
early stages and it still retains a lot

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.110 
early stages and it still retains a lot
of<00:04:25.590> those<00:04:25.710> elements<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.280> is<00:04:26.550> seen<00:04:26.789> in<00:04:27.000> the

a beautiful clock that just ties the
whole<00:04:48.020> theme<00:04:49.020> in<00:04:49.380> together<00:04:49.620> I<00:04:50.419> want<00:04:51.419> to<00:04:51.479> set<00:04:51.690> it

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
whole theme in together I want to set it

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.110 
whole theme in together I want to set it
off<00:04:51.930> here<00:04:52.229> so<00:04:52.410> you<00:04:52.500> can<00:04:52.650> see<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.310> hear<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.030> in
