00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.030 
basically the multi-tool for the trip so
I've<00:01:33.750> actually<00:01:33.930> used<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.380> bit<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
I've actually used this a bit for a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.740 
I've actually used this a bit for a
handful<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.430> things<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.060> testing<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
handful of things just for testing and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.410 
handful of things just for testing and
on<00:01:37.680> rare<00:01:38.009> occasions<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:38.729> I've<00:01:39.000> actually<00:01:39.180> had

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
on rare occasions when I've actually had

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.480 
on rare occasions when I've actually had
the<00:01:39.509> opportunity<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> use<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.470> works<00:01:41.220> pretty

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the opportunity to use it works pretty

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.969 
the opportunity to use it works pretty
well<00:01:41.899> I've<00:01:42.899> talked<00:01:43.110> about<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.439> about<00:01:43.500> before

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
well I've talked about it about before

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.319 
well I've talked about it about before
in<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.130> past<00:01:44.310> about<00:01:44.579> how<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.790> feel<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.149> it's

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
in the past about how I feel like it's

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.330 
in the past about how I feel like it's
mainly<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.840> piece<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.200> jewelry<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.710> guys<00:01:46.920> but

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
mainly a piece of jewelry for guys but

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.370 
mainly a piece of jewelry for guys but
it<00:01:47.850> does<00:01:48.090> kind<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> job<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.259> it's

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it does kind of do the job that it's

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.010 
it does kind of do the job that it's
supposed<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.649> do<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> degree<00:01:51.060> there's<00:01:51.780> some

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
supposed to do to a degree there's some

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.120 
supposed to do to a degree there's some
limitations<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.860> I'll<00:01:52.920> talk<00:01:53.100> about

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
limitations there and I'll talk about

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.160 
limitations there and I'll talk about
them<00:01:53.520> when<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.299> around<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.630> my<00:01:54.689> review<00:01:55.020> and
