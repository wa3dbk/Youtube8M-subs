00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
I thought of this I've gotten a couple

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.889 
I thought of this I've gotten a couple
requests<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.669> reviews<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.210> self<00:00:33.510> tanners

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
requests to do reviews on self tanners

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.799 
requests to do reviews on self tanners
so<00:00:34.200> that's<00:00:35.160> why<00:00:35.309> I'm<00:00:35.460> doing<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.820> today<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
so that's why I'm doing this today the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.180 
so that's why I'm doing this today the
reason<00:00:36.930> they<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.350> two<00:00:37.590> different<00:00:37.739> bottles

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
reason they have two different bottles

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.740 
reason they have two different bottles
one<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> body<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.270> face<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
one for the body and one for the face is

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.700 
one for the body and one for the face is
they<00:00:39.870> actually<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.200> slightly<00:00:40.590> different

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
they actually have slightly different

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.910 
they actually have slightly different
ingredients<00:00:41.550> they<00:00:42.180> both<00:00:42.390> use<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.899> DHA<00:00:43.890> which

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
ingredients they both use the DHA which

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.639 
ingredients they both use the DHA which
is<00:00:44.340> responsible<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.899> actual<00:00:46.170> bronzing

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
is responsible for the actual bronzing

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.069 
is responsible for the actual bronzing
of<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.890> skin<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.940> face<00:00:48.270> one<00:00:48.539> actually

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
of your skin but the face one actually

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.569 
of your skin but the face one actually
has<00:00:49.260> something<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.649> they<00:00:49.800> call<00:00:49.980> insta<00:00:50.370> lift

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
has something that they call insta lift

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.850 
has something that they call insta lift
goji<00:00:51.000> berry<00:00:51.239> which<00:00:51.570> helps<00:00:52.140> smooth<00:00:52.440> over<00:00:52.649> fine

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
goji berry which helps smooth over fine

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.619 
goji berry which helps smooth over fine
lines<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.520> also<00:00:53.730> more<00:00:54.030> hydrating<00:00:54.510> than

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
lines and it's also more hydrating than

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.500 
lines and it's also more hydrating than
the<00:00:54.719> body<00:00:54.899> version<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.670> are<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.270> more

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the body version so if you are a more

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.299 
the body version so if you are a more
dry<00:00:57.750> person<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.379> self<00:00:58.559> tanners<00:00:58.890> dry<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> out

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
dry person and self tanners dry you out

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.979 
dry person and self tanners dry you out
even<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.609> then<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.539> would<00:01:00.660> definitely

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
even more then I would definitely

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.080 
even more then I would definitely
recommend<00:01:01.109> getting<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.039> face<00:01:02.489> version<00:01:02.910> as

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
recommend getting the face version as

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.969 
recommend getting the face version as
well<00:01:03.300> as<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> body<00:01:03.719> version<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.589> reason<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
well as the body version the reason that

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.950 
well as the body version the reason that
says<00:01:05.250> extreme<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> more

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
says extreme on it is this is a more

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050 
says extreme on it is this is a more
intense<00:01:07.320> formula<00:01:07.860> than<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> regular<00:01:08.760> mermaid

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
intense formula than the regular mermaid

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.030 
intense formula than the regular mermaid
mousse<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> darker<00:01:10.080> formula<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.710> if<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
mousse it is a darker formula so if you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.789 
mousse it is a darker formula so if you
really<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.520> deep<00:01:12.000> golden<00:01:12.990> tan<00:01:13.320> then<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
really like that deep golden tan then I

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.859 
really like that deep golden tan then I
would<00:01:14.159> recommend<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.640> extreme<00:01:15.119> versus<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
would recommend the extreme versus the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.870 
would recommend the extreme versus the
regular<00:01:16.020> unless<00:01:16.890> you're<00:01:17.070> using<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.520> spray-on

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
regular unless you're using a spray-on

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.100 
regular unless you're using a spray-on
version<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> self-tanner<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.960> would

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
version of a self-tanner I would

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.590 
version of a self-tanner I would
definitely<00:01:19.590> recommend<00:01:19.740> getting<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.610> mint<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
definitely recommend getting a mint to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.510 
definitely recommend getting a mint to
use<00:01:21.810> instead<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.770> dispensing<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> into

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
use instead of just dispensing it into

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.740 
use instead of just dispensing it into
your<00:01:23.640> hand<00:01:23.880> otherwise<00:01:24.210> you're<00:01:24.450> gonna<00:01:24.509> get

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
your hand otherwise you're gonna get

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.340 
your hand otherwise you're gonna get
that<00:01:24.960> brown<00:01:25.290> hand<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.860> everybody<00:01:26.250> notices

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
that brown hand that everybody notices

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.179 
that brown hand that everybody notices
million-dollar<00:01:28.350> tan<00:01:28.590> does<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.950> their<00:01:29.070> own

four to five days but it does provide
really<00:03:22.920> good<00:03:23.010> color<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.549> entire<00:03:23.820> time<00:03:24.150> and

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
really good color the entire time and

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.539 
really good color the entire time and
it's<00:03:24.810> an<00:03:24.930> even<00:03:25.320> fade<00:03:25.680> that's<00:03:26.010> another<00:03:26.310> thing

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
it's an even fade that's another thing

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.240 
it's an even fade that's another thing
that<00:03:26.610> with<00:03:27.450> self<00:03:27.660> tanners<00:03:28.080> if<00:03:28.320> something

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
that with self tanners if something

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.630 
that with self tanners if something
fades<00:03:30.209> all<00:03:30.630> spotty<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.709> blotchy<00:03:31.980> all<00:03:32.340> over<00:03:32.519> my

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.130 
fades all spotty and blotchy all over my
skin<00:03:32.880> then<00:03:33.120> it's<00:03:33.239> not<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.450> self-tanner<00:03:33.959> that

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
skin then it's not a self-tanner that

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.170 
skin then it's not a self-tanner that
I'll<00:03:34.230> buy<00:03:34.350> again<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:34.920> one<00:03:35.130> does<00:03:35.370> fade<00:03:35.640> evenly

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
I'll buy again this one does fade evenly

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.690 
I'll buy again this one does fade evenly
everywhere<00:03:37.049> so<00:03:37.860> if<00:03:38.160> that's<00:03:38.280> something<00:03:38.549> that

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
product so that's another reason why

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.750 
product so that's another reason why
it's<00:03:56.040> good<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.220> have<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.579> one<00:03:56.730> that's

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
it's good to have the one that's

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.569 
it's good to have the one that's
separate<00:03:57.420> for<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.690> face<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:59.100> can<00:03:59.430> just

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
separate for the face is you can just

pop that on whenever you want to so you

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.390 
pop that on whenever you want to so you
can<00:04:03.269> see<00:04:03.480> on<00:04:03.690> one<00:04:04.260> side<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.769> frame<00:04:05.040> here

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
can see on one side of the frame here

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.069

I'm<00:04:05.579> applying<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:06.060> self-tanner<00:04:06.570> this<00:04:06.930> was

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
I'm applying the self-tanner this was

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.319 
I'm applying the self-tanner this was
exactly<00:04:07.350> 24<00:04:08.010> hours<00:04:08.070> ago<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.850> can<00:04:09.030> see<00:04:09.180> how

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
exactly 24 hours ago so you can see how

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.810 
exactly 24 hours ago so you can see how
pasty<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.750> was<00:04:10.049> then<00:04:10.290> versus<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.190> nice<00:04:11.430> rich

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
pasty I was then versus the nice rich

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.500 
pasty I was then versus the nice rich
golden<00:04:12.570> tan<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:12.989> I<00:04:13.079> have

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
golden tan that I have

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.080 
golden tan that I have
so<00:04:13.989> I<00:04:14.260> much<00:04:14.950> prefer<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:15.519> look<00:04:15.580> on<00:04:15.970> myself

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.090 

so<00:04:20.090> here<00:04:20.390> I<00:04:20.420> am<00:04:20.600> applying<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:21.079> to<00:04:21.200> my<00:04:21.230> legs<00:04:21.620> and

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
so here I am applying it to my legs and

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.160 
so here I am applying it to my legs and
for<00:04:22.700> now<00:04:22.790> I'm<00:04:23.030> just<00:04:23.060> going<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.480> apply<00:04:23.690> it<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:23.960> my

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
for now I'm just going to apply it to my

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.980 
for now I'm just going to apply it to my
right<00:04:24.770> leg<00:04:25.010> and<00:04:25.280> I'm<00:04:26.180> going<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.360> let<00:04:26.510> it<00:04:26.570> set<00:04:26.840> in

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
right leg and I'm going to let it set in

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.210 
right leg and I'm going to let it set in
that<00:04:27.170> way<00:04:27.290> you<00:04:27.350> can<00:04:27.590> see<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:27.890> difference

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
that way you can see the difference

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.860 
that way you can see the difference
between<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.880> two<00:04:31.180> so<00:04:32.180> this<00:04:32.420> is<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.660> color

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
between the two so this is the color

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.140 
between the two so this is the color
that<00:04:33.110> you<00:04:33.200> get<00:04:33.350> immediately<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.760> can<00:04:34.940> see

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
that you get immediately and you can see

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.500 
that you get immediately and you can see
a<00:04:35.180> difference<00:04:35.570> it's<00:04:35.780> definitely<00:04:36.260> more<00:04:36.500> golden

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
a difference it's definitely more golden

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.410 
a difference it's definitely more golden
and<00:04:38.600> then<00:04:39.560> an<00:04:39.800> hour<00:04:39.890> later<00:04:40.040> I<00:04:40.550> still<00:04:40.940> have<00:04:41.120> no

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
and then an hour later I still have no

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.570 
and then an hour later I still have no
