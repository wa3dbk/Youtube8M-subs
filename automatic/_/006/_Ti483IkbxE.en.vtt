 in the last 10 years the north of the country 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.570
 has had growth above 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.480
 average and especially our city 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.250
 whose 300 around 7 or 8 percent 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.900
 about other provinces 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.550
 this growth is reflected in what 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.800
 that today is called as the world of 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.750
 construction pull stone build 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.580
 a report is prepared on how this 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.630
 phenomenon started our city and 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.630
 where they point

 The most pure has an area of ​​36 thousand 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:39.470
 square kilometers equivalent to 3% 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.960
 of the Peruvian territory has more than 1.6 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.149
 million inhabitants locating it between

 the most populous and prosperous cities 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.360
 of the country and turning it into a city 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.979
 expansion measures large boom 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.659
 of fiber construction looks 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.360
 reflected in the appearance of large 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:59.510
 local construction companies 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.059
 as foreign the architect pablo 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.369
 zegarra former director of the school of 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.380
 architects of Piura speaks to us about the 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.940
 Construction expansion 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.640
 real estate and adaptation of 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.920
 architects to this ship when the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.080
 government in the face of the need to deal with 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.140
 cover the housing deficit that had 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.260
 in the country at the national level 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.390
 launches the program mivivienda where 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.070
 changes the design regulations 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.200
 then the architects that of some 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.470
 way we were used to create 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.619
 spaces with certain areas we had 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.840
 to adapt to thinking about design 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.500
 70 80 departments 90 meters 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.600
 square and then we start to give ourselves 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.119
 mind that that allowed us to 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.860
 land we could take two homes 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.990
 per floor and if we understand that the cost of 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.770
 housing per floor becomes cheaper in the 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.100
 as we make a building we 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.920
 generates profits then because of that 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.229
 program following these rules is that 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.570
 begin to appear the multifamily 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.090
 the construction boom in Piura 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.459

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.170
 to the financial support of the banks in addition 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.680
 of private companies that 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.600
 diversify access to the dream house 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.790
 this construction boom is also 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.650
 is reflected in the increase in 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.079

 direct as is the cement as is the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.460
 iron and labor this 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.790
 movement of silo engineers broke it 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.000
 to the annexed that is the subject of notaries 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.710
 Municipalities issue gives us economy 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.800
 favorable to the entire region in 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.500
 stanzas good construction is one of 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.230
 the main points in the boom 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.380
 economic activity in the Piura region in Peru 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.020

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.030
 only one that has an economy 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.040
 decentralized we have this oil in 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.610
 talara we have agriculture in your bullseye 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.740
 we have in paita we have in the east of 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.630
 phosphate rock of sechura that is the 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.430
 economic growth is hard is great 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.370
 as a consequence 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.319
 in the construction that has been 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.299
 retained has for many years of 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.299
 growth and a lot of work for the 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.969
 care for growth in Piura and the 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.129
 demand for developments has grown in 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:48.439
 different socio-economic sectors of 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:52.180
 the region making the 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.180
 financing of houses and departments 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.530
 eduardo iparraguirre one of the pioneers 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.840
 in real estate in Piura with 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.969
 More than 30 years of experience we 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.829
 explains to which sectors the 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.500
 urban growth in our 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.669
 City in the city of Piura speaking 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.919
 how as a city is going to have a future 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:16.370
 extraordinary its growth I see it 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:17.840
 for the west sector its growth on 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.940
 growth of the stone city for 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.829
 back to the group for classes 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.169
 social strata after book for the 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.240
 social class headquarters is in the sector 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.000
 west another sector where it is growing 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.039
 figure of the northwest sector have their 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.670
 own water system and its own 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:37.780
 sewage system 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:40.090
 and that is a big future there are projects 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.980
 and there are people investors who are 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.830
 interested in buying neighboring land 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.470
 to this organization to continue the 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.480
 growth of piura would actually come 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.210
 to be a new piura not that is 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.430
 distant from the city two kilometers and 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.200
 half the projection of the point of the 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.900
 construction in piura has great 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.620
 impact on the population however 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.540
 still not in its real apogee is 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.640
 He expected in the coming years 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.220
 adequate interaction between the economy and 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.350
 the construction make a loop 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.020
 true construction boom 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:17.680
 I believe that this real estate boom that 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.830
 we are talking has in piura for 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.100
 many years to the extent that it 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.400
 generate planning policies that 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.150
 enable infrastructures 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.150
 services 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:38.100
 that somehow those who participate 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.430
 in this activity find spaces 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.500
 to be able to make the investments that 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.510
 they need or in other words 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.240
 this real estate world I think that in 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.210
 Piura still has not burst at all 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.910
 I think a good policy good 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.200
 municipal management can give much more 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.660
 still 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.910
 Piura is a city ​​with lots of 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.150
 terrain with industrial expanding roads 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.160
 and real estate the city is growing 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.920
 in population and the need for houses 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.740
 departments and urbanizations is in 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.200
 everybody's mouth making piura the place 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.710
 ideal to invest large companies 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.570
 national and foreign real estate 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.300
 bet on the future in the city 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.790
 predicting a great economic future for 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.740
 the citizen society I want 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.690
 thank this 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.699
 to this production in this program and 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:34.440
 now they build for this opportunity 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:37.979
 that gives me to be able to give some ideas 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.300
 some concepts of which we handle 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.430
 us the architects as 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.660
 planners as planners all 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.580
 we make citizens we all have 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.740
 responsibility we are all going to work 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:50.520
 so that this figure is a good 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:54.030
 offer for all let me finally 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.130
 congratulate and greet and wish you the best 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.930
 of the successes to the program of you 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.330
 I could build because it 's very 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.460
 necessary for us to know the 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.389
 reality of diversity let's meet 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.389
 thank you very much
