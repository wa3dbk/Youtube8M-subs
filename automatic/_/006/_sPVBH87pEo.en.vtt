example I have to curl my hair now at

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.410 
example I have to curl my hair now at
the<00:00:05.549> moment<00:00:05.790> because<00:00:05.850> it's<00:00:06.060> so<00:00:06.240> long<00:00:06.359> and

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
the moment because it's so long and

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.200 
the moment because it's so long and
straggly<00:00:06.990> but<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:08.160> just<00:00:08.370> helps<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.790> disguise

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
straggly but it just helps to disguise

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.780 
straggly but it just helps to disguise
the<00:00:09.510> fact<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:10.050> really<00:00:10.559> needed<00:00:10.590> shop<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.580> I

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
supposed to use the fabulous vintage

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.919 
supposed to use the fabulous vintage
gamma<00:00:27.449> wave<00:00:27.689> maker<00:00:28.279> because<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.640> nice

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
gamma wave maker because it's a nice

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.380 
gamma wave maker because it's a nice
narrow<00:00:31.160> barrel<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.489> with<00:00:32.669> smaller<00:00:32.969> barrels

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
narrow barrel and with smaller barrels

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.630 
narrow barrel and with smaller barrels
you<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:33.899> more<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> curl<00:00:34.640> without

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
you can get more of a curl without

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.819 
you can get more of a curl without
having<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.630> many<00:00:36.780> sections<00:00:37.469> or<00:00:37.680> bigger

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
having to do so many sections or bigger

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.110 
having to do so many sections or bigger
barrels<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.309> can<00:00:38.460> probably<00:00:38.700> use<00:00:38.820> smaller

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
barrels you can probably use smaller

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.760 
barrels you can probably use smaller
sections<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.750> wanted<00:00:40.020> nice<00:00:40.290> loose

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
sections but if you wanted nice loose

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.889 
sections but if you wanted nice loose
movement<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.399> your<00:00:41.550> hair<00:00:41.760> using<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.570> small

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
movement in your hair using a small

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.240 
movement in your hair using a small
barrel<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:43.950> really<00:00:44.129> really

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
barrel you can do it really really

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
barrel you can do it really really
quickly<00:00:44.610> by<00:00:44.850> writing<00:00:45.059> large<00:00:45.480> sections<00:00:46.140> which

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
quickly by writing large sections which

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.810 
quickly by writing large sections which
is<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.620> want<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.579> really

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
is what we want to do so it's really

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.439 
is what we want to do so it's really
really<00:00:48.180> easy<00:00:48.329> simple<00:00:49.289> sectioning<00:00:50.180> it's<00:00:51.180> just

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
really easy simple sectioning it's just

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.869 
really easy simple sectioning it's just
two<00:00:51.629> sections<00:00:52.170> basically<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> horizontal

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
two sections basically like a horizontal

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.130 
two sections basically like a horizontal
like<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.360> I'm<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.870> section

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
like this so I'm just going to section

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.330 
like this so I'm just going to section
up<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:56.100> top<00:00:56.309> half<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.710> tie<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:58.920> away<00:00:59.280> so

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
up the top half and just tie it away so

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.220 
up the top half and just tie it away so
I'm<00:00:59.640> sticking<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.359> band<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.660> clip<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> or

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
I'm sticking a band you can clip it or

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.310 
I'm sticking a band you can clip it or
do<00:01:01.379> whatever<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:01.980> rid<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.480> then

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
do whatever just get rid of it and then

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.490 
do whatever just get rid of it and then
I'm<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.129> working<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.549> these<00:01:05.960> two<00:01:06.960> bottom

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
I'm just working on these two bottom

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.109 
I'm just working on these two bottom
sections<00:01:08.189> oh<00:01:09.080> this<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.380> new<00:01:11.119> sugared

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
sections oh this is the new sugared

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.910 
sections oh this is the new sugared
almonds<00:01:12.570> tangle<00:01:12.930> teezer<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.470> pretty

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.940 

just<00:01:16.369> brush<00:01:16.610> through<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:18.259> section<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:18.860> you

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
just brush through the section so you

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.679 
just brush through the section so you
don't<00:01:19.100> have<00:01:19.189> any<00:01:19.250> tangles<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:20.210> because<00:01:20.540> we

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
don't have any tangles so because we

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.580 
don't have any tangles so because we
want<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.520> hair<00:01:22.520> to<00:01:22.549> take<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.630> curl<00:01:23.840> quite

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
want the hair to take the curl quite

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.170 
want the hair to take the curl quite
quickly<00:01:24.950> because<00:01:25.580> we<00:01:25.670> have<00:01:25.820> got<00:01:25.970> loads<00:01:26.119> of

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
quickly because we have got loads of

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.310 
quickly because we have got loads of
time<00:01:26.240> I'm<00:01:26.540> just<00:01:26.600> going<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.869> spray<00:01:27.080> through

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
time I'm just going to spray through

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:35.160 
time I'm just going to spray through
some<00:01:27.880> hairspray<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:33.440> just<00:01:33.710> give<00:01:33.860> it<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:33.979> quick

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
some hairspray and just give it a quick

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.740 
some hairspray and just give it a quick
brush<00:01:36.759> through<00:01:37.759> with<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.149> tangle<00:01:38.539> teezer

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
brush through with the tangle teezer

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.779 
brush through with the tangle teezer
just<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.229> make<00:01:39.380> sure<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.649> spray<00:01:39.950> spray<00:01:40.490> also

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
just to make sure the spray spray also

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.940 
just to make sure the spray spray also
helps<00:01:41.090> with<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.240> heat<00:01:41.450> protection<00:01:41.810> so<00:01:42.680> here

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
helps with the heat protection so here

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.270 
helps with the heat protection so here
we<00:01:43.009> go<00:01:43.039> just<00:01:43.399> taking<00:01:43.789> that<00:01:43.970> one<00:01:44.270> big<00:01:44.600> section

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
we go just taking that one big section

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.649 
we go just taking that one big section
get<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.369> up<00:01:46.399> as<00:01:46.580> high<00:01:46.729> as<00:01:46.759> you<00:01:46.970> can<00:01:47.030> on<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.509> the

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
get it up as high as you can on to the

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:54.249 
get it up as high as you can on to the
barrel<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:48.500> wrap<00:01:49.429> it<00:01:49.580> back<00:01:52.990> because<00:01:53.990> you're

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
barrel and wrap it back because you're

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.680 
barrel and wrap it back because you're
doing<00:01:54.500> in<00:01:54.649> one<00:01:54.830> big<00:01:55.009> section<00:01:55.520> just<00:01:56.509> let<00:01:56.600> the

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
doing in one big section just let the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.210 
doing in one big section just let the
hair<00:01:56.840> slide<00:01:57.110> off<00:01:57.259> into<00:01:57.470> your<00:01:57.500> hand<00:01:57.799> just<00:01:58.130> let
