00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.509
 hello good we're all going to explain in 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.230
 this video 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.170
 what is the logo and how is it played 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.600
 to start you have an extensive list of 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.580
 heroes each with his 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.080
 with its characteristic with its 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.970
 skills with its drawbacks 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.490
 but good after all are all 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.300
 good and some more fun than 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.300
 others for my taste 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.850
 good 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.620
 second mind that we have the spells 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.730
 that are like universal skills that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.559
 can have all the characters 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.040
 everyone can have the same use and 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.320
 choose any 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.460
 I want to use 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.750
 here we have the runes and masters 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.410
 the zones are objects that are bought 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.000
 to get advantage 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.000
 defense everything what one 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.800
 while releasing the pasta for good not 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.719
 matter you know 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.580
 a page of expertise page 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.040
 master's degrees are points of influence that 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.200
 more than you are accumulating as you go up 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.550
 levels in the account and you can go 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.880
 increasing what they give you like 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.430
 because you like a taste 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.659
 what do you like? 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:26.120
 well here you choose character 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.460
 now it seems that the game will start 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.210
 that yes is the downside of this game is that 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.880
 it takes 40 million hours to load 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.700
 you can spend hours 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.689
 what happens that I 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.689
 I preferred 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.729
 I preferred to do it with bots so 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.869
 do not have so many complications that I 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.600
 I destroyed no million in a video in 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.060
 youtube that not only interests me 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.710
 that who better than me already has already 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.900
 shattered in my look 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.010
 and well here we have the skills what 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.909
 first thing we have to do is 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.280
 to learn 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.190
 an ability that is the one that corresponds 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.680
 with our level 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.260
 next mind we have the store not 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.110
 can buy several objects where he puts 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.860
 what goes up 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:23.800
 the attack and here are park 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.180
 in recent attack movement armor 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.180
 away above 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.140
 and who starts playing I recommend 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.290
 than meet the recommended objects already 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.110
 with more or less go seeing already followed 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.930
 knowing that you have to catch 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.290
 well the objective of this game consists 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.450
 in with a few shots that 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.340
 they will come out here 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.340
 at minute 130 you said it's slow 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.010
 to destroy the towers and break through 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.880
 until the nexus of the enemy and destroy what 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.510
 who gets it that wins 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.510
 good 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.290
 obviously it is 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.930
 the objectives are those 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.090
 especially this game is strategic and 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.010
 you have to work as a team if you do not 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.890
 like to work in a team is not necessary 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.510
 nor that you play 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.140
 before you start , you can withdraw 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.140
 for the House 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.640
 good 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.610
 as you can see 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.560
 let's play a little bit so you have 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.560
 a little bit the idea of ​​how the game is 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.430
 to see that this goes slower 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.430
 it seems my grandmother is walking 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.420
 in front of 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.420
 p'alante strip 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.010
 you're going to die motherfucker 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.010
 when the stroke 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.440
 good people and up to here my video today 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.739
 I hope you liked it good to 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.739
 everyone
