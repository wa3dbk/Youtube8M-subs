00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.029
 extremely simple good I will you 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.890
 show how to change a candle on 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.330
 a bike it works for any 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.949
 motorbike 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.090
 it's going to be I'm going to do that on a 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.649
 125 a small single cylinder step by 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.260
 step 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.780
 so for this tutorial will need the clap 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.370
 y corresponding to the size of the candle 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.500
 here is an 18 a hammer a freelancer 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.680
 to adjust the spreads of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.680
 electrodes and of course a new candle 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.370
 first steps 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:06.299
 we will remove the old candles so we 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:09.409
 remove the cap and unscrew into the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.409
 counterclockwise 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.700
 you can clean the pit of candles 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:30.470
 before going out the candle room ultra 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:34.179
 who helped junk that falls with 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.179
 a blow of breath be for example 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.189
 tock 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:43.250
 this is the old candle that is your 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:48.860
 beautiful, by the way, it's not going to hurt him 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:58.640
 the change and the new here 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:02:03.259
 the old the new so then he 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.240
 must find what distance 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.520
 we have to put at the level of 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.720
 the electronics or candle there so 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.880
 that or it's an information you can 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.420
 find on the internet or on a 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.930
 technical review also of you take my 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:28.940
 girl here so on 725 cdu 8 mm so I 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:30.920
 take the corresponding freelance so the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.519
 freelance for this candle and for this 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:40.750
 motorcycle will be from the past we can see the 0 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:48.519
 8 mm so I slide it slide the freelancer 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.519
 here I slip it with a hammer 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:02.870
 I check that supports I return without 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:10.700
 difficulty and more is blocked then 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:13.030
 I live it moves even in his sweater 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.030
 the hand 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.070
 so here we end the raja with key without 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.290
 to force consonants resistance on 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.490
 stop me 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.380
 what the hell I can not go over 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:43.270
 far so I stop 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:47.350
 so then we look at whether we have a 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:50.310
 flat washer like here or a 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.310
 conical washer 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.780
 in the case of a flat washer we go 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.430
 finish the tightening with the method 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.570
 angular so we'll do a half turn 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.770
 key tightening and if you have a 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.140
 conical washer 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:13.000
 we're going to make a sixteenth rate 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:26.710
 gone so I believe a benchmark in 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:29.800
 space like that so here I do a 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:37.480
 quarter turn s more than a quarter 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:41.200
 turn to make a half-turn is used to 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:47.190
 nothing too tight then we have more 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.190
 to put the cap back on and that's it 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.750
