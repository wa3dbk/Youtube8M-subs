00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.199
 good brazil and mexico as we know the 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.650
 Two most important countries in America 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:21.130
 Latin both in population and in 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.110
 percentage of GDP in the most 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.849
 wealth generated at the level of america 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:32.220
 latina in and followed strategies 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:36.120
 economic more or less similar to 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.829
 late 80's early 90's 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.530
 just when all the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.469
 restructuring of the economy over 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.129
 all Latin American and the so-called 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:51.269
 Washington consensus that involved the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.000
 adjustment in the deficit of the states of 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.030
 the national accounts of the countries that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.839
 they were applied in privatization measures 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.760
 in both structural reforms and the 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.960
 impact of the crisis of the 80s was very 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.289
 strong for both countries however to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.289
 from the 90s in the context of 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:16.080
 the extension of the globalization of 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.130
 process of realization strategies 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.039
 from both countries money changing 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:26.530
 in the state took a different hue in 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:30.280
 each of them in the Mexican case 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.729
 as we know and applies since then 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.720
 strict adherence to the guidelines of 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.200
 financial organizations 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.600
 international organizations and what the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.569
 care in macroeconomic accounts or 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.049
 is not to leave the margin of deficit 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:50.470
 not not having vulnerability in the 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.170
 monetary policy and generally keep 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.920
 in the accounts the big accounts 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.929
 national and especially abroad 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.670
 controlled and with a level of 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:06.429
 inflation under a certain range and not a 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.530
 deficit spending what does this mean 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.750
 of deficit spending that the state does not 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.590
 they must intervene 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.260
 and productive projects that exceed the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.660
 level of private investment case 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.210
 Brazilian from the nineties on 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.300
 everything in the strategy is being 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.420
 different the state is strengthened in 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.850
 terms of a nation-state with a 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.270
 long - term vision that means 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.209
 the state should invest intervening not 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.400
 only the matter here is interesting 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.400
 because they managed to keep driving their 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.900
 macroeconomic accounts so by 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.709
 say something responsible but to peace 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:54.340
 allowed the incidence of the state 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:57.550
 certainly based on reforms of 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.310
 fiscal nature of many character 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.500
 companies were privatized 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.930
 but then sanitized and then returned to 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.400
 been this would be the the case, the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.489
 oil of the case of electricity 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.260
 but only for a certain 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.900
 moment 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.239
 and the funny thing here is that the state 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.069
 Separate from certain activities 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:23.280
 strategic but there is a business 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.260
 national who takes over the reins of 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.170
 investment 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.540
 despite good not to regret we know that 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.780
 Brazil has a strong component of 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.540
 foreign investment however to 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.159
 From the 90's we can see that at the same time 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.290
 that there is a very strong presence of 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:45.510
 transnational corporations there are also and 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.640
 broad and vigorous presence of companies 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.190
 Brazilians in all fields of the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.280
 economy and not only large groups 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.440
 but also from a policy of 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.659
 development of financing to 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.750
 development the national banking 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.930
 development the bndes is very active in 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.300
 promotion of credits for small and 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.120
 medium 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.810
 then we see that there is a from my point 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.260
 of view a heterodox development in the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.500
 Brazilian and orthodox case in the case 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.320
 Mexican that means orthodox that 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.500
 finally stay firmly in 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.750
 those policies that have to do 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.740
 with the belief that the market is going to 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.680
 solve everything and that the state nothing else 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.290
 must intervene in this stability and the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.050
 create stability and trust for 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.330
 that businessmen invest is is 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.060
 leaving from a point of view about 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.730
 all in the hands of the private initiative 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.390
 in Mexico the future of the country 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:54.390
 unfortunately before a 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.160
 a policy that had been different 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.160
 in mexico gmexico in mexico and in america 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.190
 latina 'and almost every country now 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.410
 called emergent and that have come out 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.950
 successfully without being developed have 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.040
 successfully emerged from the crisis on 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.220
 state has never stopped intervening 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.890
 productively and at the same time create the 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.860
 economic conditions and conditions 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.960
 of infrastructure and institutions that 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.720
 support the development 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.389
 I am going to emphasize here the importance 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.190
 of the industrial sector because because the 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.740
 industrial sector is the generator of the 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.009
 wealth what the tertiary sector does 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.509
 is the financial sector let's say and the 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.810
 trade is a way of 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.639
 intermediation and leverage for 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.180
 productive activities but if the 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:50.370
 productive sector that is the industry and 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:53.620
 the agribusiness or the whole 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.780
 part of the primary sector and let's say that 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.990
 all the primary sector that produces 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.389
 goods to strengthen others for 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.370
 provide other economic activities 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.169
 without 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.720
 if we neglect those two 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.500
 sectors although the sector grows a lot 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.360
 tertiary 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.630
 we are talking about a 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.030
 weak economy because because if not 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.039
 we produce our food if not 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.419
 we produce the necessary inputs the 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:20.889
 food then for the entire population 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.930
 and of course for the population 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.880
 worker and already find the areas 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.770
 well that's important you have to give 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.950
 to eat your workers well for 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.250
 that are productive too 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.530
 we neglect the production of food 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:38.070
 we neglect the production of inputs 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:41.220
 basic industries that will provide 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:44.800
 the industry then from the 80's 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:48.520
 especially the 90s and the 21st century 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.190
 we see that deterioration in everything that 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:56.229
 It would be the production chain in Mexico 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:57.190
 It weakens and they are imported like never before 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:59.360
 before 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.779
 goods that are produced 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.779
