they introduced a new feature on the
server<00:00:21.000> software<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.050> does<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> check<00:00:23.160> for

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
server software that it does a check for

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.089 
server software that it does a check for
all<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.730> plugins<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.740> installed

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
all the plugins that you have installed

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.529 
all the plugins that you have installed
to<00:00:26.250> make<00:00:26.369> sure<00:00:26.550> they're<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:26.939> stable<00:00:27.269> or

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
to make sure they're like stable or

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.570 
to make sure they're like stable or
whatever<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.310> going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.490> be

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
whatever so that so it's going to be

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.370 
whatever so that so it's going to be
more<00:00:29.849> difficult<00:00:30.060> than<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.390> copying<00:00:31.260> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
more difficult than just copying and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.479 
more difficult than just copying and
pasting<00:00:31.500> over<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> plugins<00:00:32.219> which<00:00:32.340> has

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
pasting over the plugins which has

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.950 
pasting over the plugins which has
worked<00:00:32.669> before<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.270> same<00:00:33.510> versions

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
worked before for the same versions

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.640 
servers will update i'll make a video
whenever<00:01:30.479> those<00:01:30.750> update<00:01:31.170> because<00:01:31.320> i<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
whenever those update because i have to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.560 
whenever those update because i have to
wait<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:31.829> all<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> plugins<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.299> update

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
wait for all of the plugins to update

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.080 
wait for all of the plugins to update
and<00:01:33.780> since<00:01:34.470> i<00:01:34.560> use<00:01:34.710> essentials<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.610> takes<00:01:35.939> some

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and since i use essentials it takes some

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.429 
and since i use essentials it takes some
forever<00:01:36.360> because<00:01:36.630> normally<00:01:37.049> they<00:01:37.200> only

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
forever because normally they only

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.310 
forever because normally they only
release<00:01:38.189> builds<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.240> recommended<00:01:39.990> builds

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
release builds for recommended builds

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.679
