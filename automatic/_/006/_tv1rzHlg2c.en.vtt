00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.460
 hello video by 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:10.530
 concrete mixer do it yourself 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.530
 gear on belts 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:23.260
 The principle of the framework will tell you what to start. 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:28.920
 from simple to complex diameter 45 years 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.920
 roughly 100 liters per nike 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.520
 intermediate shaft so massive 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:45.630
 complex them pump 26 and a half six can 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:51.310
 simpler will be this of improvised means 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:55.540
 pulley sense without generator with zelovskie 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:03.690
 compressor skiff ribbed belt 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:07.540
 even visible from the 155 number generator 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.750
 just throws a barrel on 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.750
 we'll see 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:16.490
 the motor will become a cat. 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:26.539
 brake disk 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:30.829
 wheel brake wheel bearing 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:36.390
 I donâ€™t remember exactly how I sleep 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:39.740
 fastened stay on something worth except 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.140
 so motor 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:50.409
 single phase industrial cold handles 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:53.409
 by the way from the industrial refrigerator 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.409
 hocus pocus 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.070
 about 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.070
 highlights 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.160
 In short, especially there is no evidence 3 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.739
 one and a half thousand turns by the way 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.550
 guess pen 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:23.480
 kilowatt no you can calculate it 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:26.650
 it was full 1 powerful enough 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.819
 2-capacitor motor 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.420
 I accidentally turned up 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:36.130
 nod to the washing machine number here 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.130
 you can even calculate subordinate 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:48.200
 so well 5 diameter 25 is steeper that is 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.390
 what is going to be collected is clear shaft 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.390
 any pump is sure there 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.390
 intermediate 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:06.069
 then the barrel turns over in two directions 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:19.890
 at 108 degrees from regulator 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:19.890
 pen if taken without a barrel 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:32.319
 It goes very hard to shoot and here on 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:42.799
 boiled these this just gathered today 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:44.030
 paint one very shoulder 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:49.180
 wrong already toltak 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:53.510
 if sadly pours in the center of gravity 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.480
 it turns out here is part of a barrel but he 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.569
 should somewhere around the belt 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:04.970
 be too long then this part 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:10.569
 It turned out here mentally tighten a lot 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:14.439
 scales here let's see it works 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.439
 a bit too much momentum 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:29.980
 thirty two revolutions per minute standard 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:33.510
 This 25 principle is normal not fast photo 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:37.900
 it is usually loaded on the contrary and skins 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:40.770
 so here the belt does not fly off point shuttlecock 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.770
 with any will not fly away 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.360
 that's how it all works 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.689
 in general, even 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.639
 Well, like the idea put the class 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.799
 thanks to all
