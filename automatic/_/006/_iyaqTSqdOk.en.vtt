00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
5 how strong as that so anyway I'll get

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.899 
5 how strong as that so anyway I'll get
that<00:02:00.219> off<00:02:00.850> on<00:02:01.149> upper<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:01.840> um<00:02:02.049> yeah<00:02:02.890> anyway<00:02:03.670> he

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
that off on upper so um yeah anyway he

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.209 
that off on upper so um yeah anyway he
asked<00:02:04.240> me<00:02:04.450> what<00:02:04.659> is<00:02:05.380> my<00:02:05.679> favorite<00:02:06.039> thing<00:02:06.159> about

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
asked me what is my favorite thing about

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.690 
asked me what is my favorite thing about
a<00:02:06.399> game<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.880> I<00:02:07.030> would<00:02:07.240> say<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:09.190> difficult<00:02:09.579> to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
a game and I would say it's difficult to

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.160 
a game and I would say it's difficult to
say<00:02:09.880> cuz<00:02:10.119> obviously<00:02:10.269> lots<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.840> games<00:02:11.019> are

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
say cuz obviously lots the games are

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.360 
say cuz obviously lots the games are
very<00:02:11.320> different<00:02:11.500> but<00:02:12.720> i<00:02:13.720> would<00:02:13.900> say<00:02:14.049> probably

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
very different but i would say probably

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.430 
very different but i would say probably
the<00:02:15.370> graphics<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.209> game<00:02:16.239> are<00:02:16.600> really

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
the graphics of the game are really

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.680 
the graphics of the game are really
quite<00:02:17.620> important<00:02:18.100> to

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
quite important to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:32.360 
quite important to
they<00:02:19.580> they<00:02:20.580> can<00:02:20.850> make<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:31.070> kindness<00:02:32.070> right

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
they they can make a kindness right

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.550 
they they can make a kindness right
there<00:02:32.550> Myron<00:02:33.060> good<00:02:33.210> deal<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.570> day<00:02:33.600> yeah<00:02:34.140> um

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
there Myron good deal of the day yeah um

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.430 
there Myron good deal of the day yeah um
yeah<00:02:35.450> graphics<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.600> think<00:02:36.870> could<00:02:37.020> probably<00:02:37.200> one

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
yeah graphics I think could probably one

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
yeah graphics I think could probably one
of<00:02:37.470> my<00:02:37.560> favorite<00:02:37.950> things<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.340> game

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
of my favorite things in the game

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.040 
of my favorite things in the game
because<00:02:38.610> they<00:02:38.880> are<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.510> know<00:02:39.630> they<00:02:39.840> can

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
because they are just you know they can

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.290 
because they are just you know they can
make<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.320> game<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.010> incredible<00:02:41.550> remember<00:02:41.880> first
