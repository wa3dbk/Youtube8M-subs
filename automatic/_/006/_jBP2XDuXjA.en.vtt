above that sits there and on top of
those<00:00:51.510> sits<00:00:51.719> your<00:00:51.960> patella<00:00:52.379> or<00:00:52.469> kneecap<00:00:52.769> so

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
those sits your patella or kneecap so

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.910 
those sits your patella or kneecap so
underneath<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> kneecap<00:00:55.320> through<00:00:55.589> here<00:00:55.829> is

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
underneath the kneecap through here is

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.799 
underneath the kneecap through here is
your<00:00:56.070> patellar<00:00:56.429> tendon<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> top<00:00:57.510> part

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
your patellar tendon in the top part

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.410 
your patellar tendon in the top part
through<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.440> your<00:00:58.620> quadricep<00:00:59.190> tendon<00:00:59.420> so

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
through here is your quadricep tendon so

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.180 
through here is your quadricep tendon so
finder<00:01:00.899> step<00:01:01.109> turn<00:01:01.320> kind<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.800> comes<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
finder step turn kind of comes and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.439 
finder step turn kind of comes and
narrows<00:01:02.640> down<00:01:02.670> at<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.089> becomes<00:01:03.390> your

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
narrows down at you becomes your

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
narrows down at you becomes your
quadricep<00:01:03.960> tendon<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.980> that's<00:01:05.220> where<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
quadricep tendon so that's where the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.980 
quadricep tendon so that's where the
area<00:01:05.909> we're<00:01:06.120> targeting<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.930> were

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
area we're targeting that's we were

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.920 
area we're targeting that's we were
having<00:01:07.260> problems<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:09.480> show<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.690> on<00:01:09.900> my

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
having problems so to show you on my

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.889 
having problems so to show you on my
knee<00:01:10.140> that's<00:01:11.070> kind<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:11.790> right<00:01:12.630> through

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
knee that's kind of like right through

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.060 
knee that's kind of like right through
this<00:01:13.049> area<00:01:13.280> where<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.399> can<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.700> problems<00:01:15.000> so

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
this area where you can have problems so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.399 
this area where you can have problems so
often<00:01:17.070> with<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.810> athletes<00:01:18.810> playing<00:01:19.020> sports

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
often with the athletes playing sports

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.230 
often with the athletes playing sports
where<00:01:19.710> you're<00:01:19.829> jumping<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.759> there's<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.000> quick

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
where you're jumping or there's a quick

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.260 
where you're jumping or there's a quick
movement<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:23.009> come<00:01:23.250> down<00:01:23.430> hard<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.000> that

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
movement and you come down hard on that

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.130 
movement and you come down hard on that
on<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.590> tendon<00:01:26.219> and<00:01:26.899> there's<00:01:27.899> a<00:01:27.960> lot<00:01:28.110> of

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
on that tendon and there's a lot of

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
on that tendon and there's a lot of
eccentric<00:01:28.560> force<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.280> through<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:29.670> you

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
eccentric force going through there you

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.480 
eccentric force going through there you
can<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.479> micro<00:01:31.350> tears<00:01:31.619> or<00:01:31.890> trauma<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.460> that

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
can have micro tears or trauma to that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.679 
can have micro tears or trauma to that
area<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:34.020> which<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.500> result<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:35.479> scarring<00:01:36.479> or

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
area and which can result in scarring or

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.850 
area and which can result in scarring or
thickening<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.289> it<00:01:37.380> doesn't<00:01:37.619> heal<00:01:37.829> properly

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
thickening if it doesn't heal properly

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770 
thickening if it doesn't heal properly
because<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> tissue<00:01:39.030> doesn't<00:01:39.299> lay<00:01:39.539> down

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
because if the tissue doesn't lay down

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.469 
because if the tissue doesn't lay down
properly<00:01:40.289> in<00:01:40.530> circulation<00:01:41.369> issues<00:01:41.850> which

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
properly in circulation issues which

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.039 
properly in circulation issues which
which<00:01:43.009> binds<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.549> area<00:01:45.049> possibly

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
which binds up that area possibly

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.350 
which binds up that area possibly
resulting<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.710> tendinitis<00:01:47.369> or<00:01:47.610> tendinosis

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
resulting in tendinitis or tendinosis

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.999 
resulting in tendinitis or tendinosis
some<00:01:48.810> degeneration<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.560> wear<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.829> tear<00:01:49.950> of

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
some degeneration or wear and tear of

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.719 
some degeneration or wear and tear of
that<00:01:50.130> candidate<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:52.259> breaking<00:01:53.009> down<00:01:53.250> those

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
that candidate so breaking down those

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.719 
that candidate so breaking down those
adhesions<00:01:53.969> is<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.950> important<00:01:55.950> thing<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.700> terms

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
adhesions is a important thing in terms

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.880 
adhesions is a important thing in terms
of<00:01:57.060> freeing<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.990> tissue<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.320> promoting

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
of freeing up that tissue and promoting

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.490 
of freeing up that tissue and promoting
circulation<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.850> area<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.960> when

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
circulation in that area so you can when

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.139 
circulation in that area so you can when
you<00:02:01.590> bend<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.039> or<00:02:02.219> when<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.430> contract<00:02:03.000> that

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
