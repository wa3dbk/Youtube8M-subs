o'clock<00:01:20.640> when<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.570> huge<00:01:21.840> so

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
o'clock when you have not that huge so

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.899 
o'clock when you have not that huge so

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
if you're Manchester Michael is probably

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.789 
if you're Manchester Michael is probably
just<00:01:24.090> keeping<00:01:24.509> flash<00:01:24.780> steady<00:01:25.200> at<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.530> point

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799

for<00:01:26.070> now<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.340> think<00:01:26.369> workers<00:01:26.850> are<00:01:27.000> indeed

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
for now and I think workers are indeed

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
