basically<00:02:46.730> he<00:02:46.849> can<00:02:47.030> hold<00:02:47.269> two<00:02:48.370> beam<00:02:49.370> sabers

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
basically he can hold two beam sabers

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.170 
basically he can hold two beam sabers
and<00:02:50.090> that's<00:02:50.930> about<00:02:51.079> it<00:02:51.200> besides<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.940> bits

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
and that's about it besides the the bits

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.110 
and that's about it besides the the bits
that<00:02:53.299> he<00:02:53.510> has<00:02:53.720> on<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.109> bottom<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.620> his<00:02:55.120> funnel

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
that he has on the bottom of his funnel

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.899 
that he has on the bottom of his funnel
case<00:02:56.870> or<00:02:57.079> whatever<00:02:57.319> you<00:02:57.379> want<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.560> call<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.909> so

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
case or whatever you want to call it so

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.720 
case or whatever you want to call it so
this<00:02:59.359> is<00:02:59.510> what<00:02:59.659> it<00:02:59.750> looks<00:02:59.900> like<00:03:00.049> now<00:03:00.579> it's<00:03:01.579> my

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730

see I would if you are someone who kind
of<00:03:17.090> likes<00:03:17.329> the<00:03:17.569> shiny<00:03:18.609> because<00:03:19.609> it<00:03:19.819> certainly

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
of likes the shiny because it certainly

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.939 
of likes the shiny because it certainly
is<00:03:20.329> shiny<00:03:21.190> but<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.970> does<00:03:23.180> have<00:03:23.389> its<00:03:23.540> problems

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949 
is shiny but it does have its problems

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:27.789 
is shiny but it does have its problems
and<00:03:24.949> it's<00:03:25.159> it's<00:03:25.489> because<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.359> the<00:03:26.449> extra<00:03:26.959> pearl

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
and it's it's because of the extra pearl

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.939 
and it's it's because of the extra pearl
shiny<00:03:28.190> finish<00:03:28.519> especially<00:03:29.150> on<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.019> metallic

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
shiny finish especially on the metallic

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.490 
shiny finish especially on the metallic
pink<00:03:31.449> points<00:03:32.449> now<00:03:33.049> I<00:03:33.079> don't<00:03:33.230> have<00:03:33.440> a

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
pink points now I don't have a

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.229 
pink points now I don't have a
high-definition<00:03:34.040> camera<00:03:34.699> so<00:03:34.879> it's<00:03:35.030> going<00:03:35.180> to

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
high-definition camera so it's going to

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.640 
high-definition camera so it's going to
be<00:03:35.329> really<00:03:35.510> hard<00:03:35.810> for<00:03:35.840> me<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.139> point<00:03:36.319> the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
be really hard for me to point the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.780 
be really hard for me to point the
problems<00:03:37.040> out<00:03:37.510> but<00:03:38.510> basically<00:03:39.459> if<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:40.639> could

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
problems out but basically if you could

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.659 
problems out but basically if you could
imagine<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.599> know<00:03:41.720> cutting<00:03:42.099> your<00:03:43.099> pieces<00:03:43.370> off

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
imagine you know cutting your pieces off

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.460 
imagine you know cutting your pieces off
of<00:03:43.699> the<00:03:44.000> tree<00:03:44.269> or<00:03:44.479> the<00:03:44.510> runner<00:03:44.810> or<00:03:45.049> any<00:03:45.229> want<00:03:45.409> to

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
of the tree or the runner or any want to

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.099 
of the tree or the runner or any want to
call<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:46.239> where<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.329> screws<00:03:47.659> meet<00:03:47.930> the

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
call it and where the screws meet the

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.369 
call it and where the screws meet the
object<00:03:49.690> there's<00:03:50.690> kind<00:03:50.989> of<00:03:51.019> a<00:03:51.139> plastic

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
object there's kind of a plastic

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.920 
object there's kind of a plastic
distortion<00:03:52.159> right<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.579> you<00:03:53.359> know<00:03:53.479> you<00:03:53.510> file

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
distortion right and you know you file

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.050 
distortion right and you know you file
it<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.409> sand<00:03:54.709> it<00:03:54.889> and<00:03:55.040> it<00:03:55.310> looks<00:03:55.549> really<00:03:55.669> nice

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
it you sand it and it looks really nice

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.899 
it you sand it and it looks really nice
well<00:03:56.989> because<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:58.629> this<00:03:59.629> metallic<00:04:00.169> paint<00:04:00.909> it

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
well because of this metallic paint it

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.289 
well because of this metallic paint it
actually<00:04:02.680> looks<00:04:03.680> really<00:04:03.799> horrible<00:04:04.729> because

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
actually looks really horrible because

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.860 
actually looks really horrible because
the<00:04:05.930> underlying<00:04:07.269> plastic<00:04:08.269> surface<00:04:08.629> is<00:04:08.840> a

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
the underlying plastic surface is a

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.979 
the underlying plastic surface is a
different<00:04:09.260> color<00:04:09.379> kind<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.799> a<00:04:09.859> gray<00:04:10.699> and<00:04:11.030> then

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
different color kind of a gray and then

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.420 
different color kind of a gray and then
there's<00:04:12.229> the<00:04:12.349> metallic<00:04:12.769> pink<00:04:13.010> so<00:04:13.250> wherever

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
there's the metallic pink so wherever

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.969 
there's the metallic pink so wherever
you<00:04:13.549> cut<00:04:13.849> it<00:04:13.940> off<00:04:14.090> you'll<00:04:14.780> have<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.260> gray

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:15.979 
you cut it off you'll have the gray

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:20.879 
you cut it off you'll have the gray
points<00:04:16.519> now<00:04:17.510> if<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:18.409> can<00:04:18.620> get<00:04:18.769> as<00:04:18.950> close<00:04:19.130> I<00:04:19.400> can

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
points now if I can get as close I can

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.809 
points now if I can get as close I can
if<00:04:21.889> you<00:04:22.069> see<00:04:22.250> right<00:04:22.520> there<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.270> right<00:04:23.500> there

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:24.819 
if you see right there and right there

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:27.820 
if you see right there and right there
it<00:04:25.819> actually<00:04:25.970> looks<00:04:26.330> like<00:04:26.449> a<00:04:26.509> gray<00:04:26.900> spot<00:04:27.410> and

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
it actually looks like a gray spot and

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.460 
it actually looks like a gray spot and
that's<00:04:28.550> because<00:04:28.819> it<00:04:29.150> is<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.360> gray<00:04:29.720> spot<00:04:30.139> that's

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
that's because it is a gray spot that's

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.159 
that's because it is a gray spot that's
where<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.460> two<00:04:31.699> separate<00:04:32.389> pieces<00:04:32.659> of<00:04:33.050> the

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
where the two separate pieces of the

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.249 
where the two separate pieces of the
heel<00:04:33.470> was<00:04:34.190> chopped<00:04:34.550> off<00:04:34.759> and<00:04:35.479> then<00:04:35.900> you<00:04:36.020> ended

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
heel was chopped off and then you ended

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.399 
heel was chopped off and then you ended
up<00:04:36.409> getting<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.009> two<00:04:37.479> runner<00:04:38.479> points<00:04:38.960> with<00:04:39.169> no

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
up getting the two runner points with no

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.700 
up getting the two runner points with no
paint<00:04:40.060> you're<00:04:41.060> going<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.300> have<00:04:41.509> to<00:04:41.750> somehow

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
paint you're going to have to somehow

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.999 
paint you're going to have to somehow
paint<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.639> now<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.030> don't<00:04:44.389> have<00:04:44.690> high<00:04:45.560> metallic

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
paint it now I don't have high metallic

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.719 
paint it now I don't have high metallic
silver<00:04:46.520> paint<00:04:47.620> that's<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.770> problem<00:04:49.009> if<00:04:49.370> you're

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
silver paint that's a problem if you're

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.820 
silver paint that's a problem if you're
a<00:04:49.759> perfectionist<00:04:50.090> this<00:04:50.990> would<00:04:51.199> really<00:04:51.379> bug

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
a perfectionist this would really bug

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.870 
a perfectionist this would really bug
you<00:04:52.539> the<00:04:53.539> same<00:04:53.780> problem<00:04:54.050> goes<00:04:54.500> for<00:04:55.039> the

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
you the same problem goes for the

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.469 
you the same problem goes for the
cockpit<00:04:56.690> area<00:04:58.060> that's<00:04:59.060> where<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.419> was

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
cockpit area that's where it was

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.350 
cockpit area that's where it was
attached<00:04:59.840> to<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.550> runner<00:05:01.550> of<00:05:01.759> the<00:05:01.789> tree<00:05:02.120> and

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
attached to the runner of the tree and

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.809 
attached to the runner of the tree and
now<00:05:02.990> there's<00:05:03.319> a<00:05:03.380> man<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:04.250> probably<00:05:04.520> can't<00:05:04.729> see

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
now there's a man you probably can't see

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.879 
now there's a man you probably can't see
very<00:05:04.940> well<00:05:05.240> but<00:05:05.539> there's<00:05:05.750> a<00:05:05.810> there's<00:05:06.259> a<00:05:06.349> gray

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
very well but there's a there's a gray

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.860 
very well but there's a there's a gray
spot<00:05:07.400> right<00:05:07.639> there<00:05:07.669> it<00:05:08.030> just<00:05:08.150> looks<00:05:08.509> really

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
spot right there it just looks really

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.420 
spot right there it just looks really
bad<00:05:09.169> looks<00:05:09.409> like<00:05:09.560> someone<00:05:09.830> took<00:05:09.949> a<00:05:10.069> gray

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
bad looks like someone took a gray

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.330 
bad looks like someone took a gray
marker<00:05:10.849> and<00:05:11.030> just<00:05:11.349> you<00:05:12.349> know<00:05:12.440> put<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:13.009> right<00:05:13.159> on

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
marker and just you know put it right on

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.370 
marker and just you know put it right on
there<00:05:13.520> this<00:05:14.419> obviously<00:05:14.599> doesn't<00:05:15.110> have<00:05:15.229> any

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
there this obviously doesn't have any

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.950 
there this obviously doesn't have any
panel<00:05:15.710> lines<00:05:16.120> I'm<00:05:17.120> thinking<00:05:17.479> if<00:05:17.599> I<00:05:17.719> want<00:05:17.870> to

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
panel lines I'm thinking if I want to

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.959 
panel lines I'm thinking if I want to
pan<00:05:18.139> align<00:05:18.349> it<00:05:18.469> or<00:05:18.590> not<00:05:18.800> but<00:05:19.129> i<00:05:19.430> just<00:05:19.699> wanted<00:05:19.909> to

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 
pan align it or not but i just wanted to

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.600 
pan align it or not but i just wanted to
show<00:05:20.150> you<00:05:20.180> what<00:05:20.360> it<00:05:20.449> looked<00:05:20.599> like<00:05:20.659> and<00:05:21.370> yeah<00:05:22.370> i

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
show you what it looked like and yeah i

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.270 
show you what it looked like and yeah i
would<00:05:22.909> recommend<00:05:23.330> it<00:05:23.449> because<00:05:23.539> it's<00:05:23.870> cuba<00:05:24.110> day

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
would recommend it because it's cuba day

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.209 
would recommend it because it's cuba day
and<00:05:25.280> it<00:05:26.030> looks<00:05:26.240> really<00:05:26.479> shiny<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:27.349> cool<00:05:27.590> but

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:28.219 
and it looks really shiny and cool but

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:29.589 
and it looks really shiny and cool but
if<00:05:28.400> you're<00:05:28.580> a<00:05:28.610> person<00:05:29.180> who<00:05:29.479> is<00:05:29.539> a

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
try to fix the problems that it creates

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.309 
try to fix the problems that it creates
because<00:05:35.870> of<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:36.229> actual<00:05:36.770> pearl<00:05:37.069> surface<00:05:38.319> the

because of the actual pearl surface the

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.860 
because of the actual pearl surface the
problems<00:05:39.800> would<00:05:40.039> be<00:05:40.210> you<00:05:41.210> know<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.690> actual
