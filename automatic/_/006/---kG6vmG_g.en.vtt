00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.160
 well let's show them how to draw 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 sleeve 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.880
 Japanese style 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.890
 first we need 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.890
 and more than anything when we know nothing 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:24.490
 we need a grid sheet for 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:28.150
 know exactly how how do 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.539
 instead of doing this a little circle like that a 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.320
 circle 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.340
 the note highlights the nose is not the most 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.810
 simple on a grid sheet we are going to 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.870
 to draw 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:46.690
 like a small house 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.460
 it's not your little one and this longer 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.410
 that's going to be first let's start 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.510
 by the eye 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.629
 we make a circle 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.420
 and we already have an eye because to start in 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:04.170
 an eye because I learned to draw 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.170
 single 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.770
 drawing thus this poster commenting 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.830
 It served by the part I like going to 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.690
 get to the eyes 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.390
 now that we have an eye 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.390
 we see that it falls 1 2 3 4 5 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:29.390
 if we make a separation 1 2 3 4 5 and it's 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.390
 as if we calculate 1 2 3 4 5 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.840
 all right 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.570
 to make it exact for a face 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.570
 as we want and copy the same 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:52.690
 Now let's put a few ways 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.170
 to give it depth now we start 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.170
 with the eyebrows 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.920
 and an eyebrow here 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.370
 now after making the eyes what 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.360
 we have to do 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.360
 immediately 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.910
 in the nose 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.750
 we put anyone in the middle 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.920
 and then we make the face 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.820
 You do not have to be perfect until 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.530
 until good is a draft more than anything 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.069
 do not even move on tip or if not 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.319
 finished in a circle 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:39.790
 and we already have a face and a mouth 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.650
 and ears usually the ears in 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.709
 line and then I put it this 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.500
 in the circle and to give it greater 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.980
 this 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.870
 the greater contrast to the drawing we put some 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.849
 how many lines 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.849
 It's the simplest thing you can do 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.150
 and after this we do the neck 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.670
 and it is already 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.670
 to me 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.560
 I already have practices, that's why 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.560
 practices to the teacher 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.260
 as you will see this is a face almost almost 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.690
 almost perfect indeed the ball no more 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.870
 but more or less in the how-to guide 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.030
 it makes a perfect rose 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.690
 when you already know how to do 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.980
 let's say keep the proportions already 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.030
 they can do is a sheet like that 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.980
 blank but as they still do not know 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.340
 you just have to practice in a 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.340
 squared sheet 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.000
 and that's like making a face 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.610
 in front after teaching is that 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.640
 Well, if I'm going to show you everything 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.049
 he learned until the human body because 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.049
 all in bases of proportions 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.100
 you liked this, it's just a 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.100
 introductory 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.630
 the my manga classes 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.340
 I can teach what the 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.260
 proportion of doing this 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.540
 of what is here and what is here 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.320
 so that it's not because if it's a girl and 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.890
 is a male Maria rod of this 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.890
 already 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.380
 that is all
