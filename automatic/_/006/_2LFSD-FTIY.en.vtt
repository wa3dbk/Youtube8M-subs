00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.809
 hello girls today will teach you how to do 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:17.160
 nail decorated with chess first thing 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.760
 is to pass some basic nude nail polish 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.699
 I chose faith in the daughter and after drying 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.019
 with white enamel not wholly white 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.640
 It can be an income, it's just for the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.309
 stay a little clearer to give a 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.880
 illuminated then you will pass from a 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.899
 from the beginning of the cuticle to the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.129
 down 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.890
 there is a little thick tap that is after 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.910
 We'll do it with black and then we'll do it too. 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.100
 on the top you also cross the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.440
 nail of the same thickness 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.780
 after that with red enamel you 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.649
 will make a fine stroke 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.579
 on the opposite side of the white one you made 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.449
 from the top and then on the side also 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.449
 on the opposite side 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.490
 and if you will do well fine okay more 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.490
 thin than white 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.950
 now with black enamel you go 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:29.550
 get around the white then you will do 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.550
 on one side and then the other 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.840
 so that's why the white has to 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.120
 be thick because we will also 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.120
 make one more risquinho in the middle 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:50.450
 after that it will do the same thing the 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:56.020
 three strokes on the other white part then 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.020
 there are two in the round and one in the middle 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:17.380
 It's good to have a fine brush, people. 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:19.930
 to be able to make the stroke is fine and there 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.819
 to finish pass some basis for 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.890
 up to give a brightness 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.780
 so this is it girls I hope you guys 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.170
 have enjoyed a kiss and until the next 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.170
 champions
