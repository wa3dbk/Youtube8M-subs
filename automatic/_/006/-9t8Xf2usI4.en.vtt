00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:04.520
 this machine the ideas go from the government we are starting to nobody 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.260
 my name because it embodies the I turn crazy and this as it is done in this material in 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.170
 where he conceives it to be happiest until today defunct measures for 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.029
 use it are also other tissues efe 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.119
 I tell you what I'm going to do 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.320
 every time it just happened to see the buttons 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.980
 you have to design the buttons to learn a bag to have a bag 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.810
 coat 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.079
 I put these same accounts for 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.770
 ted kaufman analyst of a bag that can be quietly the parts of 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.120
 giant in which we are seeing christian this fuchsia bag 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.629
 inditex sacred account 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.289
 the model that is pretty much a rectangle phase that is 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.790
 simple and how are more women who like to go alive 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.370
 if it is so simple we can make one of each color one of each color making 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.330
 focus on the hat with the scarf with the mittens just glove said good this is 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.020
 in infinity of this equipment and it is what can arise to us and yes 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.840
 It is also an important fact that you are very little material supposedly because 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.260
 It helps us save, it ensures that apart from the little we sometimes have 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.050
 a delay of the moon a very small vision of wool 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.280
 it's not just for an accessory, we're going to be very attentive 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.440
 friends from home also because the most important total outlay so easy 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.480
 easy easy will bring discount efe 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.440
 a woven piece is expected why we're going to start doing it directly 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.539
 on our work table let's start 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.340
 from the zero point 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.710
 and I want to tell you 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.900
 for example, for this one, from the beginning, it has a very strong principle 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.540
 how the points are placed 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.810
 this has prevented we got enough percent 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.499
 caracas history to each family that a custom on how to place the points 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.499
 I will tell you in this case which is mine 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.730
 than with the thread 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.990
 took the end of the stage towards my left hand a little dependence on the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.990
 long depends on the number of points that need to be placed 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.940
 I make a turn 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.550
 with my left hand 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.810
 passed the needle so that it is that turn plus a thread with which 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.150
 I make a point 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.120
 that is all 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.579
 i shot 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.599
 bean that it's the same again 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.280
 passola abuja on the interior yew the dots 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.129
 i quirÃ³n 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.559
 these 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:28.529
 these are not going to tell me that this is difficult today we start from scratch 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.639
 it is more if there are people who know the placement of points in another way 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.389
 I said this is 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.810
 ancestral each family 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.300
 I have seen more than five 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.139
 different ways of placing the points are the son of this one because 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.469
 because percent is a way that offers me 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.409
 here underneath a quite important subjection for what is the point that 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.029
 he has not gotten involved 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:52.919
 all right 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.529
 the first main subject or the very first subject that the one of the placement 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.939
 let's see what is the point that we are going to grow 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:05.199
 in this case all the laps all the same and we do not even have points of 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.020
 revision 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.859
 we have a point down 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.469
 which is the first 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.929
 the whole round equal score down pointed down 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:18.239
 I tell you this because today for this portfolio 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.299
 that he the material he's made with does not measure 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.719
 percent does not lie it prevents it from just making a point a lot more 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.029
 Elaborated 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:30.659
 Of course the artist also wants to look like he wants to be a 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.429
 offense about 8 2 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:36.599
 a hundred a few more percent designs and completed you can also do it by 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.679
 borrowed 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:41.069
 we are inviting those who never wove to see that this 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.079
 it was worth it because it is a clue of these little ones that can already be done for sale 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.239
 I impose and short 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.660
 milk let's start turning the other way around for this case all the points towards 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.119
 above but I repeat choose the point that you like point up 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.409
 point up 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.179
 next to that auction from start to finish 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:01.199
 until now 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.199
 the row in the same way 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.669
 let's put here on the table 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:09.979
 this is 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:14.889
 it's more pony nils I bring you a pattern because today you are going to choose the 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.959
 amount of points depends on the size of having material 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.549
 the amount of points as 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.599
 fits better so you can see it 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.279
 because what happened is just curled up because it's a point that we 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:30.349
 lack is what we are always trying to avoid when it is a garment that does not 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.719
 be the posture in this case yes it goes but see 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:36.699
 what that tragedy in one piece for a hundred a second piece 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:39.810
 shows are always going to grow 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.820
 the measure they need 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.720
 In this case, I did it so that Europe could surpass the camera 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.550
 more short 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.910
 what they are going to do / fold the piece in half 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:52.139
 in this case 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:53.439
 in this way 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.529
 and they are going to be a posture 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:00.219
 years ago percent does something on the side feet and 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:04.039
 trying to take care that the top is free to give us a 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.969
 opening of the bag that we do not tell you why we need band 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:09.069
 our pocket 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.849
 I think it's going to be with sewing on both sides and we'll be left 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.229
 in this case 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.860
 pisaca if with this determined we have almost no more to say 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.060
 in this case it's a parsley the smallest piece 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.249
 with seam on the sides 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.150
 concerned 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.620
 yes we do not continue until the accounts that they taught us make balls and pulled and 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.189
 america I offer you 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:34.900
 get this kind of demonstrations 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.180
 in the houses where the shoes or bags are that type 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.949
 of saying things you get 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:47.289
 you can choose in this tone if you have some material a more justified wool 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.639
 you can choose this other tone see what is more copaco 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.190
 this is a simple idea is that they are extracted 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.509
 I hope you take advantage of a simple set rectangle end 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.650
 just a handle a couple of peanut peanuts need to buy 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.370
 and see how nice they are 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.619
 this purse wallet 

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:10.990
 to choose the color we need the size we need 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.629
 percent the style we're going to define this allows us to create 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:16.650
 lehane questions 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.470
 and always please make this extravagant the next thing that we 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.339
 identify once this topic since the scientist will feel very 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:27.139
 very very satisfied unesco pays such was his son
