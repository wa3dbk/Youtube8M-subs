00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.619
 golden of education is in the third 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.850
 childhood this means between the 5 and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.469
 11 years to 11 years almost 80% of 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.050
 the values ​​of the virtues of the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.909
 habits children learn then it is 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.000
 important that parents know of 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:43.800
 this because sometimes we do not realize 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.710
 and how children are small the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.699
 problems are small we do not put 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.019
 intentionality in education we 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.610
 we let the time come to the 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.580
 adolescence and just as parents we 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.860
 we wake up and we say that it has happened 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.110
 because I have this problem with me that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.970
 it was very good because we did not 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.920
 educated when we had to educate them 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.689
 that are early ages especially 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.670
 the family orientation that is what 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:08.060
 we dedicate ourselves is preventive 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.150
 try to get parents to prepare 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.110
 in advance for the stages that are going 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.110
 to live our children 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.630
 bullying is something that if I continue 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.980
 always suffers both the victim and the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.260
 aggressor 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.570
 the aggressor often has problems 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.570
 of a very low self-esteem 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.430
 they are not usually academically very good 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.380
 then a way to call the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.600
 attention is going to be the weakest or 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.140
 there are some features in both the aggressor and 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.810
 In attacked the assaulted person is usually a 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.460
 shy person who does not have a good 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.649
 communication with their parents as they are 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.530
 timid the problem by which 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.890
 survived they keep it and it's from some 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.890
 moment 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.120
 and it's not about the school having 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.800
 a child who does bullying say you 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.230
 sure and he left school not because 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.880
 it's a family, it 's back, it 's a child 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.830
 is behind that is not a bad adult 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.510
 trained and there is a young man with children in 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.910
 training process and you need 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.560
 help is not about taking the problem and 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.780
 to go back to another school to another site 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.760
 but the school with responsibility 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.550
 with your family you have to have a plan 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.800
 to help then in that plan have 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.570
 that see the trust father of children not 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.490
 you have to go to the root of the problem if you do not 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.620
 dedicate time to the kids to create 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.080
 spaces of family communication in the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.580
 nights after dinner then one 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.350
 You can know what the boys have 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.540
 inside but if that dad and mom 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.890
 we work let's say tired of the house 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.870
 we learn television and even the other 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.350
 day passes the time we do not know 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.350
 our old 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.420
 and 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.210
 first is communication but they have 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.280
 that spouses need time to know that 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.040
 it's a new relationship but I have to 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.320
 put aside my friends singles and 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.620
 I no longer think not the you and the self 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.360
 begins to see us one with one to 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.790
 yes they are the essential features of 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.400
 machismo because now we talk about more and 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.800
 good any things require the root 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.800
 to marriage as even natural 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.060
 to see the best of what flaws 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.040
 we have all we will die with effects 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.010
 you do not have to see that the other one has 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.480
 good things value the good if all 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.210
 in these things 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.710
 believe me you can theory or that 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.000
 promise that there is a day of treatment of the 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.000
 life if you can deny
