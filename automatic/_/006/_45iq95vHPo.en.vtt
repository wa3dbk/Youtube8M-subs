00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:08.970
 hi people we all know that laptops 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.259
 tend to overheat here 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:16.080
 when you put the laptop on your feet 9 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.000
 this on the subway at the stop at the airport is not 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.779
 it is important on some kind of a shop that you 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.430
 feel the laptop warm up 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.560
 how to deal with it actually is 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.810
 very simple way there is such 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.869
 program it is called you now 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.649
 will show 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:37.739
 briefing mean with m with funk control with 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.739
 english m s russian m m fan 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.090
 control means a very handy thing on 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.010
 in fact here you can set 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.050
 Fahrenheit in Celsius 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.570
 then the tray shows us the temperature 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.449
 in Celsius today and quantity 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.410
 your fan speed is easier 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.320
 let's say in 35 years 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.989
 change the fan is probably cheaper 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.820
 rotate the processor or output board 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.619
 both which will have failed in 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.590
 laptop for this, we opened the preference 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.229
 increase the speed to that temperature 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.200
 which you like for example you saw 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.270
 on radio watched a clip there in u-tube like 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.009
 on the laptop on the back side put 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.990
 there is some kind of foil or film and fries 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.100
 scrambled eggs actually heat up 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.509
 laptops sometimes up to 90 degrees there 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.729
 Well, we can assume that very quickly 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.860
 may go out there for a few years 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.430
 and build some detail to happen 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.869
 some kind of unsoldering stretching of some kind 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.100
 things or squeezing i mean they can 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.310
 just fail 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.049
 bring out the laptop for this at the same time 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.200
 it is desirable at the same time that 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.280
 the team arrived almost identical 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.280
 make safe 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.659
 I hope you hear that there is a fan 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.470
 earned a louder show again 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.470
 preference 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.210
 increase fan speed 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.210
 save 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.209
 heard yes that is the fan works 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.400
 just more powerful 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:21.970
 here today 38 degrees Celsius 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:26.140
 shows the thermometer built in like 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:29.019
 this program is very easy 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.640
 the program is absolutely free does not require 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.879
 no payment licenses 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.080
 introducing purchase password keys and 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:41.640
 Otherwise recommend with fan control decides 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:46.420
 all problems eliminates heard yes 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.340
 the fan started to work quieter when 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.769
 magnification we had 36 degrees 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.870
 Celsius now this assuming will be 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:58.620
 area 45 it just rises 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.620
 all the people while cooling laptops
