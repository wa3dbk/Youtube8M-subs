00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello dear sports fans with 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.990
 again you i dmitry x-fit and today i 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.750
 I want to continue the exercise with you 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.980
 at home and today show you how to rock 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:18.210
 at home hands or rather triceps us today 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.949
 you will need a dumbbell best 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.560
 to be collapsible to her 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.330
 there was a weight of 5 there and up to 20 kilograms and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.189
 above 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.720
 so you can swing big hands in 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.869
 home conditions without resorting to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.369
 the gym what exercise will be 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.430
 exercises are called as many already 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.280
 know the french dumbbell press with 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.379
 one dumbbell and I'll tell you how to 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.489
 technically how to technically do 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.980
 right and 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.640
 what angles can you do 30 to 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.000
 you had more triceps and the load was 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.160
 on not meet on middle path on 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.020
 the middle part and the top of the triceps so you 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.859
 Got a full load of us all 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.350
 triceps first exercise can be said 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:09.630
 come near the angle it is horizontal you 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:11.040
 must lie down take a dumbbell bring elbow 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.869
 to you 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.340
 if you lay down horizontally to have you 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.229
 and the logot looked exactly up without 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.630
 no fluctuations here 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.810
 will only guys move forearm 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.810
 all took in such a way as a hammer and 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.759
 raise is the easiest way to do 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.229
 This exercise elbow should not 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:40.320
 walk just walks get drunk all slowly 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.759
 raised in the corners elbow no need it 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.909
 to load you have been constantly 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.710
 denies to be straight when straightening the arm 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.610
 you have a little load can get away with 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.060
 triceps and it's traumatic you should 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.829
 be tension once lowered to 90 angle 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.149
 degrees no longer do you need to allow 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:03.140
 he understand lowered raised on triceps 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.820
 should always be always hard as 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.950
 increase the load on the triceps 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.099
 the best way i am basically so always 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.050
 make traction to the bottom you saw already a movie i 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.560
 showed you so 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.010
 make a brush you need to turn and headquarters 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.260
 palm pool looked you up face here 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.870
 same thing keep everything just along already 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.720
 there is the most important thing not to drop on face 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:32.040
 it is this shell 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.690
 once raised lowered lowered lowered 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.240
 here it is even harder for you 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.640
 hard if you're afraid of dropping 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.610
 support dumbbell support hand 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.720
 like that so she attacked you or even 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.660
 would protect your face lifted lowered 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.610
 lifted lowered loading children 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.710
 almost doubled 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.320
 Now I did this way not 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.930
 easy to do and when turned so brush 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.150
 it became much harder for me why 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.110
 because guys when you turn the brush 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.540
 you basically suck you 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.160
 becoming shoulders doesn't even help you not 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.200
 helps shoulder triceps 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.450
 and when you turn so here brush 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.390
 Your forearm helps you see how much 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.870
 here is meat and it is this part you are very 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.090
 helps a lot to guide 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.350
 forearm and thereby reduces the load 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.870
 from the triceps here is the best sea 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.970
 You can say the position for the brush so 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.940
 do it all the time like that 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.930
 will be external and internal and long 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:41.180
 head and outer head will be much 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.010
 I'll show you more now 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.440
 from different angles we still have two 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.830
 angle on what can be done french too 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.440
 find the second way to do french 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.070
 bench press slope see how I lay down and ice 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.110
 tilted but here we also take 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.450
 dumbbell first try as 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.100
 first showed you here you go 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.680
 diagonal 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.870
 understand see elbow could and also 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.810
 looking strictly up your elbow watching you 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:17.660
 strictly all up and lift the same time 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.660
 two times two times 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.729
 only forearm work everyone here is you 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.280
 already 30 more stretched tasks load yet 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.160
 more will be but here you need moms 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.560
 guys already lower weight dumbbells 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.449
 if you do horizontally you have weight 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.979
 the heaviest dumbbells should be if 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.580
 you tilt and make a little bit easier 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.740
 and 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.720
 90 degrees the lightest dumbbell 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.699
 should be so you do not get hurt 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.150
 thus it will be safe here too 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:56.010
 the most complicated in this way 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:59.289
 turned the brush hard if you have a brush 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:03.340
 when you exercise when you tilt 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:05.740
 tilt fails to drive out completely 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.630
 then at least slightly transport from this 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.740
 provisions here as much as possible 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.460
 turn 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.180
 brush and do because in this particular 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.880
 tilting you will be hard to make a brush 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.240
 turn out and completely that the banks looked 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.590
 on face that is la longer young 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.490
 it becomes very difficult to do a little 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.190
 a little at least brought 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:31.300
 already load change further love and 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:34.060
 third exercise option then you 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.060
 will sit at a 90 degree angle 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:41.050
 here is the same just as well 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.660
 elbow watching strictly yo here you can 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:47.260
 here already in this situation turn 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.530
 thus agility to elbow 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.500
 looking away from you too 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:57.789
 you can even press your biceps down and 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.949
 raises all the same here yet 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.960
 more stretching triceps goes but here 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.639
 clear you will need to be on it 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.160
 what he said not to be injured 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:11.699
 don't hurt your elbow all again 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:16.180
 changed the position of the brush and understand 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:19.030
 load is awesome here I guarantee 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.639
 that in large weight it will be impossible 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.449
 need to do very much load goes 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:27.640
 at 30 so try guys french 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:31.030
 press to do as I showed you on quality 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.610
 on technology and I will give you one more 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.560
 for the sake of advice, always do French 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.900
 bench press whatever you would do with 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.600
 dumbbells with a barbell and a gym at home 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.760
 always do 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.310
 know at all angles how i do i 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.100
 I do everything I have one 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:52.630
 horizontal approach 2 tilted 3 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:54.040
 90 then liked 4 5 same 95 tilted 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.230
 and 6 i do 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.500
 horizontally and how my grip 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.010
 settles down at the beginning I always do 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.070
 grip 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:05.740
 reverse because 30 still not tired i 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.840
 I can withstand the load under this 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.390
 angle reverse grip under such reverse 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.670
 on such inverse in all and immediately 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.850
 then changing my grip on another case again 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.530
 90 Direct grip then obliquely 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.620
 and horizontally everything I did six 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.960
 approaches I killed 30 myself here is the best 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.780
 set of exercises for 30 I consider him 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.970
 base complex you have it in 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.880
 principle to do after pull times 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.590
 warmed up warmed up to the bottom of the triceps 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.380
 all proceed to the French wife 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.210
 guys i just shook the whole time i'm all 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.580
 life rocked that way the triceps 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.950
 and my triceps can be said grown up 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.360
 so guys aspire to train 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.130
 watch my workouts 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.210
