00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.090
 Hello 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.219
 I'll show you the solution for 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.619
 the quest exam and problems 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:20.119
 that is the and crashed of the life heart 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:22.439
 from german fall alliance in bangkirai 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.740
 downstairs when it comes to the hall of 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.650
 save heroes or help king 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.199
 emmerick against the imperial must there 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.420
 you write scrolls on the podium 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.219
 These scrolls you have to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.760
 So you can put the following form first 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.350
 look here like the scrolls 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.590
 or what is in the writings in that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.930
 your inventory goes to quest items and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.680
 then the scrolls opens the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.160
 discipline scroll stands in the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.710
 seasons season of life in 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.980
 The rain hand passed discipline 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.149
 so rain could be you 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.240
 equate, so to speak, with spring 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:09.000
 So we think here that I pull 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.930
 From then on, we will continue to look 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.320
 then we see the devotion the devotion 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.500
 is the suns high but that means tempted 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.460
 he was coming after spring 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.600
 summer so here we put the devotion 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:30.090
 in the summer spring summer so now 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.450
 are missing us on the fall as look 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.360
 we again wisdom the hearth 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.659
 usually it means exposed 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.659
 it was already cold in autumn 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:52.960
 and then we'll have a look again in winter 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:02:01.950
 then the sacrifice of the spring at the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.950
 discipline and the accomplishment of devotion 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:17.010
 and that was already you have seen 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.870
 So we have to lay it down very easily 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.780
 looking at the spring summer autumn 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.600
 and winter times and then submit them 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.830

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.830
