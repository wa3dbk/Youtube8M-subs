00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.109
 television chain also having 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:06.459
 become a mother time that also 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.560
 He took the opportunity to write some 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:10.480
 songs already want back to music 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.520
 when presenting his new studio album 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.430
 I think that this album is a compendium 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.500
 of songs that reveal many of my 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.560
 musical tastes at the moment in which 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.110
 is my head today and also many of 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.230
 the songs I've written on this album 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.150
 reveal a current state of sentimental 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.250
 some songs I did not write them but 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.720
 well this is the first time this 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.210
 It happened this first time I decided 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.499
 open myself to the experience of singing a 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.160
 that another song that I did not write 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:40.079
 and it has been the truth that very interesting 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.540
 see me in this facet also of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.370
 only interpreter although many of 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.550
 the songs are written also because 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.690
 this for me is always and has been and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.460
 It will be essential as composer 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.140
 Colombian star chose as first 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.730
 single from his album a duet with 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.750
 rihanna who tour member you because you 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.750
 for you 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.640
 for nothing 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.350
 I never thought that rihanna the end was going to 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.630
 decide to make this song because it is 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.460
 so busy but where will launch the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.229
 adventure to send her to see what 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.650
 it seemed and she loved it look like this 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.630
 We decided to enter this process in this 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.550
 collaboration is a luxury for me 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.710
 because rihanna is one of the artists 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.420
 most important in the world but it has been 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.650
 also very nice to meet her from the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.290
 human point of view because it is a 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.420
 person I think very simple and very 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.520
 warm with everyone so it was very nice 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.080
 work with him however it is difficult 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.720
 that can make a world tour 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.880
 spin still do not know exactly 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.800
 when will it happen because for now 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.920
 I'm releasing my new album and also 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.660
 I'm doing another season more between 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.390
 young but yes with a lot of desire to 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.860
 go on tour but this time it's not going to 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.860
 have to accompany and very special 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.119
 so I'll have to look for the moment 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.060
 suitable for when you can also 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.040
 travel because he is still very baby 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.750
 well you can not let get so 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.520
 let's try to see how how 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.150
 we can achieve everything how we can do 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.230
 that everything that happens at the same time 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.630
 this about being a mother and going on tour and 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.680
 has to see some formula 52 ivonne
