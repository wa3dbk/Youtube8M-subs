00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.110
 839 nicely salvaged they hear oldie 95 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.719
 or very special friday because 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.860
 finally he is welcome 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.860
 Wladimir Klitschko 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.710
 good morning a little 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.140
 drawn from the fight of the last 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.300
 weekend against a weakly Mario 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.599
 small little blue spot still over 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.679
 the right eye 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.880
 it is almost barely visible 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:34.640
 that's almost right for them 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.280
 no make-up about twelve rounds right 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.559
 well also have boxed yes you see 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.329
 then you can hardly see anything anymore 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.430
 from the traces of the fight then is 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.289
 the day after tomorrow it starts here rocky that 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.079
 musical world premiere in the operetta house 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.510
 her brother vitali and also sylvester 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.890
 stallone and behind the co- producers 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.629
 The big day is coming closer and closer 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.640
 excited they are now I am 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.850
 pretty upset because he was in front of three 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.230
 Years ago we had the idea and before 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.359
 We started three years ago 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.980
 and what is the test with the three 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.860
 actually, never is that much time 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.479
 but so much work has been done and 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.360
 so many people then become themselves 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.400
 have teamed around this characterizes the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.299
 make rock musician successful and 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.000
 I think so 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.759
 the audience does not have it yet musician 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.070
 Seen only a small audience and seen 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.860
 specialists and critics and 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.460
 we have for something to change so and so 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.439
 to do so and to represent that 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.600
 People are simply being helped by the 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.869
 history inspires just as enthusiastic 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.140
 as of the six follow from rocky so 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.630
 this is a classic where it works 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.780
 not about the sport you think it's all about 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.780
 fight 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.700
 Part of it is life because we work 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.320
 are all underdogs and baroque that is 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.280
 a complete looser actually as an 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.830
 other days 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.510
 He noticed music in life and 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.300
 especially in life, by boxing one man 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.240
 Do it only for a woman as an educator 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.850
 adware woman who wants strawberries round 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.330
 of course , to conquer the heart of change 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.270
 he is not so easy and this 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.630
 away to euro grumbled but something for them 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:20.000
 bio said without end 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.440
 Who can say no by whom? 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.580
 can now actually the concrete idea 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.530
 for the musical who had the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.540
 originally of course the idea came from 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.540
 stage entertainment the system the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.780
 Production company of many musics will 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.580
 A risk to think because I can you 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.480
 assure that is under the stage 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.090
 floor and we loved it 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.310
 they also have hamburg 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.410
 Headquarters in hamburg from stage 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.480
 entertainment germany 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.910
 and we know that musicals in 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.610
 Germany is wanted very popular 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.380
 love to go to a virus and 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.250
 I already found the idea anyway 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.410
 Great and it was just me shouldering 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.299
 follow my are six's then 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.840
 actually no other life for rocky 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.630
 and at the next meeting in los angeles 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.910
 with sony have agreed and he 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.910
 The idea was wonderful and really great 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.290
 and he said I want that rock 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:28.310
 lies further and music is the right one 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.750
 then follow for the rockers as a character 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.270
 when 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.120
 movie hero easy to live in the musical 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.620
 to live with the risk-on and it 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.350
 everything went pretty fast I was 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.270
 very surprised but it was very 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.460
 fast 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.560
 of course he has the semestern 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.540
 script so the script written for 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.450
 of course, then the film myself too 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.450
 played 1976 he is a star roque 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.170
 risk, therefore , 36 years ago 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.540
 this is my vintage so i'm 976 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.750
 born and i never thought that 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.590
 I will then be competent of 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.060
 roxy music 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.770
 I have to say well I am very proud 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.920
 You can also so but I say 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.880
 I am very happy that I am with too 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.170
 living legend 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:23.340
 the aim is therefore still like movies 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.540
 Producing this risk is also 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.920
 one of her biggest fans 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.870
 that's good, we're fans of filming 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.860
 Sylvester stallone was quite like that 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.740
 with us in Carinthia 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.660

 also feverishly 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.410
 has struggled with and in the end how to do that 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.030
 already seen in Europe for us the 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.820

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.710

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.780
 put it on the side and that was also on 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.310

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.440
