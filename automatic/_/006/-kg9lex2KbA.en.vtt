 morissette the one in one of the concepts 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.179
 of the Apollo program and former chief of 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:22.730
 nasa communications all the 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.619
 flights to polo and gemini were followed 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.539
 some distance and sometimes very closely 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.180
 by space vehicles of origin 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.520
 alien 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.470
 every time the astronauts happened what 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.540
 they reported to mission control who 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.770
 then they were ordered to maintain absolute 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.770
 silence about the matter 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.160
 gordon cooper former astronauts 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.220
 mercury program 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.420
 for years I have lived with a secret the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.520
 secret imposed on all 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.860
 specialists and astronauts now I can 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.600
 reveal that every day in the USA our 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.239
 radars detect shape objects and 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.130
 unknown nature there are thousands of 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.600
 witness reports and many documents 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.300
 they try it but nobody wants 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.010
 post that because 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.479
 authorities fear that people imagined 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.210
 a kind of horrible invaders 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.830
 then the slogan remains 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.830
 avoid panic at all costs 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.780
 donald and clayton astronaut of the program 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.509
 Mercury was making a flight 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.659
 trials in a fighter - bomber of 15 in 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.039
 when I saw that the object 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.209
 that looks like a gray probe balloon 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.399
 and a diameter of one meter 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:51.229
 approximately but nothing more to place 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.689
 behind that imposing thing is not 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.630
 it looked more like a balloon it looked like a 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.099
 saucer a disc at the same moment I 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.560
 I noticed that he was moving away from me 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:03.289
 suddenly and I was flying to more than 500 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.270
 kilometers per hour I chased him for 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.909
 a few moments and suddenly that 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.979
 happy things just took off 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.860
 came up with a 45 degree angle turning 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.239
 and accelerating and disappeared two more days 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.489
 I had a beer with me later 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.340
 commander and I thought I would have 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.780
 I told him I did and he told me that 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.329
 I had to introduce myself to the service 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.550
 information to give part I did it and 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.310
 I have not heard anything again 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.960
 astronaut and colonel john glenn never 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.300
 we have answered the truth and without 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.210
 But we have seen things there are things 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.620
 strange but we know what we have seen 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.510
 our superiors had a lot of this 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.490
 they had something similar to the war of the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.760
 worlds' and the general panic the streets 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.320
 therefore we had to shut up and 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.390
 now we only see those things during 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.610
 our nightmares or perhaps in movies 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.610
 and sharp are very close to the truth 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.360
 eugene cernan apollo commander 17 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.550
 I am one of those who have never seen a 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.410
 UFO when questioned I said 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.060
 publicly I thought they came from 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.060
 another world from another civilization 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.350
 two 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.680
 james mcdivitt astronaut my observation 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.120
 of the UFOs was a long time ago in 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.880
 1965 during the space mission 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.080
 Gemini 4 was looking through the 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.030
 window when you saw an object 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.140
 cylindrical which was tied to a 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.280
 tube or antenna 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.750
 giorgi grow Russian cosmonaut if he had 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.819
 freedom to tell what is coming 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.819
 space the world would be stupefied 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.310
 Doctor reads catch in physicist and expert 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.810
 atmospheric NASA observations 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.430
 of UFOs are so common that 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.500
 military do not have enough time 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.600
 to deal with them then the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.580
 delete the main screens 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.890
 defense systems have filters 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.380
 integrated UFOs and when a UFO appears 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.239
 the filters simply ignore it 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.950
 remove all objects or targets not 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.840
 conventional and do not do any 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.280
 UFO recording the whites do not 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.020
 conventional are ignored because 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.240
 apparently they are only whites 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.910
 Russians we are interested in being 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.740
 potential enemies something that has 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.750
 stationary flight and then it shoots up to 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.090
 8,000 kilometers per hour we do not 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.370
 interesting because it can not be the 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.530
 enemy the UFOs are detected with 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.240
 radars on land and in the air and have 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.510
 been signed by cameras brought to 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.510
 board 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.290
 Germano German gerd physical doctor and one 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.610
 of the founding fathers of the 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.340
 astronautics and space rockets 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.590
 UFOs are conceived and directed by 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.270
 intelligent beings of high level and it 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.400
 propel by field distortion 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.280
 gravitational when converting gravity 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.720
 in energy I have no doubt that 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.750
 these objects are interplanetary ships 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.010
 of some kind my colleagues and I are 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.080
 sure that they do not come from our 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.210
 solar system but we thought that they could 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.550
 use Mars or another celestial body as 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.740
 outpost probably is not 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.479
 originate in our solar system such 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.830
 not once in our galaxy not 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:49.380
 we can boast of scientific advances 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.380
 in some areas they helped us 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.770
 doctor joseph alan hi nec astronomer 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.350
 Professor and Scientific Advisor of NASA 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.230
 I was and in the project blue book 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.480
 and I knew the work that they had 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.000
 they ordered not to alter the public not to throw 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.950
 firewood where ever a case 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.410
 explainable that there were many 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.050
 they extrapolated in their quality of 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.580
 prosaic to the whole phenomenon 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.530
 disseminating it in the media for 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.260
 cases that were very difficult to explain 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.140
 they made real juggling for 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.610
 keep them away from the media 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.010
 they had a job to do 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.620
 correctly or incorrectly to maintain 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.020
 to the calm public when the longed for 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.120
 solution to the problem UFO arrive I think 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.160
 that will prove to be not just a small step 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.080
 for science but a resounding and 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.080
 totally unexpected quantum leap 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.880
 physicist michio kaku theoretical physicist 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.250
 specialized in string theory the 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.080
 civilization type 1 is maybe hundreds of 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.540
 years more advanced than ours 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.820
 control planetary energy any 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.950
 thing related to the planet the weather 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.570
 perhaps earthquakes and volcanoes them 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.520
 They can control it as 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.680
 eventually expand by a factor 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.540
 of 10 million to have the power of his 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.810
 star can control storms 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.940
 solar that is civilization type 2 the 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.310
 which can be moved from one part to 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.470
 another of the galaxy have the power of the 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.240
 thermonuclear fusion the very power of 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.770
 the stars 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.260
 eventually they deplete the power of their 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:33.080
 star and they become galactic they 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.790
 they come back type 3 they have tremendous access 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.270
 to vast and vast regions of the 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.270
 galaxy 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.780
 so 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.720
 yes
