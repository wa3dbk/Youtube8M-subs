00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.220
 Intel laid this year in office under Babbel have on this issue and 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.840
 everybody made the women look at it now Dr 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.949
 of course this survey is lost 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:12.279
 if that's true 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.829
 So who is virtual 6 for me absolutely idiotic because that makes it wet 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.539
 Eighth, none at all in crisis and no charm from Dertingen 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.470
 fake pol-i khomri to watch how this process 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.539
 but also hold nothing for me 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.800
 around the man the virtual Sachs has is the percent in my opinion 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.109
 Fraud percentages in percent that's actually still in principle 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.340
 worse because the thoughts 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.070
 Of course, they are much better than what you actually live with in sex 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.940
 Virtual Earth 6 percent can be quite interesting 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.780
 You have a lot of time to describe what you are doing and therefore 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.260
 Maybe in real life, there's no time for everything that's there 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.650
 thinks out 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.430
 or maybe not the courage that's why it's a very good one 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.370
 Alternative phone sex also recommended 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.830
 Virtual 6 is somehow not really six times more for me 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.500
 Body largely 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.690
 I would say hear 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.300
 and how and what you can touch and somewhere they lie 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.520
 but the main thing I have you 6 and not somehow known that yourself 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.060
 the figures I move that is then on average 6 o'clock 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.910
 yes, you should always do the six already 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.850
 it is our gate 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.690
 6 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.700
 those of reproduction and 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 When we stop Ramos is having sex is humanity 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.350
 Consecrated end 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.190
 we are not for that one 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.190
 also in high during working hours 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.450
 always wanted to have sex 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.410
 for the benefit of all humanity Second Life such a nonsense you only live 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.560
 once in a while and let's see the DP falls out the sow I was 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.540
 around the 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.310
 besides, I prefer to play with power 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.330
 Compare me right shit for something better for me and better 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.120
 Virtual 6 is now 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.990
 It's going to be sixth in computer games 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.619
 It's more though, so if I think of a computer games games then percent shows 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.389
 I am not the person I am playing there 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.839
 and that's why it's not fun that way, Schwenn says 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.709
 to watch how they have sexual intercourse 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.129
 I was lucky 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.179
 have weariness 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:22.329
 but the feelings were missing 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.670
 Mitterer 6 11 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.839
 and are boring 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:28.859
 all the Second Life 6 1 in my opinion no real bet therefore not 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.049
 rate and 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.509
 simply meaningless 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.949
 I find it funny that in this survey our action makes accident content 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:37.329
 every rally 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.430
 Water - it's not so bad you can not make any food 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.009
 Nursing staff midfield 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.209
 this is the only one 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.590
 but a good year we have been here six years ago 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.069
 while colleagues of the world improve thus making a round at Werder 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.180
 but is safe 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.439
 the place was but you may land but up to the top ten Most Wanted 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.699
 list, for example, as misleading department 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.950
 so be in this survey that they do not notice that on the break 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.850
 No pants worn Spoerr the Rose Week Thursday with us and so 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.529
 That's why all donkeys only wanted to get away from Beust had no exceptions 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:15.059
 Accordingly, that we help ourselves very well as Torgefahr failed in the 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.379
 Office always have sex believes me a lot you can get a year ago 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.800
 hilarious word and I am so Larsen 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.310
 I believe the two teacher students that 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.770
 In addition, the things were synonymous tell me a few times awake so a whole 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.319
 other very different stuff like old died for the power since now 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.819
 born of donations 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:32.299
 in friendly
