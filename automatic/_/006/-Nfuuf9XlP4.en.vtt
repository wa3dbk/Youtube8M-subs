thousand<00:00:29.300> guitars<00:00:30.699> hopefully<00:00:31.699> we<00:00:31.849> won't

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
thousand guitars hopefully we won't

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.299 
thousand guitars hopefully we won't
crack<00:00:32.239> piece<00:00:32.449> of<00:00:32.570> wood<00:00:32.689> a<00:00:32.720> day<00:00:33.190> and<00:00:34.190> we're

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
crack piece of wood a day and we're

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.020 
crack piece of wood a day and we're
gonna<00:00:34.370> bend<00:00:34.730> it<00:00:34.850> right<00:00:35.090> into<00:00:35.300> this<00:00:35.540> form<00:00:37.030> hard

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
gonna bend it right into this form hard

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.869 
gonna bend it right into this form hard
to<00:00:38.149> believe<00:00:38.420> that<00:00:41.559> that<00:00:42.559> piece<00:00:42.829> of<00:00:43.010> wood<00:00:43.160> is

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
to believe that that piece of wood is

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:50.170 
to believe that that piece of wood is
going<00:00:44.450> in<00:00:44.620> there<00:00:46.270> but<00:00:47.270> it<00:00:47.450> will<00:00:48.850> one<00:00:49.850> way<00:00:50.000> or

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
going in there but it will one way or

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.999 

good

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.969 

this<00:01:36.460> is<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.759> homemade<00:01:37.200> poisoned<00:01:38.200> coffee<00:01:38.439> I

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
this is the homemade poisoned coffee I

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.310 
this is the homemade poisoned coffee I
used<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:39.880> do<00:01:40.030> this<00:01:40.210> without<00:01:40.390> so<00:01:40.780> kind<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.110> wood

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
used to do this without so kind of wood

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.620 
used to do this without so kind of wood
but<00:01:41.860> I<00:01:44.159> seem<00:01:45.159> to<00:01:45.189> have<00:01:45.369> a<00:01:45.549> whole<00:01:45.880> lot<00:01:45.909> more<00:01:46.119> luck

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
but I seem to have a whole lot more luck

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.999 
but I seem to have a whole lot more luck
once<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.740> whole<00:01:48.039> piece<00:01:48.610> of<00:01:48.640> wood<00:01:49.030> is<00:01:49.270> like

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
once the whole piece of wood is like

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.010 
once the whole piece of wood is like
saturated<00:01:51.009> with<00:01:51.159> hot<00:01:51.399> water<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:53.490> rosewood

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
saturated with hot water and rosewood

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.139 
saturated with hot water and rosewood
takes<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.170> long<00:01:56.439> time<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:57.130> dry<00:01:57.399> out<00:01:57.520> so

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
takes a long time to dry out so

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.179 
takes a long time to dry out so
therefore<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.659> takes<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:59.020> long<00:01:59.319> time<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.920> get

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
therefore it takes a long time to get

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.919 
therefore it takes a long time to get
wet<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:00.880> I'm<00:02:00.939> going<00:02:01.179> to<00:02:01.270> give<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.600> maybe

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
wet so I'm going to give this maybe

00:02:01.929 --> 00:04:24.140 
wet so I'm going to give this maybe
eight<00:02:02.289> minutes

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.520 

you<00:04:25.150> know<00:04:25.240> we<00:04:25.360> got<00:04:25.509> the<00:04:25.690> board<00:04:26.169> out<00:04:26.320> of<00:04:26.350> the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
you know we got the board out of the

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.219 
you know we got the board out of the
sander<00:04:27.810> to<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.930> approximate<00:04:31.020> thickness<00:04:32.020> of

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
sander to the approximate thickness of

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.800 
sander to the approximate thickness of
our<00:04:33.870> finger<00:04:34.870> thing<00:04:35.080> in<00:04:35.199> Italy

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
our finger thing in Italy

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.730 
our finger thing in Italy
so<00:04:37.380> we<00:04:37.500> gotta<00:04:37.620> lay<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.800> board<00:04:38.100> out<00:04:38.360> on<00:04:39.360> this

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
so we gotta lay the board out on this

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:50.290 
so we gotta lay the board out on this
$500<00:04:40.740> piece<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.100> wood

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.770 

there<00:04:51.289> are<00:04:51.379> two<00:04:51.560> boards<00:04:52.129> so<00:04:52.970> you<00:04:53.030> have<00:04:53.629> to

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
there are two boards so you have to

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:41.980 
there are two boards so you have to
rough<00:04:54.080> cut<00:04:54.110> these<00:04:54.470> out<00:04:54.680> on<00:04:54.889> the<00:04:55.009> bends

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.050 

you
