00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the game what do we have here black to

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.950 
the game what do we have here black to
move<00:00:41.550> let<00:00:41.879> me<00:00:41.989> let<00:00:42.989> me<00:00:43.170> switch<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.710> around<00:00:43.860> so

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
move let me let me switch that around so

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.750 
move let me let me switch that around so
it's<00:00:45.960> easier<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.620> guys<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:47.010> calculate

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
it's easier for you guys to calculate

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.560 
it's easier for you guys to calculate
its<00:00:48.539> black<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.170> move<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.800> said<00:00:49.860> it's

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
quite a difficult example so if you want

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
quite a difficult example so if you want
to<00:00:54.149> set<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.719> your<00:00:54.750> own<00:00:54.899> board<00:00:55.289> or<00:00:55.469> take<00:00:55.829> as

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
to set up on your own board or take as

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.760 
to set up on your own board or take as
much<00:00:56.219> time<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.820> want<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.510> dive<00:00:58.230> into<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
much time as you want to dive into the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.099 
much time as you want to dive into the
variations<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.579> calculate<00:01:00.570> as<00:01:00.719> much<00:01:00.960> as

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
variations and calculate as much as

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.240 
variations and calculate as much as
possible<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.949> great<00:01:03.470> training<00:01:04.470> example
