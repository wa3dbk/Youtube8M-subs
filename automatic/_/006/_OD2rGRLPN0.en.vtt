during high water it's something that a
lot<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.950> people<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.910> time<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.330> year<00:00:12.509> did<00:00:12.719> a

lot of people this time of year did a

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.230 
lot of people this time of year did a
little<00:00:12.990> bit<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.200> scared<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:14.059> and<00:00:15.059> there's

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
little bit of scared of and there's

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240 
little bit of scared of and there's
really<00:00:15.330> no<00:00:15.540> reason<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.929> fish<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.100> eat

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
really no reason to fish have to eat

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.910 
really no reason to fish have to eat
even<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.850> dirty<00:00:18.090> water<00:00:18.240> right<00:00:19.109> now<00:00:19.260> if<00:00:19.830> you

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
even in dirty water right now if you

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.070 
even in dirty water right now if you
look<00:00:20.130> down<00:00:20.340> let's<00:00:20.640> say<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.090> maybe<00:00:21.359> six

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
look down let's say we have maybe six

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.140 
look down let's say we have maybe six
inches<00:00:22.380> available<00:00:22.609> visibility<00:00:23.609> here<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
inches available visibility here on the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.990 
inches available visibility here on the
Miracle<00:00:24.510> Mile<00:00:25.160> dirty<00:00:26.160> water<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.760> running

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
Miracle Mile dirty water is running

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.189 
Miracle Mile dirty water is running
about<00:00:27.210> eight<00:00:27.420> thousand<00:00:27.869> cff<00:00:28.400> and<00:00:30.199> everybody

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
about eight thousand cff and everybody

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.049 
about eight thousand cff and everybody
thinks<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.470> need<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> water<00:00:32.160> you

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
thinks you need to be in the water you

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.910 
thinks you need to be in the water you
don't<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.320> actually<00:00:34.620> probably<00:00:34.739> one

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
don't so this is actually probably one

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.340 
don't so this is actually probably one
of<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> more<00:00:35.219> accessible<00:00:35.579> times<00:00:42.170> just<00:00:43.170> walk

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
of the more accessible times just walk

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.000 
of the more accessible times just walk
up<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> banks<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:45.260> another<00:00:46.260> misnomer<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.860> that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
up the banks so another misnomer is that

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.889 
up the banks so another misnomer is that
you<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.309> fish<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> ton<00:00:47.820> away<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.360> big<00:00:48.629> long

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
you have to fish a ton away in big long

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.840 
you have to fish a ton away in big long
rigs<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> lot<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.950> times<00:00:50.160> that's<00:00:50.489> not<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
rigs and a lot of times that's not the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.209 
rigs and a lot of times that's not the
case<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.600> fact<00:00:51.899> I'm<00:00:52.500> probably<00:00:52.770> fishing

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
case in fact I'm probably fishing

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.610 
case in fact I'm probably fishing
shorter<00:00:53.879> than<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.300> normally<00:00:54.360> would<00:00:54.989> okay<00:00:55.410> I'd

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
shorter than I normally would okay I'd

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.279 
shorter than I normally would okay I'd
say<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.860> maybe<00:00:56.190> three<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> half<00:00:57.420> feet<00:00:57.989> from

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
say I maybe three and a half feet from

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.740 
say I maybe three and a half feet from
my<00:00:58.440> fly<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.219> my<00:00:59.370> indicator<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
my fly to my indicator and this is a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.319 
my fly to my indicator and this is a
right-angle<00:01:01.440> type<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.520> rig<00:01:02.730> where<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
right-angle type of rig where I have the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.050 
right-angle type of rig where I have the
thingamabob<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.199> an<00:01:04.350> open<00:01:04.710> loop<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:06.030> I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
thingamabob on an open loop and then I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.770 
thingamabob on an open loop and then I
have<00:01:06.390> short<00:01:07.549> section<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.640> 2x<00:01:09.150> tied<00:01:09.420> straight

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
have short section of 2x tied straight

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.109 
have short section of 2x tied straight
to<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> instead<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.189> having<00:01:11.400> thick<00:01:11.820> butt

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
to it and instead of having thick butt

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.210 
to it and instead of having thick butt
section<00:01:12.420> hanging<00:01:12.930> below<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
section hanging below this is going to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.160 
section hanging below this is going to
allow<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> weight<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.180> my<00:01:15.330> flies<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
allow just the weight of my flies to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.560 
allow just the weight of my flies to
sink<00:01:16.439> everything<00:01:16.920> down<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.580> I'm<00:01:18.150> gonna<00:01:18.270> start

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
sink everything down so I'm gonna start

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
sink everything down so I'm gonna start
with<00:01:18.659> no<00:01:18.900> split<00:01:19.140> shot<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.100> add<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
with no split shot if I have to add a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.310 
with no split shot if I have to add a
little<00:01:20.549> bit<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.909> later<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.780> but<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.080> try<00:01:22.259> to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
little bit on later I will but I try to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.399 
little bit on later I will but I try to
avoid<00:01:22.470> split<00:01:23.009> shot<00:01:23.250> because<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> has<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> way<00:01:24.119> of

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
avoid split shot because it has a way of

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.469 
avoid split shot because it has a way of
digging<00:01:25.409> down<00:01:25.710> into<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.130> rocks<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.729> sticks

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
digging down into the rocks and sticks

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
digging down into the rocks and sticks
that<00:01:27.720> are<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:27.930> along<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> banks<00:01:28.710> during<00:01:28.890> high

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
that are up along the banks during high

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.910 
that are up along the banks during high
water<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.900> using<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> weight<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.259> my<00:01:31.290> flies<00:01:31.619> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
water so using the weight of my flies to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.710 
water so using the weight of my flies to
get<00:01:32.040> everything<00:01:32.280> down<00:01:32.610> we're<00:01:33.360> running<00:01:33.570> two

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
get everything down we're running two
