00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
what you need to do is you need to get

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:30.160 
what you need to do is you need to get
this<00:01:28.399> dimension<00:01:28.850> right<00:01:29.000> down<00:01:29.210> here<00:01:29.539> so<00:01:30.140> you

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
this dimension right down here so you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.289 
this dimension right down here so you
have<00:01:30.369> this<00:01:31.369> top<00:01:31.549> dimension<00:01:32.000> now<00:01:32.119> what<00:01:32.210> you

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
have this top dimension now what you

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.160 
have this top dimension now what you
need<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.450> do<00:01:32.509> is<00:01:32.570> you're<00:01:32.689> gonna<00:01:32.780> need<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:32.990> cut

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
need to do is you're gonna need to cut

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.230 
need to do is you're gonna need to cut
these<00:01:33.350> edges<00:01:33.770> here<00:01:34.009> in<00:01:34.759> order<00:01:34.969> to<00:01:35.060> come<00:01:35.149> up

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
these edges here in order to come up

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.090 
these edges here in order to come up
with<00:01:35.299> this<00:01:35.450> dimension<00:01:35.899> here<00:01:36.079> I<00:01:36.259> believe<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:36.829> is

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
with this dimension here I believe it is

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.230 
with this dimension here I believe it is
you<00:01:37.340> multiply<00:01:37.490> this<00:01:38.360> number<00:01:38.630> by<00:01:39.369> 0.2<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:40.579> 0<00:01:40.939> and

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
you multiply this number by 0.2 to 0 and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.080 
you multiply this number by 0.2 to 0 and
that's<00:01:41.869> how<00:01:42.110> you<00:01:42.170> end<00:01:42.259> up<00:01:42.500> with<00:01:42.649> this

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
that's how you end up with this

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.700 
that's how you end up with this
dimension<00:01:44.090> down<00:01:44.240> here<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:44.600> measure<00:01:44.869> in<00:01:45.140> 20%

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
dimension down here you measure in 20%

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.249 
dimension down here you measure in 20%
and<00:01:46.280> you<00:01:46.670> measure<00:01:46.850> in<00:01:47.030> 20%<00:01:47.630> on<00:01:47.719> this<00:01:47.840> side<00:01:48.049> and

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
and you measure in 20% on this side and

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.560 
and you measure in 20% on this side and
that's<00:01:48.469> where<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.859> end<00:01:49.070> up<00:01:49.250> cutting<00:01:49.490> here<00:01:50.299> so

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
that's where you end up cutting here so

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.950 
that's where you end up cutting here so
you<00:01:50.630> have<00:01:50.810> 20%<00:01:51.200> in<00:01:51.789> 20%<00:01:52.789> in<00:01:52.909> from<00:01:53.180> you<00:01:53.840> know

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
you have 20% in 20% in from you know

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.609 
you have 20% in 20% in from you know
from<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.259> direct<00:01:54.530> rectangle<00:01:56.140> 20%<00:01:57.140> in<00:01:57.229> this<00:01:57.380> way

them unsewn and you can thread your
suspension<00:03:16.180> through<00:03:16.329> it<00:03:16.419> I<00:03:16.569> actually<00:03:17.319> sewed

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
suspension through it I actually sewed

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.470 
suspension through it I actually sewed
some<00:03:17.590> omni<00:03:18.099> tape<00:03:18.280> here<00:03:18.519> on<00:03:18.669> both<00:03:18.909> sides<00:03:18.939> and

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
some omni tape here on both sides and

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.240 
some omni tape here on both sides and
basically<00:03:20.319> what<00:03:20.469> this<00:03:20.590> does<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.889> it<00:03:21.010> just<00:03:21.099> kind

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
basically what this does is it just kind

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.729 
basically what this does is it just kind
of<00:03:21.340> keeps<00:03:21.549> everything<00:03:21.699> in<00:03:22.030> place<00:03:22.060> so<00:03:22.239> you<00:03:22.480> can

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
of keeps everything in place so you can

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.949 
of keeps everything in place so you can
you<00:03:23.739> know<00:03:23.769> you<00:03:24.099> can<00:03:24.219> kind<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.400> use<00:03:24.519> this<00:03:24.699> and<00:03:25.530> on

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
you know you can kind of use this and on

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.199 
you know you can kind of use this and on
stick<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.109> I<00:03:29.319> guess<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.069> can<00:03:30.819> use<00:03:31.060> this

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
stick it I guess and you can use this

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.030 
stick it I guess and you can use this
like<00:03:31.329> a<00:03:31.389> big<00:03:31.599> snake<00:03:31.810> skin<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.229> kind<00:03:32.409> of<00:03:32.500> unfurl

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
like a big snake skin and kind of unfurl

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.830 
like a big snake skin and kind of unfurl
it<00:03:33.250> all<00:03:33.759> the<00:03:33.970> way<00:03:34.060> off<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.389> just<00:03:34.509> kind<00:03:34.689> of<00:03:34.720> have

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
it all the way off and just kind of have

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.020 
it all the way off and just kind of have
it<00:03:34.930> hanging<00:03:35.079> over<00:03:35.290> over<00:03:36.189> off<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.459> one<00:03:36.579> side<00:03:36.609> and

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
it hanging over over off to one side and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.429 
it hanging over over off to one side and
then<00:03:37.540> when<00:03:37.659> you<00:03:37.720> want<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:37.959> back<00:03:38.079> again<00:03:38.349> you

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
then when you want it back again you

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.069 
then when you want it back again you
just<00:03:38.560> take<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:38.979> place<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.720> use<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.840> Omni

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
just take it place it and use the Omni

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.580 
just take it place it and use the Omni
tape<00:03:41.259> to<00:03:41.439> since<00:03:41.769> you're<00:03:41.859> closed<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:43.750> get<00:03:43.930> in<00:03:44.079> at

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
tape to since you're closed to get in at

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.839 
tape to since you're closed to get in at
the<00:03:44.680> bottom<00:03:44.949> here<00:03:45.099> like<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:45.280> said<00:03:45.370> it's<00:03:45.639> just<00:03:45.759> a

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
the bottom here like I said it's just a

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.360 
the bottom here like I said it's just a
big<00:03:46.000> glorified<00:03:46.419> stuff<00:03:46.659> sack<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:48.220> just

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
kind of it's got a hole at the bottom

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.800 
kind of it's got a hole at the bottom
here<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.669> can<00:03:51.819> adjust<00:03:51.909> the<00:03:52.269> cinch<00:03:52.569> by

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
here that you can adjust the cinch by

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.929 
here that you can adjust the cinch by
cinching<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:53.769> cord<00:03:54.009> lock<00:03:54.159> down<00:03:54.400> or<00:03:54.579> leaving

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
cinching that cord lock down or leaving

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.879 
cinching that cord lock down or leaving
it<00:03:55.120> further<00:03:55.299> open<00:03:55.629> you<00:03:56.199> just<00:03:56.379> kind<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.590> hop<00:03:56.739> in

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
it further open you just kind of hop in

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.289 
it further open you just kind of hop in
like<00:03:57.069> a<00:03:57.099> big<00:03:57.310> stuff<00:03:57.519> sack<00:03:57.729> and<00:03:57.759> then<00:03:57.970> cinch<00:03:58.180> it

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
like a big stuff sack and then cinch it

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.780 
like a big stuff sack and then cinch it
up<00:03:58.359> behind<00:03:58.569> you<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.769> just<00:03:59.799> hangs<00:04:00.129> like<00:04:00.579> so

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
up behind you and it just hangs like so

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.339 
up behind you and it just hangs like so
you<00:04:00.849> can<00:04:01.120> see<00:04:01.239> there's<00:04:01.449> enough<00:04:01.870> room<00:04:01.959> down

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
you can see there's enough room down

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.559 
you can see there's enough room down
there<00:04:02.530> for<00:04:02.769> an<00:04:02.829> under<00:04:03.009> quilt<00:04:03.250> I've<00:04:03.819> put<00:04:04.150> on<00:04:04.180> my

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
there for an under quilt I've put on my

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.649 
there for an under quilt I've put on my
my<00:04:05.560> winter<00:04:05.889> incubator<00:04:06.340> on<00:04:06.549> on<00:04:06.939> this<00:04:07.329> hammock

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
my winter incubator on on this hammock

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.979 
my winter incubator on on this hammock
and<00:04:08.139> it<00:04:08.259> had<00:04:08.349> enough<00:04:08.560> clearance<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.970> just<00:04:10.900> I

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
and it had enough clearance I just I

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.749 
and it had enough clearance I just I
like<00:04:11.169> the<00:04:11.259> way<00:04:11.379> it<00:04:11.469> hangs<00:04:11.709> in<00:04:12.009> my<00:04:12.189> opinion<00:04:12.579> more

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:12.759 
like the way it hangs in my opinion more

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.860 
like the way it hangs in my opinion more
than<00:04:12.819> a<00:04:13.469> the<00:04:14.469> designs<00:04:14.799> that<00:04:14.889> are<00:04:15.009> used<00:04:15.340> by<00:04:15.489> the

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
than a the designs that are used by the

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.270 
than a the designs that are used by the
big-name<00:04:16.870> manufacturers<00:04:17.560> out<00:04:17.739> there<00:04:17.769> in<00:04:18.130> my

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
big-name manufacturers out there in my

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.580 
big-name manufacturers out there in my
opinion<00:04:18.729> with<00:04:19.539> these<00:04:19.719> sort<00:04:19.989> of<00:04:20.049> zipper<00:04:20.349> on<00:04:20.500> the

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
opinion with these sort of zipper on the

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.230 
opinion with these sort of zipper on the
side<00:04:20.620> reason<00:04:21.579> why<00:04:21.669> I<00:04:21.699> like<00:04:21.909> this<00:04:22.060> design

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
side reason why I like this design

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.779 
side reason why I like this design
better<00:04:22.690> than<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:23.050> is<00:04:23.229> because<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:24.400> can<00:04:24.550> see

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
better than that is because you can see

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.310 
better than that is because you can see
how<00:04:24.940> these<00:04:25.090> shockcord<00:04:25.479> on<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.900> bottom<00:04:26.169> kind

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
how these shockcord on the bottom kind

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.719 
how these shockcord on the bottom kind
of<00:04:26.440> cinches<00:04:26.770> things<00:04:26.979> up<00:04:27.159> and<00:04:27.310> makes<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.610> more

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
of cinches things up and makes it more

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.689 
of cinches things up and makes it more
of<00:04:27.909> a<00:04:28.800> you<00:04:29.800> know<00:04:29.889> just<00:04:30.070> imagine<00:04:30.370> if<00:04:30.460> this<00:04:30.550> were

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
of a you know just imagine if this were

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.370 
of a you know just imagine if this were
hanging<00:04:31.060> down<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.419> would<00:04:31.539> be<00:04:31.690> hanging<00:04:32.020> down<00:04:32.169> to

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
hanging down it would be hanging down to

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.010 
hanging down it would be hanging down to
here<00:04:32.789> if<00:04:33.789> it<00:04:34.000> were<00:04:34.120> did<00:04:34.360> not<00:04:34.479> have<00:04:34.630> that<00:04:34.659> shock

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
here if it were did not have that shock

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.629 
here if it were did not have that shock
cord<00:04:35.289> on<00:04:35.409> it<00:04:35.440> basically<00:04:36.039> just<00:04:36.340> gives<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:36.610> a

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
cord on it basically just gives you a

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.830 
cord on it basically just gives you a
little<00:04:36.760> extra<00:04:36.880> clearance<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.479> feel<00:04:37.659> in<00:04:37.810> my

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
little extra clearance I feel in my

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.990 
little extra clearance I feel in my
opinion<00:04:38.289> on<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.620> bottom<00:04:38.919> so<00:04:39.789> you're<00:04:39.880> not

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
opinion on the bottom so you're not

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.040 
opinion on the bottom so you're not
dragging<00:04:40.210> your<00:04:40.419> bug<00:04:40.599> net<00:04:40.779> and

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
dragging your bug net and

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.700 
dragging your bug net and
I<00:04:41.310> like<00:04:42.310> that<00:04:42.490> shot<00:04:42.669> Corden<00:04:43.379> bottom<00:04:44.379> portion

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
I like that shot Corden bottom portion

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.619 
I like that shot Corden bottom portion
because<00:04:44.949> not<00:04:45.129> only<00:04:45.159> does<00:04:45.520> it<00:04:45.550> cinch<00:04:46.240> up<00:04:46.360> behind

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
because not only does it cinch up behind

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.629 
because not only does it cinch up behind
you<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:46.930> keep<00:04:47.710> everything<00:04:47.949> cinched<00:04:48.370> up<00:04:48.460> so

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
you and keep everything cinched up so

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.670 
you and keep everything cinched up so
the<00:04:48.729> books<00:04:48.909> can't<00:04:49.120> get<00:04:49.300> in<00:04:49.419> but<00:04:49.539> it<00:04:49.629> also<00:04:49.750> takes

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
the books can't get in but it also takes

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.050 
the books can't get in but it also takes
up<00:04:50.800> some<00:04:51.009> of<00:04:51.069> the<00:04:51.129> slack<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.639> bug<00:04:51.879> netting

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
up some of the slack of the bug netting

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.110 
up some of the slack of the bug netting
itself<00:04:52.509> and<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:54.370> know<00:04:54.490> prevents<00:04:54.970> that<00:04:55.060> from

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
itself and you know prevents that from
