fight was listen he was ranked ahead of

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.710 
fight was listen he was ranked ahead of
Bader<00:04:09.829> and<00:04:10.040> then<00:04:10.549> we<00:04:10.669> look<00:04:10.849> at<00:04:10.970> Condit<00:04:11.419> well

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
Bader and then we look at Condit well

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.599 
Bader and then we look at Condit well
he's<00:04:11.930> ranked<00:04:12.229> below<00:04:12.440> this<00:04:12.739> so<00:04:13.040> there's<00:04:13.430> an

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
he's ranked below this so there's an

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.879 
he's ranked below this so there's an
inconsistency<00:04:13.850> there<00:04:14.449> so<00:04:14.840> listen<00:04:15.380> I'm<00:04:15.530> fine

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
inconsistency there so listen I'm fine

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.229 
inconsistency there so listen I'm fine
with<00:04:16.070> making<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.459> fight<00:04:16.729> to<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:16.970> want<00:04:17.150> to

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
the sand that these rankings mean

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.780

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
nothing and this is business and I think

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.870 
nothing and this is business and I think
even<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.420> UFC<00:04:30.960> hasn't<00:04:31.830> quite<00:04:32.220> figured<00:04:32.280> out

think<00:05:11.010> I<00:05:11.120> when<00:05:12.120> when<00:05:12.390> there's<00:05:12.600> money<00:05:12.750> involved

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
think I when when there's money involved

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.380 
think I when when there's money involved
sure<00:05:13.530> but<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:13.980> depends<00:05:14.760> on<00:05:15.000> what<00:05:15.300> the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
sure but it depends on what the

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.790 
sure but it depends on what the
philosophy<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:15.990> because<00:05:16.140> Robbie<00:05:16.350> said<00:05:16.590> it<00:05:16.740> in

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
philosophy is because Robbie said it in

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.960 
philosophy is because Robbie said it in
the<00:05:16.860> past<00:05:17.040> that<00:05:17.220> he<00:05:17.340> doesn't<00:05:17.490> want<00:05:17.610> to<00:05:17.790> really

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
the past that he doesn't want to really

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.570 
the past that he doesn't want to really
fight<00:05:18.210> anybody<00:05:18.780> at<00:05:19.050> 170<00:05:19.740> pounds<00:05:20.130> from

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
fight anybody at 170 pounds from

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.370 
fight anybody at 170 pounds from
American<00:05:21.090> Top<00:05:21.270> Team<00:05:21.300> I<00:05:21.660> know<00:05:21.930> would<00:05:22.200> least

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
American Top Team I know would least

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.660 
American Top Team I know would least
traveling<00:05:22.830> around<00:05:23.010> so<00:05:23.280> maybe<00:05:23.400> that's

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
traveling around so maybe that's

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.640 
traveling around so maybe that's
different<00:05:24.390> but<00:05:24.510> I<00:05:24.570> think<00:05:24.930> if<00:05:25.110> we're<00:05:25.290> going<00:05:25.560> to

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
different but I think if we're going to

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.380 
different but I think if we're going to
be<00:05:26.040> straight<00:05:26.520> honest<00:05:26.940> and<00:05:27.150> we're<00:05:27.240> going<00:05:27.360> to

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
be straight honest and we're going to

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.020 
be straight honest and we're going to
say<00:05:27.690> there's<00:05:28.290> no<00:05:28.680> explaining<00:05:29.340> these<00:05:29.700> things

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
say there's no explaining these things

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.310 
say there's no explaining these things
we<00:05:30.180> got<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.330> say<00:05:30.540> there's<00:05:30.960> no<00:05:31.050> explaining

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
we got to say there's no explaining

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.810 
we got to say there's no explaining
these<00:05:31.590> things<00:05:31.800> this<00:05:32.160> is<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.460> fight<00:05:32.640> they

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
these things this is the fight they

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.250
