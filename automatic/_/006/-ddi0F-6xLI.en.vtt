00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
are these pieces from the life so let's

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.170 
are these pieces from the life so let's
start<00:02:04.890> with<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.160> sewing<00:02:05.430> room<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.910> design

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
start with the sewing room the design

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.970 
start with the sewing room the design
room<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.870> is<00:02:07.020> where<00:02:07.200> they're<00:02:07.530> creating<00:02:07.740> all

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
room this is where they're creating all

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.920 
room this is where they're creating all
the<00:02:08.100> pieces<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.790> just<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.480> few<00:02:09.600> days<00:02:09.660> we'll

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
the pieces that just a few days we'll

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.500 
the pieces that just a few days we'll
see<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.619> actual<00:02:11.010> runway<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.790> design<00:02:12.180> room

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
see on the actual runway the design room

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.710 
see on the actual runway the design room
is<00:02:12.870> really<00:02:13.590> where<00:02:13.770> magic<00:02:13.980> happens<00:02:14.640> from<00:02:15.270> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
is really where magic happens from the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.310 
is really where magic happens from the
sewers<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.830> pattern<00:02:17.250> makers<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:18.540> either's

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
sewers to the pattern makers to either's

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.680 
sewers to the pattern makers to either's
tailors<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.310> mean<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:20.820> is<00:02:21.000> where<00:02:21.210> everything

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
tailors I mean this is where everything

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.380 
tailors I mean this is where everything
happens<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.500> takes<00:02:22.740> an<00:02:23.280> army<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.730> put<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.270> all

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
happens it takes an army to put it all

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.840 
happens it takes an army to put it all
together<00:02:24.570> I<00:02:25.020> was<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:25.770> inspired<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.490> I'm<00:02:26.640> like

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
together I was so inspired that I'm like

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.060 
together I was so inspired that I'm like
all<00:02:27.120> my<00:02:27.330> checklist<00:02:27.600> adduce<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.440> need<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.980> go

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
all my checklist adduce I need to go

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.170 
all my checklist adduce I need to go
back<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.370> start<00:02:29.580> sewing<00:02:29.790> again

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
back and start sewing again

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.420 
back and start sewing again
I<00:02:30.390> think<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.690> difficulty<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.620> pulling<00:02:31.980> all

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
I think the difficulty in pulling all

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.940 
I think the difficulty in pulling all
the<00:02:32.550> elements<00:02:33.150> for<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.720> jacket<00:02:34.260> was<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:34.770> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
the elements for the jacket was just the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:45.230 
the elements for the jacket was just the
timing<00:02:36.140> machines<00:02:37.140> are<00:02:37.860> still<00:02:38.280> spinning<00:02:44.240> so

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
timing machines are still spinning so

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.809 
timing machines are still spinning so
