00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
legs so let's take a closer look at this

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.009 
legs so let's take a closer look at this
guy<00:00:29.550> first<00:00:29.970> impressions<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.720> thing<00:00:30.869> is

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
guy first impressions this thing is

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.810 
guy first impressions this thing is
fairly<00:00:31.320> light<00:00:31.679> perhaps<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.460> little<00:00:32.669> over

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
fairly light perhaps just a little over

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.760 
fairly light perhaps just a little over
a<00:00:32.850> pound<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:33.719> built<00:00:33.899> very<00:00:33.960> very<00:00:34.530> sturdy

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
a pound but it's built very very sturdy

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.260 
a pound but it's built very very sturdy
I'm<00:00:35.070> feeling<00:00:35.520> nothing<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:35.850> metal-on-metal

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
I'm feeling nothing but metal-on-metal

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.420 
I'm feeling nothing but metal-on-metal
here<00:00:36.750> first<00:00:37.320> thing<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.559> note<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.980> surface

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
here first thing to note on the surface

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.220 
here first thing to note on the surface
is<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.940> has<00:00:39.090> its<00:00:39.270> own<00:00:39.360> built-in<00:00:39.809> bubble

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
is that it has its own built-in bubble

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.780 
is that it has its own built-in bubble
leveler<00:00:40.559> right<00:00:41.010> beneath<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
leveler right beneath it we have a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
leveler right beneath it we have a
little<00:00:42.030> knob<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.420> allows<00:00:42.480> us<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.870> adjust<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
little knob that allows us to adjust and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.900 
little knob that allows us to adjust and
lock<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> leveler<00:00:44.100> once<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> shot

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
lock the leveler once we have the shot

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.819 
lock the leveler once we have the shot
set<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> center<00:00:46.649> it

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
set and as you can see in the center it

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.010 
set and as you can see in the center it
has<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.010> 3/8<00:00:47.399> inch<00:00:47.430> screw<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.030> top<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.539> turn<00:00:48.899> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
has a 3/8 inch screw on top and turn it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.319 
has a 3/8 inch screw on top and turn it
over<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.649> has<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> 3/8<00:00:50.280> inch<00:00:50.309> socket<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:51.180> its

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
over and it has a 3/8 inch socket at its

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.310 
over and it has a 3/8 inch socket at its
face<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.629> guess<00:00:54.840> we're<00:00:55.079> going<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
face so as you can guess we're going to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.720 
face so as you can guess we're going to
sandwich<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.770> right<00:00:56.070> between<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.520> head<00:00:56.699> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
sandwich this right between the head and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.819 
sandwich this right between the head and
the<00:00:56.940> legs<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.420> our<00:00:57.480> tripod<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.289> let's<00:00:58.590> go<00:00:58.680> ahead

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the legs of our tripod so let's go ahead

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.410 
the legs of our tripod so let's go ahead
and<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.010> right<00:00:59.219> now<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.000> tripod<00:01:00.390> that

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and do that right now the tripod that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
and do that right now the tripod that
I'm<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> use<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.379> demo<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> man

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
I'm going to use for this demo is a man

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.539 
I'm going to use for this demo is a man
throttle<00:01:02.579> 196<00:01:03.359> 3<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> 701<00:01:04.470> HDV<00:01:04.979> fluid<00:01:05.369> head

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
throttle 196 3 with a 701 HDV fluid head

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.160 
throttle 196 3 with a 701 HDV fluid head
obviously<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.450> first<00:01:06.630> thing<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.960> want<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
obviously the first thing that I want to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.780 
obviously the first thing that I want to
do<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.619> separate<00:01:08.040> these<00:01:08.189> guys<00:01:08.430> from<00:01:08.640> one

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
do is separate these guys from one

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
do is separate these guys from one
another<00:01:09.060> first<00:01:09.540> step<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:09.990> doing<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
another first step in doing so is to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.050 
another first step in doing so is to
remove<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> anti<00:01:11.340> twist<00:01:11.400> screws<00:01:11.820> from<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
remove the anti twist screws from the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.670 
remove the anti twist screws from the
center<00:01:12.390> column<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.020> make<00:01:13.229> sure<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.470> save

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
center column but make sure you save

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.750 
center column but make sure you save
them<00:01:13.860> because<00:01:14.159> you're<00:01:14.280> going<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> need<00:01:14.610> them

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
them because you're going to need them

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.390 
them because you're going to need them
later<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.830> once<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> screws<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.340> removed

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
later so once the screws are removed

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.280 
later so once the screws are removed
just<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.000> few<00:01:18.210> quick<00:01:18.360> turns<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> head<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
just a few quick turns of the head and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.429 
just a few quick turns of the head and
it<00:01:19.380> easily<00:01:19.710> twists<00:01:20.159> right<00:01:20.369> off<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:22.020> now<00:01:22.229> I'll

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it easily twists right off so now I'll

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.899 
it easily twists right off so now I'll
take<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.740> leveling<00:01:23.100> head<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.490> twist<00:01:23.790> it

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
take the leveling head and twist it

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.630 
take the leveling head and twist it
right<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.240> top<00:01:24.479> where<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> head<00:01:24.960> once<00:01:25.170> was

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
right on top where the head once was

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.920 
right on top where the head once was
once<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> twisted<00:01:27.330> nice<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.689> snug

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
once you have it twisted nice and snug

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.690 
once you have it twisted nice and snug
