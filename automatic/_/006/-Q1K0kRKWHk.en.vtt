00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.680
We bring the students at the end of the semester out to Fort McClellan so that they can get as close to human experience

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.900
as possible with the mannequins that we have.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:40.060
These mannequins breathe, they talk, we can hear breath sounds and heart tones and check pulses.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.800
They respond to our actions as we give them medications or preform treatments and procedures.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:58.200
And so the students can see real life what happens when this is applied in a clinical situation at the hospital or out patient facility.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.500
We feel like it really benefits them when they go into practice because this is a safe environment for them

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.680
and they can make the wrong decisions and still be ok and they learn from those experiences.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.860
Based on what skill they preform, then behind the monitor in the control room,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:41.360
those people are changing the vital signs and the reactions that the simulated patient is having.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.540
I feel like this is absolutely necessary experience for the students, I feel they get a lot out of this

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.140
and they need to continue doing high fidelity simulation so that they can simulate a true patient experience.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.460
It's what sets us apart from those who don't have that experience, they're allowed to have that safe enviorment

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.620
and to give the wrong medications or wrong treatment and it's ok.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.020
They can learn from it where as those who don't have those simulation experience don't get that chance to mess up.
