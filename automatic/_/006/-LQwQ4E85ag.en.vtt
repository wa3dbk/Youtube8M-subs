00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
one of those concrete bricks are they

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.859 
one of those concrete bricks are they
called<00:00:13.650> Bessel<00:00:14.040> blocks<00:00:14.219> or<00:00:14.429> something<00:00:17.869> there

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
called Bessel blocks or something there

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.540 
called Bessel blocks or something there
it<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.410> planted<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.949> week<00:00:20.130> or<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.430> ago

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
it is I planted it a week or so ago

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.029 
it is I planted it a week or so ago
anyway<00:00:21.230> mounted<00:00:22.230> quite<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> few<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.800> them<00:00:22.949> I

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
anyway mounted quite a few of them I

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.050 
anyway mounted quite a few of them I
don't<00:00:23.100> know<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.490> they'll<00:00:23.609> get<00:00:23.760> through<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
don't know that they'll get through the

it so so well yet there they are growing
in<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> centers<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.289> concrete<00:00:49.289> bricks<00:00:50.870> just

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
in the centers of concrete bricks just

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.900 
in the centers of concrete bricks just
for<00:00:52.110> fun<00:00:53.449> here<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> couple<00:00:54.989> more<00:00:57.890> I'm<00:00:58.890> doing<00:00:59.399> all

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.930 

nice<00:01:13.460> long<00:01:13.760> stem<00:01:14.060> on<00:01:14.270> this<00:01:14.420> one<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:16.640> its

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
nice long stem on this one and its

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.710 
nice long stem on this one and its
leaves<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.630> reaching<00:01:17.960> up<00:01:18.080> to<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.440> Sun<00:01:19.720> and

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
they are well let's see how it goes with

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.710 
they are well let's see how it goes with
the<00:01:25.340> winter<00:01:25.670> frost<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.300> whether<00:01:26.450> they<00:01:26.659> can

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
the winter frost and whether they can

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.350 
the winter frost and whether they can
you<00:01:27.680> know<00:01:27.860> whether<00:01:28.400> they<00:01:28.580> can<00:01:28.640> last<00:01:29.000> through

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
you know whether they can last through

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.520 
you know whether they can last through
into<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.780> spring<00:01:30.310> we'll<00:01:31.310> see<00:01:35.320> well<00:01:36.320> I've<00:01:36.500> just

double Moringa coming up to from the one

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.289 
double Moringa coming up to from the one
seed<00:02:29.530> that's<00:02:30.530> interesting<00:02:31.220> setting<00:02:31.760> focus

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
seed that's interesting setting focus

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.140 
seed that's interesting setting focus
probably<00:02:32.780> not<00:02:33.430> true<00:02:34.430> from<00:02:34.579> the<00:02:34.730> one<00:02:34.880> seed

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
probably not true from the one seed

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.100 
probably not true from the one seed
coming<00:02:35.540> up<00:02:35.660> here<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.940> this<00:02:38.180> one<00:02:38.390> next<00:02:38.630> door<00:02:38.750> is
