hope you enjoy so here's my rotation as
you<00:00:12.090> can<00:00:12.300> see<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.480> start<00:00:13.049> off<00:00:13.200> with<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.559> pyroblast

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
you can see I start off with a pyroblast

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.550 
you can see I start off with a pyroblast
straight<00:00:14.730> into<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> blast<00:00:15.809> wave<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.289> think<00:00:16.470> it's

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
straight into a blast wave I think it's

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.760 
straight into a blast wave I think it's
gone<00:00:16.710> then<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.609> go<00:00:17.760> into<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> fireball<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.840> then

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
gone then I go into a fireball and then

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.090 
gone then I go into a fireball and then
immediately<00:00:20.070> after<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.970> go<00:00:21.330> into<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> Fire<00:00:21.900> Blast

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
immediately after I go into a Fire Blast

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.460 
immediately after I go into a Fire Blast
so<00:00:23.100> I'm<00:00:23.160> going<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.369> show<00:00:23.519> both<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.750> clip<00:00:25.109> full

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
so I'm going to show both this clip full

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.080 
so I'm going to show both this clip full
speed<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.980> then<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> few<00:00:26.369> other<00:00:26.430> examples

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
speed and then a few other examples

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.500 
speed and then a few other examples
since<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.990> am<00:00:28.170> using<00:00:28.680> all<00:00:29.039> fire<00:00:29.460> spells<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.119> my

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
since I am using all fire spells and my

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.430 
since I am using all fire spells and my
rotation<00:00:31.130> as<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.189> fire<00:00:32.550> respect<00:00:32.850> mage<00:00:33.059> I'm

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
rotation as a fire respect mage I'm

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.959 
rotation as a fire respect mage I'm
getting<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> 25%<00:00:35.239> increased<00:00:36.239> damage<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.930> each

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
getting the 25% increased damage on each

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.530 
getting the 25% increased damage on each
fire<00:00:38.969> spell<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:39.870> since<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.680> get<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
fire spell because since you get the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.590 
fire spell because since you get the
ability<00:00:43.040> 25%<00:00:44.040> increase<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.059> fire<00:00:45.300> suppose

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
ability 25% increase and fire suppose

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.950 
ability 25% increase and fire suppose
once<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.989> spec<00:00:46.200> fire<00:00:46.410> let's<00:00:47.309> say<00:00:47.520> obviously

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
once you spec fire let's say obviously

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.580 
once you spec fire let's say obviously
so<00:00:48.960> you're<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.379> wasting<00:00:49.559> your<00:00:49.739> time<00:00:49.980> about

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
so you're not wasting your time about

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.529 
so you're not wasting your time about
casting<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.800> stuff<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.100> frost<00:00:53.520> well<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
casting and stuff like frost well and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:04.369 
casting and stuff like frost well and
you're<00:00:55.440> maximizing<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.190> DPS

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.540 

so<00:01:05.379> now<00:01:05.500> I'm<00:01:05.590> going<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:05.830> be<00:01:05.920> showing<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.310> stunt

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
so now I'm going to be showing the stunt

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.120 
so now I'm going to be showing the stunt
a<00:01:06.729> blanket<00:01:07.120> trick<00:01:07.440> it's<00:01:08.440> pretty<00:01:08.680> simple<00:01:08.890> trick

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
a blanket trick it's pretty simple trick

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.920 
a blanket trick it's pretty simple trick
but<00:01:09.310> some<00:01:09.850> may<00:01:10.000> not<00:01:10.150> know<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.479> as<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:10.810> can<00:01:10.869> see

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
but some may not know it as you can see

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.620 
but some may not know it as you can see
I'm<00:01:11.170> getting<00:01:11.500> nearly<00:01:11.979> attacked<00:01:12.070> by<00:01:12.400> this<00:01:12.460> wolf

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
I'm getting nearly attacked by this wolf

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.950 
I'm getting nearly attacked by this wolf
so<00:01:14.110> I<00:01:14.140> frost<00:01:14.590> Nova<00:01:15.070> turn<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.180> Link<00:01:16.570> this<00:01:16.930> can

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so I frost Nova turn and Link this can

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.249 
so I frost Nova turn and Link this can
increase<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.580> what's<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.759> word<00:01:22.259> space

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
increase the what's the word space

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.480 
increase the what's the word space
between<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:24.130> caster<00:01:24.580> and<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:26.080> enemy<00:01:26.380> so<00:01:27.100> you

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
between the caster and the enemy so you

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.359 
between the caster and the enemy so you
can<00:01:28.240> maximize<00:01:29.050> your<00:01:29.200> DPS<00:01:29.440> and<00:01:29.740> start<00:01:30.159> casting

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
can maximize your DPS and start casting

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.670 
can maximize your DPS and start casting
your<00:01:30.640> rotation<00:01:31.119> if<00:01:31.270> your<00:01:31.570> snuck<00:01:31.899> up<00:01:32.080> on<00:01:32.229> by<00:01:32.350> a
