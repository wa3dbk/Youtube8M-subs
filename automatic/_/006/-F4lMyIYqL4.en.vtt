be right back all right this is what the
top<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.660> looks<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:26.930> took<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.290> little<00:02:27.410> bit

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590

it<00:02:29.810> took<00:02:30.050> so<00:02:30.110> long<00:02:30.320> I<00:02:30.530> think<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.800> might<00:02:30.980> just

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
it took so long I think it might just

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.580 
it took so long I think it might just
kiddin<00:02:31.490> me<00:02:31.840> hopefully<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:32.990> gets<00:02:33.140> easier<00:02:33.500> as

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
kiddin me hopefully that gets easier as

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.300

we get on moving on to the sides see how

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.460 
we get on moving on to the sides see how
long<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:37.490> takes

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
long that takes

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.950

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
and stuff but just keep in mind when it

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.200 
and stuff but just keep in mind when it
rains<00:05:32.990> it<00:05:33.380> will<00:05:33.440> get<00:05:33.770> wet<00:05:33.919> you<00:05:34.699> will<00:05:34.820> get<00:05:35.030> wet

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
rains it will get wet you will get wet

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.370 
rains it will get wet you will get wet
oh<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:36.680> this<00:05:36.770> this<00:05:37.159> mesh<00:05:37.720> that's<00:05:38.720> on<00:05:38.990> here<00:05:39.199> on

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
oh and this this mesh that's on here on

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.580 
oh and this this mesh that's on here on
the<00:05:39.650> screen<00:05:40.510> if<00:05:41.510> I'm<00:05:41.780> not<00:05:41.930> mistaken<00:05:42.349> it

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
the screen if I'm not mistaken it

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.909 
the screen if I'm not mistaken it
explains<00:05:43.039> that<00:05:43.220> it's<00:05:43.400> a<00:05:43.580> shoot<00:05:43.909> through<00:05:44.240> mesh

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
explains that it's a shoot through mesh

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.420 
explains that it's a shoot through mesh
so<00:05:45.919> I<00:05:47.050> assume<00:05:48.050> that<00:05:48.080> means<00:05:48.530> my<00:05:48.800> arrow<00:05:49.039> should

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
so I assume that means my arrow should

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.750 
so I assume that means my arrow should
fly<00:05:49.699> through<00:05:50.180> without<00:05:50.780> any<00:05:50.840> problem<00:05:51.740> I<00:05:51.919> got<00:05:52.699> a

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
fly through without any problem I got a

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.310 
fly through without any problem I got a
tough<00:05:53.000> time<00:05:53.210> believing<00:05:53.690> that<00:05:53.810> it's<00:05:53.990> not<00:05:54.169> going

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
tough time believing that it's not going

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.629 
tough time believing that it's not going
to<00:05:54.409> affect<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.800> flight<00:05:55.039> at<00:05:55.159> all<00:05:57.400> but<00:05:58.400> what<00:05:58.520> can

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
to affect the flight at all but what can

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.219 
to affect the flight at all but what can
I<00:05:58.699> do<00:05:58.759> I'll<00:05:59.150> give<00:05:59.330> it<00:05:59.419> a<00:05:59.449> shot<00:05:59.509> I'll<00:05:59.900> do<00:06:00.050> some

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
I do I'll give it a shot I'll do some

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.189 
I do I'll give it a shot I'll do some
testing<00:06:00.590> on<00:06:00.740> that<00:06:00.889> on<00:06:01.250> my<00:06:01.460> targets<00:06:01.940> with<00:06:02.720> some

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
testing on that on my targets with some

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.960 
testing on that on my targets with some
field<00:06:03.470> tips<00:06:03.710> and<00:06:03.979> some<00:06:04.130> broad<00:06:04.340> heads<00:06:04.580> just<00:06:04.820> to

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
field tips and some broad heads just to
