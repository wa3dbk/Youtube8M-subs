here curly maple binding even cut an

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
armrest in and let me design the cutaway

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.250 
armrest in and let me design the cutaway
so<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.850> didn't<00:00:39.149> look<00:00:39.180> exactly<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
so it didn't look exactly like a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.940 
so it didn't look exactly like a
Florentine<00:00:40.860> or<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.570> Venetian<00:00:42.570> cut<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:43.079> he's

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
Florentine or a Venetian cut but he's

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.799 
Florentine or a Venetian cut but he's
just<00:00:44.100> does<00:00:44.309> great<00:00:44.579> work<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.480> spent<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> ton

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
just does great work but we spent a ton

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.020 
just does great work but we spent a ton
of<00:00:45.989> time<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.469> pickup<00:00:46.800> system<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> wanted

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
of time on the pickup system so I wanted

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.750 
of time on the pickup system so I wanted
to<00:00:48.120> show<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.340> basically<00:00:50.340> when<00:00:50.610> I'm

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
to show you that basically when I'm

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.260 
to show you that basically when I'm
playing<00:00:51.410> through<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> PA<00:00:52.770> with<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> band<00:00:53.520> it's

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
playing through a PA with a band it's

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.600 
playing through a PA with a band it's
just<00:00:54.539> hard<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:54.989> guitar<00:00:55.289> sound<00:00:55.680> decent<00:00:56.160> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
just hard to get guitar sound decent and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.599 
just hard to get guitar sound decent and
this<00:00:57.120> by<00:00:57.329> far<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.870> best<00:00:58.309> setup<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.460> I've

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
this by far is the best setup that I've

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.720 
this by far is the best setup that I've
ever<00:00:59.789> used<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.250> thought<00:01:02.370> I'd<00:01:02.460> walk<00:01:02.699> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
ever used so I just thought I'd walk you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.560 
ever used so I just thought I'd walk you
through<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.149> first<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.899> use<00:01:04.290> them<00:01:04.799> this

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
through it first of all I use them this

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.510 
through it first of all I use them this
KK<00:01:06.570> preamp<00:01:07.110> box<00:01:07.380> which<00:01:08.100> has<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:09.360> input<00:01:09.720> for

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
KK preamp box which has this input for

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.570 
KK preamp box which has this input for
gain<00:01:11.630> bass<00:01:12.630> mid<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.530> trouble<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.369> when<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
gain bass mid and trouble so when you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.910 
gain bass mid and trouble so when you
plug<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> stereo<00:01:15.540> cable<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.439> actually

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
plug in with a stereo cable it actually

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.880 
plug in with a stereo cable it actually
splits<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> signal<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.970> sends<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
splits the signal and sends it out to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.770 
splits the signal and sends it out to
different<00:01:19.890> inputs<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:21.119> sends<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.600> out

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
different inputs and that sends it out

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.780 
different inputs and that sends it out
to<00:01:22.820> this<00:01:23.820> box<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.720> which<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.950> radial

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
three attachments that are on the inside

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.640 
three attachments that are on the inside
of<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.700> body<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.229> that's<00:01:40.500> on

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
of the body and then the one that's on

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.679 
of the body and then the one that's on
the<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> bridge<00:01:41.820> which<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.420> Paizo

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the on the bridge which is that Paizo

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.380 
the on the bridge which is that Paizo
pickup<00:01:43.110> once<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.100> comes<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.490> here<00:01:44.850> then

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
pickup once it comes in here then

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.789 
pickup once it comes in here then
there's<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> little<00:01:45.840> dip<00:01:46.020> switch<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> side

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
there's a little dip switch on the side

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.520 
there's a little dip switch on the side
of<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.040> peasy<00:01:47.430> pre<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:48.240> about<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:48.689> that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
of this peasy pre right about there that

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.539 
of this peasy pre right about there that
allows<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.759> stay<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:52.399> actually<00:01:53.399> have

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
allows this to stay on and actually have

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.270 
allows this to stay on and actually have
both<00:01:54.200> both<00:01:55.200> inputs<00:01:55.710> running<00:01:56.070> simultaneously

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
both both inputs running simultaneously

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.450 
both both inputs running simultaneously
so<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.329> I'm<00:01:57.540> able<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.899> use<00:01:58.320> line<00:01:58.890> level<00:01:59.250> one

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
so now I'm able to use line level one

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.899 
so now I'm able to use line level one
line<00:01:59.759> level<00:01:59.939> two<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.479> notch<00:02:01.259> filter<00:02:01.909> sweepable

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
line level two a notch filter sweepable

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.319 
line level two a notch filter sweepable
mid<00:02:03.240> which<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.079> really<00:02:04.530> nice<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:05.070> low<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.210> then

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
mid which is really nice a low and then

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.029 
mid which is really nice a low and then
of<00:02:06.450> course<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.840> boost<00:02:07.110> which<00:02:07.710> I'll<00:02:07.890> explain

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
of course the boost which I'll explain

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.850 
of course the boost which I'll explain
in<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.459> second<00:02:08.849> I'm<00:02:09.509> also<00:02:09.810> able<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.259> use<00:02:10.739> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
in a second I'm also able to use a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.350 
in a second I'm also able to use a
low-cut<00:02:11.400> which<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.150> right<00:02:12.330> here

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
low-cut which is right here

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.350 
low-cut which is right here
a<00:02:13.390> notch<00:02:13.660> filter<00:02:13.960> and<00:02:14.820> then<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:15.910> footswitch

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
a notch filter and then the footswitch

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.240 
a notch filter and then the footswitch
piece<00:02:16.630> is<00:02:16.780> kind<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.080> cool<00:02:17.290> because<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.220> can

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
piece is kind of cool because you can

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.560 
piece is kind of cool because you can
set<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:19.710> basically<00:02:20.710> use<00:02:21.340> both<00:02:21.670> boost<00:02:22.240> and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
set it to basically use both boost and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.530 
set it to basically use both boost and
loop<00:02:22.780> or<00:02:23.410> just<00:02:23.770> boost<00:02:24.070> which<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:25.090> where<00:02:25.390> this

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
loop or just boost which is where this

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.380 
loop or just boost which is where this
comes<00:02:25.810> in<00:02:25.990> here<00:02:26.260> or<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.610> case<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:28.060> use<00:02:28.210> it

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
comes in here or in this case I use it

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.120 
comes in here or in this case I use it
as<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> loop<00:02:28.780> which<00:02:29.110> comes<00:02:29.380> out<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:29.920> two

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
as a loop which comes out to just two

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.900 
as a loop which comes out to just two

real inexpensive TC Electronics kind of

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.350 
real inexpensive TC Electronics kind of
a<00:02:34.030> delay<00:02:34.390> looper<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:35.680> reverb<00:02:36.370> which<00:02:36.850> just

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
a delay looper and a reverb which just

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.480 
a delay looper and a reverb which just
if<00:02:37.600> I'm<00:02:37.750> playing<00:02:37.960> someplace<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:39.160> I<00:02:39.190> don't

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
if I'm playing someplace that I don't

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.670 
if I'm playing someplace that I don't
want<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.840> rely<00:02:40.840> on<00:02:40.870> front-of-house<00:02:41.440> for

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
want to rely on front-of-house for

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.100 
want to rely on front-of-house for
everything<00:02:42.070> then<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.760> can<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.510> step<00:02:43.750> on<00:02:43.900> that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
everything then I can just step on that

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.650 
everything then I can just step on that
and<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.860> puts<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.400> chain<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.480> can

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
and it puts it in the chain and I can

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.020 
and it puts it in the chain and I can
step<00:02:47.260> on<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.590> again<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.490> takes<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.910> out<00:02:48.970> of

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
step on it again and it takes it out of

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.330 
step on it again and it takes it out of
the<00:02:49.150> chain<00:02:49.360> which<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.600> pretty<00:02:49.840> cool<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:51.100> box

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the chain which is pretty cool the box

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.850 
the chain which is pretty cool the box
is<00:02:51.550> great<00:02:51.760> it's<00:02:52.030> got<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.239> loop<00:02:52.840> send<00:02:53.380> in<00:02:53.500> return

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
is great it's got a loop send in return

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.630 
is great it's got a loop send in return
it<00:02:54.670> also<00:02:54.910> has<00:02:55.980> which<00:02:56.980> is<00:02:57.130> great<00:02:57.340> if<00:02:57.489> you're

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
it also has which is great if you're

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.520 
it also has which is great if you're
running<00:02:57.970> like<00:02:58.270> with<00:02:58.450> an<00:02:58.540> inner<00:02:58.720> ear<00:02:58.810> system<00:02:59.350> or

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
running like with an inner ear system or

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.780 
running like with an inner ear system or
Navion<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.250> has<00:03:00.880> an<00:03:01.060> out<00:03:01.239> pre<00:03:01.930> EQ<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.760> also<00:03:03.760> a

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
Navion it has an out pre EQ and also a

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.840 
Navion it has an out pre EQ and also a
ground<00:03:04.390> left<00:03:04.690> of<00:03:04.840> course<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.290> then<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.470> post<00:03:05.850> EQ

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
ground left of course and then a post EQ

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.630 
ground left of course and then a post EQ
so<00:03:07.239> what<00:03:07.480> I'll<00:03:07.600> do<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:08.110> I'll<00:03:08.800> send<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.070> pre<00:03:09.250> EQ

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
so what I'll do is I'll send the pre EQ

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.610 
so what I'll do is I'll send the pre EQ
to<00:03:09.790> front<00:03:09.970> house<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.480> I'll<00:03:10.570> send<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.900> post<00:03:11.140> EQ

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
to front house and I'll send the post EQ

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.660 
to front house and I'll send the post EQ
to<00:03:12.400> say<00:03:12.580> my<00:03:13.200> digital<00:03:14.200> snake<00:03:14.470> which<00:03:14.920> sends<00:03:15.489> me

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
to say my digital snake which sends me

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.270 
to say my digital snake which sends me
an<00:03:15.910> EQ<00:03:16.690> signal<00:03:17.050> of<00:03:17.140> my<00:03:17.290> guitar<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.769> my<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:18.250> my

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
an EQ signal of my guitar to my to my

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.070 
an EQ signal of my guitar to my to my
ears<00:03:18.670> it's<00:03:18.940> got<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.090> tuner<00:03:19.420> out<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:19.900> you're<00:03:20.049> not

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
ears it's got a tuner out so you're not

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.870 
ears it's got a tuner out so you're not
running<00:03:20.380> through<00:03:20.680> your<00:03:20.799> tuner<00:03:21.130> at<00:03:21.250> all<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.700> I

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
running through your tuner at all and I

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.970 
running through your tuner at all and I
just<00:03:22.120> have<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.269> real<00:03:22.900> inexpensive<00:03:23.110> pitch<00:03:23.709> black

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
just have a real inexpensive pitch black

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.259 
just have a real inexpensive pitch black
and<00:03:25.140> but<00:03:26.140> then<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.290> also<00:03:26.530> have<00:03:26.830> these<00:03:27.640> two<00:03:27.910> boss
