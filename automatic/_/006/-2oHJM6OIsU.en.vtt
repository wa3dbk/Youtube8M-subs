 revolverlab.com with an eye on technology 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.319
 few people notice that in modern 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.450
 smartphones have another interesting 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.230
 indicator which can be compared 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.150
 these smartphones 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.309
 besides design performance 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.020
 megahertz and gigabytes there is still such 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.330
 question which is called safe 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.039
 smartphone for exactly this indicator we 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.750
 we will compare today's flagships 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.640
 and what is most interesting if we are talking about 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.470
 smartphone security that first frontier 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.220
 in this matter it is like us 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.590
 unlock 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.449
 screen of our device today we will 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.669
 compare different approaches from different 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.850
 iphone companies will take part in the test 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.820
 5s samsung galaxy s5 smartphone from lg and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.320
 htc one m8 my name is ivan guchkov it 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.570

 stylus for great prices link in 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.960
 video description 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.270
 a bit of history just recently we knew 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.250
 two ways to protect smartphones banal 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.840
 Entering the password on the screen is inherent in the company 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.910
 apple before tachadi 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.530
 and more gamified vodka right 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.260
 shoulder on android devices with 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.390
 the emergence of such convenient write to knockout 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.030
 lg and trend fingerprint scanner 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.200
 fingers apple and samsung make us 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.970
 forget about the old ways 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.979
 interactions with our devices and 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.570
 so how are we going to evaluate smartphones 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.850
 smartphones we will leave for three 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.659
 parameters first parameter is convenience 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.310
 operation 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.320
 here every smartphone can get 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.479
 maximum 5 points the second parameter is 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.619
 naturally the degree of protection itself is here 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.909
 smartphone can get too 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.460
 maximum rating 5 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.110
 and the third parameter is a bonus one point 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.390
 for the uniqueness of a particular function 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.890
 naturally not everyone will get this bonus 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.990
 score at the end of the sum about the results 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.920
 and see which smartphone takes 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.079
 leading position 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.390
 and what toyota apple and its function 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.560
 tachaydi smartphone iphone 5s can 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.570
 call a breakthrough 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.009
 and how to him a fingerprint scanner 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.990
 other devices worked 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.119
 disgusting though no they are practically 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.369
 did not work with the release of new updates 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.020
 apple constantly improves the work of tachadi 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.939
 smartphone easily unlocked 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.100
 one hand has the ability to bring up 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.960
 5 fingerprints and one 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.909
 disadvantage is a whim mercy of this 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.710
 technology their pur clean rub if fingers 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.049
 wet unlock the smartphone will have 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.570
 annoying password and so assessment 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.429
 revolver lab in relation to iphone 5s 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.439
 ease of use peter there 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.239
 danger too five bonus point to 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.920
 unfortunately lg 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.290
 uniqueness of the lie company approach 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.909
 lies in the originality of the foot function 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.250
 the system allows programming 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.109
 screen tapping combinations 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.420
 thereby facilitating the unlock process 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.159
 smartphone you are not attached to external 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.200
 hand cleanliness and accuracy factors 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.209
 the poet's presentation to the sensor here 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.069
 just no fun beating 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.590
 the required combination on the big screen 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.780
 your smartphone and instantly get 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.790
 desktop access systems like 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.829
 can be done lumia smartphones 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.959
 this function did not carry a leg 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.790
 nature of protection on smartphones lg you 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.230
 either beat the combination on completely 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.669
 locked screen either on 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.709
 the included screen in specially 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.419
 area you noticed I said 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.430
 on lg smartphones 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.919
 huge advantage over competitors 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.689
 is the availability of the functions of the feet under the above 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.769
 most smartphones and even on 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.569
 lg tablet 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.459
 whether in the budget and dvuhsimnik or 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.079
 flagship smartphone and so ratings 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.120
 regarding lg 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.879
 usability solid five 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.980
 safety is also not worth giving 5 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.959
 bonus points for uniqueness points and 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.159
 availability of this feature on the entire line 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.680
 samsung smartphones 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.900
 it just so happens that samsung and apple are connected 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.859
 love bonds there is a fingerprint scanner 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.139
 iphone finger 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.970
 It means it will be with the galaxy, I'm not saying that 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.769
 someone is copying someone first 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.349
 trend is track and secondly not 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.629
 patented free fingerprint scanner 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.849
 fingers samsung galaxy s5 works 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.709
 excellent when properly operated not 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.659
 worth trying to unlock the smartphone 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.489
 with one hand it does not provide 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.829
 dimensions of the device but questions 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.810
 security, everything is fine as she did 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.359
 paypal approved security issues 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.540
 samsung galaxy s5 we set the following 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.949
 ease of operation 4 how many will 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.870
 try to unlock the smartphone 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.699
 with one hand, but for safety, we 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.229
 put 5 extra points to 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:59.009
 Unfortunately HLB DC New htc one m8 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:01.019
 nicely implemented system 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.699
 unlock your smartphone with 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.919
 gestures on the screen off you can 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:07.319
 instantly bring your smartphone into active 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.930
 mode or run a certain amount 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.930
 smartphone screen very responsive feature 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.209
 motion launch works surprisingly 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.039
 quickly and steadily even hold a smartphone 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.079
 in your pocket you can not looking 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.789
 and guaranteed to start the machine themselves 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.250
 wake up and declare that now we can 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.910
 forever forget about the sex button and i'm with 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.850
 they agree 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.800
 security issues htc one m8 will not get 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.690
 nothing at all is not to blame 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.669
 This company does not launch motion 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.500
 meant to protect your smartphone 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.720
 but for the uniqueness of the motion functions 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.699
 launch we will give the company htc 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.800
 1 bonus point because her excellent work 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.870
 allowed to make this comparison 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.590
 wonderful smartphone and so summarize 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.259
 results 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.169
 the first place was taken by the company elji scored 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.699
 11 points stable operation on devices 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.590
 different price categories and 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.020
 unpretentiousness of external factors 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.180
 allowed items but cat from company lg 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.460
 come out on top in our comparison 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.440
 From my experience I can add tapa 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.630
 lg g2 screen for two months 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.880
 this habit did not leave me still very 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.889
 for a long time I still have such an ipad screen 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.960
 on the macbook touchpad and in general for all 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.210
 you can't fool the rest of smartphones to 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.360
 you get used to a good second place 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.289
 iphone 5s and deserved honest 10 baht 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.300
 touch di di 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.430
 is the best fingerprint scanner 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.780
 existing on the market even though the fountain 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.310
 get an extra point for 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.860
 uniqueness but security issues 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.960
 and convenience occupy exactly the leading 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.669
 position it proves once again that 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.889
 If new items appear in the iphone 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.960
 it works as it should on the third 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.590
 samsung galaxy s5 spot with nine 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.360
 points 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.710
 and it is not enough, it speaks only about 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.750
 little nuances 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.849
 for someone unlocking the smartphone at 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.889
 side help type seems like cons to me 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.840
 it doesn't seem like a drawback i'm used to that 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.000
 a device with 5 inches needs to be used 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.349
 two hands and not bother a 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.909
 given the design features 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.949
 fingerprint scanner 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:55.460
 it is completely normal and fourth 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:57.650
 location htc one m8 six beams mega 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.050
 convenient motion launch function works 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.979
 perfect but nothing security matters 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.960
 can help me 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.060
 rather protect your smartphone you 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.039
 be able to combine in the traditional way 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.020
 it with a unique new sign system 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.090
 we will not get you in this comparison 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.860
 pushed heads against industry giants though 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.780
 I am sure that there are alternative 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.669
 safe methods for using your 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.320
 smartphone if you still know write
