00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.720 

well<00:00:04.620> what<00:00:04.740> attracts<00:00:05.130> me<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.279> floating

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
well what attracts me to floating

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.820 
well what attracts me to floating
initially<00:00:06.150> was<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.839> whole<00:00:06.990> idea<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.500> kind<00:00:07.740> of

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
initially was the whole idea to kind of

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.669 
initially was the whole idea to kind of
disconnect<00:00:08.490> from<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.630> busy<00:00:09.929> world<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.469> have

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
disconnect from the busy world and have

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.290 
disconnect from the busy world and have
a<00:00:10.710> bit<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.040> long<00:00:11.190> time<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.519> just<00:00:11.940> be<00:00:12.000> with

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
a bit of a long time to just be with

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.390 
a bit of a long time to just be with
with<00:00:12.630> yourself<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.230> your<00:00:13.380> mind<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:14.130> had<00:00:14.250> no

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
with yourself in your mind and I had no

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.829 
with yourself in your mind and I had no
idea<00:00:14.549> what<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.940> expect<00:00:14.969> when<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.480> first<00:00:15.719> tried

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
idea what to expect when I first tried

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.900 
idea what to expect when I first tried
floating<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.100> knew<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.580> was<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> new

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
floating but I knew that it was a new

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.609 
floating but I knew that it was a new
and<00:00:18.060> novel<00:00:18.180> experience<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.020> wanted<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.320> try

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
and novel experience and I wanted to try

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.170 
and novel experience and I wanted to try
it<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:20.039> see<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.220> was<00:00:20.369> all<00:00:20.430> about<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.029> when<00:00:21.150> I

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
it to see it was all about so when I

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.910 
it to see it was all about so when I
first<00:00:21.449> floated<00:00:21.840> again<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.140> didn't<00:00:22.500> really<00:00:22.769> have

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
first floated again I didn't really have

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.040 
first floated again I didn't really have
any<00:00:23.100> expectations<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.420> still<00:00:24.660> don't<00:00:24.869> every

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
any expectations and I still don't every

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.300 
any expectations and I still don't every
time<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.260> go<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.560> tank<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.010> different

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
time I go in the tank it's a different

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.089 
time I go in the tank it's a different
experience<00:00:26.670> after<00:00:27.180> about<00:00:27.630> 25<00:00:28.349> 30<00:00:28.650> minutes<00:00:29.010> I

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
experience after about 25 30 minutes I

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.410 
experience after about 25 30 minutes I
couldn't<00:00:29.400> actually<00:00:29.490> feel<00:00:29.789> my<00:00:29.910> body<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.390> that

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
couldn't actually feel my body and that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.849 
couldn't actually feel my body and that
was<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> really<00:00:30.900> interesting<00:00:31.170> experience<00:00:31.650> as

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
was a really interesting experience as

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.380 
was a really interesting experience as
well<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.219> was<00:00:32.399> left<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> tank<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
well so I was left in the tank for the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.560 
well so I was left in the tank for the
rest<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> time<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:34.590> my<00:00:34.620> mind<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.450> and<00:00:36.450> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
rest of the time with my mind and and a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.729 
rest of the time with my mind and and a
lot<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.750> things<00:00:36.960> came<00:00:37.170> up<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.469> really

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
lot of things came up that really

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.830 
lot of things came up that really
surprised<00:00:38.129> me<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.489> came<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.629> tank

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
surprised me and I came out of the tank

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.799 
surprised me and I came out of the tank
after<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.590> everything<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.879> brighter<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.629> was

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
after and everything was brighter it was

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
after and everything was brighter it was
I<00:00:42.840> was<00:00:43.140> hearing<00:00:43.379> things<00:00:43.649> clearer<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.309> was

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
I was hearing things clearer I was

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.330 
I was hearing things clearer I was
seeing<00:00:44.820> things<00:00:45.120> more<00:00:45.390> vividly<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.320> my<00:00:46.890> thinking

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
seeing things more vividly I my thinking

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.700 
seeing things more vividly I my thinking
was<00:00:47.550> sharper<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:48.930> kind<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> when<00:00:49.680> I

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
was sharper and that was kind of when I

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.700 
was sharper and that was kind of when I
got<00:00:49.920> hooked<00:00:50.420> but<00:00:51.420> floating<00:00:51.719> offers<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.469> no

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
got hooked but floating offers that no

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.560 
got hooked but floating offers that no
other<00:00:52.920> service<00:00:53.250> out<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:53.820> does<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.510> a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
chance we really get to shut all of that

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.950 
chance we really get to shut all of that
off<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.970> offer<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.299> very<00:01:24.479> unique<00:01:24.810> environment

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
off we offer a very unique environment

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.230 
off we offer a very unique environment
where<00:01:25.560> people<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.920> go<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.280> turn<00:01:27.030> off

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
where people can go in turn off

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
where people can go in turn off
everything<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.200> actually<00:01:28.350> acts<00:01:28.740> like

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
everything and it actually acts like

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.649 
everything and it actually acts like
it's<00:01:29.159> rebooting<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.759> computer<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.540> like

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
it's rebooting your computer it's like

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.590 
it's rebooting your computer it's like
rebooting<00:01:30.960> your<00:01:31.110> whole<00:01:31.320> nervous<00:01:31.590> system<00:01:32.600> the

rebooting your whole nervous system the
thing<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.930> captivated<00:01:34.439> me<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> most<00:01:34.979> about

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
thing that captivated me the most about

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.990 
thing that captivated me the most about
floating<00:01:36.150> right<00:01:36.329> away<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.799> ability<00:01:38.340> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
floating right away was the ability to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.710 
floating right away was the ability to
isolate<00:01:39.720> your<00:01:40.439> mind<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:42.270> use<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.659> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
