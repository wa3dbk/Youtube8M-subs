has a 7 inch across LCD TFT screen and
1024<00:00:28.920> by<00:00:29.039> 600<00:00:29.369> pixels<00:00:29.939> resolution<00:00:30.240> that

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
1024 by 600 pixels resolution that

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.400 
1024 by 600 pixels resolution that
translates<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.260> about<00:00:31.349> 168<00:00:32.279> PPI<00:00:32.940> that's<00:00:33.809> not

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
translates to about 168 PPI that's not

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.889 
translates to about 168 PPI that's not
bad<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:35.010> not<00:00:35.070> mouth-watering<00:00:36.000> either<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.719> it

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
bad but not mouth-watering either so it

this device on a flat surface the sound

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.520 
this device on a flat surface the sound
gets<00:01:37.590> obstructed<00:01:38.119> so<00:01:39.170> even<00:01:40.170> when<00:01:40.320> you're
