00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.840
 hello hello today we are you 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.150
 presents a game then totally playful 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.759
 and electronics etc for all 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.070
 children from 5 to 9 years old comes and 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.230
 him it's a pinball not a real 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.449
 pinball of course adapted to the size of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.100
 kids it's still a toy it's called 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.140
 the pinball stars of the brand 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.510
 oxybul so obviously how does that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.590
 walk it's very simple it's about 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.720
 shoot the agly teachers and reach sin 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.800
 that she does not fall back with the small 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.589
 keys on the side 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.280
 in short, here is a real scare in 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:46.799
 watching on sound demonstrations 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.140
 sound is gone here then there is 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.670
 the version without noise without doing anything and 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:59.030
 now here's to see if we're doing it 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:02.460
 something it was at their gold basement 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.960
 So this game it's 100% winning 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.939
 children are having fun 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.159
 we put it in the middle of a room they are 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.710
 all like around a jar of honey and he 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.660
 really have fun ah yes so that's 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.030
 a real plus but I still have a 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.010
 true - and you can imagine that's the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.300
 sound side because you're going 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.000
 ask all parents who have had 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.160
 there is a moment when it is more possible 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 we have to put the sound if we 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.650
 is not there is actually a button 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.120
 on off 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.020
 but here look what it makes a 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.020
 stealth look 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.259
 so that's the samson version you 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.700
 had the sound version the version 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.090
 penalty it's just not possible 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.250
 so here's a real big fault is the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.850
 obligatory sound side because what is 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.500
 what's going to happen 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.750
 and obviously the parents will 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.420
 crack and the game will end up at 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.070
 closet background well hidden exactly 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.610
 necessarily all parents 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.240
 end up so two so low blow for 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.670
 to finish is a good game 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.070
 not sure because here are the parents going 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.450
 crack you've been told and so by 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.330
 the kids are going to be a little punished 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.489
 will not have played them so even if that 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.110
 actually does even though it's very 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.700
 fun for children having fun 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.530
 really a lot that's definitely 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.600
 a really they have fun is what we 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.459
 is really forced to create games 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.470
 that please deserving children 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.720
 which hinders all their environment 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.080
 not sure we're not sure so you 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.630
 have understood it we are not mega fan on 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.060
 not recommend the really strong 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.830
 brother you to see not too much of you from 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.790
