okay<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.550> first<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:33.000> them<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.930> small<00:00:34.140> 1/10

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
okay the first of them is a small 1/10

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.500 
okay the first of them is a small 1/10
it<00:00:34.920> might<00:00:35.190> remind<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.940> something<00:00:36.210> if<00:00:36.480> you

puzzles<00:00:40.170> because<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.710> looks<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:42.390> one

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
puzzles because it looks so like the one

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.889 
puzzles because it looks so like the one
that<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.110> proud<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:44.309> salt<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.030> it's

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that was so proud to have salt and it's

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.709 
that was so proud to have salt and it's
actually<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:47.460> same<00:00:47.670> kind<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.059> puzzle<00:00:48.450> it's

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
actually the same kind of puzzle it's

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.580 
actually the same kind of puzzle it's
just<00:00:49.379> smaller<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.660> it<00:00:51.660> works<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> same<00:00:52.140> way

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
just smaller and it works the same way

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.880 
just smaller and it works the same way
do<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.129> smaller<00:00:53.690> easier<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.140> course<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.559> got

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
do it smaller easier and of course I got

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.540 
do it smaller easier and of course I got
it<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:58.170> instructions<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.949> didn't

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
it with the instructions but I didn't

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.740 
it with the instructions but I didn't
need<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.789> read<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> instructions<00:01:00.600> because

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
need to read the instructions because

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.190 
need to read the instructions because
it's<00:01:01.109> exactly<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.129> same<00:01:02.340> way<00:01:02.579> put<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:06.200> it's

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
it's exactly the same way put it it's

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.649 
it's exactly the same way put it it's
the<00:01:07.500> same<00:01:07.770> way<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.760> might<00:01:09.420> recognize

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the same way that you might recognize

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.539 
the same way that you might recognize
the<00:01:10.320> same<00:01:11.750> three<00:01:12.750> long<00:01:13.260> pieces<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.520> have

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the same three long pieces that you have

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.870 
the same three long pieces that you have
to<00:01:14.700> put<00:01:14.909> together<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.799> after<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.640> even

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
to put together and after it's it's even

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.370 
to put together and after it's it's even
easier<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.720> don't<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.140> wonder

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
easier because you don't have to wonder

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.640 
easier because you don't have to wonder
about<00:01:19.560> them<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> likely<00:01:22.200> slightly

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
about them you know the likely slightly

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.440 
about them you know the likely slightly
smaller<00:01:23.070> pieces<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.670> were<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.180> there<00:01:24.360> were

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
smaller pieces that were in there were

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.570 
smaller pieces that were in there were
six<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.140> they<00:01:26.130> were<00:01:26.189> all<00:01:26.400> different

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
six of them and they were all different

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.190 
six of them and they were all different
here<00:01:26.970> everything<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> same<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.020> of

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
here everything is the same and of

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.850 
here everything is the same and of
course<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.590> recognize<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.820> key<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.860> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
course you recognize the key and the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.840 
course you recognize the key and the
small<00:01:32.100> ones<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.180> I'll<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.750> partly<00:01:34.110> because

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
small ones so I'll do it partly because

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.679 
small ones so I'll do it partly because
it's<00:01:35.850> um<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:37.020> not<00:01:37.140> much<00:01:37.380> difficult<00:01:38.689> anymore

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it's um it's not much difficult anymore

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.950 
it's um it's not much difficult anymore
for<00:01:40.049> me<00:01:41.420> hopefully

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.410 

should<00:01:48.920> be<00:01:49.070> something<00:01:49.340> like<00:01:49.520> that<00:01:50.380> like<00:01:51.380> this

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
should be something like that like this

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.750 
should be something like that like this
this<00:01:53.420> one<00:01:53.600> goes<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:53.960> way<00:01:54.790> okay<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:56.600> one<00:01:56.930> step

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
this one goes this way okay so one step

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.850 
this one goes this way okay so one step
that's<00:01:58.760> wrong

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
that's wrong

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.710 
that's wrong
well<00:02:00.860> excuse<00:02:01.460> me<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:01.910> is<00:02:02.090> always<00:02:02.300> a<00:02:02.480> tricky

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
well excuse me this is always a tricky

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.510 
well excuse me this is always a tricky
part<00:02:03.050> because<00:02:03.800> you<00:02:03.920> have<00:02:04.010> lots<00:02:04.160> of<00:02:04.340> different

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
part because you have lots of different

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.810 
part because you have lots of different
orientations<00:02:05.390> possible<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:06.680> I<00:02:07.220> think<00:02:07.280> this

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
orientations possible and I think this

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.320 
orientations possible and I think this
one<00:02:08.030> goes<00:02:08.060> like<00:02:08.510> this<00:02:10.480> no<00:02:11.480> it's<00:02:12.380> not<00:02:13.330> centered

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
one goes like this no it's not centered

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.740 
one goes like this no it's not centered
so<00:02:15.320> this<00:02:15.530> one<00:02:15.710> might<00:02:15.980> goes<00:02:16.280> like<00:02:16.520> that's<00:02:16.940> this

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
so this one might goes like that's this

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.290 
so this one might goes like that's this
one<00:02:17.960> was<00:02:18.140> like<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:18.710> one<00:02:18.890> goes<00:02:19.100> like

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
one was like that this one goes like

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.530 
one was like that this one goes like
this<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.590> think<00:02:21.830> I'm<00:02:22.550> done<00:02:22.970> for<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.300> first

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
this and I think I'm done for the first

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.320 
this and I think I'm done for the first
first<00:02:24.230> step<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:25.190> then<00:02:25.340> after<00:02:25.670> our<00:02:25.700> after<00:02:26.150> that

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
first step and then after our after that

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.720 
first step and then after our after that
everything<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:28.280> very<00:02:28.580> easy<00:02:30.160> because<00:02:31.160> you

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
everything is is very easy because you

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.380 
everything is is very easy because you
just<00:02:31.790> might<00:02:32.210> want<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.810> do<00:02:33.080> like<00:02:33.350> this<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.940> key

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
just might want to do like this the key

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.780 
just might want to do like this the key
here

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:51.490 

here<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:42.260> thing<00:02:42.640> here<00:02:45.850> there<00:02:48.820> here

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
here the thing here there here

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.780 

he's<00:03:16.060> open<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:18.040> one<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:21.250> one

he's open this one that one
turn<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.630> over<00:03:23.350> it's<00:03:23.920> almost<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.310> same

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
turn it over it's almost the same

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.310 
turn it over it's almost the same
processor<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.090> other<00:03:25.240> one<00:03:25.420> that<00:03:25.600> notch<00:03:25.960> much

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
processor the other one that notch much

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:34.680 
processor the other one that notch much
simpler<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:30.270> that's<00:03:31.270> it<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:34.150> turn<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.480> key

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
simpler and that's it you turn the key

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.880 
simpler and that's it you turn the key
to<00:03:35.050> close<00:03:35.170> everything<00:03:37.200> too<00:03:38.200> much<00:03:38.350> difficult

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
to close everything too much difficult

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.030 
to close everything too much difficult
okay<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:39.970> then<00:03:40.420> you'll<00:03:40.570> have<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.990> same<00:03:41.830> one

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040

as the big one I have hopefully slightly

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.690
