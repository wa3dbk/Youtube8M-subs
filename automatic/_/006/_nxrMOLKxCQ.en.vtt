00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.590
 I do not understand why PS3 played Ajax, because I can here 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.380
 read through the relay run no but the guards crown 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:33.109
 this jury is as soon as you play a few days they re-checked package control 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.790
 stuck and it just feels 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.790
 such a small declaration made as prevented 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.100
 what I do a lot to another child's size under someone else we do is right 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.200

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.670
 and a church year is fun 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.440
 And by the way, you really just don't look like this when you go 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.410
 ever 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.570
 that place is the animal game play knew both corpses came with pcm 34 i think 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.710

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.810

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.540
 his friends parra to be this demo 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.540
 if you i have new music coach 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.060
 firmly more 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.820
 bolat that makes no sense 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.820
 it's not a mistake you hold focused 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.640
 but I have something to shorten again 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.470
 true 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.370
 a number of charities after a receipt 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.140
 the kinkobra and citrix l 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.450
 they hit the car against a man from the shop 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.300
 but the nothing to do we have to go to the quest does I know other side 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.300
 tackle ladies of the crates on the island 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.890
 for a conversation 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.200
 oh oh shit east seat with second room strong 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.330
 we are in the arena immediately 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.280
 quickly itself still says that I do not in two weeks does the interest better 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.350
 see 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.310
 that came out better when mauro reflected chose spee 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.540
 I thought the booklet whatsapp 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.659
 it's all welcome 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.940
 optical illusion 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.190
 3m 0 or three to not find one in order with 3 0 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.519
 the time is ripe is a theme that we divorce you is also rapper 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:20.479
 but i will play one i think never after this as hers might ever be the 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:22.599
 chain for the role of three for the 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.599
 I have with that to the 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.169
 arrested and become 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:29.439
 me neither 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.709
 and I still have liander behind us 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.189
 that couples derail if not 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.189
 there would only be one graceful then they jumped yes 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.039
 the children had gone but he did not cry 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.749
 if you have a code for the whole week even though those times I can't do much 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.869
 7 nobody on 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:49.979
 only one thing 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:52.379
 but you 12 percent to the EPD 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.689
 but I say I have at a bakery that file in pigeons the beautiful aka 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.239
 what a better look too many of these breda came to make a 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:05.279
 aka the shins 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.279
 Always see that they are also guided by what the profession 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.219
 nice article 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:15.460
 also all tour must 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.930
 I am once again playing something different that he means is indeed not 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.060
 to that 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.060
 kemp i don't exit that i think they are 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.680
 not all people who have but no weapons 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.680
 we will therefore be barista then i think if you have that idea 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:34.019
 And so you would basically opinion that campina if you have the ten playground iris 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.479
 residents if I live 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:38.789
 with the riders not having the games that are all there just like me 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.789
 then i guess you are not going to get any further but 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.599
 If you are a serious player then guess the time you will be too 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.449
 and I just think we have the best odds 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.549
 the paterstraat site 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.549
 if they had not happened 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.159
 nevertheless, I am attic in the workers' profession that I can do now 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.059
 don't think not on deck 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:02.969
 approach precisely for that reason 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.329
 he walked around the aex i was already stuck taking that and all that crap 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:10.739
 very quickly 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.819
 oh well god opinion 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.819
 marijke sharpen the buoy no this max in race 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.549
 look old paper reaches it is an out until the i don't care but if you 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.770
 just a stubble comment you have to external the models and it comes that 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.729
 I want to search close 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.159
 and not at all that jan people can be seen better 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.550
 also at the widest it was as a drawback like that opel 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.030
 and I know stagnation but on the breese the four the colors are so much better and 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.749
 more time the doors are looking from the outside in 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:43.909
 today that is the intention or black you look nothing and it really fun 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.620
 it is resistant 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.409
 if your pants are il 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:51.699
 and the zeeuw is a series of teeth that you see the other way around for modernization 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.270
 if you come from 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.729
 looking in from the inside is in albi but you don't see them in the 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.580
 tub 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.759
 we have to 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.759
 not easy and nobody 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.449
 if you 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.550
 market it is the past nooij 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.089
 This should be a serious second time to Pakistan 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.270
 he doesn't know yet 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.099
 on the playstation 3 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.999
 I find it wait and see more I think he does not want to be on and that too 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:28.439
 Ticks Espelo because it is just a proper devices actually 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:31.499
 And I also have a part that I cannot put that on 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:34.499
 two 44 children on CD a few quarters 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.420
 so I have the best this the playstation 3 and that is best discovered to us 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.969
 kindle countries 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.689
 but yes that prevents you from having fun 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:47.409
 and that seemed to find us behind the front door I think it's free for sometime 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:49.159
 but never again 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.699
 therefore be serious and it is also something shortage maybe I have something too 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.819
 that too old toys i say yes i played way to cover budget limit 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:56.979
 margo around 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.070
 and I ten jack handicap a stunt but from those from Kooten who liked it 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.909
 if you have nice noise complaints 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:05.560
 and almere when you see the world and cry there once
