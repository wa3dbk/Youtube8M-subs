00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.490
 they will take me 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.619
 I'm chunk today I'm here for 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.170
 to present you a new fashion the fashion of 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.170
 today the amnesia lines mod 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.480
 let's start right away because I chose this one 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.000
 fashion is a fashion that does not include many 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.850
 things, however, I especially like for 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 some dynamic lights and above all for 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.739
 how lights work this way 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.480
 so let's see it right away 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.160
 I wanted to tell you something as I noticed 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 that in the moon these many have said 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 piece enough series so many the usual ones 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.260
 four five boys if not there 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.840
 affect the series you don't watch 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.610
 true that in the past or I have not finished 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.129
 many series but I simply did it 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.050
 because I saw that they were bored then 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.199
 rather than bring you something you don't 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.240
 look I choose not to do it except 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.270
 I do something because you don't 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.920
 you want so I always try always 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.530
 to satisfy you in a few words 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.660
 time but I would like to try to bring 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.210
 forward a series and then finish it by 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.549
 courtesy follow it and who does not want to 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.340
 follow her don't worry I continue it 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.380
 the same I'm sorry but I do it for 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.970
 all the other people they want 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.909
 see a series and have it to me 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.290
 asked then let's go and see what's there 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.119
 introduces this mode as per name 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.580
 this fashion introduces us a criterion that 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.780
 I don't know what the hello creeper is doing anyway 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.909
 no it does not produce us that the hyper is not there 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.280
 worry, it introduces lots of lights 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.770
 who have different uses 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.850
 if you can't understand a lot of things there is 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.380
 however this object which is amnesia 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.780
 lights encyclopedia that you kraft has with 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.990
 a bouquet a fat that would be fat 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.899
 which is made with a piece of meat that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.520
 contains all the features all 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.810
 blocks that introduces all that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.799
 there is what you need to know 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.299
 you find it here ok explanation of each 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.459
 object is how it is found then 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.869
 very easy we go to see all the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.739
 objects that introduce us are really 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.500
 many and are various the first object is the 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.260
 at light torch which will then be light 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.989
 when it is turned on, that is, turned on 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.580
 secret with a speech and a torch 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.350
 cloth scratching with one 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.330
 the inter or that which also comes 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.880
 introduced by the fashion kraft a 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.890
 cooking the fact that kraft is cooked 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.530
 that is, in this way, to get there 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.440
 you'll have to craft a lot of stuff like 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.750
 This works because the beautiful torches 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.100
 we position it and turn it on with 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.620
 a very simple click 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.470
 look at tac when we no longer have 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.970
 need click again turn off this 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.400
 what is very nice because minecraft 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.080
 you know that torches just endless too 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.000
 if it should not be so then 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.930
 I especially like this fashion for 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.870
 these mechanics 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.420
 then we also have the candlestick 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.880
 you can turn it off but it is 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.180
 differently with four rings 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.070
 torch2 fells and a plane languages ​​lo 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.070
 let's position for example here 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.200
 look at it we light it as you see 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.450
 the light is made very very well yes 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.760
 is a lot of propagating blocks 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.020
 beautiful as decoration like biblio kraft 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.820
 you know that bike that we are 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.310
 introduces many decorative blocks 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.580
 here's what we have this one 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.110
 object the ITER roof lantern that 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.410
 kraft has very much this way 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.080
 easy to activate this to the iter the 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.239
 roof lantern is positioned in this way 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.250
 wait maybe we do the 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.260
 place here and turn it on 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.630
 we need this item when 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.090
 we are logically in survival, that is, of 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.070
 kinder box that kraft and in this way 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.060
 he's a lighter type 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:55.120
 ok just not the exact translation 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.480
 so I know how to do key 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.530
 right and turn on we see the effect of 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.090
 sorry night times set 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.540
 twenty thousand the night effect is a lot 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.900
 very nice light there is really nice 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.400
 as amnesia that is not a strong light 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.320
 light a little soft but made 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.630
 really good if we turn it off as you see 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.850
 the effect is normal I really like the 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.340
 light so then let's go back a moment 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.300
 day times set a thousand and I do you 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.169
 see the other objects 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.910
 we have the lantern the lantern where not 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.280
 we can hold the ugly thing in our hands 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.620
 this we must necessarily position it 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.070
 how do we use the lantern 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.720
 it should be filled with ancient oil 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.180
 casey kraft has this way cooking 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.700
 always bang the fat that Kraft has 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.890
 in this way we fill it up until it does 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.270
 you tell us that the lantern is full 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.730
 and we turn it on with a click 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.700
 even here I show you the other one too 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.680
 the bullseye lantern this fills up 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.780
 always with lantern oil e 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.540
 we light it the only one I don't know how 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.800
 Does flashlight I'm going to 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.630
 see a moment as it should 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.550
 work because I looked for it but not 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:07.460
 I understand to you it is not possible to karina ho 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.980
 understood how it worked I show it 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.370
 then let's put a day on me 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.150
 I always get confused by game mode 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.620
 we do time set 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.270
 twenty thousand admitted 2000 well twenty thousand 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.950
 perfect 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.250
 look here a pretty light too 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.660
 soft made very well yellow I like it 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.130
 let's see unlike the torches 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.440
 however I believe this is an effect 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.940
 given by it is more beautiful 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.240
 I must say that more beautiful and less less 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.550
 turned on than the normal one I like best 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.280
 perfect then we break and put 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.010
 perfect day and I'll show you 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.990
 now the flashlight does not flash 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.410
 so it cannot be placed on the ground 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.790
 eva turned on by the batteries that 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.880
 they are introduced precisely from this 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.880
 fashion you see these as we do 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:04.410
 we put here and with a crafting or 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:07.980
 using crafting within the 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.740
 menu here we re-enter the flashlight e 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.350
 we can use it by clicking f 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.100
 look, there was no energy like 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.840
 there is no energy 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.370
 what is the maximum wait there is something 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.850
 that does not work 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.850
 let's see second 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:31.390
 ah no I didn't wait for the ballet 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:32.650
 flashlight object crafting event 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.030
 we have it 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.150
 because it tells me it is not turned on 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.160
 wait then let's see now 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.320
 the flashlight that cannot be 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.700
 positioned earth and look like 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.140
 it works just like mine amnesia 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.160
 beautiful the beautiful thing about this fashion 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.330
 and above all this animation where here 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.460
 look at the elevation of the light that is 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.040
 move with us this is a great cool 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.110
 you see a lot but very beautiful because the 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.030
 light does not become much stronger when 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.560
 we approach but it remains so already me 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.110
 especially like this 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.720
 look makes the environment just bleak 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:10.810
 beautiful and more then introduces us 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.060
 this is also the miner method he has 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.490
 the same effect varied loaded with the 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.740
 battery and we put it in our heads 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.120
 now I'm creative so it works 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.520
 the same we put it in our heads 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.410
 we click the key but it is not 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.660
 recharged unfortunately okay we have to 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:28.180
 recharge it and this also makes a light 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.310
 just like the flashlight thing 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.870
 nice of the miner's helmet is that 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.280
 logically it doesn't hold a hand 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.270
 occupied then the other with the other 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.490
 we can dig 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.110
 logically the miner method is one 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.540
 fashion and very beautiful that I recommend to everyone 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.430
 then try it download it because 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.140
 makes minecraft a little more 

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.300
 realistic thanks to these lights 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.940
