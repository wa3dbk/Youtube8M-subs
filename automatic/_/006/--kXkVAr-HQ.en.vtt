did<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.780> think<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> platforming<00:02:01.920> action<00:02:02.100> and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
did I think the platforming action and

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.149 
did I think the platforming action and
RPG<00:02:03.359> elements<00:02:03.780> worked<00:02:03.990> well<00:02:04.229> together<00:02:04.439> but

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
RPG elements worked well together but

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.590 
RPG elements worked well together but
the<00:02:05.250> real<00:02:05.399> strength<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.909> these<00:02:06.000> games<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the real strength of these games is the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.930 
the real strength of these games is the
platforming<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.679> classic<00:02:08.190> Capcom<00:02:08.610> at<00:02:08.789> its
