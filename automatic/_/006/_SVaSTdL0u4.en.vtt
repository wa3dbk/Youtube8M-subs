00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:17.490 

now<00:02:07.189> that<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:08.000> cool

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:03:02.809 

very<00:02:18.280> realistic<00:02:18.940> flying<00:02:19.180> through<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.420> crowds

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:21.390 

now<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.230> awesome

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.520 

just<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.329> quick<00:03:22.510> note<00:03:22.720> still<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.110> few<00:03:23.379> issues

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
just a quick note still a few issues

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.020 
just a quick note still a few issues
with<00:03:24.370> prepared<00:03:25.360> v2<00:03:26.519> initially<00:03:27.519> I<00:03:27.549> had<00:03:27.640> a<00:03:27.790> bunch

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
with prepared v2 initially I had a bunch

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.259 
with prepared v2 initially I had a bunch
of<00:03:28.150> issues<00:03:28.540> with<00:03:28.569> trees<00:03:29.260> disappearing<00:03:30.269> and

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
of issues with trees disappearing and

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.259 
of issues with trees disappearing and
turning<00:03:31.629> into<00:03:31.900> really<00:03:32.079> ugly<00:03:32.290> objects<00:03:33.060> seem<00:03:34.060> to

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
turning into really ugly objects seem to

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.830 
turning into really ugly objects seem to
have<00:03:34.390> correct<00:03:34.750> at<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:35.110> issue<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:37.720> only

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
have correct at that issue and it only

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.069 
have correct at that issue and it only
seems<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.319> work<00:03:38.439> with<00:03:38.620> third-party<00:03:40.079> sceneries

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
seems to work with third-party sceneries

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.800 
seems to work with third-party sceneries
so<00:03:41.530> that's<00:03:42.010> something<00:03:42.670> that<00:03:42.790> seems<00:03:43.359> like<00:03:43.599> it's

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
so that's something that seems like it's

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.030 
so that's something that seems like it's
soft<00:03:43.989> but<00:03:44.140> I'm<00:03:44.349> still<00:03:44.620> kind<00:03:44.799> of<00:03:44.829> playing

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
soft but I'm still kind of playing

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.599 
soft but I'm still kind of playing
around<00:03:45.189> with<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:47.040> one<00:03:48.040> of<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.220> issues<00:03:48.250> I

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
around with that one of the issues I

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.660 
around with that one of the issues I
have<00:03:48.790> right<00:03:49.000> now<00:03:49.209> my<00:03:50.140> installed<00:03:50.620> Orbix<00:03:51.159> FTX

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
have right now my installed Orbix FTX

pnw all the cheese are present but it

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.220 
pnw all the cheese are present but it
seems<00:03:54.159> that<00:03:54.310> there<00:03:54.609> are<00:03:54.730> some<00:03:54.940> houses<00:03:55.780> in

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
seems that there are some houses in

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.490 
seems that there are some houses in
building<00:03:56.650> auto<00:03:57.010> Jim<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.519> has<00:03:57.670> disappeared

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.790 

still<00:04:02.500> working<00:04:02.859> on<00:04:02.980> that

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.740 

but<00:04:09.370> for<00:04:09.550> now<00:04:09.580> just<00:04:09.910> running<00:04:10.240> a<00:04:10.300> test<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.720> the

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
but for now just running a test of the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.390 
but for now just running a test of the
clouds<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:11.440> what<00:04:11.560> it's<00:04:11.710> like<00:04:11.830> to<00:04:12.010> fly<00:04:12.130> through

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
clouds and what it's like to fly through

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.570 
clouds and what it's like to fly through
some<00:04:12.640> of<00:04:12.730> these<00:04:12.820> clouds<00:04:13.120> in<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.390> p3<00:04:13.840> dv2<00:04:14.380> and<00:04:14.800> i

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
some of these clouds in the p3 dv2 and i

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.210 
some of these clouds in the p3 dv2 and i
have<00:04:15.700> to<00:04:15.850> say<00:04:16.000> just<00:04:16.269> these<00:04:16.870> clouds<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.950> then

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
have to say just these clouds and then

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.520 
have to say just these clouds and then
out<00:04:18.400> themselves<00:04:18.640> or<00:04:19.239> probably<00:04:20.019> worth<00:04:20.320> the

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
out themselves or probably worth the

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.250 
out themselves or probably worth the
switch<00:04:20.769> from<00:04:20.950> fsx<00:04:21.580> i<00:04:24.690> mean<00:04:25.690> that's<00:04:25.870> just<00:04:26.140> very

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
switch from fsx i mean that's just very

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.950 
switch from fsx i mean that's just very
realistic<00:04:27.190> i<00:04:27.400> know<00:04:27.820> i<00:04:28.000> can't<00:04:28.360> capture<00:04:28.570> it<00:04:28.780> very

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
realistic i know i can't capture it very

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.550 
realistic i know i can't capture it very
well<00:04:29.140> on<00:04:29.290> my<00:04:29.410> iphone<00:04:29.830> but<00:04:30.840> take<00:04:31.840> my<00:04:32.020> word<00:04:32.050> for

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
well on my iphone but take my word for

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.930 
well on my iphone but take my word for
it<00:04:33.690> flying<00:04:34.690> through<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.020> clouds<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:36.220> it<00:04:36.580> is

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
it flying through the clouds is it is

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.540 
it flying through the clouds is it is
quite<00:04:37.270> realistic<00:04:37.660> here<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.230> i<00:04:38.290> think<00:04:38.560> i'll<00:04:39.340> be

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
quite realistic here and i think i'll be

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.880 
quite realistic here and i think i'll be
doing<00:04:39.700> a<00:04:39.910> lot<00:04:40.090> of<00:04:40.150> flying<00:04:40.540> around<00:04:41.140> cloud<00:04:41.620> level

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
doing a lot of flying around cloud level

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.550 
doing a lot of flying around cloud level
just<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.460> experience<00:04:42.910> this<00:04:43.210> will<00:04:44.140> go<00:04:44.350> through

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
just to experience this will go through

00:04:44.560 --> 00:05:04.690 
just to experience this will go through
one<00:04:44.740> more<00:04:44.920> cloud<00:04:45.190> set<00:04:45.490> here

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.440 

and<00:05:04.910> just<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.900> note<00:05:06.640> these<00:05:07.640> are<00:05:07.820> not<00:05:07.940> stutters

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
and just a note these are not stutters

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.060 
and just a note these are not stutters
you're<00:05:08.600> saying<00:05:08.840> this<00:05:09.020> is<00:05:09.200> my<00:05:09.230> shaking<00:05:09.740> hand

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
you're saying this is my shaking hand

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:26.210 
you're saying this is my shaking hand
holding<00:05:10.430> my<00:05:10.580> iPhone<00:05:11.030> so<00:05:11.620> just<00:05:12.620> for<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.830> record

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220
