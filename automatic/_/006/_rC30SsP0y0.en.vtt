00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
so go into the McKinley circuit I mean

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.360 
so go into the McKinley circuit I mean
look<00:02:15.050> at<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:15.580> really<00:02:16.580> good<00:02:18.370> it's

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
look at that that is really good it's

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.720 
look at that that is really good it's
actually<00:02:19.520> ridiculously<00:02:20.209> fun<00:02:20.450> as<00:02:20.600> well<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.640> you

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
actually ridiculously fun as well so you

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.600 
actually ridiculously fun as well so you
can<00:02:22.850> see<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.150> uses<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.920> accelerometer<00:02:24.920> to

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
can see it uses the accelerometer to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.970 
can see it uses the accelerometer to
turn<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:26.870> got<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.050> try<00:02:27.290> not<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.620> move<00:02:27.800> this

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
turn so I got to try not to move this

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.440 
turn so I got to try not to move this
too<00:02:28.160> much<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:28.459> you<00:02:28.520> can<00:02:28.670> still<00:02:28.880> see<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:31.450> very

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
too much so you can still see it very

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.479 
too much so you can still see it very
smooth<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.230> there's<00:02:33.470> not<00:02:33.620> any<00:02:33.830> lag<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
smooth is there's not any lag and the

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.350 
smooth is there's not any lag and the
controls<00:02:34.910> are<00:02:35.060> actually<00:02:35.360> really<00:02:35.660> good<00:02:37.360> now

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
controls are actually really good now

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.640 
controls are actually really good now
probably<00:02:38.569> doing<00:02:38.780> pretty<00:02:38.959> bad<00:02:39.170> because<00:02:39.380> this

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
probably doing pretty bad because this

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.170 
probably doing pretty bad because this
is<00:02:39.800> on<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> slant<00:02:40.489> for<00:02:40.760> me<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:45.530> yeah<00:02:46.070> I<00:02:46.400> was<00:02:47.030> get

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
is on a slant for me so yeah I was get

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.720 
is on a slant for me so yeah I was get

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
reason that takes full advantage of the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.270

stuff I just got out of that but you
know<00:03:40.950> how<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.280> works<00:03:41.490> so<00:03:42.209> basically<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.660> main

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
know how it works so basically the main

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.630 
know how it works so basically the main
augmentations<00:03:43.320> our<00:03:43.680> internal<00:03:44.190> with<00:03:44.459> of

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
augmentations our internal with of

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.910 
augmentations our internal with of
course<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.120> external<00:03:45.630> editions<00:03:46.080> those<00:03:46.620> being

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
course to external editions those being

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.620 
course to external editions those being
the<00:03:47.100> camera<00:03:47.550> and<00:03:47.790> different<00:03:48.209> colors<00:03:48.600> and

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
the camera and different colors and

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.750 
the camera and different colors and
design<00:03:49.140> overall<00:03:49.980> though<00:03:50.160> not<00:03:50.400> much<00:03:50.520> has

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
design overall though not much has

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.190 
design overall though not much has
changed<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.330> to<00:03:51.450> be<00:03:51.540> honest<00:03:51.840> if<00:03:51.930> you're<00:03:52.050> happy

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
changed and to be honest if you're happy

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.809 
changed and to be honest if you're happy
with<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.470> iPad<00:03:52.800> you<00:03:52.950> have<00:03:53.100> there<00:03:53.340> is<00:03:53.430> no<00:03:53.580> real

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
with the iPad you have there is no real

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.580 
with the iPad you have there is no real
reason<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.209> upgrade<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:55.020> main<00:03:55.170> difference

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
reason to upgrade the main difference

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.800 
reason to upgrade the main difference
between<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.040> two<00:03:56.250> are<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.940> additional<00:03:57.330> perks

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
between the two are the additional perks

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.720 
between the two are the additional perks
that<00:03:58.020> come<00:03:58.200> with<00:03:58.260> having<00:03:58.470> an<00:03:58.800> ipad<00:03:59.100> 2<00:03:59.340> like<00:03:59.610> the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
that come with having an ipad 2 like the

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.020 
that come with having an ipad 2 like the
Smart<00:04:00.030> Cover<00:04:00.239> option<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.380> camera<00:04:01.940> now<00:04:02.940> of

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
Smart Cover option and the camera now of

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.550 
Smart Cover option and the camera now of
course<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.780> reason<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.080> didn't<00:04:04.260> include<00:04:04.440> the

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
course the reason I didn't include the

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.530 
course the reason I didn't include the
processor<00:04:05.250> or<00:04:05.430> graphics<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.150> because<00:04:06.420> those

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
processor or graphics is because those

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.780 
processor or graphics is because those
upgrades<00:04:06.959> are<00:04:07.170> quite<00:04:07.380> subtle<00:04:07.709> for<00:04:08.370> now<00:04:08.550> and

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
upgrades are quite subtle for now and

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.520 
upgrades are quite subtle for now and
they<00:04:08.850> aren't<00:04:09.090> fully<00:04:09.390> utilize<00:04:09.900> they'll<00:04:10.410> be

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
they aren't fully utilize they'll be

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.750 
they aren't fully utilize they'll be
honest<00:04:10.830> I<00:04:10.920> don't<00:04:11.010> really<00:04:11.160> see<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.519> massive

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
honest I don't really see a massive

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.060 
honest I don't really see a massive
speed<00:04:12.180> difference<00:04:12.510> between<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.050> two<00:04:13.260> that

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
speed difference between the two that

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.280 
speed difference between the two that
could<00:04:14.220> change<00:04:14.430> over<00:04:14.700> time<00:04:14.970> as<00:04:15.209> people<00:04:15.600> use<00:04:16.260> it

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
could change over time as people use it

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.170
