00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.549
 hello future masters continue 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.410
 my series of video tutorials 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:19.420
 Today we have such a pretty useful 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.650
 from the practical point of view to 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.930
 such a lesson about the offset from the line of attack I 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.060
 I'll show you how this up to boxing is called 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.910
 side step 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.090
 also secret wrestlers this 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.730
 called that dog this is not thai 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.640
 dogs are just the name of that dog 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.060
 yes it was interesting and funny to me 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.040
 but what people do not think up to tighten 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.560
 their secret schools 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.590
 Well, the essence is all the same, it's just 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.350
 leaving the line of attack and continuing your 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.880
 attacks or to soften the blow when all 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.880
 will now you will see 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.850
 fronter 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.600
 Now I will explain how this is done before 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.880
 offsets from the attack line or side step 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.369
 Leopard this with a blow mostly done at 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.560
 us a little bit different specificity or 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.280
 that dog yes as oriental 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.770
 martial arts there they call it all well by 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.259
 Essentially, this is just an offset, that is, at the beginning 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.090
 before 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.049
 your main task is to leave with 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.720
 striker up to the enemy who 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.690
 attacks for example if your your going a 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.780
 so yes it does not matter that is, you there are like 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.929
 dvoechku catch or throw a pass, not all 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.560
 Equal will answer was not well he will 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.200
 answer 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.840
 boxing usually try to spin go 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.569
 behind your back constantly move in thai 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.750
 in all the more straightforward work then 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.509
 there is a front stance to a hard exchange 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.539
 punches try to get my hand 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:14.830
 throw less goes offset but this too 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.290
 very useful for the hands, Iâ€™ll see 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.910
 opponent represents her daughter 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.269
 answers straight I'm leaving 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.030
 see the whole punch goes straight to i'm leaving with 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.120
 attack lines and immediately answer my own 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.519
 I can answer with my own blow right away 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.549
 when loading and in open case but tone 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.640
 add the knees the same under the left 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:40.450
 I start my hand and immediately leave with 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:45.700
 the enemy is blocked by his visibility 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.889
 limited but trying to answer me 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.500
 anyway and he answers in that zone 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:53.799
 where did everything strike me right 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.550
 saw it closed and to the same answers I 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.220
 don't wait 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.210
 blow i do immediately gave birth immediately 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.820
 are shifting 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.300
 when already responding I have already shifted and 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.320
 here also disable either direct or under 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.010
 arm in the body 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.350
 same work goes on when 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.960
 the adversary attacks the same principle 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.050
 or he attacks will give here the front of me 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.990
 I try to get out of the line of attack 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.490
 and here I have a great opportunity for 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.420
 kicks 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.430
 he stands sideways uncomfortable, that is, I 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.340
 as if from the back a little bit right under 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.560
 hitting leg could knock 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.920
 body pierce the heel of options 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.790
 little left so dog you i'm leaving 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.330
 I immediately charge the water on my head right away 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.670
 minced meat 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.220
 and then load punch that is 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.680
 my options are pretty good too 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.790
 the very thing when the enemy hits 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.460
 the more I leave him right away just a little 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.790
 fail and here can already make your 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.610
 an attack that is, it is like 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.550
 offset from the attack line but it 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.870
 used pretty 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.640
 experienced fighters because you have to 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.530
 switch yourself 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.340
 sense of need to run away 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.790
 Yes, that is, usually when an attack is in progress 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.780
 try to just move away but the whole thing in 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:27.910
 the same far you will not work 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:31.060
 limited or ring or street and such 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.620
 walls trees there curb and some sort 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.570
 eat and constantly back up 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.390
 not always work out if you 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.889
 constant shifting here in a circle you 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.469
 stay on some circle 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.020
 and the gap but the adversary is yours 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.770
 chase he gets tired but he chases everything 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.139
 equal to you 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:53.840
 donate when - do not go in a circle 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:56.960
 embarrass you don't let him say so 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.150
 enter tough so because nothing 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.009
 so constantly around him is very hard 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.509
 and if there is work in a straight line these 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:10.219
 close just eat there is work on 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:13.039
 straight I can push until until 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:15.560
 he doesn't get into something or somewhere 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:22.069
 will rise that is, went it so and besides 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:24.830
 just close everything i went or takes 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:28.099
 or everything rakes out as soon as he goes there tab 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.969
 pressed immediately Cullens put and immediately 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:35.300
 nudity beats that is therefore offset 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:38.479
 this is one of the most important elements 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.870
 precisely avoiding the attack and 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.650
 work on the counterattack as well as from the legs 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.379
 as well as me here in this work 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.400
 do work then we finish 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.740
