shape which is just like that and then

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.470 
shape which is just like that and then
you're<00:00:22.500> gonna<00:00:22.590> want<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.920> leave<00:00:23.090> just<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.210> little

space open there for what we're gonna do

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.510 
space open there for what we're gonna do
is<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:27.990> connect<00:00:28.609> it<00:00:29.609> later<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.510> this

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
is just connect it later like this

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.030 
is just connect it later like this
you're<00:00:32.520> just<00:00:32.700> gonna<00:00:32.850> want<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.120> draw<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> few

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
you're just gonna want to draw a few

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.580 
you're just gonna want to draw a few
kind<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.100> spike<00:00:35.489> looking<00:00:35.940> things<00:00:36.440> just<00:00:37.440> like

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
kind of spike looking things just like

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.970 
kind of spike looking things just like
them<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:39.050> then<00:00:40.050> we're<00:00:40.559> gonna<00:00:40.680> want<00:00:40.920> to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
them and then we're gonna want to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280 
them and then we're gonna want to
connect<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.280> one<00:00:41.520> more<00:00:41.700> time<00:00:41.730> with<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.390> stem

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
connect that one more time with a stem

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.959 
connect that one more time with a stem
which<00:00:43.530> was<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.160> two<00:00:44.370> lines<00:00:44.640> there<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.680> then

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
which was just two lines there and then

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.740 
which was just two lines there and then
we<00:00:47.969> connect<00:00:48.239> those<00:00:48.559> with<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.890> teardrop<00:00:50.430> shape

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
we connect those with a teardrop shape

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.920 
we connect those with a teardrop shape
and<00:00:51.829> then<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.760> add<00:00:53.910> some<00:00:54.210> details<00:00:54.629> which

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and then we can add some details which

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.299 
and then we can add some details which
are<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.520> thinner<00:00:56.520> lines<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> inside

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
are just thinner lines on the inside

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.399 
are just thinner lines on the inside
that<00:00:59.309> look<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:02.100> after<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:03.409> we

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that look like that and after that we

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.960 
that look like that and after that we
can<00:01:04.559> start<00:01:04.769> drawing<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.280> face<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
can start drawing the face on the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.609 
can start drawing the face on the
jack-o'-lantern<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.810> there's<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.380> lot<00:01:07.530> of

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
jack-o'-lantern and there's a lot of

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.870 
jack-o'-lantern and there's a lot of
different<00:01:07.920> ways<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:08.729> what<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
different ways to do that but what I

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.109 
different ways to do that but what I
like<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.869> draw<00:01:10.820> triangles<00:01:11.820> I

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
like to do is just draw triangles I

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.880 
like to do is just draw triangles I
think<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.840> looks<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.229> best<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
think it looks the best and it's the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.109 
think it looks the best and it's the
simplest<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.220> draw<00:01:17.400> two<00:01:17.430> triangle

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
simplest so I just draw two triangle

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.810 
simplest so I just draw two triangle
eyes<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.780> color<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.350> black

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
eyes and then I color them in black

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.440 
eyes and then I color them in black
right<00:01:20.820> next<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> each<00:01:21.299> other<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.689> that

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
right next to each other like that

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.450 
right next to each other like that
and<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:26.060> draw<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> smaller<00:01:27.600> nose<00:01:28.460> triangle

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
and then I draw a smaller nose triangle

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.170 
and then I draw a smaller nose triangle
like<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:31.040> then<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> mouth<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.820> draw

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
like that and then for the mouth I draw

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.520 
like that and then for the mouth I draw
a<00:01:33.540> smile<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.530> then<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.759> leave<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> little<00:01:36.240> space

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
a smile and then I leave a little space

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.319 
a smile and then I leave a little space
for<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> buck<00:01:37.979> teeth<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:42.180> once

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
for a buck teeth like that and then once

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.899 
for a buck teeth like that and then once
you<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.810> done<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.700> just<00:01:44.700> color

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
you have that done you just color

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.319 
you have that done you just color
everything<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.840> didn't<00:01:46.850> I'm<00:01:47.850> inside

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
that and then I'm inside you're gonna

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.590 
that and then I'm inside you're gonna
want<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> draw<00:01:55.890> some<00:01:56.719> inner<00:01:57.719> lines<00:01:57.960> again<00:01:59.600> for

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
