00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:03.610
 Just a little bit 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.200
 This fall 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.720
 It was in a straight line 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.909
 This undecided 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:10.609
 I understood 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.609
 Cloud born 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.619
 One step height 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.720
 Figure 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.060
 It is not Mr. Sato 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.060
 Taito 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.500
 At least 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.470
 Joint 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.880
 High example 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.460
 I succumbed to the first half of last year 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.860
 Also forecast sales peak 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.360
 In addition, the said enclosure was carried out 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.740
 Tani Mikio 24 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.740
 I think that there is such a background 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.380
 City bank 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.240
 Specific support content 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.920
 I understood 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.830
 He is also Takasago Public Relations Manager 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.270
 Go perfect 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.070
 Will it go in 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.890
 End 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.160
 It continued 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.320
 I met with the loser 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.700
 Real on the net 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.310
 Same place 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 2 arrived 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.090
 Each group is targeted 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.450
 10,000 shares 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.560
 1. 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 End 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.509
 Then start up 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.350
 I'm talking chilly 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.750
 Unlike Japan 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.750
 Things I saw on TV 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.260
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics was included 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
 Network E ... 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.160
 14th 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.300
 3. 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.150
 q I 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.410
 Newly added 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.410
 Still 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.740
 Joint 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.740
 End 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.010
 On the other hand 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.300
 Divided into this epicenter area 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:14.569
 Debut in recent years 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.969
 pci 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.899
 for pc 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:21.329
 I have traded 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.609
 I'm getting bigger 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.609
 1. 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.639
 Opened the same day 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.639
 I tried to come in 9 times of 2-2 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.229
 For the purpose of investment solicitation 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:40.499
 Joint 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.069
 I feel relieved but
