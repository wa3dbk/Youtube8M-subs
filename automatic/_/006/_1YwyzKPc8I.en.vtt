00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.740
 to teach our proposal to 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.030
 stretching of the abductor muscles 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.060
 of the hip 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.640
 are three muscles some of them have 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.190
 a question more anterior to the axis of 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.560
 bending others more subsequent to that 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.010
 same efe therefore we are going to need 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.739
 different bending positions and 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.960
 Hip extension and trunk for 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.070
 build a complete stretch and 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.500
 effective 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.130
 let's start with the simple position 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.130
 initial 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.970
 flexion of the opposite leg 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.420
 stabilization of the pelvis 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.720
 and we can choose 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.750
 by trunk flexion 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.210
 with neutral lumbar spine in this way 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.860
 we insist more on the senior author than 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.190
 has an extension component of 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.190
 hip 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.440
 we can stay in neutral position and 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.320
 we can go 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.010
 towards the extension position of this 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.390
 way we are addressing the different 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.510
 muscular planes of the authors 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.580
 Another aspect to take into account is the 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.760
 contraction 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.780
 of our leg that could be so 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.350
 simple as 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.920
 to support to force hip hop to the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.900
 stretcher so that we have the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.940
 stretch on one side and at the same 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.369
 time the contraction of these same 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.409
 muscles that go towards the function of the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.860
 hip with which we would be doing 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.690
 an active tension stretch 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.040
 what is the recommended exercise for 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.620
 prepare the muscle before the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.580
 activity exercises before the 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.900
 shorter sports activity 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.930
 including the same exercise the 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.050
 stretching and contraction with it 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.660
 we managed to increase the temperature 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.080
 internal muscle and improve the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.180
 muscular vigilance between muscles 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.519
 agonists and antagonists 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.900
 thank you very much for your choice 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.730
 we await your comments and we 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.730
 we see in the following video
