00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.770

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.859
 [Music]

 here we have a magic sachet 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.059
 Let's check 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.010

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.679
 we have to fill it with boiling water 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.429
 to the line so we take e 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:06.570
 we stay with boiling water until 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:08.130
 get to the line so we pass 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.470
 slightly so that's here 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.080
 we cover everything was precise what we did 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.060
 had at this point let it rest 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.320
 for three minutes you pay attention 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.020
 attention to the graphics in 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.020
 3 minutes rest period 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.000
 so much so that we pass by brino we remember that 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.660
 what happens nothing 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.660
 nothing happens 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.230
 meanwhile let's see what is written e 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.720
 close with the perforated cover of 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.400
 Plastic and we cover if you want then 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.960

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.080
 part where there are all of sti 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.220
 buchetti so we will run into this 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.600
 so being careful not to burn yourself 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.670
 well 3 minutes have passed we see that it is 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 in fact, the line is not seen 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.680

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.660
 being hot water could not 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.530
 be and hot water therefore without 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.660
 burnt school then like pasta 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.150
 dry this the colander in practice 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.420
 so this should not be eaten dry 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.940

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.940
