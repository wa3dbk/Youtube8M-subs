00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
trunks were in the same timeline at the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.640 
trunks were in the same timeline at the
same<00:00:44.150> time<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:44.540> I<00:00:44.570> guess<00:00:44.780> we<00:00:44.900> could<00:00:45.019> do<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:45.350> it

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
same time so I guess we could do that it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.240 
same time so I guess we could do that it
could<00:00:45.799> kind<00:00:46.100> of<00:00:46.250> make<00:00:46.400> sense<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:47.710> yeah<00:00:48.710> I'm

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
could kind of make sense and yeah I'm

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.649 
could kind of make sense and yeah I'm
pretty<00:00:49.460> sure<00:00:49.670> you<00:00:49.760> guys<00:00:49.909> know<00:00:49.940> this<00:00:50.299> is<00:00:50.390> going

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
pretty sure you guys know this is going

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.160 
pretty sure you guys know this is going
because<00:00:51.229> of<00:00:51.739> mystic<00:00:52.250> Gohan<00:00:52.699> I'm<00:00:53.360> pretty<00:00:53.900> sure

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
because of mystic Gohan I'm pretty sure

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.950 
because of mystic Gohan I'm pretty sure
Goku's<00:00:54.589> family<00:00:54.979> wins<00:00:55.159> by<00:00:55.400> far<00:00:56.000> even<00:00:56.360> if<00:00:56.689> modern

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
Goku's family wins by far even if modern

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.079 
Goku's family wins by far even if modern
would<00:00:57.290> you<00:00:57.379> do<00:00:57.470> able<00:00:57.769> to<00:00:57.860> push<00:00:58.070> himself<00:00:58.250> beyond

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
would you do able to push himself beyond

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.479 
would you do able to push himself beyond
the<00:00:59.269> limits<00:00:59.659> into<00:01:00.140> Super<00:01:00.650> Saiyan<00:01:00.860> to<00:01:01.010> form<00:01:01.339> I

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
the limits into Super Saiyan to form I

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.979 
the limits into Super Saiyan to form I
mean<00:01:01.640> because<00:01:01.820> Super<00:01:02.119> Saiyan<00:01:02.269> 3<00:01:02.330> is<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.600> glitchy

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
mean because Super Saiyan 3 is a glitchy

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.840 
mean because Super Saiyan 3 is a glitchy
form<00:01:03.260> he<00:01:03.439> does<00:01:03.619> lose<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:03.890> lot<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.250> energy<00:01:04.729> while

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
form he does lose a lot of energy while

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.060 
form he does lose a lot of energy while
he's<00:01:05.030> alive<00:01:05.330> maybe<00:01:06.200> he<00:01:06.470> could<00:01:06.590> push<00:01:06.770> forward

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
he's alive maybe he could push forward

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.740 
he's alive maybe he could push forward
to<00:01:07.130> win<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:07.880> but<00:01:08.090> that's<00:01:08.240> very<00:01:08.330> very<00:01:08.630> rare

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.899 
to win that but that's very very rare
very<00:01:09.350> rare<00:01:09.439> chance<00:01:09.740> of<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:09.950> happening<00:01:10.340> but

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
very rare chance of that happening but

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.710 
very rare chance of that happening but
just<00:01:10.970> for<00:01:11.210> video<00:01:11.299> sake<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:11.750> lab<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:13.720> Goten

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
trunks versus kid go ten and then after

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.250 
trunks versus kid go ten and then after
go<00:02:52.639> tendencies<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.150> both<00:02:53.599> his<00:02:53.840> father<00:02:54.079> I

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260

have taken out both Vegeta and Future
Trunks<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.389> think<00:02:59.629> he's<00:02:59.720> gonna<00:02:59.840> push<00:03:00.109> himself

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
Trunks I think he's gonna push himself

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.960 
Trunks I think he's gonna push himself
shirt<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:00.950> like<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.370> point<00:03:01.609> where<00:03:01.760> he's

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
shirt so like the point where he's

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.460 
shirt so like the point where he's
strongly<00:03:02.750> enough<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:02.930> take<00:03:03.079> out<00:03:03.139> trunks<00:03:03.409> and

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
strongly enough to take out trunks and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.679 
strongly enough to take out trunks and
even<00:03:03.739> so<00:03:04.010> if<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.819> was<00:03:04.970> like<00:03:05.060> an<00:03:05.209> all-out<00:03:05.389> battle

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
even so if it was like an all-out battle

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.390 
even so if it was like an all-out battle
where<00:03:05.930> everybody<00:03:06.290> could<00:03:06.409> just<00:03:06.470> tag-team<00:03:07.280> each

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
where everybody could just tag-team each

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.099 
where everybody could just tag-team each
other<00:03:07.609> they<00:03:08.090> would<00:03:08.209> still<00:03:08.480> win<00:03:08.629> because<00:03:08.810> he

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
other they would still win because he

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.809 
other they would still win because he
got<00:03:09.260> go<00:03:09.500> ten<00:03:09.799> and<00:03:09.980> he's<00:03:10.159> doing<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.489> brotherly

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
got go ten and he's doing the brotherly

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.599 
got go ten and he's doing the brotherly
coming<00:03:11.299> in<00:03:11.389> a<00:03:11.510> wave<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:12.430> technically<00:03:13.430> he's

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
coming in a wave so technically he's

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.460 
coming in a wave so technically he's
gonna<00:03:13.730> die<00:03:13.939> just<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.299> same<00:03:14.480> way<00:03:14.659> I<00:03:14.870> brought<00:03:15.230> it
