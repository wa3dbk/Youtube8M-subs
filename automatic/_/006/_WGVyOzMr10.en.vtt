00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:03.950 
hey guys lacks one with YouTube here

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.680 
hey guys lacks one with YouTube here
today<00:00:04.950> I'm<00:00:05.069> gonna<00:00:05.250> be<00:00:05.520> showing<00:00:06.089> you<00:00:06.299> guys<00:00:06.629> how

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
today I'm gonna be showing you guys how

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.980 
today I'm gonna be showing you guys how
to<00:00:06.899> solve<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.680> 3x3<00:00:08.550> Rubik's<00:00:09.120> cube<00:00:09.300> in<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
to solve the 3x3 Rubik's cube in the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.100 
to solve the 3x3 Rubik's cube in the
beginners<00:00:10.769> way<00:00:10.969> hopefully<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.210> will<00:00:12.450> make<00:00:13.080> a

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
beginners way hopefully I will make a

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.049 
beginners way hopefully I will make a
tutorial<00:00:13.440> later<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.340> about<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.820> more

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
tutorial later on about the more

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.570 
tutorial later on about the more
advanced<00:00:15.269> ways<00:00:15.529> but<00:00:16.529> before<00:00:17.250> we<00:00:17.310> get<00:00:17.400> started

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
advanced ways but before we get started

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.310 
advanced ways but before we get started
I<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:17.910> wanted<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.330> make<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> note<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> people

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
I just wanted to make a note to people

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.929 
I just wanted to make a note to people
who<00:00:19.380> have<00:00:19.470> noticed<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:20.460> can<00:00:20.640> see<00:00:20.820> that

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
who have noticed you can see that

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.800 
who have noticed you can see that
there's<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.470> white<00:00:22.470> screen<00:00:23.210> around<00:00:24.210> where<00:00:24.720> I'm

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
there's a white screen around where I'm

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.279 
there's a white screen around where I'm
filming<00:00:25.199> some<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.769> my<00:00:25.859> other<00:00:26.039> videos<00:00:26.070> to

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
filming some of my other videos to

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.390 
filming some of my other videos to
eventually<00:00:28.289> hopefully<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:29.039> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.310> be

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
eventually hopefully I'm going to be

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.500 
eventually hopefully I'm going to be
making<00:00:29.900> them<00:00:30.900> into<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.369> green<00:00:32.369> screen<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
making them into a green screen as you

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.180 
making them into a green screen as you
would<00:00:33.630> say<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.320> don't<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.770> green<00:00:34.950> sheet

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
would say but I don't have a green sheet

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.410 
would say but I don't have a green sheet
but<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.670> with<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> white<00:00:36.000> sheet<00:00:36.270> or

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
but you can do with a white sheet or

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420 
but you can do with a white sheet or
whatever<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.380> I'm<00:00:37.440> using<00:00:37.710> cardboard<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.280> now

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
whatever so I'm using cardboard for now

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.180 
whatever so I'm using cardboard for now
but<00:00:39.420> anyways<00:00:39.750> back<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> 3x3<00:00:40.890> tutorial<00:00:41.460> um

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
but anyways back to the 3x3 tutorial um

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.520 
but anyways back to the 3x3 tutorial um
but<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:45.600> gonna<00:00:45.840> teach<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.230> guys<00:00:46.350> how<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
but so I'm gonna teach you guys how to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.779 
but so I'm gonna teach you guys how to
do<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.489> pretty<00:00:47.789> basic<00:00:47.940> way<00:00:48.620> I<00:00:49.789> recommend

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
do this the pretty basic way I recommend

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.500 
do this the pretty basic way I recommend
a<00:00:50.820> pen<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.120> paper<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.680> write<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:52.920> I

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
a pen and paper so you can write down I

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.240 
a pen and paper so you can write down I
mean<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:55.079> some<00:00:55.199> sheets<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.559> paper<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.890> show

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
mean I have some sheets of paper to show

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.369 
mean I have some sheets of paper to show
you<00:00:56.879> guys<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.930> uh<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.989> you<00:01:00.989> might<00:01:01.170> want

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you guys but uh you know you might want

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.490 
you guys but uh you know you might want
to<00:01:01.410> write<00:01:01.559> some<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.890> down<00:01:02.100> okay<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:04.110> we'll

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to write some this down okay so we'll

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.520 
to write some this down okay so we'll
get<00:01:04.589> started<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.960> there's<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> few<00:01:07.229> things<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
get started and there's a few things you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.560 
get started and there's a few things you
need<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.680> know<00:01:07.770> before<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.100> actually<00:01:08.570> start

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
need to know before we actually start

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.990 
need to know before we actually start
solving<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:13.490> when<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> tell<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.880> an

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
solving it so when I tell you an

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.090 
solving it so when I tell you an
algorithm<00:01:15.330> you're<00:01:16.020> gonna<00:01:16.110> need<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.439> know<00:01:16.470> some

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
algorithm you're gonna need to know some

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.289 
algorithm you're gonna need to know some
stuff<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.520> order<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.909> understand<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:20.299> well

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
stuff in order to understand it so well

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.820 
stuff in order to understand it so well
you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.780> look<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.080> diagram<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:22.560> fast

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
you can look at this diagram really fast

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.890 
you can look at this diagram really fast
pause<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.280> video<00:01:23.520> whatever<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.600> I'm<00:01:24.720> gonna

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
pause the video whatever but I'm gonna

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.730 
pause the video whatever but I'm gonna
put<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.350> down<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.680> second<00:01:27.650> when<00:01:28.650> you're

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
put it down for a second when you're

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.749 
put it down for a second when you're
looking<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> cube

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
looking at a cube

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.140 
looking at a cube
since<00:01:31.100> looking<00:01:32.100> right<00:01:32.340> ahead<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.790> red<00:01:32.970> is

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
since looking right ahead the red is

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.960 
since looking right ahead the red is
facing<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.810> guys<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.400> that<00:01:35.400> means<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> red<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
facing you guys so that means the red is

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.480 
facing you guys so that means the red is
the<00:01:36.060> front<00:01:36.270> face<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:37.590> yellow<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.130> top

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the front face the yellow is the top

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.560 
the front face the yellow is the top
face<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.960> blue<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.590> left<00:01:40.979> face<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
face the blue is the left face and the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.530 
face the blue is the left face and the
green<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.500> face<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:45.090> orange

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
green is the right face and the orange

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.620 
green is the right face and the orange
is<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.899> back<00:01:46.079> face<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.119> why<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.479> down

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
is the back face and why is the down

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.359 
is the back face and why is the down
face<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.530> won't<00:01:49.710> need<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> know<00:01:50.189> that

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
face but you won't need to know that

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.550 
face but you won't need to know that
because<00:01:50.759> none<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.659> hydrants<00:01:52.110> involves<00:01:52.439> two

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
because none of my hydrants involves two

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.469 
because none of my hydrants involves two
down<00:01:52.680> face<00:01:53.149> but<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:56.579> now<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.030> know<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
down face but so now that you know the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.840 
down face but so now that you know the
faces<00:01:58.460> we'll<00:01:59.460> look<00:01:59.549> at<00:01:59.759> an<00:02:00.119> algorithm<00:02:01.850> we'll

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
faces we'll look at an algorithm we'll

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.090 
faces we'll look at an algorithm we'll
take<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.930> example<00:02:03.990> but<00:02:04.710> you'll

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
take this one for example but you'll

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.859 
take this one for example but you'll
learn<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:05.610> later

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
learn this one later

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.550 
learn this one later
the<00:02:07.770> capital<00:02:08.160> R<00:02:08.479> means<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.660> turn<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.289> right

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the capital R means you turn the right

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.640 
the capital R means you turn the right
face<00:02:11.120> clockwise<00:02:12.120> or<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.080> case<00:02:13.260> it's

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
face clockwise or in this case it's

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.970 
face clockwise or in this case it's
it's<00:02:13.739> RI<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:15.030> mean<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.420> turn<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:16.470> means<00:02:16.799> you

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
it's RI you mean it turn it means you

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.190 
it's RI you mean it turn it means you
turned<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.489> right<00:02:18.360> face<00:02:18.659> counterclockwise

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
turned the right face counterclockwise

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.130 
turned the right face counterclockwise
so<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.980> odd<00:02:20.220> stands<00:02:20.519> for<00:02:20.700> inverting<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.840> this

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
so the odd stands for inverting so this

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.929 
so the odd stands for inverting so this
means<00:02:22.379> you<00:02:22.530> turn<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.829> front<00:02:23.010> face<00:02:23.159> clockwise

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
means you turn the front face clockwise

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.460 
means you turn the front face clockwise
counterclockwise

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
counterclockwise

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.380 
counterclockwise
that<00:02:26.010> means<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.370> turn<00:02:26.579> the<00:02:26.730> back<00:02:26.970> face<00:02:27.239> twice

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
that means you turn the back face twice

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.449 
that means you turn the back face twice
that<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:31.379> 180<00:02:31.920> degrees<00:02:32.280> winter<00:02:32.609> and<00:02:34.459> when

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
that like 180 degrees winter and when

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.410 
that like 180 degrees winter and when
you're<00:02:35.579> looking<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.939> a<00:02:35.970> cube<00:02:38.150> inverted<00:02:39.150> on<00:02:39.329> the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
you're looking at a cube inverted on the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.220 
you're looking at a cube inverted on the
back<00:02:39.780> face<00:02:40.079> is<00:02:40.409> not<00:02:41.280> like<00:02:41.579> that<00:02:42.019> imagine<00:02:43.019> that

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
back face is not like that imagine that

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.399 
back face is not like that imagine that
you're<00:02:43.500> looking<00:02:43.530> at<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.579> face<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.810> inverted

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
you're looking at that face so inverted

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.559 
you're looking at that face so inverted
would<00:02:46.530> be<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.889> way<00:02:47.069> and<00:02:47.310> clockwise<00:02:48.239> would<00:02:48.480> be

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
would be that way and clockwise would be

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.220 
would be that way and clockwise would be
that<00:02:48.810> way<00:02:49.670> yeah<00:02:51.019> okay

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
that way yeah okay

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.670 
that way yeah okay
so<00:02:53.129> to<00:02:53.730> solve<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.569> Rubik's<00:02:54.840> Cube

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
so to solve the Rubik's Cube

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.940 
so to solve the Rubik's Cube
first<00:02:56.609> thing<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.879> do<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.450> do<00:02:57.569> is<00:02:57.889> scramble<00:02:58.889> it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
first thing you do to do is scramble it

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:17.860 
first thing you do to do is scramble it
so<00:02:59.700> we're<00:03:00.060> going<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.209> do<00:03:00.359> that

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.960 

okay<00:03:18.870> now<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:19.950> my<00:03:20.069> cube<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.430> scrambled<00:03:21.470> your

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
okay now that my cube is scrambled your

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.100 
okay now that my cube is scrambled your
once<00:03:23.970> your<00:03:24.150> cube<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.420> scramble<00:03:24.780> when<00:03:24.840> you

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
once your cube is scramble when you

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.339 
once your cube is scramble when you
first<00:03:25.950> thing<00:03:26.099> you<00:03:26.190> do<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.670> need<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.819> make<00:03:27.030> a

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
first thing you do is you need to make a

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.320 
first thing you do is you need to make a
white<00:03:28.349> cross<00:03:28.650> which<00:03:29.010> are<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.430> with<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.060> four

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
white cross which are the with the four

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.520 
white cross which are the with the four
white<00:03:31.260> corner<00:03:31.650> pieces<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:34.170> may<00:03:34.290> just

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
white corner pieces and you may just

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.650 
white corner pieces and you may just
make<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.680> white<00:03:34.980> cross<00:03:35.220> on<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.640> yellow<00:03:35.790> face<00:03:36.000> so

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
make a white cross on the yellow face so

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.809 
make a white cross on the yellow face so
as<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.680> can<00:03:37.739> see<00:03:37.799> I<00:03:37.950> already<00:03:38.129> have<00:03:38.370> one<00:03:38.549> piece

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
as you can see I already have one piece

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.240 
as you can see I already have one piece
up<00:03:38.970> there<00:03:39.000> but<00:03:39.959> in<00:03:40.200> order<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.650> get<00:03:40.799> this<00:03:40.920> one<00:03:41.129> up

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
up there but in order to get this one up

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.430 
up there but in order to get this one up
there<00:03:41.430> it's<00:03:41.670> pretty<00:03:41.849> self-explanatory<00:03:42.810> you

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
there it's pretty self-explanatory you

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.800 
there it's pretty self-explanatory you
just<00:03:43.680> turn<00:03:44.010> up<00:03:44.700> like<00:03:44.879> that<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.299> now<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.599> have

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
just turn up like that and now you have

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.289 
just turn up like that and now you have
to<00:03:46.079> don't<00:03:47.010> worry<00:03:47.129> about<00:03:47.250> corner<00:03:47.610> pieces<00:03:47.970> that

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
to don't worry about corner pieces that

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.990 
to don't worry about corner pieces that
doesn't<00:03:48.690> come<00:03:48.840> in<00:03:48.989> for<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.560> few<00:03:49.739> more<00:03:49.860> steps<00:03:50.069> for

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
doesn't come in for a few more steps for

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.289 
doesn't come in for a few more steps for
this<00:03:51.150> one<00:03:51.329> you<00:03:52.140> turn<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.590> up<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.299> now

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
this one you turn it up like that now

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.420 
this one you turn it up like that now
you<00:03:54.359> can<00:03:54.750> see<00:03:54.989> this<00:03:55.260> one<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.859> come<00:03:56.129> into<00:03:56.280> a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
you can see this one you come into a

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.990 
you can see this one you come into a
situation<00:03:56.640> where<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.569> turn<00:03:58.019> it<00:03:58.170> up<00:03:59.040> it's<00:03:59.549> not

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
situation where you turn it up it's not

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.630 
situation where you turn it up it's not
going<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.269> be<00:04:00.390> oriented<00:04:00.900> correctly<00:04:01.549> so<00:04:02.549> what

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
going to be oriented correctly so what

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.150 
going to be oriented correctly so what
you're<00:04:02.760> gonna<00:04:02.849> do<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.500> let's<00:04:04.500> say<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.709> was<00:04:04.829> here

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
you're gonna do is let's say it was here

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.449 
you're gonna do is let's say it was here
and<00:04:06.109> it's<00:04:07.109> above<00:04:07.440> what<00:04:08.010> you're<00:04:08.129> gonna<00:04:08.220> do<00:04:08.370> is

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
and it's above what you're gonna do is

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.160 
and it's above what you're gonna do is
you're<00:04:08.579> gonna<00:04:08.700> turn<00:04:08.879> it<00:04:09.060> below<00:04:09.390> an<00:04:09.780> empty

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
you're gonna turn it below an empty

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.479 
you're gonna turn it below an empty
space<00:04:10.849> and<00:04:11.849> then<00:04:12.060> you're<00:04:12.209> gonna<00:04:12.299> turn<00:04:12.629> it<00:04:13.489> like

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
space and then you're gonna turn it like

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.080 
space and then you're gonna turn it like
that

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
that

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.710 
that
then<00:04:15.480> you're<00:04:15.690> trying<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.959> turn<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.350> top<00:04:16.650> and

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
then you're trying to turn the top and

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.490 
then you're trying to turn the top and
then<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:19.500> up<00:04:19.709> in<00:04:20.039> position<00:04:20.549> so<00:04:21.239> yeah<00:04:21.750> that's

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
then it's up in position so yeah that's

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.610 
then it's up in position so yeah that's
pretty<00:04:22.700> that<00:04:23.700> that's<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.150> white<00:04:24.330> cross<00:04:24.620> once

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
pretty that that's the white cross once

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.610 
pretty that that's the white cross once
you<00:04:25.710> get<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.950> white<00:04:26.130> cross<00:04:27.289> you're<00:04:28.289> gonna

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
you get the white cross you're gonna

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.490 
you get the white cross you're gonna
need<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:29.070> match<00:04:30.030> up<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:32.240> adjacent<00:04:33.240> colors<00:04:33.660> for

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
need to match up the adjacent colors for

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.310 
need to match up the adjacent colors for
the<00:04:34.680> white<00:04:34.830> pieces<00:04:35.510> which<00:04:36.510> they're<00:04:37.139> not

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
the white pieces which they're not

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.860 
the white pieces which they're not
always<00:04:37.560> going<00:04:37.800> to<00:04:37.830> be<00:04:38.180> matched<00:04:39.180> up<00:04:39.330> correctly

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
always going to be matched up correctly

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.500 
always going to be matched up correctly
like<00:04:39.990> -<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:40.620> was<00:04:41.130> just<00:04:41.250> luck<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:41.849> didn't<00:04:42.330> do<00:04:42.419> that

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
like - I was just luck I didn't do that

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.600 
like - I was just luck I didn't do that
on<00:04:42.570> purpose<00:04:42.710> but<00:04:43.710> sometimes<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.340> will<00:04:44.430> look

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
on purpose but sometimes it will look

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.450 
on purpose but sometimes it will look
like<00:04:47.240> like<00:04:48.240> this<00:04:48.979> so<00:04:49.979> you'll<00:04:50.160> have<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.340> few

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
like like this so you'll have a few

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.350 
like like this so you'll have a few
messed<00:04:51.000> up<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.570> then<00:04:51.810> -<00:04:52.169> we've<00:04:52.470> made<00:04:53.039> of

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
messed up and then - we've made of

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.060 
messed up and then - we've made of
together<00:04:54.360> whatever<00:04:54.599> I<00:04:54.780> mean<00:04:55.020> there's<00:04:55.710> so<00:04:55.979> many

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
together whatever I mean there's so many

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.580 
together whatever I mean there's so many
different<00:04:56.400> patterns<00:04:56.520> but<00:04:57.210> uh<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:57.960> once<00:04:58.440> you

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
different patterns but uh so once you

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.969 
different patterns but uh so once you
match<00:04:58.889> up<00:04:58.919> one<00:04:59.849> of<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.090> corner<00:05:00.570> colors<00:05:01.470> you're

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
match up one of the corner colors you're

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.350 
match up one of the corner colors you're
going<00:05:02.039> to<00:05:02.160> turn<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.430> 180<00:05:02.910> degrees<00:05:03.919> so<00:05:04.919> now

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
going to turn it 180 degrees so now

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.240 
going to turn it 180 degrees so now
you'll<00:05:06.360> have<00:05:06.570> one<00:05:07.110> white<00:05:07.380> edge<00:05:07.620> piece<00:05:07.919> once

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
you'll have one white edge piece once

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.640 
you'll have one white edge piece once
again<00:05:08.460> don't<00:05:08.669> worry<00:05:08.760> about<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:09.030> corners<00:05:09.419> and

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
again don't worry about the corners and

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.990 
again don't worry about the corners and
it<00:05:10.650> will<00:05:11.070> be<00:05:11.130> matched<00:05:11.370> up<00:05:11.520> with<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.760> Green

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
it will be matched up with the Green

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.379 
it will be matched up with the Green
Center<00:05:12.440> so<00:05:13.440> now<00:05:13.620> we'll<00:05:13.830> move<00:05:13.949> on<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.639> blue

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
Center so now we'll move on to the blue

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.589 
Center so now we'll move on to the blue
white<00:05:16.349> piece<00:05:16.760> so<00:05:17.760> we're<00:05:17.910> gonna<00:05:18.000> mash<00:05:18.270> up<00:05:18.479> with

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
white piece so we're gonna mash up with

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.510 
white piece so we're gonna mash up with
the<00:05:18.750> blue<00:05:19.110> Center<00:05:19.470> turn<00:05:20.190> 180<00:05:20.669> and

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
the blue Center turn 180 and

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.939 
the blue Center turn 180 and
and<00:05:22.639> orange<00:05:23.389> turn<00:05:24.319> 180<00:05:24.860> and<00:05:25.669> then<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.509> red<00:05:26.949> 180

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
and orange turn 180 and then the red 180

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:31.869 
and orange turn 180 and then the red 180
so<00:05:28.729> now<00:05:28.910> you<00:05:29.569> have<00:05:29.750> a<00:05:29.780> white<00:05:30.139> cross<00:05:30.650> and<00:05:31.009> all

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:31.879 
so now you have a white cross and all

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:36.149 
so now you have a white cross and all
the<00:05:32.090> colors<00:05:32.449> are<00:05:32.840> correctly<00:05:33.409> matched<00:05:33.770> up<00:05:34.780> so

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
the colors are correctly matched up so

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.839 
the colors are correctly matched up so
after<00:05:37.159> the<00:05:37.310> white<00:05:38.180> cross<00:05:39.069> the<00:05:40.069> first<00:05:40.340> you're

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
after the white cross the first you're

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.779 
after the white cross the first you're
gonna<00:05:41.379> the<00:05:42.379> the<00:05:43.069> next<00:05:43.310> step<00:05:43.430> you're<00:05:43.580> gonna<00:05:43.639> do

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
gonna the the next step you're gonna do

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.909 
gonna the the next step you're gonna do
is<00:05:43.909> you're<00:05:44.000> going<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.150> solve<00:05:44.620> the<00:05:45.620> corner

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
is you're going to solve the corner

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.279 
is you're going to solve the corner
pieces<00:05:46.539> so<00:05:47.539> the<00:05:47.690> first<00:05:47.900> thing<00:05:48.050> you're<00:05:48.169> gonna

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
pieces so the first thing you're gonna

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.999 
pieces so the first thing you're gonna
do<00:05:48.440> is<00:05:48.470> you're<00:05:48.740> gonna<00:05:48.830> look<00:05:49.129> for<00:05:50.020> pieces<00:05:51.020> on

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
do is you're gonna look for pieces on

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.570 
do is you're gonna look for pieces on
the<00:05:52.370> top<00:05:52.639> layer<00:05:52.940> here<00:05:53.930> which<00:05:54.830> you<00:05:55.190> can<00:05:55.340> see<00:05:55.550> I

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
the top layer here which you can see I

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.420 
the top layer here which you can see I
don't<00:05:55.819> have<00:05:56.270> any<00:05:56.479> so<00:05:57.409> that's<00:05:57.860> kind<00:05:58.159> of<00:05:58.220> helpful

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
don't have any so that's kind of helpful

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.719 
don't have any so that's kind of helpful
for<00:05:58.729> me<00:05:58.849> but<00:05:59.599> so<00:06:00.050> once<00:06:00.560> if<00:06:00.889> I<00:06:01.069> don't<00:06:01.250> see<00:06:01.490> any

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
for me but so once if I don't see any

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.909 
for me but so once if I don't see any
colors<00:06:02.120> in<00:06:02.330> the<00:06:02.479> top<00:06:02.690> layer<00:06:02.900> first<00:06:03.680> thing<00:06:03.800> I<00:06:03.860> do

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
colors in the top layer first thing I do

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.290 
colors in the top layer first thing I do
is<00:06:04.099> I<00:06:04.190> look<00:06:04.340> for<00:06:04.550> them<00:06:04.639> in<00:06:04.789> the<00:06:04.849> bottom<00:06:05.150> layer

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
is I look for them in the bottom layer

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.499 
is I look for them in the bottom layer
and<00:06:06.069> I<00:06:07.069> found<00:06:07.400> one<00:06:07.610> I<00:06:07.819> usually<00:06:08.090> look<00:06:08.180> for<00:06:08.240> them

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
and I found one I usually look for them

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.870 
and I found one I usually look for them
to<00:06:08.630> put<00:06:08.780> it<00:06:08.840> on<00:06:08.930> the<00:06:09.020> right<00:06:09.169> side<00:06:09.610> note

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
to put it on the right side note

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.790 
to put it on the right side note
always<00:06:11.389> keep<00:06:11.810> your<00:06:11.840> white<00:06:12.319> on<00:06:12.530> the<00:06:12.650> bottom

always keep your white on the bottom
that<00:06:13.280> just<00:06:13.639> is<00:06:13.880> helpful<00:06:14.479> so<00:06:15.639> to<00:06:16.639> get<00:06:16.789> this

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
that just is helpful so to get this

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.480 
that just is helpful so to get this
piece<00:06:17.210> in<00:06:17.360> the<00:06:17.389> top<00:06:17.719> layer<00:06:18.039> you're<00:06:19.039> gonna<00:06:19.190> go

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
piece in the top layer you're gonna go

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:27.010 
piece in the top layer you're gonna go
right<00:06:23.229> top<00:06:24.310> right<00:06:25.310> and<00:06:25.430> burden<00:06:25.759> so<00:06:26.750> now<00:06:26.960> you

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
right top right and burden so now you

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.540 
right top right and burden so now you
can<00:06:27.259> see<00:06:27.440> it's<00:06:27.560> in<00:06:27.650> the<00:06:27.740> layer<00:06:27.919> it's<00:06:28.310> in<00:06:28.490> the

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
can see it's in the layer it's in the

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.580 
can see it's in the layer it's in the
top<00:06:28.699> layer<00:06:28.909> so<00:06:29.690> once<00:06:29.870> you<00:06:29.990> have<00:06:30.080> a<00:06:30.139> piece<00:06:30.440> in

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
top layer so once you have a piece in

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.800 
top layer so once you have a piece in
the<00:06:30.650> top<00:06:30.860> layer<00:06:31.069> you're<00:06:31.370> gonna<00:06:31.490> match<00:06:31.880> the

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
the top layer you're gonna match the

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.050 
the top layer you're gonna match the
adjacent<00:06:33.139> don't<00:06:33.710> worry<00:06:33.860> about<00:06:34.009> the<00:06:34.130> top<00:06:34.370> the

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
adjacent don't worry about the top the

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.149 
adjacent don't worry about the top the
top<00:06:35.270> color<00:06:35.509> look<00:06:35.750> it<00:06:35.900> to<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:36.169> want<00:06:36.770> the<00:06:36.949> color

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:37.159 
top color look it to the want the color

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:39.070 
top color look it to the want the color
on<00:06:37.250> the<00:06:37.310> same<00:06:37.460> layer<00:06:37.669> and<00:06:37.909> you're<00:06:38.690> gonna<00:06:38.779> match

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
on the same layer and you're gonna match

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.089 
on the same layer and you're gonna match
it<00:06:39.259> up<00:06:39.289> diagonally<00:06:40.130> with<00:06:40.310> its<00:06:40.940> center<00:06:41.270> and

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:42.099 
it up diagonally with its center and

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:49.510 
it up diagonally with its center and
then<00:06:43.099> you're<00:06:43.250> gonna<00:06:43.370> go<00:06:44.080> right<00:06:46.330> top<00:06:48.400> right<00:06:49.400> and

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
then you're gonna go right top right and

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.120 
then you're gonna go right top right and
verted<00:06:49.849> and<00:06:50.229> then<00:06:51.229> you<00:06:51.440> can<00:06:51.590> see<00:06:51.800> that<00:06:51.979> it's

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
verted and then you can see that it's

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.360 
verted and then you can see that it's
matched<00:06:52.370> up<00:06:52.610> now<00:06:52.759> and<00:06:53.949> you<00:06:54.949> can<00:06:55.069> see<00:06:55.190> we<00:06:55.279> have

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
matched up now and you can see we have
