00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
failures I was watching a video review

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.940 
failures I was watching a video review
where<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> guy<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.409> having<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.500> fight<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
where a guy was having a fight with a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.390 
where a guy was having a fight with a
tree<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.820> tree<00:01:24.030> one<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:25.259> mean<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.220> not

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
tree in the tree one I mean this is not

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.030 
tree in the tree one I mean this is not
a<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:27.150> wouldn't<00:01:28.020> put<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.290> down<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.650> fighting

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
a I wouldn't put this down as a fighting

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.830 
a I wouldn't put this down as a fighting
knife<00:01:29.189> at<00:01:29.460> all<00:01:29.640> I'd<00:01:29.909> say<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> very<00:01:30.689> high

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
knife at all I'd say this is a very high

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.740 
knife at all I'd say this is a very high
quality<00:01:31.079> utility<00:01:31.710> knife<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> only

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
quality utility knife and and the only

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.730 
quality utility knife and and the only
difference<00:01:34.049> between<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.500> they're

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
difference between this and they're

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.520 
difference between this and they're
standard<00:01:35.070> issue<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:35.900> that<00:01:36.900> they<00:01:37.049> sell<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
standard issue one that they sell is

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.620 
standard issue one that they sell is
there<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.070> they've<00:01:38.250> changed<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> very

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
there is they've changed to the very

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.060 
there is they've changed to the very
high<00:01:39.960> vis<00:01:40.200> green<00:01:40.470> which<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.009> very

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
high vis green which is going to be very

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.830 
high vis green which is going to be very
easy<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.610> see<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.970> drop<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.390> night<00:01:42.540> or

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
easy to see if you drop it at night or

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.130

do with that

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.969 
do with that
probably<00:02:07.210> going<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.390> take<00:02:07.510> this<00:02:07.630> one<00:02:07.720> off

probably going to take this one off

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.590 
probably going to take this one off
there<00:02:08.979> isn't<00:02:09.280> really<00:02:09.369> i<00:02:09.520> haven't<00:02:09.910> used<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.240> so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
there isn't really i haven't used it so

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.480 
there isn't really i haven't used it so
i<00:02:10.869> think<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.709> personally<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.220> just<00:02:12.340> sort<00:02:12.459> of

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
i think it personally it just sort of

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.740 
i think it personally it just sort of
gets<00:02:12.670> in<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.819> way<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.090> grip<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.360> bit<00:02:13.510> and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
gets in the way of the grip a bit and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.860 
gets in the way of the grip a bit and
but<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.709> group<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:14.950> very<00:02:15.190> good<00:02:15.660> they've<00:02:16.660> been

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
but the group is very good they've been

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.990 
but the group is very good they've been
seared<00:02:17.260> one<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.310> bits<00:02:18.459> i<00:02:18.580> don't<00:02:18.850> like

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
seared one of the bits i don't like

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.270 
seared one of the bits i don't like
about<00:02:19.180> this<00:02:19.420> knife<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:20.020> it's<00:02:20.920> not<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.069> huge

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
about this knife and it's not a huge

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.059 
about this knife and it's not a huge
deal<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.760> actually<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.330> finish<00:02:22.600> on<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.780> blade

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
deal is actually the finish on the blade

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.280 
deal is actually the finish on the blade
the<00:02:24.069> blade<00:02:24.100> itself<00:02:24.610> has<00:02:25.300> got<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:25.930> sort<00:02:26.230> of

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
the blade itself has got this sort of

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.320 
the blade itself has got this sort of
shiny<00:02:26.770> black<00:02:27.130> coating<00:02:27.489> on<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.910> i<00:02:27.940> think<00:02:27.970> it

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
shiny black coating on it and i think it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.910 
shiny black coating on it and i think it
light<00:02:28.540> on<00:02:28.690> there<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.900> show<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.319> or<00:02:29.530> not<00:02:29.680> but

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
light on there to show you or not but

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.699 
light on there to show you or not but
it's<00:02:30.250> am<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:31.480> not<00:02:31.660> it's<00:02:31.720> not<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:32.020> great<00:02:32.319> finish

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
it's am it's not it's not a great finish

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.800 
it's am it's not it's not a great finish
it<00:02:32.890> does<00:02:33.340> come<00:02:33.550> off<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.700> little<00:02:33.790> bit<00:02:34.120> but<00:02:34.630> has

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
it does come off a little bit but has

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.240 
it does come off a little bit but has
already<00:02:34.930> started<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.350> wear<00:02:35.560> on<00:02:35.590> mine<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.190> i

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
already started to wear on mine and i

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.990 
already started to wear on mine and i
haven't<00:02:36.580> used<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:37.209> much<00:02:38.519> it's<00:02:39.519> not<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.670> big

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
haven't used it that much it's not a big

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.300 
haven't used it that much it's not a big
deal<00:02:40.030> but<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:41.170> know<00:02:41.290> you'd<00:02:41.739> think<00:02:41.769> you'd

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
deal but you know you'd think you'd

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.199 
deal but you know you'd think you'd
think<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.580> would<00:02:42.670> be<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.760> little<00:02:42.940> bit<00:02:43.090> better

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
think it would be a little bit better

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.110 
think it would be a little bit better
considering<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.959> quality<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.970> from<00:02:45.970> what<00:02:46.090> i

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
considering the quality and from what i

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.120 
considering the quality and from what i
understand<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.840> fixed<00:02:47.230> all<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.470> fixed<00:02:47.920> blade

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
understand the fixed all the fixed blade

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.979 
understand the fixed all the fixed blade
to<00:02:48.519> have<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.700> different<00:02:49.030> finish<00:02:49.209> is<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.840> is

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
to have a different finish is this is

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.330 
to have a different finish is this is
the<00:02:50.140> only<00:02:50.260> one<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.470> has<00:02:50.709> just<00:02:50.860> finish<00:02:51.160> on<00:02:51.310> it

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the only one that has just finish on it

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.150 
the only one that has just finish on it
