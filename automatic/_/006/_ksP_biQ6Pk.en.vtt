from<00:02:19.650> everyday<00:02:19.980> tasks<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.610> would<00:02:20.880> say<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.150> you

from everyday tasks I would say that you
may<00:02:21.990> not<00:02:22.110> notice<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.530> huge<00:02:22.830> difference<00:02:22.920> but

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
may not notice a huge difference but

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.250 
may not notice a huge difference but
certain<00:02:24.000> apps<00:02:24.210> when<00:02:24.510> you're<00:02:24.630> loading<00:02:24.930> up<00:02:25.050> you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
certain apps when you're loading up you

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.540 
certain apps when you're loading up you
will<00:02:25.470> notice<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.800> they<00:02:26.040> are<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.160> little<00:02:26.340> bit

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
will notice that they are a little bit

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.340 
will notice that they are a little bit
faster<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.630> may<00:02:27.750> know<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.080> original

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
faster you may know that the original

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.860 
faster you may know that the original
iPad<00:02:29.010> Mini<00:02:29.310> did<00:02:29.580> use<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.850> Apple<00:02:30.270> a5<00:02:30.420> processor

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
iPad Mini did use the Apple a5 processor

iPad Mini did use the Apple a5 processor
and<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.070> case<00:02:32.280> we're<00:02:32.550> jumping<00:02:32.970> over<00:02:33.210> to

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
and in this case we're jumping over to

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.020 
and in this case we're jumping over to
the<00:02:33.510> a7<00:02:34.110> processor<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:35.280> i<00:02:35.310> would<00:02:35.610> say<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.940> in

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the a7 processor so i would say that in

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.490 
the a7 processor so i would say that in
certain<00:02:36.270> things<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.840> will<00:02:37.050> notice<00:02:37.320> a

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
certain things you will notice a

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.260 
certain things you will notice a
difference<00:02:37.710> but<00:02:38.100> really<00:02:38.490> not<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.880> big<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.090> a

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
difference but really not that big of a

difference the ipad mini original
version<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.790> still<00:02:42.090> very<00:02:42.570> very<00:02:42.720> capable<00:02:43.410> but

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
version is still very very capable but

you may know that probably one of the

can<00:03:13.500> do<00:03:13.620> 720p<00:03:14.010> video<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.330> camera<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.720> one

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
can do 720p video so the camera is one

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.300 
can do 720p video so the camera is one
of<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.320> things<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.680> stays<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.130> same

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
of the things that stays the same

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.460 
of the things that stays the same
between<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.910> ipad<00:03:18.300> mini<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:19.080> retina

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
between the ipad mini and the retina

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.440 
between the ipad mini and the retina
ipad<00:03:19.830> mini<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.640> can<00:03:20.790> see<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.090> photos

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
ipad mini you can see that the photos

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.300 
ipad mini you can see that the photos
are<00:03:21.630> decent<00:03:22.230> though<00:03:22.470> they're<00:03:22.650> not<00:03:22.680> anything

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
are decent though they're not anything

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.130 
are decent though they're not anything
amazing<00:03:23.850> but<00:03:24.390> i<00:03:24.420> would<00:03:24.630> say<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:24.990> they're

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
amazing but i would say that they're

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.810 
amazing but i would say that they're
definitely<00:03:25.380> good<00:03:25.709> enough<00:03:25.740> for<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.130> tablet<00:03:26.370> and

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
definitely good enough for a tablet and

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.610 
definitely good enough for a tablet and
compared<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.540> some<00:03:27.780> other<00:03:27.930> tablets<00:03:28.470> out<00:03:28.560> there

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
compared to some other tablets out there

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.610 
compared to some other tablets out there
it<00:03:29.010> definitely<00:03:29.459> beats<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.820> out<00:03:30.110> so<00:03:31.110> this<00:03:31.500> is

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
it definitely beats it out so this is

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.970 
it definitely beats it out so this is
just<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:32.190> video<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.030> dual<00:03:33.570> mics<00:03:33.870> test<00:03:34.320> on<00:03:34.590> the

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
just a video and dual mics test on the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.850 
just a video and dual mics test on the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
job so now on to my final thoughts of

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.390 
job so now on to my final thoughts of
the<00:04:09.239> ipad<00:04:09.570> mini<00:04:09.840> with<00:04:10.020> retina<00:04:10.080> display<00:04:10.440> the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
the ipad mini with retina display the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.310 
the ipad mini with retina display the
two<00:04:11.670> most<00:04:11.880> widely<00:04:12.480> asked<00:04:12.660> questions<00:04:13.140> will

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
two most widely asked questions will

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.080 
two most widely asked questions will
likely<00:04:13.530> be<00:04:13.920> whether<00:04:14.520> it's<00:04:14.730> worth<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.060> upgrade

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
likely be whether it's worth the upgrade

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.990 
likely be whether it's worth the upgrade
from<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.810> existing<00:04:16.410> ipad<00:04:16.890> with<00:04:17.400> no<00:04:17.640> retina

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
from the existing ipad with no retina

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.120 
from the existing ipad with no retina
display<00:04:18.390> or<00:04:18.840> for<00:04:19.380> people<00:04:19.470> who<00:04:19.770> do<00:04:19.979> not

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
display or for people who do not

display or for people who do not
actually<00:04:20.370> have<00:04:20.640> an<00:04:20.760> ipad<00:04:21.060> mini<00:04:21.090> right<00:04:21.539> now

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
actually have an ipad mini right now

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.540 
actually have an ipad mini right now
whether<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.380> is<00:04:22.410> worth<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.770> extra<00:04:23.100> hundred

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
whether it is worth the extra hundred

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.060 
whether it is worth the extra hundred
dollars

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
dollars

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.070 
dollars
jump<00:04:24.370> to<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.670> model<00:04:24.940> as<00:04:25.270> opposed<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.930> the

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
opinion I would say definitely coming

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.880 
opinion I would say definitely coming
from<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.030> ipad<00:04:31.360> mini<00:04:31.420> to<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.170> iPad<00:04:32.470> Mini<00:04:32.710> with

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
from the ipad mini to the iPad Mini with

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.160 
from the ipad mini to the iPad Mini with
Retina<00:04:32.920> display<00:04:33.670> I<00:04:33.910> didn't<00:04:34.420> really<00:04:34.540> notice<00:04:34.840> a

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
Retina display I didn't really notice a

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.930 
Retina display I didn't really notice a
huge<00:04:35.620> huge<00:04:35.950> difference<00:04:36.490> in<00:04:36.640> terms<00:04:36.820> of

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
huge huge difference in terms of

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.230 
huge huge difference in terms of
everyday<00:04:37.240> tasks<00:04:37.870> although<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.590> processor<00:04:39.100> is

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
everyday tasks although the processor is

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.220 
everyday tasks although the processor is
significantly<00:04:40.240> better<00:04:40.480> on<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.900> spec<00:04:41.200> sheet

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
significantly better on the spec sheet

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.220 
significantly better on the spec sheet
however<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.430> retina<00:04:42.760> display<00:04:43.150> itself<00:04:43.720> I<00:04:43.990> feel

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
however the retina display itself I feel

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.890 
however the retina display itself I feel
is<00:04:44.440> worth<00:04:44.490> extra<00:04:45.490> hundred<00:04:45.850> dollars<00:04:46.240> if<00:04:46.600> you

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
is worth extra hundred dollars if you

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.720 
is worth extra hundred dollars if you
don't<00:04:47.110> think<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.470> iPad<00:04:47.800> Mini<00:04:48.070> has<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.340> bad

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
don't think the iPad Mini has a bad

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.280 
don't think the iPad Mini has a bad
screen<00:04:49.120> or<00:04:49.270> you<00:04:49.300> don't<00:04:49.510> really<00:04:49.600> mind<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:50.080> i

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
screen or you don't really mind it i

guess it's fine just saved by extra
hundred<00:04:52.330> dollars<00:04:52.690> but<00:04:52.930> i'd<00:04:53.260> say<00:04:53.590> for<00:04:53.800> most

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890
