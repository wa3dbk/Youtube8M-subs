00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:09.240
 [Music] 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.370
 hi to all the boys then in this 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.619
 very short video we will show how 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.880
 jailbreak spirit works and how 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.850
 maybe install the first apps 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.740
 how they work from cydia 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.269
 the guide and could almost be defined 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.070
 useless for anyway it must 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.920
 simply press a button 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.240
 But we say and more to see then what 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.550
 what happens next 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.370
 then ipad already connected me it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.649
 it recognizes ipad 3.2 waxes 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:48.899
 that to the installed firmware version yes 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:51.469
 press the jailbreak button and the ipad yes 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.469
 we got it 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.510
 expect a few seconds 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.760
 and as we see there is a small bar of 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.940
 progress that shows us that the jailbreak 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.690
 and in progress this bar really lasts 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.070
 a few seconds as you already know why 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:29.560
 we made an article tonight 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:32.710
 very explanatory now on itunes has me 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.310
 already detected the program and the iPad 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.580
 connected we await some more 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.580
 second 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.350
 and here ipad that opened we see a 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.520
 if there are any news 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.100
 let's go ahead let's go ahead 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.680
 forward 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.920
 and here it is the cydia icon 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.980
 we will open it for new users 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.970
 because it is not said that the people that 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.979
 buy live ad hoc and buy it 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.800
 they are already users of maybe iphone and hip 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.920
 hop siria is a program that allows 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.660
 installing third-party applications 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.310
 set off 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.190
 we say as if it were some kind of 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.350
 secondary market ie they are 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.110
 applications from developers 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.459
 independent that do not pass for apple and 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.090
 often also serve as a rational of the 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.150
 functionality that apple has blocked or that 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.050
 however he did not want to include in the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.239
 ipad 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:44.680
 its firmware we return back to 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:46.959
 Syria because the first start is the first 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.550
 startup is to organize the database and 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.170
 all its functions 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.790
 here now he asks us if we are gods 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.930
 developers or not we are gods 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:00.489
 simple users so let's try 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:03.280
 superuser and syria in practice opens e 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.790
 as we can see, download the first ones 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.410
 information on its repositories that 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.959
 it's pretty much it's information on 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.410
 all packages you can install 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.329
 on ipad the deputies find a beautiful one 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.319
 guide on all applications already 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.030
 compatible 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:25.510
 with the ipad then the program is in 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:30.329
 day then we have the sections where 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.329
 there are all the various sections of the 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.650
 jockey tools and e-books etc. 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:41.310
 etc. there are changes we say the 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.319
 updates of things already installed 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.790
 here we can say manage various 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.150
 new repositories or the sources 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.909
 installed packages, etc. etc. 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.189
 where we can do a search 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.040
 then let's see briefly two 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:04.319
 backgrounder applications should 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.519
 restart restore the ipad because 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.780
 some people function some not in 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.579
 this moment does not work because 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.409
 I should do a complete restore thing 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.599
 that I don't have time to do now though ve 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.250
 we will then show it in a separate video 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.650
 I'll show you quickly meetic mine 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.070
 di has blackmailed that it is an application 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.139
 very simple in which we write 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:30.099
 now you see that ipad is written 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:32.710
 above then whistle as you see is 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:39.849
 for iphone the application but it works 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:45.220
 months we click on end and press up 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:47.650
 understand us as you can see now the 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.340
 written above and ipad the deputies no longer ai 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.840
 20 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.810
 obviously we can write that 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.860
 what we want is over but we come 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.409
 to the other application than sb setting 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.599
 west of settings is an application that 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.909
 we do not see here we say among our own 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.430
 among the list of actions structures between 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:09.699
 the icons because in hidden quotation marks 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.849
 is activated by making a small swipe on 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.949
 this on the status bar e 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.289
 as we can see a menu appears between 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.969
 hidden quotes but this one less 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.050
 we can set up a pair of crosses and 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:25.760
 activate or deactivate the bluetooth 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:31.680
 the same is true for wifi 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:35.850
 set the brightness and make a 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.740
 refresh a reboot a respring of the in 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.410
 springboard of the device then from 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.920
 here I can decide whether to reopen the ipad e 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.450
 I can activate deactivate some 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.910
 functionality that will then go to 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.630
 add setting cash supports i 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:54.030
 plugin and brightness and we can see 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.720
 also the ram available in 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.830
 device 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.250
 and how much space we have on the undoing of 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.140
 storage on the sun curtains 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.650
 these are the applications for a moment 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:11.370
 we say fundamental and those that are 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.200
 install normally then as soon as it will be 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.940
 compatible also proswitcher we will have a 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.650
 real multitasking on the skin 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.240
 that's all for now 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:24.459
 Hi everyone 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.459
