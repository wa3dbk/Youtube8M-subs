 Last time we stay full gamescom 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.020
 right on the topic gamescom because it 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.850
 Still wonder where I come from 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.020
 because to be on the gamescom and 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.570
 I think I have the last one 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.369
 two three four five weeks and over 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.730

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.160

 ubisoft staff and I'm at 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.800
 ubisoft on the rainbow six looks up 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.809
 to be exact of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.820
 tuesday there are no rows yet 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.290
 wednesday press day if you are there 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.539
 So should the trade visitor day 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.149
 otherwise thursday friday saturday 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.120
 sunday every day on the rails exceet 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.920
 was at ubisoft and who is not yet 18 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.660
 should be years old and not there 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.300
 comes in because it is a game from 18 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.649
 That is where I am currently considering if I am 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.149
 that in the midday breaks makes us 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.920
 Just say hey I stop 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.480
 Somehow always at 2 o'clock in the afternoon or so 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.159
 and then just meet us in front of the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.540
 stand or something like that I will 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.210
 but then announce at the fair 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.380
 because the current time a planning so 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.970
 if I take a break now and was still 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.229
 not only is Wednesday to Tuesday 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.869
 stand firm when I am at the fair 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.650
 then I will but in any case 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.780
 every day on facebook and twitter 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.189
 I hope that was enough 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.320
 information where to find me on the 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.900
 gamescom meets ubisoft rainbow six 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.860
 was not forgotten 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.540
 Windows 10 is here and I have it too 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.560
 already installed on the asus notebook 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.150
 and will be seen yesterday's video 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.070
 has noticed that I showed 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.009
 did you like the xbox were on that 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.049
 Notebook or on the pc can stream 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.579
 and what might that bring 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.079
 it could actually be that way now 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.189
 I have a lot of people that feature 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.890
 of course in the reverse 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.770
 direction so that you want from pc 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.119
 then stream out to the xbox then 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.470
 needed was still mouse and keyboard 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.960
 support and it would be possible for example 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.159
 that the xbox one is on the big tv 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.570
 is in the living room of the pc 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.369
 for example, in the study 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.619
 and her just a game about steam 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.780
 orange uplay and run in the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.040
 Living room on your xbox is gambling for it 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.840
 would need a mouse and mouse 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.270
 keyboard support da microsoft works 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.649
 allegedly and phil spencer is it 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.940
 It is said by microsoft has also said 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.250
 he understands that the players get that 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.780
 wish and it would be essential 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.150
 harder because the pcs stop completely 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.720
 easy 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.730
 so many different 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.120
 So specifications have these 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.129
 encoding from the pc in the direction of xbox would be 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.319
 much more elaborate but they would 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.110
 consuming tasks would be so 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.459
 it is indeed a possibility that it 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.670
 in the future also in the other direction 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.280
 it works a lot according to ea 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.409
 Battlefield experience in the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.549
 third quarter of the fiscal year 2017 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.159
 yes, it is about the financial year 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.599
 always with companies from april to april 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.890
 that's because you're the christmas business 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.139
 then still in the current year with 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.010
 wants to have it in and that's why it is 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.569
 always very little bit funny 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.780
 but that means nothing 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.849
 Battlefield 5 was hereby added 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.440
 officially confirmed by ea and 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.849
 announced and that takes however 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.680
 still a little bit until that 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.389
 What else will she do ? 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.700
 said that they are three new ones 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:07.540
 bring original brands on the way 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.980
 and that will be the beginning of 2016 then 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.750
 so be sure what's coming up 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.639
 we do not know yet but they have 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.349
 So business numbers launched business 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.879
 had meetings and so were stopped 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.389
 these themes are three new games and 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.370
 Battlefield 5 already released on 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.489
 18 august it will already be ready 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.290
 and the game zombie was in advance for 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.790
 the veu has now been published for 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.430
 the playstation for the xbox man and 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.959
 the pc is available as a digital download 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.639
 and the whole thing will be one too 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.190
 reprint of a zombie game for 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.659
 the wii be up in advance 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.500
 this touchpad has been designed that 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.409
 play very little bit modified 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.409
 and Ubisoft says further that also 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:46.120
 that's just the new consoles 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.859
 generation easily adjusts something 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.019
 means that the artwork probably 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:53.379
 so he is even better 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.269
 horror could have experience for star 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.669
 wars battlefront was then too 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.680
 a new game mode announced and 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.879
 he calls himself blast that means 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.079
 I believe as much as if I fought 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.000
 not all that great and that's it 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.879
 just a ten by ten multiplayer 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.379
 the match with 100 kills 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.090
 must reach or the game stops 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.370
 depending on the ten minutes long 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.449
 and who then leads the kills 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.040
 is the winner 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:16.630
 In my opinion, this is always the thing 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.699
 team deathmatch is like that for me 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.229
 boring mode sorry love 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.969
 women about electronic arts but so 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.229
 testmatch is really what i like 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:25.419
 I do not need but I know exactly 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.260
 as probably the publisher that the 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.210
 a very popular one 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.480
 Mode is he likes to play the match in 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.600
 multiplayer matches techland has become 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.830
 now to the upcoming lite dsi 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.860
 following comments and they said 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.470
 that following yourself will be just as great 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.570
 will like all maps before in your sorry 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.130
 The whole thing will be collected for the season 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.320
 Pass should be free 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.060
 when the part comes out, there are currently 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.590
 not yet what that cost separately 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.070
 you do not probably know there either 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.690
 it only informos on the gamescom the 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.220
 whole now there is an absolute rumor 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.930
 probably nothing at all 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.160
 homefront 2 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.170
 Maybe you can do that 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.300
 Remember that was such a mega disaster 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.250
 with crytek the whole thing is still 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.990
 crashed once and so and then it is 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.210
 somehow absolutely silent about the title 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.680
 homefront become at that time one had 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.360
 At that time, as I found a lot 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.360
 Good approach from one of the players 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.980
 Perspective was out but then technical 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.300
 and finally a bit like that 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.770
 Mediocre built then is the whole 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.180
 been given to crytek 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.320
 you have where work of the new graphics 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.090
 engine and that will be correct now 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.530
 get cool atmosphere and then 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.210
 crytek leyen a bit greasy 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.680
 and then it is relatively quiet around that 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.530
 thing has become and now has the user 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.330
 shinobi 602 maybe that's you in 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.220
 reminder of the dives often times to 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.470
 neogaf forum twitter and so on and 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.520
 always tweets so insider information where 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.080
 you do not know exactly where they came from 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.060
 and most of the time it's relatively green 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.070
 relatively much content and he has now 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.110
 Again he is looking forward to it 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.930
 near future homefront to see again 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.540
 that could be interpreted as that the 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:56.080
 homefrontdesign 2 show at gamescom 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:00.040
 I think but not the gears of 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.170
 was ultimate edition will be on 25 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.640
 August will be the end of the month 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.560
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.320
 am old xbox 360 player knows faith 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.210
 I've everyone with gears of war was 1 2 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.530
 mega had fun that scary 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.900
 many multiplayer was played and so was 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.250
 really great gaming experience 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.050
 now the thing comes for the xbox 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.820
 or other out and also have 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.960
 knocked out a new trailer where she 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.170
 just a little bit about it 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.430
 How much do they talk graphically 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.440
 have improved and so would the 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.260
 English is a bit powerful 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.970
 can take a look 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.970
 you do not have any software 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.910
 chains so my friends then is still 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.620
 a lot of exciting things in youtube world 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.850
 I think I have to think about that 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.110
 that soon also times in the 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.150
 daily news and very little bit with 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.650
 just pack that I think I have one 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.480
 or two made there could me happy 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.770
 let your feedback to there if he 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.300
 bock on it that maybe so 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.560
 sometime in the week so somehow 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.130
 other video from any other 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.290
 youtuber mention it is there that knows what
