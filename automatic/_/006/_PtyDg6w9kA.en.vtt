open<00:00:11.059> up<00:00:11.180> the<00:00:11.480> DJI<00:00:12.110> Go<00:00:12.620> app<00:00:13.420> I'm<00:00:14.420> not<00:00:14.629> connected

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
open up the DJI Go app I'm not connected

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.050 
open up the DJI Go app I'm not connected
to<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:15.320> Phantom<00:00:15.770> so<00:00:16.340> I<00:00:16.369> can<00:00:16.580> make<00:00:16.670> the<00:00:16.790> screen

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
to the Phantom so I can make the screen

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.550 
to the Phantom so I can make the screen
recording<00:00:17.480> but<00:00:17.630> I'm<00:00:17.750> pretty<00:00:18.080> sure<00:00:18.230> I<00:00:18.259> could<00:00:18.439> to

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
recording but I'm pretty sure I could to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.280 
recording but I'm pretty sure I could to
the<00:00:18.650> settings<00:00:18.980> I<00:00:19.130> need<00:00:19.310> so<00:00:19.640> then<00:00:19.820> you<00:00:19.910> go<00:00:20.029> to

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
the settings I need so then you go to

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.440 
the settings I need so then you go to
the<00:00:21.290> camera<00:00:21.680> and<00:00:21.770> the<00:00:21.890> gear<00:00:22.160> right<00:00:22.970> above<00:00:23.150> the

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
the camera and the gear right above the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.639 
the camera and the gear right above the
recording<00:00:24.110> button<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:25.270> then<00:00:26.270> we<00:00:27.079> go<00:00:27.290> to<00:00:27.320> we'll

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:27.649 
recording button and then we go to we'll

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.499 
recording button and then we go to we'll
start<00:00:27.919> with<00:00:28.040> color<00:00:28.279> I<00:00:28.579> always<00:00:29.119> shoot<00:00:29.300> with<00:00:29.480> a

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:29.509 
start with color I always shoot with a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.389 
start with color I always shoot with a
log<00:00:29.779> profile<00:00:30.320> and<00:00:30.590> it's<00:00:30.829> because<00:00:31.099> it's<00:00:31.309> a

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
log profile and it's because it's a

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.319 
log profile and it's because it's a
little<00:00:32.170> flatter<00:00:33.430> I<00:00:34.430> don't<00:00:34.850> like<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.120> use<00:00:35.180> any

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
little flatter I don't like to use any

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.020 
little flatter I don't like to use any
of<00:00:35.660> them<00:00:35.840> especially<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:36.410> vivid<00:00:37.030> profile

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
of them especially the vivid profile

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.130 
of them especially the vivid profile
because<00:00:38.930> it<00:00:39.680> tends<00:00:40.340> to<00:00:40.520> to<00:00:41.090> crush<00:00:41.690> your<00:00:41.870> blacks

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
because it tends to to crush your blacks

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.919 
because it tends to to crush your blacks
and<00:00:42.550> oversaturate<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:44.390> can<00:00:44.539> do<00:00:44.600> that<00:00:44.719> kind

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
and oversaturate and I can do that kind

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:46.660 
and oversaturate and I can do that kind
of<00:00:44.989> stuff<00:00:45.199> in<00:00:45.320> post<00:00:45.559> so<00:00:45.980> it<00:00:46.100> gives<00:00:46.280> you<00:00:46.399> much

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
of stuff in post so it gives you much

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.430 
of stuff in post so it gives you much
more<00:00:46.699> leeway<00:00:47.149> when<00:00:47.629> you<00:00:47.719> shoot<00:00:47.960> a<00:00:48.170> little<00:00:48.350> bit

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
more leeway when you shoot a little bit

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.049 
more leeway when you shoot a little bit
more<00:00:49.129> flat<00:00:49.600> so<00:00:50.600> I<00:00:50.660> use<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:51.019> long<00:00:51.199> profile<00:00:51.710> and

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
more flat so I use the long profile and

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.139 
more flat so I use the long profile and
then<00:00:53.059> a<00:00:53.480> white<00:00:53.899> balance<00:00:54.379> I<00:00:54.589> used<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.609> start<00:00:55.879> I

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
then a white balance I used to start I

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.220 
then a white balance I used to start I
used<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:56.749> shoot<00:00:56.989> with<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:57.559> white<00:00:58.010> balance<00:00:59.230> set

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
used to shoot with the white balance set

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.299 
used to shoot with the white balance set
to<00:01:00.350> auto<00:01:01.120> but<00:01:02.120> I've<00:01:02.690> learned<00:01:03.019> that<00:01:03.199> that's<00:01:04.190> not

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
to auto but I've learned that that's not

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.890 
to auto but I've learned that that's not
the<00:01:04.430> best<00:01:04.460> thing<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.820> do<00:01:04.940> because<00:01:05.089> your<00:01:05.720> white

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
the best thing to do because your white

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.780 
the best thing to do because your white
balance<00:01:06.110> can<00:01:06.560> change<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.220> much<00:01:07.400> it's<00:01:07.640> much

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
balance can change so much it's much

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.670 
balance can change so much it's much
different<00:01:08.210> than<00:01:08.300> a<00:01:08.630> land-based<00:01:09.020> camera<00:01:09.500> where

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
different than a land-based camera where

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.200 
different than a land-based camera where
you<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:10.159> have<00:01:10.310> a<00:01:10.340> little<00:01:10.490> bit<00:01:10.670> more<00:01:10.820> control

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
you you have a little bit more control

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.700 
you you have a little bit more control
over<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.540> scene<00:01:11.780> or<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.140> scenes<00:01:12.380> not<00:01:12.560> going

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
over the scene or the scenes not going

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.860 
over the scene or the scenes not going
to<00:01:12.770> change<00:01:13.010> that<00:01:13.130> drastically<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:14.390> what

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
to change that drastically and what

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.380 
to change that drastically and what
happens<00:01:15.320> is<00:01:15.530> if<00:01:16.040> you're<00:01:16.670> shooting<00:01:16.850> white<00:01:17.120> auto

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
happens is if you're shooting white auto

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.240 
happens is if you're shooting white auto
white<00:01:17.750> balance<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.380> your<00:01:18.740> camera<00:01:19.160> is

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
white balance and your camera is

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.310 
white balance and your camera is
shooting<00:01:19.520> say<00:01:19.880> straight<00:01:20.150> forward<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:20.720> then

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
shooting say straight forward and then

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.220 
shooting say straight forward and then
you<00:01:21.440> quickly<00:01:21.650> point<00:01:22.070> down<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:23.750> whole<00:01:23.930> color

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
you quickly point down the whole color

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.170 
you quickly point down the whole color
cast<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.100> shot<00:01:25.370> will<00:01:25.640> be<00:01:25.670> different

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
cast of the shot will be different

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.510 
cast of the shot will be different
usually<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:26.990> little<00:01:27.230> bit<00:01:27.350> cooler<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:27.950> you'll

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
usually a little bit cooler and you'll

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.950 
usually a little bit cooler and you'll
notice<00:01:28.760> that<00:01:28.910> all<00:01:29.060> sudden<00:01:29.540> it'll<00:01:29.690> take<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:29.840> few

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
notice that all sudden it'll take a few

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.740 
notice that all sudden it'll take a few
seconds<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.680> that<00:01:31.010> shot<00:01:31.310> will<00:01:31.550> warm<00:01:31.880> up<00:01:32.150> and

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
seconds and that shot will warm up and

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.970 
seconds and that shot will warm up and
that's<00:01:33.050> because<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:33.530> auto<00:01:33.680> white<00:01:33.950> balance

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
that's because that auto white balance

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.180 
that's because that auto white balance
is<00:01:34.610> correcting<00:01:35.620> using<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:36.710> new<00:01:36.860> information

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
is correcting using the new information

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.310 
is correcting using the new information
visa<00:01:38.000> V<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:38.630> know<00:01:38.750> where<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:38.990> camera<00:01:39.290> is

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
visa V you know where the camera is

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.900 
visa V you know where the camera is
pointing<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:40.460> get<00:01:41.320> as<00:01:42.430> neutral<00:01:43.430> as<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.700> can<00:01:43.880> a

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
pointing to get as neutral as it can a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.730 
pointing to get as neutral as it can a
white<00:01:44.180> balance<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.840> what<00:01:45.440> you're<00:01:45.590> going<00:01:45.680> to

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
white balance and what you're going to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.470 
white balance and what you're going to
have<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.160> shot<00:01:46.460> where<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:46.790> starts<00:01:47.120> out<00:01:47.240> very

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
have is a shot where it starts out very

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.240 
have is a shot where it starts out very
blue<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.020> all<00:01:48.320> sudden<00:01:48.710> there's<00:01:48.860> this<00:01:48.980> weird

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
blue and all sudden there's this weird

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.000 
blue and all sudden there's this weird
color<00:01:49.610> cast<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:50.330> warm<00:01:50.690> in<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.620> middle<00:01:51.830> of<00:01:51.890> your

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
color cast to warm in the middle of your

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.380 
color cast to warm in the middle of your
shot<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.460> that<00:01:52.520> just<00:01:53.090> looks<00:01:53.270> really

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
shot and that just looks really

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.010 
shot and that just looks really
unprofessional<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.410> I<00:01:54.670> am<00:01:55.670> Iowa<00:01:56.300> shoot<00:01:56.540> with<00:01:56.810> a

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
unprofessional so I am Iowa shoot with a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.320 
unprofessional so I am Iowa shoot with a
manual<00:01:57.890> white<00:01:58.100> balance<00:01:58.130> setting<00:01:58.970> got<00:01:59.300> a

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
manual white balance setting got a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.640 
manual white balance setting got a
custom<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.350> is<00:02:00.560> set<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.860> 5000<00:02:01.610> K<00:02:01.820> I<00:02:02.590> tend<00:02:03.590> to

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
custom this is set to 5000 K I tend to

on<00:02:08.420> Sun<00:02:08.780> beautiful<00:02:09.440> brights<00:02:09.649> on<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:09.890> day<00:02:10.269> this

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
on Sun beautiful brights on a day this

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.050 
on Sun beautiful brights on a day this
is<00:02:11.330> probably<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:12.110> little<00:02:12.500> bit<00:02:12.739> cool<00:02:12.980> for<00:02:13.400> some

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
is probably a little bit cool for some

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.699 
is probably a little bit cool for some
people<00:02:14.390> but<00:02:14.780> I've<00:02:14.900> learned<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.379> Phantom

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
people but I've learned that the Phantom

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.180 
people but I've learned that the Phantom
3s<00:02:15.980> camera<00:02:16.310> tends<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.940> shoot<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.269> bit<00:02:17.749> warm

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
3s camera tends to shoot a bit warm

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.190 
3s camera tends to shoot a bit warm
so<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.670> like<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.030> kick<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.450> down<00:02:20.570> just<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.170> notch

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
so I like to kick it down just a notch

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.550 
so I like to kick it down just a notch
about<00:02:21.770> 5,000<00:02:22.640> K<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.150> still<00:02:23.510> gives<00:02:24.470> you

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
about 5,000 K and that still gives you

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.310 
about 5,000 K and that still gives you
plenty<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:25.030> warm<00:02:26.030> colors<00:02:26.210> but<00:02:26.570> it's<00:02:26.870> more<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.230> a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
plenty of warm colors but it's more of a

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.480 
plenty of warm colors but it's more of a
neutral<00:02:27.860> white<00:02:28.490> balance<00:02:29.000> for<00:02:29.390> full-on

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
neutral white balance for full-on

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.070 
neutral white balance for full-on
sunlight<00:02:31.490> now<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.690> know<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:32.900> will

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
sunlight now that you know this will

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.080 
sunlight now that you know this will
vary<00:02:33.320> from<00:02:33.560> time<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.040> time<00:02:34.070> is<00:02:34.520> depending<00:02:34.970> on

vary from time to time is depending on
the<00:02:35.150> daylight<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.750> when<00:02:36.170> you're<00:02:36.290> shooting<00:02:36.710> so

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
the daylight and when you're shooting so

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.430 
the daylight and when you're shooting so
you<00:02:37.490> can<00:02:37.610> always<00:02:37.790> use<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.450> settings<00:02:39.230> for

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
you can always use the settings for

you can always use the settings for
sunny<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.850> settings<00:02:41.210> for<00:02:41.360> cloudy<00:02:41.720> those

sunny on the settings for cloudy those

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.860 
sunny on the settings for cloudy those
are<00:02:42.290> two<00:02:42.470> extremes<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.240> can<00:02:44.390> use<00:02:44.600> but

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
are two extremes that you can use but

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.840 
are two extremes that you can use but
the<00:02:45.080> good<00:02:45.230> thing<00:02:45.260> about<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.860> either

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
the good thing about that is either

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.710 
the good thing about that is either
sunny<00:02:47.270> or<00:02:47.450> cloudy<00:02:47.980> or<00:02:48.980> custom<00:02:49.700> it's<00:02:50.120> locked<00:02:50.450> in

to you know correct that color shift

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.650 
to you know correct that color shift
from<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.590> warm<00:03:04.160> shot<00:03:04.520> that<00:03:04.760> also<00:03:04.910> goes<00:03:05.390> really

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
from a warm shot that also goes really

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.970 
from a warm shot that also goes really
cold<00:03:07.210> but<00:03:08.210> the<00:03:08.600> important<00:03:08.930> thing<00:03:09.050> is<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.530> the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
cold but the important thing is the the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.160 
cold but the important thing is the the
biggest<00:03:10.460> lesson<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.030> isn't<00:03:11.420> isn't<00:03:11.600> do

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
biggest lesson of this isn't isn't do

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.220 
biggest lesson of this isn't isn't do
not<00:03:12.320> use<00:03:12.560> auto<00:03:12.860> white<00:03:13.190> balance<00:03:13.220> because<00:03:14.030> it

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
not use auto white balance because it

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.290 
not use auto white balance because it
corrects<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.350> shifts<00:03:15.740> and<00:03:15.860> changes<00:03:15.920> as<00:03:16.550> the

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
corrects and shifts and changes as the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.770 
corrects and shifts and changes as the
camera<00:03:17.660> turns<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.350> points<00:03:19.270> with<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.390> manual

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
camera turns and points with the manual

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.720 
camera turns and points with the manual
white<00:03:20.990> balance<00:03:21.020> or<00:03:21.590> one<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.100> presets<00:03:22.550> for

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
white balance or one of the presets for

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.140 
white balance or one of the presets for
cloudy<00:03:23.000> or<00:03:23.360> sunny<00:03:24.040> at<00:03:25.040> least<00:03:25.370> it's<00:03:25.580> locked<00:03:25.880> in

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
cloudy or sunny at least it's locked in

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.830 
cloudy or sunny at least it's locked in
so<00:03:26.390> that's<00:03:26.570> real<00:03:26.720> important<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:28.550> then<00:03:28.840> most

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
so that's real important and then most

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.810 
so that's real important and then most
importantly<00:03:30.320> here<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.709> style<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.550> bottom

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
importantly here is style the bottom

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.190 
importantly here is style the bottom
lower<00:03:32.060> left<00:03:32.390> of<00:03:32.630> this<00:03:32.780> menu<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:35.200> default

lower left of this menu the default
comes<00:03:36.530> up<00:03:36.709> out<00:03:36.860> like<00:03:37.070> this<00:03:37.250> but<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.550> go<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.760> the

comes up out like this but I go to the

comes up out like this but I go to the

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.720 
look realistic it's over sharpened I
think<00:03:59.810> in<00:03:59.900> my<00:04:00.050> opinion<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:02.480> Phantom<00:04:02.870> 3<00:04:03.310> is<00:04:04.310> a

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
think in my opinion the Phantom 3 is a

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.449 
think in my opinion the Phantom 3 is a
good<00:04:05.000> camera<00:04:05.420> okay<00:04:05.900> but<00:04:06.290> in<00:04:06.470> my<00:04:06.830> opinion<00:04:06.980> it's

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
good camera okay but in my opinion it's

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.540 
good camera okay but in my opinion it's
not<00:04:07.550> a<00:04:07.700> great<00:04:08.270> camera<00:04:08.989> so<00:04:09.890> you've<00:04:10.070> got<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.400> kind

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
not a great camera so you've got to kind

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.190 
not a great camera so you've got to kind
of<00:04:10.580> work<00:04:10.730> around<00:04:10.910> some<00:04:11.330> of<00:04:11.360> its<00:04:11.630> weaknesses

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
of work around some of its weaknesses

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.280 
of work around some of its weaknesses
and<00:04:12.760> one<00:04:13.760> of<00:04:13.850> its<00:04:13.970> or<00:04:14.209> two<00:04:14.360> of<00:04:14.450> its<00:04:14.600> big<00:04:14.810> biggest

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
and one of its or two of its big biggest

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.729 
and one of its or two of its big biggest
weaknesses<00:04:16.010> is<00:04:16.299> that<00:04:17.299> it<00:04:17.870> produces<00:04:18.350> more<00:04:18.709> a

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739

makes<00:05:11.380> this<00:05:11.620> just<00:05:11.950> terrible<00:05:13.380> so<00:05:14.380> I<00:05:14.410> kicked

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
makes this just terrible so I kicked

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.830 
makes this just terrible so I kicked
mine<00:05:15.220> down<00:05:15.430> to<00:05:15.640> negative<00:05:15.880> two<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:16.420> I<00:05:16.510> found

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
mine down to negative two and I found

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.810 
mine down to negative two and I found
that<00:05:16.990> this<00:05:17.170> is<00:05:17.230> the<00:05:17.560> sweet<00:05:17.830> spot<00:05:17.860> negative<00:05:18.640> one

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
that this is the sweet spot negative one

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.770 
that this is the sweet spot negative one
is<00:05:19.090> still<00:05:19.480> pretty<00:05:19.990> bad<00:05:20.350> I<00:05:20.380> think<00:05:21.030> but<00:05:22.030> negative

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
is still pretty bad I think but negative

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.480 
is still pretty bad I think but negative
three<00:05:22.960> is<00:05:23.050> way<00:05:23.320> too<00:05:23.380> much<00:05:23.740> I<00:05:23.950> think<00:05:24.100> negative

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
three is way too much I think negative

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.120 
three is way too much I think negative
three<00:05:24.700> started<00:05:25.060> to<00:05:25.180> take<00:05:25.420> away<00:05:25.830> what<00:05:26.830> appear

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
three started to take away what appear

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.180 
three started to take away what appear
to<00:05:27.280> be<00:05:27.690> taking<00:05:28.690> away<00:05:29.020> some<00:05:29.380> of<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:29.710> finer

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
to be taking away some of the finer

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.920 
to be taking away some of the finer
details<00:05:30.640> say<00:05:30.880> like<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.090> group<00:05:31.390> of<00:05:31.540> trees<00:05:31.870> a

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
details say like a group of trees a

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.080 
details say like a group of trees a
group<00:05:32.380> of<00:05:32.560> trees<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:33.490> tops<00:05:33.730> of<00:05:33.940> those<00:05:34.030> trees

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
group of trees the tops of those trees

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.960 
group of trees the tops of those trees
we're<00:05:34.450> starting<00:05:34.750> to<00:05:34.840> look<00:05:34.990> like<00:05:35.170> a<00:05:35.230> solid

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
we're starting to look like a solid

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.940 
we're starting to look like a solid
clumped<00:05:36.970> image<00:05:37.360> versus<00:05:37.840> separate<00:05:38.350> trees<00:05:38.620> with

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
clumped image versus separate trees with

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.640 
clumped image versus separate trees with
separate<00:05:39.280> leaves<00:05:39.520> and<00:05:39.790> that<00:05:39.880> kind<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.120> thing

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
separate leaves and that kind of thing

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.160 
separate leaves and that kind of thing
so<00:05:42.150> sharpness<00:05:43.150> at<00:05:43.270> negative<00:05:43.660> two<00:05:43.810> I<00:05:44.050> think

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
so sharpness at negative two I think

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.350 
so sharpness at negative two I think
I've<00:05:44.530> been<00:05:45.430> able<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.670> achieve<00:05:45.850> some<00:05:46.210> pretty

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
I've been able to achieve some pretty

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.780 
I've been able to achieve some pretty
decent<00:05:46.570> results<00:05:47.140> with<00:05:47.260> that<00:05:47.610> contrast<00:05:48.610> at

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
decent results with that contrast at

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.640 
decent results with that contrast at
negative<00:05:49.150> three<00:05:49.420> that<00:05:49.630> goes<00:05:49.780> back<00:05:50.020> to<00:05:50.290> getting

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
negative three that goes back to getting

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.910 
negative three that goes back to getting
the<00:05:50.830> flattest<00:05:51.370> image<00:05:51.790> possible<00:05:52.920> there's

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
the flattest image possible there's

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.610 
the flattest image possible there's
still<00:05:54.160> plenty<00:05:54.430> to<00:05:54.460> work<00:05:54.730> with<00:05:55.000> but<00:05:55.420> again<00:05:55.810> if

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
still plenty to work with but again if

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.050 
still plenty to work with but again if
you<00:05:56.740> shoot<00:05:56.920> something<00:05:57.220> and<00:05:57.430> your<00:05:57.550> blacks<00:05:57.790> are

you shoot something and your blacks are
