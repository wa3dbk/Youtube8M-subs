00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.740
 and whoever who wins will do it 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.889
 with all the merits and although 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.139
 we have been the first to fall 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.940
 in disappointment but little by little they go to 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.850
 to fall all or almost all because only 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.320
 win one 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:24.890
 yesterday's theme I think it's a thing 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.240
 typical of a training in which 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.779
 He had been bitten by a team had 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.830
 remained weakened numerically in addition 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.050
 almost all were very very players 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.480
 offensive the others were well done 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.480
 goals were a bit uneasy the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.250
 team that favre played on 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.050
 seat of prefer to reinforce with xabi 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.610
 Alonso for putting a more defensive man 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.220
 to balance that match that is 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.510
 was decomposing and he then in the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.770
 moment he said no because I do not want him 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.589
 I want to continue with my team as 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.850
 saying I want and then it took a few 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.500
 tenths of a second we hold 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.810
 stoically until the bib was changed 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.790
 and nothing more 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.350
 and us but come on I think it's a 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.750
 practice I do not say it's a practice 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.630
 usual but there's no need to 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.760
 get a lot of hearing from this ball because 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.210
 he does not have it and then he talked this morning 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.040
 with him all cleared up perfectly and I 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.630
 I think we respect each other, we appreciate each other 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.640
 he has just come to all 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.550
 calls with us to all the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.530
 calls 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.540
 if I told you yesterday something that I said this 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.810
 tomorrow I do not know if anyone asks me 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.020
 but I say it now that the coach 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.740
 think for everyone and for them and for each 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.020
 one is the best and each player finally 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.010
 at the end he thinks for him but we 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.020
 has happened to everyone when we have been 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.830
 footballers since nothing is strange either 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.900
 or anything that does not enter into what is 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.990
 a coexistence of a team and our 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.570
 recognition is very big towards xavi 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.500
 very big huge Spanish football 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.820
 towards the we go another one that does not 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.530
 wants to recognize is because it takes a 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.890
 shirt is permanently to go to 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.890
 bed
