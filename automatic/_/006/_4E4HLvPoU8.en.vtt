00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
years

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.979 
years
it's<00:00:23.230> actually<00:00:23.529> lateral<00:00:23.919> raise<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:25.150> arm<00:00:25.179> with

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
it's actually lateral raise one arm with

it's actually lateral raise one arm with
a<00:00:26.019> barbell<00:00:26.500> instead<00:00:26.859> of<00:00:26.949> a<00:00:27.009> dumbbell<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
a barbell instead of a dumbbell the

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.580 
a barbell instead of a dumbbell the
reason<00:00:30.009> I<00:00:30.070> do<00:00:30.130> this<00:00:30.399> I<00:00:31.019> can<00:00:32.019> get<00:00:32.140> more<00:00:32.259> muscles

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
reason I do this I can get more muscles

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.000 
reason I do this I can get more muscles
to<00:00:32.710> fire<00:00:33.030> by<00:00:34.030> distributing<00:00:34.570> three<00:00:35.320> feet<00:00:35.800> of

to fire by distributing three feet of

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.680 
to fire by distributing three feet of
weight<00:00:36.220> instead<00:00:36.579> of<00:00:36.670> hitting<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:37.150> small

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
weight instead of hitting a small

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.590 
weight instead of hitting a small
dumbbell<00:00:38.170> so<00:00:38.650> the<00:00:39.610> other<00:00:39.760> thing<00:00:39.940> I<00:00:40.059> did<00:00:40.120> also

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
dumbbell so the other thing I did also

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.060 
dumbbell so the other thing I did also
does<00:00:40.750> it<00:00:40.870> just<00:00:41.019> really<00:00:41.230> will<00:00:41.530> bring<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.829> lot

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
an exercise I've been doing for years to

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:17.820 
an exercise I've been doing for years to
target<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.110> rear<00:03:01.260> dose

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
I actually came up with this exercise

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.710 
I actually came up with this exercise
two<00:03:20.620> years<00:03:20.800> ago<00:03:21.040> like<00:03:21.280> two<00:03:21.460> columns<00:03:21.820> W<00:03:22.180> and

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
two years ago like two columns W and

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.810 
two years ago like two columns W and
you'll<00:03:23.080> see<00:03:23.260> why<00:03:23.380> actually<00:03:24.220> show<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:24.700> the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
you'll see why actually show you the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.490 
you'll see why actually show you the
backside<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.720> can<00:03:25.900> actually<00:03:26.200> see<00:03:26.380> my
