00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
that's pretty responsive but I'll give

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:46.830

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.320 

because<00:05:47.840> um<00:05:48.819> the<00:05:49.819> response<00:05:50.270> is<00:05:51.669> fast<00:05:52.669> but<00:05:53.090> it's

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
because um the response is fast but it's

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.499 
because um the response is fast but it's
not<00:05:53.539> fast<00:05:53.840> enough<00:05:53.990> and<00:05:54.819> I<00:05:55.819> don't<00:05:56.300> know<00:05:56.360> about

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
not fast enough and I don't know about

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:01.200 
not fast enough and I don't know about
the<00:05:56.780> hoary<00:05:57.080> stick<00:05:57.500> if<00:05:57.860> I<00:05:58.270> have<00:05:59.270> a<00:05:59.860> time<00:06:00.860> Tobias

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
the hoary stick if I have a time Tobias

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.629 
the hoary stick if I have a time Tobias
time<00:06:02.210> to<00:06:02.330> buy<00:06:02.479> another<00:06:03.009> this<00:06:04.009> gives<00:06:04.250> me<00:06:04.310> time

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
time to buy another this gives me time

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.029 
time to buy another this gives me time
to<00:06:04.669> buy<00:06:04.849> another<00:06:05.150> joystick<00:06:05.719> I'll<00:06:06.710> probably

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
to buy another joystick I'll probably

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.670 
to buy another joystick I'll probably
eat<00:06:07.250> a<00:06:07.490> i'll<00:06:08.090> probably<00:06:08.360> bite<00:06:08.690> but<00:06:09.319> that's<00:06:09.530> when

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
eat a i'll probably bite but that's when

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.040 
eat a i'll probably bite but that's when
I'm<00:06:09.800> going<00:06:10.069> to<00:06:10.159> stick<00:06:10.370> with<00:06:10.430> this<00:06:10.729> one<00:06:10.789> and<00:06:11.180> I

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
I'm going to stick with this one and I

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.249 
I'm going to stick with this one and I
could<00:06:12.229> probably<00:06:12.469> swap<00:06:13.340> it<00:06:13.490> with<00:06:13.520> sanwa<00:06:14.180> parts

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
could probably swap it with sanwa parts

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:18.550 
could probably swap it with sanwa parts
so<00:06:15.280> it's<00:06:16.280> a<00:06:16.370> good<00:06:16.490> response<00:06:17.000> but<00:06:17.240> esten<00:06:17.599> but

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
so it's a good response but esten but

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.990 
so it's a good response but esten but
not<00:06:19.069> as<00:06:19.190> the<00:06:19.340> fast<00:06:19.699> response<00:06:19.990> so<00:06:20.990> um<00:06:21.229> so<00:06:22.000> yeah

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
not as the fast response so um so yeah

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.510 
not as the fast response so um so yeah
it's<00:06:23.930> ready<00:06:24.819> all<00:06:25.819> right<00:06:26.000> so<00:06:26.389> uh<00:06:26.919> yes<00:06:27.919> six<00:06:28.340> out
