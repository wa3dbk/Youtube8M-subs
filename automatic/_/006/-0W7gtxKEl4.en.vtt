00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
put out another album for five years

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.130 
put out another album for five years
until<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.649> green<00:00:58.890> album<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.460> 2001<00:01:00.449> which<00:01:00.899> saw

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
until the green album in 2001 which saw

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.590 
until the green album in 2001 which saw
them<00:01:01.350> string<00:01:01.770> backs<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.730> guess<00:01:02.940> closer<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
them string backs I guess closer to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.299 
them string backs I guess closer to
their<00:01:03.780> roots<00:01:04.080> but<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.739> Pinkerton<00:01:05.220> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
their roots but here on Pinkerton I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.620 
their roots but here on Pinkerton I
guess<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.610> got<00:01:05.760> something<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> little

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
guess we got something that was a little

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.600 
guess we got something that was a little
bit<00:01:06.750> less<00:01:06.930> radio<00:01:07.470> friendly<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.220> exactly

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
bit less radio friendly not exactly

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.700 
bit less radio friendly not exactly
mainstream<00:01:09.270> appealing<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.869> some<00:01:10.110> ways<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.560> mean

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
mainstream appealing in some ways I mean

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.830
