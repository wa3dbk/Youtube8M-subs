00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.070
 hello friends we are we want 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.080
 send a very strong greeting to all 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.780
 the netizens that are achieving 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.240
 they terrified 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.240
 comprises the disc as has been the 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.580
 evolution of his music through good 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.939
 coming out the soap opera until now how 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.110
 do you consider that this evolution has been 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.480
 huge from the beginning because 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.029
 obviously with the first disc 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.590
 we knew each other as rbd we did not know what 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.890
 what can we do all up to a certain 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.619
 point 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.270
 the evolution was incredible not the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.610
 producers also evolved with 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.170
 we can listen for example 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.190
 already with the latter is to start from scratch 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.770
 which is a pretty quiet album but 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.140
 very good both the letter and its 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.190
 songs that stick to you then I think 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.760
 that already said a pretty evolution 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.629
 good and what new challenges are there for rbd 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.250
 after so much success so good 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.110
 I believe that life is a challenge not every 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.480
 day is a new challenge since you 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.149
 wake up and I think it has rbd 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.770
 many challenges ahead the first and the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.810
 closest to you is that you like this 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.729
 fan edition because the truth is that it brings 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.590
 things apart as very personal as well 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.600
 like the song of sweet the song 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.060
 of maite that are things that they do not 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.259
 they wrote and such it also brings by 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.929
 example behind the scenes of the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.149
 videos that we can see there just 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.070
 awakened by coming to the video early 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.560
 things so they are like super fun 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.660
 then these are also like challenges not 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.060
 because exposing yourself like that you are 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.420
 it's a challenge and always a new job and 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.560
 a new album that's a super challenge and I 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.790
 I think we're missing a lot of things 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.800
 meet and while people 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.050
 to follow us then seeing together and such there 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.090
 we will be and hope you like what 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.590
 we do because at the end of the day everything 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.080
 what we do is for the people then 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.390
 I hope you like this new job and 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.210
 everything we do what it means to 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.360
 you as a group and as people 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.120
 be the reflection of the current youth and 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.370
 which also serve as a prototype for 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.560
 all the kids that everyone wants 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.750
 be like one of you each with 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.720
 his personality different but that the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.310
 see as an example to follow then look 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.810
 I think we have had the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.480
 fortune 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.910
 far from considering us an example to 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.709
 continue we consider ourselves the reflection of 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.210
 the kids like you well said it every 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:24.750
 one has certain 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.490
 emotions certain preferences as soon as 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.420
 to music in regards to many things 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.710
 in fashion that obviously everyone is 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.190
 can identify with each one 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.640
 us but I think if seeing you as 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.500
 a figure that they will follow is a bit 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.200
 much more complicated and it is something that 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.330
 is loading and loading many things not 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.730
 I think we are rather the reflection of 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.160
 youth we are also young and 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.850
 We are working to be a good 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.890
 example also of how they would define 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.890
 you personally your music 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:08.310
 happy in 100% pop and I think that 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.900
 is this was good father because pop 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.609
 as it has been lost is all the time 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.280
 it was pop is plastic and I do not know that I 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.200
 I think rbd and good people rather 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.700
 the fans have made it have 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.280
 credibility aside from what has been done 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.840
 I believe that very good work 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.469
 musically with the producers who have 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.569
 He has been with us and is one hundred percent 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:29.760
 because that's what music says 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.560
 cheerful music falling feel good 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.620
 that makes you dance or that you can 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.150
 listen and you identify and it 's like the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.790
 final will bring joy and that you 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.519
 identify something great music 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.739
 is that it has no borders and can unite 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.099
 countries as well as many things separate them 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.290
 the music reaches all 9 with 9 and 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.269
 other and good are music he has achieved 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.359
 has been in many parts of the world and 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.590
 very well accepted what do you think 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.769
 then that is one of the most 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.230
 parents that with good music has been 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.000
 could to a certain extent joined to much 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.120
 people from different places with 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.950
 different beliefs and thoughts 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.860
 in which we arrived in another country and the 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.640
 people have learned to speak your language 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.190
 so that has been something incredible 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.620
 that I never forget, of course, that they are 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.620
 leaving a trace beyond the music 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.330
 if it's the cutest when we get to 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.000
 countries like brazil like romania if you see 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.310
 that people are singing in Spanish 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.729
 that people greet you in Spanish that's 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.139
 something impressive that I really do not 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.180
 We can believe because we never 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.370
 we imagine that now let's go to serbia 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.740
 let's go to slovenia to return to 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.330
 Romania then imagine what nerves 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.970
 because you do not understand anything about it 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.069
 what they say or if they suddenly know your 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.479
 songs in Spanish and they treat you 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.910
 say hello and say a few words 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.849
 Spanish and that's how amazing is something 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.550
 that rbd I think that's where you can see 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.289
 like the madness that has been this because 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.419
 for the novel that was subtitled by 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.860
 example in romania more or less like what 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.110
 disappointment understand Spanish and it 's 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.220
 johnson talk it and it's amazing and 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.720
 we know that for example in israel 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.060
 they also sing our songs in 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.770
 Spanish and all that hopefully we'll be 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.840
 that we are out there someday because if 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.539
 It would be like another dream come true 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.590
 besides those places that you mention in 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.340
 where else are you going to present 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.680
 soon 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.870
 let's go to argentina let's go to 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:30.780
 Colombia to Peru to Venezuela 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.139
 and well , if we're coming soon 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.510
 already monterrey to an event and to the city of 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.100
 Carmen on July 20 so good they are 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.350
 the only two dates we have for 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.150
 moment in Mexico but we are very 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.820
 happy hopefully soon we will come to 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.560
 do concerts rather than here in 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.900
 our house let's make concerts because 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.240
 we are always leaving and we miss 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.400
 mexico and also the people from here good 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.990
 finally it was the one that made them 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.690
 take off and the one that loves them the most 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.300
 Mexican public and already to finish that 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.570
 can you tell me about this record so 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.500
 more fun and more enjoyed that 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.180
 It was 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.730
 Well, actually, all the 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.970
 processes the truth we like 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.980
 at the end when we worked so much the 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.010
 fact of having recorded the disc was 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.120
 very funny we did it in Mexico a 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.230
 part in Mexico and part in the 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.060
 angels 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.980
 and good the surprise is that it also has 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.370
 is to have them behind cameras where 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.530
 You can suddenly show 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.570
 that part a little more intimate of the 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.810
 creation of videos to start from 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:36.060
 zero and unattainable because I think that 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.449
 one to me personally seems very 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:42.930
 funny how was recorded was filmed the 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:44.340
 video start from scratch is like a 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.840
 very strong contrast to what is 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.080
 unreachable that is a little more video 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.310
 nostalgic as much more then this 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.660
 a ballad at the end of the day 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.639
 being zero is the total contrast 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.240
 so then I think I liked it 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:59.970
 much the way in how it was done 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.770
 this video start from scratch and then the 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.320
 theme not that it's like very funny and 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:07.289
 many colors and all that yes all everything 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.110
 you see you have to be very happy they go 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:12.990
 happening and others besides something very father is 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.940
 that is not how they are currently done 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:18.479
 many videos if it's not like a plane 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.160
 sequence in some cases other than this 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:23.280
 It was not very good because suddenly 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.560
 correct take off the shirt you change 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.249
 the other the girls because suddenly they were going 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:31.349
 from a store like clothes 

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:33.569
 they have to cost as in some 

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:35.279
 towels have to arrive and get off 

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:37.229
 quickly to the blouse but suddenly 

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:39.629
 leave the blouse here then you have to 

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:41.729
 repeat the whole shot because as in a 

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:43.619
 flat sequence but it was something very 

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:46.409
 fun and I think people also 

00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:50.249
 I really enjoy it and you can wait there 

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:52.799
 with hair more or less like this to maite 

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:55.109
 also to sweet the time also night 

00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:57.599
 whole with him with his with his little heart 

00:07:55.109 --> 00:08:00.299
 in the in the cheek 

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:02.789
 I think it was was it was a video that everyone 

00:08:00.299 --> 00:08:04.919
 the funny ones so many thanks 

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:07.469
 for having accompanied us today 

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:09.329
 here friends of earth I am diana 

00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:12.409
 they already know what they can buy 

00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:12.409
 it is everywhere
