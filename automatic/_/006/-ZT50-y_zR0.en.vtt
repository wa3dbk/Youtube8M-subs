thing<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.250> did<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:33.000> hired<00:00:33.270> an<00:00:33.660> expert

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
thing we did it was we hired an expert

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.160 
thing we did it was we hired an expert
to<00:00:34.980> cut<00:00:35.190> down<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.760> main<00:00:36.030> tree<00:00:36.420> from<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> top

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
to cut down the main tree from the top

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.700 
to cut down the main tree from the top
to<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.649> bottom<00:00:37.920> into<00:00:38.370> big<00:00:39.030> chunks<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.469> we

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
to the bottom into big chunks so that we

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.160 
to the bottom into big chunks so that we
could<00:00:40.890> use<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.340> firewood<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.120> then<00:00:42.899> we

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
could use it for firewood and then we

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.340 
could use it for firewood and then we
had<00:00:43.410> all<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> branches<00:00:44.399> cut<00:00:44.700> off<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.350> we

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
had all the branches cut off and we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.139 
had all the branches cut off and we
didn't<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.649> what<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.280> them<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.000> my

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
didn't know what to do with them so my

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.090 
didn't know what to do with them so my
husband<00:00:48.510> rented<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.899> chipper<00:00:49.289> at<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.739> local

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
husband rented a chipper at the local

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700 
husband rented a chipper at the local
rental<00:00:50.370> equipment<00:00:50.850> store<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.320> brought<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
home and it wasn't very much to rent it

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.209 
home and it wasn't very much to rent it
for<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.600> day<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:55.079> were<00:00:55.199> very<00:00:55.350> surprised<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
for a day we were very surprised that it

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.770 
for a day we were very surprised that it
wasn't<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.699> much<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:57.000> we<00:00:57.149> thought<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.449> would<00:00:57.539> be

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
wasn't as much as we thought it would be

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
wasn't as much as we thought it would be
and<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.770> took<00:00:58.980> all<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.489> branches<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.300> ran

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
and we took all the branches and we ran

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.270 
and we took all the branches and we ran
it<00:01:00.629> through<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> chipper<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.530> as<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> result

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it through the chipper and as a result

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.240 
it through the chipper and as a result
we<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> pile<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.180> wood<00:01:03.390> chips<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.989> love<00:01:04.920> my

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
raised beds I'm just putting a little

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.469 
raised beds I'm just putting a little
layer<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.890> wood<00:01:32.100> chips<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.909> bottom<00:01:32.939> of

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
layer of the wood chips on the bottom of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.060 
layer of the wood chips on the bottom of
the<00:01:33.630> raised<00:01:33.810> bed<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.650> way<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> know

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the raised bed and that way I know

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.100 
the raised bed and that way I know
there's<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.729> great<00:01:36.030> drainage<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
there's going to be great drainage and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.770 
there's going to be great drainage and
that<00:01:37.680> none<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:38.100> plants<00:01:38.579> will<00:01:38.729> rot<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.720> I'm

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that none of my plants will rot so I'm

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.090 
that none of my plants will rot so I'm
going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> put<00:01:40.079> compost<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.650> top<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
going to put compost on top of the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.639 
going to put compost on top of the
woodchips<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.780> find<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.439> whenever

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
woodchips so I just find that whenever
