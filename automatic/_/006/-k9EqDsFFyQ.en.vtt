00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.490 
the actual case it has a very nice form
factor<00:01:32.479> let's<00:01:33.479> actually<00:01:33.689> slip<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.170> into<00:01:34.320> an

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
factor let's actually slip it into an

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.679 
factor let's actually slip it into an
iPhone<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.729> guys<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> good<00:01:36.630> idea

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
iPhone so you guys can get a good idea

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.899 
iPhone so you guys can get a good idea
of<00:01:36.960> how<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.110> looks<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.520> super<00:01:41.880> easy

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
of how it looks so that was super easy

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.770 
of how it looks so that was super easy
and<00:01:42.470> simple<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.649> put<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.509> see

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and simple to put in and you can see

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.999 
and simple to put in and you can see
that<00:01:45.930> all<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> ports<00:01:46.500> are<00:01:46.619> perfectly

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that all the ports are perfectly

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.789 
that all the ports are perfectly
accessible<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:48.240> camera<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> flash<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
accessible the camera the flash the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.020 
accessible the camera the flash the
volume<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:51.240> top<00:01:52.100> speakers<00:01:53.100> everything's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
volume the top speakers everything's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.459 
volume the top speakers everything's
great<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.820> it's<00:01:56.820> very<00:01:57.090> flat<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
great and it's very flat it's the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.370 
great and it's very flat it's the
perfect<00:01:58.500> form<00:01:59.040> factor<00:01:59.899> this<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.049> much<00:02:01.229> better

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
perfect form factor this is much better

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.490 
perfect form factor this is much better
than<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.799> old<00:02:02.040> iphone<00:02:02.610> 3g<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.329> 3gs<00:02:03.500> case

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
than the old iphone 3g and 3gs case

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.819 
than the old iphone 3g and 3gs case
because<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.909> iphone<00:02:06.450> 4<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.990> flat<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.680> back

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
because the iphone 4 is flat on the back

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.729 
because the iphone 4 is flat on the back
whereas<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.879> iphone<00:02:09.300> 3g<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.899> 3gs<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.410> curved

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
whereas the iphone 3g and 3gs is curved

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.850 
whereas the iphone 3g and 3gs is curved
on<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> back

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
on the back

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.580 
on the back
curve<00:02:12.130> made<00:02:12.520> your<00:02:12.700> credit<00:02:13.060> cards<00:02:13.270> bend<00:02:13.590> over

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
curve made your credit cards bend over

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.100 
curve made your credit cards bend over
time<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:16.120> didn't<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.690> about<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
time and I didn't like that about the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.560 
time and I didn't like that about the
case<00:02:17.350> even<00:02:17.620> though<00:02:17.740> I<00:02:17.830> loved<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.550> loved<00:02:18.910> the

all almost all of the antenna on the
iphone<00:03:07.870> 4<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.709> you<00:03:08.770> can't<00:03:09.190> touch<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.880> lot<00:03:10.720> of

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
iphone 4 so you can't touch a lot of

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.840 
iphone 4 so you can't touch a lot of
areas<00:03:11.230> like<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:11.739> prevents<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.340> from<00:03:12.370> touching
