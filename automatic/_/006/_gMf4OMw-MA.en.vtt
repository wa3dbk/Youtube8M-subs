00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.430
 I'll show you the different ones now 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.670
 board profile that probably 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.910
 best known board profile is the camper 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.230
 this one is looking forward to it 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.750
 that means that boards are in the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.150
 middle up and goes to go and part 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.760
 downward 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.410
 if ye over to the board on it 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.900
 you press the edge steadily in the 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.879
 snow means if you are a very 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.640
 want to have a precise board with a board 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.070
 which one can buy super a board what 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.140
 should be steadily sick stop 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.890
 that camper profile is the right choice for 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.770
 you a revving the profile is 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.430
 the rocker or reverse kemper 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.559
 this is negatively biased the 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.500
 Pressure points in the snow are not here 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.829
 just before going out and stops but in the 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.440
 center 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.610
 That makes the board relatively driving 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.590
 Loose your advantage is in the deep snow than 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.899
 beginners and as advanced 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.200
 a rocker board offers you a high 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:17.420
 uplift and forgive a very mistake 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.310
 the driving style with her only 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.590
 difficult to misunderstand there are many 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.720
 the camper and rocker mission the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.030
 best known here is a rocker 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.409
 board with two fighters to provide 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.939
 The campers are under your feet 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.189
 That gives you the most important two 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.220
 make more control than one 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.979
 pure rocker and more revving 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.280
 as a camper target of the hybrid 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.570
 Construction is always the same 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.799
 maximum revolutions at high 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:55.009
 stability a flat profile is like that 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.689
 name already says completely flat tends 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.390
 less misjudged than a camper 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.640
 Board is not quite so unstable 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.770
 like a rocker board seek you 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.990
 sporting board accesses the camper 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.880
 Missing versions miss her forgiveness 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.940
 drive it and buoyancy in deep snow 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.660
 access the rocker versions and now 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.860
 have fun in the snow 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.860
 june ready
