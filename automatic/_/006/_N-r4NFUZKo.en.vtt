00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.230
 tilapia tuna harvester every time 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.629
 that feed your crappie 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.039
 waste the food gets dirty very 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.590
 Quick your pond for all 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.570
 food waste there are fish that grow 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.949
 more than others 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.289
 recently college students 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.539
 polytechnic of chiapas but a device 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.000
 to give the proper constructions of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.949
 food for women and piaf and with 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.980
 this to ensure that all women have 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.260
 an equal size said equipment intends 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.670
 avoid excessive spending of food is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.820
 common that people have the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.320
 food in the tank to buckets that 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.750
 results in that not all 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.270
 mojarras eat equally and for 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.390
 consequence they do not grow in the same way 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.310
 besides that the food not eaten remains 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.950
 at the bottom of the pond and cause 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.840
 women do not want to eat it this brings 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.870
 as a consequence that the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.760
 food and contaminate the pond with this 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.490
 machine will be achieved that the mojarras 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.280
 they can grow the same size but as 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.049
 The machine is divided into three parts 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.579
 the first one is 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.740
 where a quantity of 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.259
 foods that will give them the day 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.229
 second is constituted by a program 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.110
 that sets the number of times that 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.780
 they will feed them and not third party 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.119
 are the shots is the portion of the 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.819
 food size for example it 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.860
 place 5 kilograms of food after 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.780
 to configure the times when 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.689
 will shoot the food portions at 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.119
 day that is two or three or four and at 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.759
 final according to the times and the amount of 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.490
 Food of shooting at food every 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.500
 change from now to second according to 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.299
 the configuration the interesting thing is that 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.759
 until the mojarras do not finish the 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.250
 food will trigger the other portion 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.530
 that's why it is handled in portions so that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.649
 do not spend food like it will warn 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.049
 with a sound if you no longer have food 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.299
 the machine said project is 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.939
 determined for hatchery ponds 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.770
 but you can also configure it for 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.259
 pond of your tank as for 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.880
 feed props dogs or cats for in 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.880
 tune with the science pedro 3
