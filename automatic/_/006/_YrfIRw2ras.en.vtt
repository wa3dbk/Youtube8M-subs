let's<00:00:22.660> consider<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.320> number<00:00:23.610> 307

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
let's consider the number 307

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.900 
let's consider the number 307
we<00:00:26.269> will<00:00:26.480> begin<00:00:26.720> by<00:00:27.050> considering<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:27.910> square

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
we will begin by considering the square

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.229 
we will begin by considering the square
of<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.179> leftmost<00:00:29.539> digit<00:00:29.900> in<00:00:30.730> this<00:00:31.730> case<00:00:32.000> the

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
of the leftmost digit in this case the

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.920 
of the leftmost digit in this case the
leftmost<00:00:32.509> digit<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:33.140> 3<00:00:34.210> so<00:00:35.210> first<00:00:35.600> write<00:00:35.899> down

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
leftmost digit is 3 so first write down

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.410 
leftmost digit is 3 so first write down
the<00:00:36.260> square<00:00:36.470> of<00:00:36.710> three<00:00:37.010> which<00:00:37.699> is<00:00:37.879> nine<00:00:38.180> as

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
the square of three which is nine as

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.530 
the square of three which is nine as
shown<00:00:39.050> for<00:00:39.949> the<00:00:40.070> next<00:00:40.340> step<00:00:40.519> we<00:00:40.730> multiply<00:00:41.269> all

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
shown for the next step we multiply all

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.329 
shown for the next step we multiply all
nonzero<00:00:41.960> digits<00:00:42.350> in<00:00:42.800> 307<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:43.909> the<00:00:44.659> number<00:00:44.930> two

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
nonzero digits in 307 and the number two

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.899 
nonzero digits in 307 and the number two
in<00:00:46.339> 307<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.570> nonzero<00:00:47.989> digits<00:00:48.230> are<00:00:48.699> three<00:00:49.699> and

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
in 307 the nonzero digits are three and

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.710 
in 307 the nonzero digits are three and
seven<00:00:50.739> so<00:00:51.739> multiplying<00:00:52.280> 3<00:00:52.610> with<00:00:52.760> seven<00:00:53.149> gives

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
seven so multiplying 3 with seven gives

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.060 
seven so multiplying 3 with seven gives
us<00:00:53.870> 21<00:00:54.470> and<00:00:54.760> multiplying<00:00:55.760> 21<00:00:56.360> with<00:00:56.899> 2<00:00:57.260> gives<00:00:57.920> us

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
us 21 and multiplying 21 with 2 gives us

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.780 
us 21 and multiplying 21 with 2 gives us

multiply all nonzero digits with each

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.330 
multiply all nonzero digits with each
other<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:50.600> then<00:01:51.109> multiply<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.710> result<00:01:51.950> with

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
other and then multiply the result with

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.289 
other and then multiply the result with
two<00:01:52.689> so<00:01:53.689> multiplying<00:01:54.259> 9<00:01:54.590> with<00:01:54.829> two<00:01:55.119> gives<00:01:56.119> us

more<00:02:52.400> than<00:02:52.580> three<00:02:52.850> digits<00:02:53.770> let's<00:02:54.770> solve<00:02:55.040> a

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
more than three digits let's solve a

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.030 
more than three digits let's solve a
final<00:02:55.520> example<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.720> takes<00:02:57.020> care<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.410> such<00:02:58.010> a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
final example that takes care of such a

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.180 
final example that takes care of such a
situation<00:02:59.020> let's<00:03:00.020> find<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.470> square<00:03:00.710> of<00:03:01.130> the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
situation let's find the square of the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.460 
situation let's find the square of the
number<00:03:01.750> 708<00:03:03.220> once<00:03:04.220> again<00:03:04.610> we<00:03:05.060> first<00:03:05.390> square<00:03:05.930> 7

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
number 708 once again we first square 7

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.940 
number 708 once again we first square 7
which<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.610> leftmost<00:03:07.910> digit<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:08.600> get<00:03:09.530> 49

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
which is the leftmost digit and get 49

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.110 
which is the leftmost digit and get 49
as<00:03:10.370> shown<00:03:10.910> in<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:12.500> next<00:03:12.860> step<00:03:13.070> we<00:03:13.610> multiply

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
as shown in the next step we multiply

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.370 
as shown in the next step we multiply
the<00:03:14.180> nonzero<00:03:14.720> digits<00:03:14.990> of<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.830> number<00:03:15.860> with<00:03:16.760> 2

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
the nonzero digits of the number with 2

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.199 
the nonzero digits of the number with 2
so<00:03:18.380> multiplying<00:03:18.980> 7<00:03:19.490> and<00:03:19.700> 8<00:03:19.940> gives<00:03:20.660> us<00:03:20.900> 56<00:03:21.709> and

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
so multiplying 7 and 8 gives us 56 and

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.240 
so multiplying 7 and 8 gives us 56 and
multiplying<00:03:23.209> 56<00:03:24.020> with<00:03:24.500> 2<00:03:24.709> gives<00:03:25.100> us<00:03:25.630> 112<00:03:27.250> since

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
multiplying 56 with 2 gives us 112 since

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.430 
multiplying 56 with 2 gives us 112 since
we<00:03:28.400> know<00:03:28.670> that<00:03:28.970> each<00:03:29.450> step<00:03:29.870> can<00:03:30.080> contribute

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
we know that each step can contribute

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.670 
we know that each step can contribute
only<00:03:30.860> two<00:03:31.310> digits<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.090> final<00:03:32.390> result<00:03:32.780> we

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
only two digits to the final result we

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.830 
only two digits to the final result we
will<00:03:33.860> carry<00:03:34.190> over<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:35.030> most<00:03:35.270> significant

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
will carry over the most significant

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.570 
will carry over the most significant
digit<00:03:36.230> in<00:03:36.700> 112<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:39.440> most<00:03:39.709> significant<00:03:40.280> digit

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
digit in 112 the most significant digit

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.740 
digit in 112 the most significant digit
is<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:41.030> leftmost<00:03:41.360> digit<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:42.430> for<00:03:43.430> 112<00:03:44.150> the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
is the leftmost digit and for 112 the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.400 
is the leftmost digit and for 112 the
most<00:03:44.989> significant<00:03:45.560> digit<00:03:45.860> will<00:03:46.160> be<00:03:46.310> 1<00:03:46.519> so<00:03:47.410> we

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
most significant digit will be 1 so we

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.320 
most significant digit will be 1 so we
carry<00:03:48.739> one<00:03:49.010> over<00:03:49.340> as<00:03:49.580> shown<00:03:49.940> in<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.209> example

carry one over as shown in the example

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.800 
carry one over as shown in the example
and<00:03:50.989> add<00:03:51.769> it<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:51.980> 49<00:03:52.610> that<00:03:53.239> was<00:03:53.420> earlier

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
and add it to 49 that was earlier

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.900 
and add it to 49 that was earlier
obtained<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.610> get<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.820> intermediate<00:03:56.390> result

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
obtained and get the intermediate result

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.490
