film<00:00:16.710> me<00:00:17.520> doing<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.449> review<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.900> way<00:00:19.050> I

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
film me doing the review in the way I

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.960 
film me doing the review in the way I
normally<00:00:19.260> do<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.520> change<00:00:20.699> out<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
normally do so we have to change out the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.310 
normally do so we have to change out the
format<00:00:21.270> for<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.510> next<00:00:21.779> few<00:00:21.900> weeks<00:00:22.109> and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
format for the next few weeks and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.259 
format for the next few weeks and
hopefully<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:23.369> would<00:00:23.580> still<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.970> an

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
hopefully this would still be an

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.509 
hopefully this would still be an
effective<00:00:25.080> manner<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.830> review<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.460> guys

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
effective manner to review for you guys

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.189 
effective manner to review for you guys
and<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.090> guys<00:00:27.150> still<00:00:27.420> get<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> same<00:00:27.750> amount

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
and you guys still get the same amount

and you guys still get the same amount
of<00:00:28.619> information<00:00:28.859> if<00:00:29.250> not<00:00:29.490> more<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.090> quicker

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
of information if not more and quicker

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.540 
of information if not more and quicker
so<00:00:31.109> let<00:00:31.320> me<00:00:31.410> know<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:31.949> okay<00:00:32.340> for

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
you guys and I'll try to do my best to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.090 
you guys and I'll try to do my best to
find<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:36.079> an<00:00:37.079> effective<00:00:37.710> way<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.860> do

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
find out like an effective way to do

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.720 
find out like an effective way to do
this<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.210> today<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:40.680> did<00:00:40.710> said<00:00:41.129> before<00:00:41.520> I

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
this but so today as I did said before I

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.000 
this but so today as I did said before I
probably<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.390> finishing<00:00:43.050> up<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> pair<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
probably be finishing up the pair of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.569 
probably be finishing up the pair of
testers<00:00:44.430> which<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.649> the<00:00:46.649> formula<00:00:46.980> X<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
testers which is the formula X and

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.029 
testers which is the formula X and
formula<00:00:47.910> y<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.140> second<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.829> this

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
formula y and this is a second so this

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.389 
formula y and this is a second so this
is<00:00:50.190> formula<00:00:50.610> y<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:52.350> as<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.070> guys<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.340> see

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
is formula y so as you guys can see

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.270 
is formula y so as you guys can see
comes<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> white<00:00:54.870> container

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
comes in like the white container

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.420 
comes in like the white container
similar<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> one<00:00:56.670> before<00:00:58.219> also<00:00:59.219> very

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
similar to the one before also very

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.330 
similar to the one before also very
similar<00:00:59.879> in<00:00:59.910> appearance<00:01:00.180> as<00:01:00.750> well<00:01:01.070> clear<00:01:02.070> on

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
similar in appearance as well clear on

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.789 
similar in appearance as well clear on
the<00:01:02.520> inside<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.809> one<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.439> little<00:01:04.710> bit

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the inside but this one is a little bit

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.730 
the inside but this one is a little bit
more<00:01:05.479> translucent<00:01:06.479> than<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.080> before<00:01:07.229> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
more translucent than the one before so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
more translucent than the one before so
we're<00:01:08.670> gonna<00:01:08.760> skip<00:01:08.939> through<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
we're gonna skip through it like the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.450 
we're gonna skip through it like the
application<00:01:10.260> process<00:01:10.290> physically<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:11.340> I'll

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
application process physically but I'll

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
application process physically but I'll
tell<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> guys<00:01:11.850> about<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.479> applies<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
tell you guys about it it applies in the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.530 
tell you guys about it it applies in the
very<00:01:13.320> similar<00:01:13.680> manner<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.970> bit<00:01:15.119> lighter

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
very similar manner a little bit lighter

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.690 
very similar manner a little bit lighter
than<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.320> before<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.100> when<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> apply

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
than the one before as in when you apply

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
than the one before as in when you apply
it<00:01:17.729> doesn't<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:19.250> my<00:01:20.299> kind<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:22.100> take

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it doesn't like really my kind of take

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.020 
it doesn't like really my kind of take
too<00:01:23.340> much<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:24.500> like<00:01:25.500> dryness<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.280> grip

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
too much like like dryness or like grip

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.120 
too much like like dryness or like grip
into<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:27.869> hair<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.710> I'm<00:01:28.799> trying<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.040> say

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
into your hair as what I'm trying to say

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.310 
into your hair as what I'm trying to say
is<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.549> doesn't<00:01:29.880> hurt<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.689> much<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> one

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
is it doesn't hurt as much as the one

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.770 
is it doesn't hurt as much as the one
before<00:01:31.700> because<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.970> way<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.329> product

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
before because the way this product

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.370 
before because the way this product
works<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.920> kind<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.400> applies<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
works is that it kind of applies like a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.370 
works is that it kind of applies like a
dry<00:01:37.380> water<00:01:37.860> base<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.460> has<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.930> left<00:01:39.930> feel<00:01:40.170> as

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
dry water base it has a left feel as

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.359 
dry water base it has a left feel as
though<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.829> water<00:01:41.040> base<00:01:41.189> that's

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
though it's like a water base that's

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.069 
though it's like a water base that's
already<00:01:41.520> driving<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> gel<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.750> once<00:01:42.960> you

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
already driving to a gel but once you

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.120 
already driving to a gel but once you
put<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.680> once<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.890> wear<00:01:44.040> it

your<00:02:11.819> view<00:02:12.090> maybe

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
your view maybe

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.809 
your view maybe
you<00:02:13.319> should<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.560> try<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.950> repeat<00:02:14.310> most<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
you should I try to repeat most of the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.970 
you should I try to repeat most of the
facts<00:02:15.420> about<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> good<00:02:16.890> amount

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
facts about it so you get a good amount

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.260 
facts about it so you get a good amount
of<00:02:17.190> strength<00:02:17.430> for<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> good<00:02:17.730> amount<00:02:17.760> control

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
of strength for a good amount control

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.130 
of strength for a good amount control
because<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.690> acts<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:20.569> like<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.600> dry<00:02:21.840> water

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
because it acts like a like a dry water

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.110 
because it acts like a like a dry water
brace<00:02:22.380> up<00:02:22.650> front<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.190> get<00:02:23.400> good<00:02:23.580> hold<00:02:23.910> and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
brace up front so you get good hold and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.110 
brace up front so you get good hold and
I<00:02:24.660> think<00:02:25.440> maybe<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.400> would<00:02:26.580> do<00:02:26.700> well<00:02:26.940> with

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
I think maybe it would do well with

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.750 
I think maybe it would do well with
curly<00:02:27.450> hair<00:02:27.480> or<00:02:27.720> like<00:02:28.050> kind<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.410> semi<00:02:29.190> unruly

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
curly hair or like kind of semi unruly

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.610 
curly hair or like kind of semi unruly
hair<00:02:30.000> because<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.780> initial<00:02:31.410> hold

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
hair because of that initial hold

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.980 
hair because of that initial hold
however<00:02:31.920> once<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.850> gets<00:02:33.030> more<00:02:33.240> malleable<00:02:33.510> I'm

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
however once it gets more malleable I'm

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.420 
however once it gets more malleable I'm
not<00:02:34.140> sure<00:02:34.200> about<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.770> for<00:02:35.010> me<00:02:35.160> it's

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
not sure about that for me it's

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.830 
not sure about that for me it's
fantastic<00:02:35.610> because<00:02:36.090> I'm<00:02:36.330> able<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.570> stop<00:02:36.810> a

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
it's a little too strong because it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.110 
it's a little too strong because it
makes<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.220> little<00:02:41.310> bit<00:02:41.550> uncomfortable<00:02:41.640> for

it<00:03:36.750> however<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:39.000> how<00:03:39.690> should<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.900> say<00:03:39.959> this

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
it however it is how should I say this

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.180 
it however it is how should I say this
like<00:03:41.459> dryer<00:03:42.120> then<00:03:42.600> formula<00:03:43.079> x<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.590> has<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:43.860> more

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
like dryer then formula x it has a more

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.880 
like dryer then formula x it has a more
matte<00:03:44.430> feel<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.360> it's<00:03:46.019> not<00:03:46.230> as<00:03:46.470> slick

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
matte feel to it and it's not as slick

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.949 
matte feel to it and it's not as slick
it's<00:03:47.579> easier<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.120> apply<00:03:48.329> but<00:03:48.570> just<00:03:48.600> not<00:03:48.900> as

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
it's easier to apply but just not as

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.380 
it's easier to apply but just not as
slick<00:03:49.440> as<00:03:49.470> formula<00:03:50.040> X<00:03:50.310> that's<00:03:50.579> very<00:03:51.060> slight

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
slick as formula X that's very slight

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.319 
slick as formula X that's very slight
difference<00:03:51.750> but<00:03:51.959> like<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.820> enough<00:03:54.090> for<00:03:54.120> me

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
difference but like it is enough for me

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.030 
difference but like it is enough for me
to<00:03:54.510> kind<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:54.959> differentiate<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.829> two<00:03:56.030> so

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
to kind of like differentiate the two so

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.060 
to kind of like differentiate the two so
either<00:03:59.040> way<00:03:59.459> like<00:03:59.910> formula<00:04:00.329> y<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:01.590> still<00:04:01.950> very

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
either way like formula y is still very

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.250 
either way like formula y is still very
impressive<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.150> would<00:04:03.329> prefer<00:04:03.480> from<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.079> x

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
impressive I would prefer from the x

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.770 
impressive I would prefer from the x
over<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.620> two<00:04:05.000> but<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.269> thing<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.540> still

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
over the two but this thing is still

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.449 
over the two but this thing is still
pretty<00:04:07.019> damn<00:04:07.260> impressive<00:04:07.530> i'm<00:04:07.860> still<00:04:08.160> waiting

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
pretty damn impressive i'm still waiting

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.979 
pretty damn impressive i'm still waiting

that and also keep an eye out for when I
finally<00:04:49.979> find<00:04:50.190> out<00:04:50.430> who<00:04:51.210> made<00:04:51.479> this<00:04:51.720> and<00:04:51.990> when

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
finally find out who made this and when

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.610 
finally find out who made this and when
they're<00:04:52.349> gonna<00:04:52.440> release<00:04:52.680> it<00:04:52.830> but<00:04:53.220> yeah<00:04:53.370> so

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
they're gonna release it but yeah so

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.010 
they're gonna release it but yeah so
once<00:04:55.620> again<00:04:55.740> formula<00:04:56.460> y<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:57.650> take<00:04:58.650> care<00:04:58.800> guys
