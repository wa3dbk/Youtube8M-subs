00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
here so you can see it while I'm using

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.000 
here so you can see it while I'm using
it<00:00:41.940> um<00:00:42.089> it's<00:00:42.690> not<00:00:42.960> recording<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> camera

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it um it's not recording into the camera

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.500 
it um it's not recording into the camera
because<00:00:44.460> my<00:00:44.640> camera<00:00:44.820> doesn't<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
because my camera doesn't have a

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.599 
because my camera doesn't have a
microphone<00:00:45.899> input<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.980> recording<00:00:47.370> into<00:00:47.519> my

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
microphone input it's recording into my

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.860 
microphone input it's recording into my
zoom<00:00:47.940> h2<00:00:48.719> i<00:00:50.120> did<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> video<00:00:51.269> on<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.570> earlier

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
zoom h2 i did a video on that earlier

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.700 
zoom h2 i did a video on that earlier
and<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:53.390> think<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:54.899> most<00:00:55.079> part<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.440> sounds

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and I think for the most part it sounds

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.399 
and I think for the most part it sounds
really<00:00:55.949> decent<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.839> telly<00:00:58.109> mode

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
really decent it's on the telly mode

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.529 
really decent it's on the telly mode
right<00:00:58.559> now<00:00:58.620> there's<00:00:59.100> two<00:00:59.339> modes<00:00:59.579> normal<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
right now there's two modes normal and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.299 
right now there's two modes normal and
telly<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.960> chelly<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.440> picks<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.829> more<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
telly and chelly just picks up more of a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.820 
telly and chelly just picks up more of a
more<00:01:03.269> sound<00:01:03.569> I<00:01:03.839> guess<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.589> turned<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
more sound I guess so I just turned it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.300 
more sound I guess so I just turned it
all<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:04.979> way<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.309> um<00:01:06.140> this<00:01:07.140> microphone<00:01:07.650> is
