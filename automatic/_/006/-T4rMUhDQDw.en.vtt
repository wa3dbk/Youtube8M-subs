working on here at Electronic Arts it

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.560 
working on here at Electronic Arts it
takes<00:00:29.119> place<00:00:29.300> in<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:29.990> future<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:31.570> primarily

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
takes place in the future and primarily

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.920 
takes place in the future and primarily
takes<00:00:32.870> place<00:00:33.140> on<00:00:33.380> a<00:00:33.410> huge<00:00:34.360> mining<00:00:35.360> spaceship

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
takes place on a huge mining spaceship

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.959 
takes place on a huge mining spaceship
gameplay-wise<00:00:36.590> we<00:00:37.100> are<00:00:37.250> definitely<00:00:37.579> I<00:00:37.760> would

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
gameplay-wise we are definitely I would

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.720 
gameplay-wise we are definitely I would
say<00:00:38.300> a<00:00:38.660> survival<00:00:39.170> horror<00:00:39.199> and<00:00:39.829> it's<00:00:40.399> those

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
say a survival horror and it's those

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.830 
say a survival horror and it's those
have<00:00:40.879> always<00:00:41.000> got<00:00:41.210> a<00:00:41.239> bunch<00:00:41.449> of<00:00:41.539> shooter

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
have always got a bunch of shooter

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.200 
have always got a bunch of shooter
inside<00:00:42.199> of<00:00:42.350> it<00:00:42.469> I<00:00:42.649> think<00:00:43.340> we<00:00:43.489> will<00:00:43.640> differ<00:00:44.030> a

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
inside of it I think we will differ a

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.590 
inside of it I think we will differ a
lot<00:00:44.690> from<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.260> survival<00:00:45.770> horror<00:00:45.980> games

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
lot from the survival horror games

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.360 
lot from the survival horror games
because<00:00:47.600> we<00:00:47.750> aren't<00:00:47.930> sci-fi<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:49.010> it<00:00:49.129> gives<00:00:49.280> us

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
because we aren't sci-fi and it gives us

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.849 
because we aren't sci-fi and it gives us
the<00:00:49.489> chance<00:00:49.520> to<00:00:50.199> have<00:00:51.199> different<00:00:51.559> types<00:00:51.739> of

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
the chance to have different types of

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.349 
the chance to have different types of
weapons<00:00:52.250> different<00:00:52.579> types<00:00:52.760> of<00:00:52.879> aliens

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
weapons different types of aliens

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.750 
weapons different types of aliens

detailed<00:03:24.870> vertical<00:03:25.169> slice<00:03:25.349> if<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.919> look<00:03:26.069> at

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
detailed vertical slice if you look at

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.009 
detailed vertical slice if you look at
the<00:03:26.250> stacks<00:03:26.609> of<00:03:26.790> like<00:03:26.879> a<00:03:26.910> cake<00:03:27.209> right<00:03:27.510> yet<00:03:27.870> you

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
the stacks of like a cake right yet you

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.420 
the stacks of like a cake right yet you
take<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.379> slice<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.919> you<00:03:28.980> get<00:03:29.129> all<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
take the slice and you get all the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.710 
take the slice and you get all the
little<00:03:29.609> stack<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.090> get<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.299> cake<00:03:30.449> bar<00:03:30.660> you

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
little stack so you get the cake bar you

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.789 
little stack so you get the cake bar you
get<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.900> frosting<00:03:31.230> part<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.500> get<00:03:31.620> all<00:03:31.709> the

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
get the frosting part you get all the

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:32.930 
get the frosting part you get all the
other<00:03:31.919> little<00:03:32.069> parts<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.519> get<00:03:32.609> an<00:03:32.699> idea

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
other little parts and you get an idea

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.729 
other little parts and you get an idea
what<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.150> whole<00:03:33.299> cakes<00:03:33.569> gonna<00:03:33.750> be<00:03:33.930> like<00:03:34.109> so

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
what the whole cakes gonna be like so

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:35.689 
what the whole cakes gonna be like so
that's<00:03:34.859> why<00:03:34.949> they<00:03:35.040> call<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.250> vertical<00:03:35.519> size

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
that's why they call the vertical size

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.390 
that's why they call the vertical size
we<00:03:36.269> wanted<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.019> create<00:03:37.199> about<00:03:37.739> 10<00:03:37.980> minutes<00:03:38.129> of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
we wanted to create about 10 minutes of

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.150 
we wanted to create about 10 minutes of
gameplay<00:03:39.000> but<00:03:39.870> we<00:03:40.199> want<00:03:40.379> it<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.590> be<00:03:40.739> complete

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
gameplay but we want it to be complete

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.610 
gameplay but we want it to be complete
game<00:03:41.370> play<00:03:41.609> not<00:03:42.329> just<00:03:42.359> like<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> smoke<00:03:43.470> and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
game play not just like a smoke and

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.830 
game play not just like a smoke and
mirrors<00:03:43.859> demo<00:03:44.129> where<00:03:44.579> it's<00:03:45.239> sort<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.569> faked

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
mirrors demo where it's sort of faked

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.080 
mirrors demo where it's sort of faked
and<00:03:46.199> you're<00:03:46.410> not<00:03:46.590> really<00:03:46.829> seeing<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.579> true

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
and you're not really seeing a true

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.210 
and you're not really seeing a true
representation<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.019> software<00:03:49.379> that<00:03:49.680> was

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
representation of the software that was

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.890 
representation of the software that was
the<00:03:50.370> biggest<00:03:50.579> thing<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.060> come<00:03:51.239> out<00:03:51.419> with

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
the biggest thing is to come out with

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.009 
the biggest thing is to come out with
something<00:03:52.560> we<00:03:52.799> save<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.419> here<00:03:54.419> instead<00:03:54.959> of

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
something we save it here instead of

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.439 
something we save it here instead of
pictures<00:03:55.440> here<00:03:55.560> just<00:03:55.980> play<00:03:56.430> it<00:03:56.459> by<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.180> end<00:03:57.269> of

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
pictures here just play it by the end of

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.300 
pictures here just play it by the end of
that<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.690> was<00:03:57.810> only<00:03:57.900> 15<00:03:58.290> minutes<00:03:58.500> but<00:03:59.129> it<00:03:59.220> was

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
that it was only 15 minutes but it was

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.580 
that it was only 15 minutes but it was
really<00:03:59.579> good<00:03:59.849> and<00:04:00.120> really<00:04:00.180> scary<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:00.989> fun<00:04:01.379> and

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
really good and really scary and fun and

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.080 
really good and really scary and fun and
we<00:04:01.680> still<00:04:01.889> had<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.040> year<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.400> half<00:04:02.430> before<00:04:02.819> we

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
we still had a year and a half before we

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.949 
we still had a year and a half before we
had<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.329> finish

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.650 

figured<00:04:08.959> out<00:04:09.580> that<00:04:10.580> we<00:04:10.700> could<00:04:10.940> scare<00:04:11.269> people

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
figured out that we could scare people

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.440 
figured out that we could scare people
like<00:04:11.890> like<00:04:12.890> scaring<00:04:13.400> peoples<00:04:13.730> really<00:04:14.150> hard

we<00:04:27.020> turned<00:04:27.800> off<00:04:27.889> the<00:04:27.950> gravity<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.930> know

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
we turned off the gravity you know

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.540 
we turned off the gravity you know
there's<00:04:30.260> been<00:04:30.290> playing<00:04:30.590> games<00:04:30.860> before<00:04:31.040> that

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
there's been playing games before that

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
things but the first time we turned off

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.500 
things but the first time we turned off
the<00:04:36.620> gravity<00:04:36.889> in<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.190> game<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.669> it<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.270> it

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
the gravity in the game and it and it

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.210 
the gravity in the game and it and it
really<00:04:38.840> worked<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.440> like<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:39.710> could<00:04:39.889> you

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
really worked and like you could you

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.560 
really worked and like you could you
could<00:04:40.310> walk<00:04:40.580> over<00:04:40.610> stuff<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.360> come<00:04:41.479> around

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
could walk over stuff and come around

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.940 
could walk over stuff and come around
the<00:04:41.750> other<00:04:41.780> sort<00:04:42.139> of<00:04:42.229> side<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.590> there<00:04:42.680> was<00:04:42.770> bad

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
the other sort of side and there was bad

guys that were they were upside down and
there<00:04:45.169> was<00:04:45.290> blood<00:04:45.669> that<00:04:46.669> sort<00:04:47.000> of<00:04:47.090> came<00:04:48.020> out<00:04:48.050> of

there was blood that sort of came out of
a<00:04:48.350> thing<00:04:48.530> and<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:48.710> just<00:04:48.740> sort<00:04:48.950> of<00:04:49.040> floated<00:04:49.460> away

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
a thing and I just sort of floated away

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.900 
a thing and I just sort of floated away
in<00:04:49.880> globs<00:04:50.180> I<00:04:50.600> was<00:04:51.560> just<00:04:51.710> like<00:04:51.800> okay<00:04:52.550> guys<00:04:52.700> we're

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
in globs I was just like okay guys we're

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.100 
in globs I was just like okay guys we're
onto<00:04:53.060> something<00:04:53.180> like<00:04:53.510> this<00:04:53.600> is<00:04:53.750> pretty<00:04:53.870> good

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110

I'd like people to walk away and think
that<00:04:57.860> that<00:04:58.010> was<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.220> scariest<00:04:58.430> video<00:04:58.970> game

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
that that was the scariest video game

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.850 
that that was the scariest video game
that<00:05:00.740> was<00:05:00.919> new<00:05:01.220> was<00:05:01.490> fresh<00:05:02.350> but<00:05:03.350> that<00:05:03.560> scared
