00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.820
 then he ran away 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.100

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.630
 as you can also see out a lot 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.550
 very well not much simulator 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.670
 his white tour is realistic 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:13.710
 different species 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:17.090
 ok it did n't take and two was this 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.090

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.980
 we're at with two guys 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.380
 can make it very clear as I already have 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.860
 say 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.920
 well left 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.770
 that they get confused here it is one there 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.420
 he took me 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.079
 ok we miss another one of the other one 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.570
 species that I have not yet understood which 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.899
 this seems yes though it is not this though 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.899

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.040

 you are one of these could be one of 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.920
 I don't think these really are 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.240
 I do not think so 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.960
 perhaps this is not a big one 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.960

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.600
 we can of these arcore 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.460

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:22.080
