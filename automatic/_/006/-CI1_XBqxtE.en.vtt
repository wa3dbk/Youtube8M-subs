moped<00:00:50.609> rally<00:00:50.879> again<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.559> can<00:00:52.559> control<00:00:53.549> it<00:00:53.729> via

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
moped rally again I can control it via

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.450 
moped rally again I can control it via
any<00:00:54.629> anywhere<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.290> world<00:00:55.409> and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:56.280> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
any anywhere in the world and then you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.950 
any anywhere in the world and then you
can<00:00:56.579> bind<00:00:56.729> that<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.000> VNC<00:00:57.299> control<00:00:57.839> on<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
can bind that with VNC control on a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.500 
can bind that with VNC control on a
computer<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.589> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.430> get<00:00:59.549> almost<00:01:00.269> anything

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
computer and you can get almost anything

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.079 
computer and you can get almost anything
done<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.409> guess<00:01:01.680> except<00:01:02.039> plugging<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
done I guess except plugging and

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:04.340 
done I guess except plugging and
unplugging<00:01:03.210> cords<00:01:03.869> but<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.170> what

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
unplugging cords but that's what

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.410 
unplugging cords but that's what
assistants<00:01:04.799> are<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.789> let<00:01:06.119> me<00:01:06.149> show<00:01:06.360> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.330 
assistants are for so let me show you
what<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.690> guy<00:01:06.869> looks<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.200> face<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> face<00:01:08.039> I

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
what this guy looks like face to face I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.740 
what this guy looks like face to face I
think<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:09.539> camera<00:01:10.259> three<00:01:11.069> nope<00:01:11.940> it's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
think that's camera three nope it's

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.690 
think that's camera three nope it's
camera<00:01:13.110> one

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.910 

and<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.360> guess<00:01:16.509> I'll<00:01:16.630> switch<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.469> other<00:01:17.619> mic

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
and I guess I'll switch to the other mic

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:37.080 
and I guess I'll switch to the other mic
this<00:01:18.700> might<00:01:18.909> sound<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.240> little<00:01:19.270> weird

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.849 

oh<00:01:38.700> ok<00:01:39.700> so<00:01:40.359> I'm<00:01:40.689> to<00:01:40.840> start<00:01:41.109> the<00:01:41.229> webcam<00:01:41.590> on<00:01:41.710> my

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:41.859 
oh ok so I'm to start the webcam on my

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.370 
oh ok so I'm to start the webcam on my
side<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:43.149> get<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.299> see<00:01:43.390> me<00:01:43.570> in<00:01:43.990> my<00:01:44.170> face

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
side and you get to see me in my face

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.260 
side and you get to see me in my face
and<00:01:44.649> I<00:01:44.740> could<00:01:44.920> just<00:01:44.950> walk<00:01:45.729> up<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:45.939> have<00:01:46.240> a

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
and I could just walk up to have a

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.730 
and I could just walk up to have a
conversation<00:01:46.539> as<00:01:46.929> opposed<00:01:47.229> to<00:01:47.319> trying<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.590> set

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
conversation as opposed to trying to set

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.760 
conversation as opposed to trying to set
up<00:01:47.829> a<00:01:47.950> time<00:01:48.219> to<00:01:48.280> escape<00:01:48.759> whatever<00:01:49.299> I<00:01:50.109> think<00:01:50.560> the

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
up a time to escape whatever I think the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.200 
up a time to escape whatever I think the
goal<00:01:50.979> on<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.280> thing<00:01:51.490> is<00:01:51.609> to<00:01:51.789> only<00:01:52.000> be<00:01:52.179> a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
goal on this thing is to only be a

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.240 
goal on this thing is to only be a
couple<00:01:52.600> thousand<00:01:53.530> dollars<00:01:53.560> when<00:01:54.009> we're<00:01:54.130> done

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
couple thousand dollars when we're done

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.830 
couple thousand dollars when we're done
producing<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:55.240> it's<00:01:55.270> really<00:01:55.569> not<00:01:55.780> that

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
producing so it's really not that

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.289 
producing so it's really not that
unreasonable<00:01:56.469> for<00:01:57.069> a<00:01:57.100> business<00:01:57.429> well<00:01:58.030> that's

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
unreasonable for a business well that's

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.429 
unreasonable for a business well that's
not<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.450> point<00:01:58.659> of<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:58.840> point<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.200> this<00:01:59.259> is

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
this thing is like capable of 15 miles

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.440 
this thing is like capable of 15 miles
an<00:02:45.870> hour<00:02:46.310> but<00:02:47.310> they<00:02:47.519> restricted<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.299> so<00:02:48.420> I

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
an hour but they restricted it so I

can't do that I'll have to turn the
volume<00:02:50.069> down<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.400> second<00:02:51.799> you<00:02:52.799> get<00:02:52.889> some

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
volume down the second you get some

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:01.300 
volume down the second you get some
feedback<00:02:53.840> okay
