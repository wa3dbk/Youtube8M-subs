00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.620
 as the past video means unscrewed on 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.630
 pitbikes 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.519
 three screws 90 him spinning he broke 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.170
 completely as I just did not try 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.890
 surround give what we do with us 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:25.230
 such a situation occurred 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:37.590
 drilled take collated set of drills drills 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:41.280
 we take a set of color we remove we need 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.890
 diameter so that not a hat in about 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.890
 my case it turned out 80 half 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:09.530
 and drilled quickly do not need to drill 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.530
 We know that slowly the drill was spinning 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.740
 inside bye 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.659
 the hat will not go away 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:52.620
 Now you can take less duralumin 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:52.620
 dinner not to spoil a little bit 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:46.560
 so it is still too early to take all of you 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.560
 ideally a few seem to buy 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:54.219
 clutch than and I would like to do here 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:04:00.819
 so during the repair there are such 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:04:03.209
 problems but need to view the health not 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.209
 to be afraid 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:27.840
 all you can see the gap chips remove all this 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:37.229
 of us still did not get the oil try 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.229
 open the lid 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.040
 knocked the boy 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:10.490
 laying broke with sleep we have 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:15.460
 new here we have left our screw to 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.930
 Unfortunately it does not shut down for what 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.880
 so you have to drill to the end and 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.880
 then cut the thread 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.710
 for disassembling the engine crankcase itself 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.660
 to make out a ghost 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.610
 did not drive anything to deal with 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:41.940
 of this country and for that we will need 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.849
 just answer the screws and everything will come off in 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.550
 this side is safe 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:52.560
 elementary that is, roughly speaking, remove 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:54.870
 cylinder cylinder head and this one 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.539
 half for all can be removed this 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.729
 which disciplines do not even disassemble but 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.990
 suddenly someone will need to twist it 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.870
 wants to see in what order 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.960
 going specifically for this I am this 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.560
 dismantle the side though I'm all here whole 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.560
 and honestly
