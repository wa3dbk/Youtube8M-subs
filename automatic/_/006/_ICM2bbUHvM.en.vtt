00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
right but because of the way that the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.520 
right but because of the way that the
frames<00:02:33.300> are<00:02:33.450> designed<00:02:33.810> are<00:02:34.020> made<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.260> out<00:02:34.470> of

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
frames are designed are made of out of

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.250 
frames are designed are made of out of
titanium<00:02:35.100> okay<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:35.970> they're<00:02:36.600> they're<00:02:37.050> very

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
titanium okay so they're they're very

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.860 
titanium okay so they're they're very
lightweight<00:02:38.000> there<00:02:39.000> there's<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.390> little<00:02:39.630> bit

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
lightweight there there's a little bit

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.930 
lightweight there there's a little bit
of<00:02:39.930> extra<00:02:40.560> weight<00:02:40.710> on<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:41.070> right<00:02:41.280> side<00:02:41.550> as

of extra weight on the right side as
you'd<00:02:42.090> expect<00:02:42.240> because<00:02:42.630> that's<00:02:42.900> where<00:02:43.140> the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
you'd expect because that's where the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.160 
you'd expect because that's where the
computer<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.340> glass<00:02:44.580> hardware<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.540> but
