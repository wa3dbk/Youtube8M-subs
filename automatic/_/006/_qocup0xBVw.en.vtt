but this figure doesn't move it is stuck

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.430 
but this figure doesn't move it is stuck
in<00:01:40.550> that<00:01:40.910> position<00:01:41.120> but<00:01:41.570> still<00:01:41.870> a<00:01:41.900> pretty<00:01:42.170> cool

total and you put them in there and push

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.460 
total and you put them in there and push
this<00:02:13.640> button<00:02:13.879> on<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.360> top<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.780> then<00:02:15.290> that

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
this button on the top and then that

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.059 
this button on the top and then that
will<00:02:15.620> fly<00:02:16.010> out<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.550> hit<00:02:17.390> any<00:02:18.069> unsuspecting

will fly out and hit any unsuspecting

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.450 
will fly out and hit any unsuspecting
victim<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.240> may<00:02:20.420> be<00:02:20.480> firing<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.200> at<00:02:21.740> all<00:02:22.130> so

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
victim you may be firing it at all so

victim you may be firing it at all so
with<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:22.910> set<00:02:23.180> we<00:02:23.300> get<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.540> work

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
with this set we get a work

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.839 
with this set we get a work
feature<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.530> bottom<00:02:25.739> what<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.580> need<00:02:26.730> to

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
feature on the bottom what you need to

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.220 
feature on the bottom what you need to
do<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.269> put<00:02:27.599> your<00:02:28.290> Sully<00:02:28.769> figure<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:30.480> if

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
do is put your Sully figure in there if

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.229 
do is put your Sully figure in there if
he<00:02:31.290> will<00:02:31.620> stay<00:02:31.980> there<00:02:32.010> put<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.610> arms<00:02:32.849> down<00:02:33.000> so

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
he will stay there put the arms down so

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.899 
he will stay there put the arms down so
they<00:02:33.390> don't<00:02:33.690> hit<00:02:33.930> those<00:02:34.620> targets<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.400> then

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
they don't hit those targets and then

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.500 
they don't hit those targets and then
when<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.209> twist<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:37.019> base<00:02:38.330> we<00:02:39.330> do

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
when you twist this base we do

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.930 
when you twist this base we do
this<00:02:39.720> we<00:02:40.470> get<00:02:40.650> those<00:02:40.829> sounds<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.370> let's<00:02:41.489> try<00:02:41.790> us

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
this we get those sounds so let's try us

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:54.350 
this we get those sounds so let's try us
a<00:02:41.970> few<00:02:42.239> times<00:02:42.450> now<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:53.430> we<00:02:53.519> get<00:02:53.670> about<00:02:53.909> five

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
a few times now so we get about five

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.380 
a few times now so we get about five
different<00:02:55.010> phrases<00:02:56.010> on<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:57.090> working

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
different phrases on that working

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.440 
different phrases on that working
feature<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.049> as<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.260> can<00:02:58.410> see<00:02:58.620> these<00:02:58.799> targets

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
feature and as you can see these targets

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.940 
feature and as you can see these targets
do<00:03:00.450> spin<00:03:00.840> around<00:03:00.959> they<00:03:01.260> have<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> different

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
do spin around they have the different

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.849 
do spin around they have the different
numbers<00:03:02.220> on<00:03:02.310> we<00:03:02.819> have<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> 50<00:03:03.599> then<00:03:04.440> we<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.829> a

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
numbers on we have a 50 then we have a

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.430 
numbers on we have a 50 then we have a
25<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.180> those<00:03:06.359> spinning<00:03:06.690> targets<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.290> also

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
25 on of those spinning targets you also

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.920 
25 on of those spinning targets you also
get<00:03:07.739> this<00:03:07.829> extra<00:03:08.340> piece<00:03:08.519> which<00:03:08.819> looks<00:03:09.480> like<00:03:09.720> a

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
get this extra piece which looks like a

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.869 
get this extra piece which looks like a
crossbow<00:03:10.530> piece<00:03:10.829> but<00:03:11.129> it's<00:03:11.340> very<00:03:11.549> difficult

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
crossbow piece but it's very difficult

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.720 
crossbow piece but it's very difficult
to<00:03:12.239> get<00:03:12.359> that<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.750> stick<00:03:13.109> in<00:03:13.590> Sully's<00:03:14.310> hand<00:03:14.579> off

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
to get that to stick in Sully's hand off

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.309 
to get that to stick in Sully's hand off
I'm<00:03:14.879> quite<00:03:15.090> sure<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.629> supposed<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.140> be

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
I'm quite sure that is supposed to be

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.460 
I'm quite sure that is supposed to be
for<00:03:16.980> firing<00:03:17.489> after<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:18.000> targets<00:03:18.659> there<00:03:18.930> we

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
for firing after the targets there we

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.490 
for firing after the targets there we
also<00:03:19.709> get<00:03:20.190> working<00:03:20.640> features<00:03:21.359> on<00:03:21.840> at<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.230> top

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
also get working features on at the top

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.399 
also get working features on at the top
of<00:03:22.680> this<00:03:23.280> we<00:03:23.549> have<00:03:23.819> this<00:03:24.090> moving<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.109> plate

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
of this we have this moving the plate

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.300 
of this we have this moving the plate
again<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:26.280> has<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.819> foot<00:03:27.299> pieces<00:03:27.859> there<00:03:28.859> for<00:03:29.280> a

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
again it has the foot pieces there for a

figure to stand in and we get this bed

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.440 
figure to stand in and we get this bed
as<00:03:32.190> well<00:03:32.430> with<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.630> scary<00:03:34.260> target<00:03:35.099> guy<00:03:35.370> if<00:03:36.239> you

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
a few times there are about three

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.170 
a few times there are about three
different<00:03:59.010> noises<00:04:01.099> yeah<00:04:02.099> three<00:04:02.519> different

different noises yeah three different

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.659 
different noises yeah three different
sounds<00:04:03.690> altogether<00:04:04.410> we've<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.799> serves<00:04:05.250> six

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
sounds altogether we've that serves six

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.780 
sounds altogether we've that serves six
plus<00:04:06.540> three<00:04:06.569> we<00:04:07.109> get<00:04:07.230> nine<00:04:07.560> different<00:04:08.340> noises

plus three we get nine different noises
with<00:04:09.359> this<00:04:10.049> set<00:04:10.410> we<00:04:10.620> do<00:04:10.769> have<00:04:10.949> the<00:04:11.069> scare<00:04:11.370> games

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
with this set we do have the scare games

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.750 
with this set we do have the scare games
banner<00:04:11.970> there<00:04:12.209> as<00:04:12.359> well<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:13.019> scoreboard

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
banner there as well and a scoreboard

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.879 
banner there as well and a scoreboard
for<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.060> different<00:04:15.660> teams<00:04:15.900> eke<00:04:16.199> and<00:04:16.440> jocks

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
for the different teams eke and jocks

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.310 
for the different teams eke and jocks
and<00:04:17.639> we<00:04:17.760> do<00:04:17.910> get<00:04:18.060> those<00:04:18.449> flags<00:04:18.900> there<00:04:19.139> which

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
and we do get those flags there which

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.259 
and we do get those flags there which
just<00:04:19.560> fell<00:04:19.829> off

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
just fell off

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.050 
just fell off
conveniently<00:04:21.269> so<00:04:22.139> we<00:04:22.470> can<00:04:22.710> hang<00:04:22.949> those<00:04:23.160> from

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
conveniently so we can hang those from

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.670 
conveniently so we can hang those from
the<00:04:24.180> top<00:04:24.389> and<00:04:24.570> those<00:04:24.720> will<00:04:24.990> just<00:04:25.199> swish<00:04:25.470> around

two figures included in this we get two
main<00:04:56.100> working<00:04:56.460> features<00:04:57.210> we<00:04:57.690> also<00:04:57.780> get<00:04:58.140> the

firing coming as well with two
projectiles<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.410> we<00:05:01.560> get<00:05:01.740> this<00:05:01.920> little

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
projectiles and we get this little

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.610 
projectiles and we get this little
weapon<00:05:02.820> which<00:05:03.330> I'm<00:05:03.540> kind<00:05:03.870> of<00:05:03.990> confused<00:05:04.410> about

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
weapon which I'm kind of confused about

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.160 
weapon which I'm kind of confused about
but<00:05:05.550> all<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:05.910> same<00:05:06.090> it<00:05:06.300> is<00:05:06.330> there<00:05:06.660> and<00:05:06.900> it<00:05:06.990> is

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
but all the same it is there and it is

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.910 
but all the same it is there and it is
to<00:05:07.560> be<00:05:07.980> used<00:05:08.310> so<00:05:09.180> onto<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.630> plus<00:05:10.140> and<00:05:10.440> negative

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
to be used so onto the plus and negative

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.430 
to be used so onto the plus and negative
ratings<00:05:11.910> for<00:05:12.180> this<00:05:12.360> set<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.780> plus<00:05:13.080> points

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
ratings for this set the plus points

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.520 
ratings for this set the plus points
would<00:05:13.620> be<00:05:13.830> we<00:05:14.310> do<00:05:14.460> get<00:05:14.670> nine<00:05:15.300> stones<00:05:15.720> in<00:05:16.080> total

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
would be we do get nine stones in total

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.220 
would be we do get nine stones in total
so<00:05:16.680> that<00:05:16.860> is<00:05:17.040> quite<00:05:17.220> good<00:05:17.580> for<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.330> set<00:05:18.750> albeit

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.010 
so that is quite good for a set albeit
quite<00:05:19.440> an<00:05:19.650> expensive<00:05:19.980> set<00:05:20.460> we<00:05:21.210> do<00:05:21.360> get<00:05:21.540> moving

don't need to play with those on the set
the<00:05:36.450> negative<00:05:37.080> points<00:05:37.410> would<00:05:37.560> be<00:05:37.740> it<00:05:37.950> is<00:05:38.160> a

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
the negative points would be it is a

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.910 
the negative points would be it is a
little<00:05:38.550> expensive<00:05:38.730> but<00:05:39.240> not<00:05:39.570> much<00:05:39.780> guys<00:05:40.110> it<00:05:40.650> is

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
little expensive but not much guys it is

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.040 
little expensive but not much guys it is
just<00:05:41.430> about<00:05:41.670> right<00:05:41.940> just<00:05:42.240> a<00:05:42.330> little<00:05:42.630> over<00:05:42.900> in

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
just about right just a little over in

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.040 
just about right just a little over in
my<00:05:43.200> opinion<00:05:43.650> but<00:05:43.920> we<00:05:44.700> also<00:05:44.970> have<00:05:45.330> one<00:05:45.750> more<00:05:46.020> a

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
my opinion but we also have one more a

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.720 
my opinion but we also have one more a
negative<00:05:46.560> point<00:05:46.800> which<00:05:47.040> would<00:05:47.250> be<00:05:47.430> I<00:05:47.640> would

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
negative point which would be I would

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.460 
negative point which would be I would
imagine<00:05:48.210> this<00:05:48.540> set<00:05:48.780> would<00:05:48.870> become<00:05:49.170> a<00:05:49.230> little

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
imagine this set would become a little

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.250 
imagine this set would become a little
boring<00:05:49.920> once<00:05:50.340> you<00:05:50.490> have<00:05:50.700> played<00:05:51.690> with<00:05:51.840> it<00:05:52.020> and

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
boring once you have played with it and

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.400 
boring once you have played with it and
activated<00:05:52.980> those<00:05:53.160> annoying<00:05:53.550> sounds<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:55.200> main

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
point of this set after that would be

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.150
