00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.850
 so here is a demonstration that worked 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.769
 city management 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:16.230
 Troy went seriously 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:19.470
 how do we need us to go 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.330
 for now the first gear went 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.720
 quietly going to such a small 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.390
 pull I slow down second gear 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.810
 grip down to us under you I lived 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.380
 doing nothing going sara transmission 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.380
 unraveled 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.890
 speeding up 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.890
 include third gear 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.530
 Now I need a crossroads 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.480
 slow down i 'm doing here and so 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.610
 reduced grip under won 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.970
 Now I again what is desirable for on 2 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.970
 take 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.150
 go further 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:06.610
 and the transfer of the wall will go great and you need 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.610
 in this package a little not 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.159
 2 3 just relaxing switch 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.869
 do nothing else but don't work 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.869
 Here 4 transfers began 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.420
 so i turn off but no frame 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.420
 squeeze the clutch is not just a 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.670
 here they are to the intersection or 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.670
 quality is the third reason 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:44.299
 farm come to life that is in fact 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.299
 2 articles 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.770
 basically 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.200
 were I track 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.640
 now everything is not very fast I think 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.080
 switch faster than kicks 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.650
 it does 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.650
 night people 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.490
 on speedometer 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.720
 this gear i tiempo para 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.170
 here 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.959
 from exclude though 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.020
 that I turn on everything after 80 about 90 km 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.800
 an hour here is such a big list 5 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.800
 fine end 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.150
 let's just go 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.370
 these people are forest and 1 and 2 liters 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.700
 pulls perfectly 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.400
 goes as he wants but usually more than 120 to 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.750
 ball try to drive and because 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.750
 wrong roads 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.599
 good site strategist times 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.239
 will affect even the mows she carries 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.069
 accelerates 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.210
 easy 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.230
 desire so fast 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.230
 no ride 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.440
 because road bitch no 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.390
 everyone likes the track 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.209
 national importance 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.590
 this is not very well, the maximum of such 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.680
 manger weed 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.730
 let's say regular 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.730
 weeks I need to overtake 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.069
 met 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.420
 just transfer 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.500
 as she picks up speed 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.500
 here I went sharply 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.850
 to pass neighbors about 80 kilometers 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.120
 got hit 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.120
 how many winters 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.350
 at the front squeezed 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.680
 go
