00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
hi I'm here today with Matt Deborah

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.410 
hi I'm here today with Matt Deborah
your<00:00:11.770> design<00:00:12.070> engineer<00:00:12.580> here

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
your design engineer here

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.160 
your design engineer here
and<00:00:14.610> Matt's<00:00:15.610> going<00:00:15.820> to<00:00:15.880> show<00:00:16.090> us<00:00:16.240> a<00:00:16.450> kind<00:00:17.110> of

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
and Matt's going to show us a kind of

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.170 
and Matt's going to show us a kind of
some<00:00:17.770> product<00:00:18.160> development<00:00:18.730> that<00:00:18.910> we've

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
some product development that we've

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.150 
some product development that we've
we've<00:00:19.960> been<00:00:20.110> working<00:00:20.410> on<00:00:20.500> for<00:00:20.740> a<00:00:20.800> little<00:00:20.920> bit

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
we've been working on for a little bit

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.150 
we've been working on for a little bit
here<00:00:21.460> so<00:00:22.290> Matt<00:00:23.290> why<00:00:23.500> don't<00:00:23.529> you<00:00:23.740> show<00:00:23.890> us<00:00:23.920> what

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
here so Matt why don't you show us what

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.320 
here so Matt why don't you show us what
you<00:00:24.279> got<00:00:29.730> that's<00:00:30.730> cool

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
you got that's cool

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.020 
you got that's cool
do<00:00:32.110> it<00:00:32.230> again

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.549 

very<00:00:39.030> neat<00:00:40.579> what<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.729> it<00:00:42.199> we<00:00:43.199> have<00:00:43.350> ourselves

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
very neat what is it we have ourselves

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.060 
very neat what is it we have ourselves
here<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.100> our<00:00:44.609> drawbar<00:00:45.679> and<00:00:46.679> why<00:00:46.829> would<00:00:47.039> you

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
here in our drawbar and why would you

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.579 
here in our drawbar and why would you
even<00:00:47.280> need<00:00:47.519> a<00:00:47.579> power<00:00:47.850> drawbar<00:00:48.469> while<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
even need a power drawbar while the

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.700 
even need a power drawbar while the
obvious<00:00:49.920> reasons<00:00:50.280> are<00:00:50.809> fast<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.140> simple<00:00:52.469> tool

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
obvious reasons are fast and simple tool

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.240 
obvious reasons are fast and simple tool
changes<00:00:53.210> no<00:00:54.210> drawbar<00:00:55.049> to<00:00:55.170> tighten<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:56.219> loosen

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
changes no drawbar to tighten or loosen

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.429 
changes no drawbar to tighten or loosen
and<00:00:57.530> makes<00:00:58.530> tool<00:00:59.039> changes<00:00:59.399> very<00:00:59.519> quick

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:00.439 
and makes tool changes very quick

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:05.329 
and makes tool changes very quick
there's<00:01:01.439> also<00:01:01.589> additional<00:01:02.539> reasons<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:04.339> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
there's also additional reasons that the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.550 
there's also additional reasons that the
automatic<00:01:05.850> tool<00:01:06.119> changer<00:01:06.200> requires<00:01:07.200> some

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
automatic tool changer requires some

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.800 
automatic tool changer requires some
form<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.920> power<00:01:08.130> trailer<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.909> function<00:01:09.299> so

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
form of power trailer to function so

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.330 
form of power trailer to function so
this<00:01:09.899> would<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.470> stepping<00:01:10.950> stone<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.310> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
this would be a stepping stone in that

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.609 
this would be a stepping stone in that
direction<00:01:12.470> neat<00:01:14.600> could<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.780> could<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.470> take

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
direction neat could we could you take

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.859 
direction neat could we could you take
us<00:01:16.679> for<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.039> tour<00:01:17.340> kind<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.940> apparatus<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
us for a tour kind of the apparatus and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.830 
us for a tour kind of the apparatus and
show<00:01:19.259> us<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:20.060> little<00:01:21.060> bit<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.569> design

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
show us a little bit about the design

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.199 
show us a little bit about the design
requirements<00:01:22.500> certainly<00:01:23.100> while<00:01:24.090> here

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209 
requirements certainly while here

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.260 
requirements certainly while here
obviously<00:01:24.450> here's<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> control<00:01:25.530> pendant<00:01:26.270> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
obviously here's a control pendant you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.359 
obviously here's a control pendant you
have<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> trigger<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.740> then<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> latching

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
have a trigger and then a latching

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.800 
have a trigger and then a latching
mechanism<00:01:30.229> as<00:01:31.229> well<00:01:33.590> here's<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> inside

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
mechanism as well here's the inside

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.690 
mechanism as well here's the inside
basic<00:01:36.810> structure<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.369> stack

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
basic structure is you have a to stack

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.160 
basic structure is you have a to stack
and<00:01:39.119> Vanek<00:01:39.599> cylinder<00:01:40.759> you've<00:01:41.759> got<00:01:42.170> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and Vanek cylinder you've got the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.979 
and Vanek cylinder you've got the
drawbar<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.830> in<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.580> and<00:01:44.879> then<00:01:45.629> you<00:01:45.750> have

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:45.989 
drawbar is in here and then you have

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:49.100 
drawbar is in here and then you have
some<00:01:46.590> Bell<00:01:46.739> Bell<00:01:46.890> washers<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:48.239> then<00:01:48.989> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
some Bell Bell washers and then the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.350 
some Bell Bell washers and then the
other<00:01:49.259> critical<00:01:49.739> element<00:01:50.160> to<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.340> design<00:01:50.700> is

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
other critical element to this design is

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.999 
other critical element to this design is
this<00:01:51.629> plate<00:01:51.899> here<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.830> this<00:01:53.819> flange<00:01:54.119> here

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
this plate here and this flange here

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.749 
this plate here and this flange here
this<00:01:56.009> flange<00:01:56.369> rotates<00:01:56.879> with<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.569> spindle<00:01:58.759> and

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
this flange rotates with the spindle and

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.490 
this flange rotates with the spindle and
so<00:01:59.910> when<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> power<00:02:00.330> drawbar<00:02:00.869> activities

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
so when the power drawbar activities

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.880 
so when the power drawbar activities
it's<00:02:02.369> actually<00:02:03.200> working<00:02:04.200> its<00:02:04.470> resultant

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
it's actually working its resultant

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.490 
it's actually working its resultant
forces<00:02:05.159> off<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.519> flange<00:02:06.229> reason<00:02:07.229> for<00:02:07.379> that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
forces off that flange reason for that

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.130 
forces off that flange reason for that
is<00:02:07.789> it<00:02:08.789> keeps<00:02:09.000> all<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.269> loads<00:02:09.509> off<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
is it keeps all the loads off the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.900 
is it keeps all the loads off the
spindle<00:02:10.379> bearings

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
spindle bearings

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:20.230 
spindle bearings
so<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:12.800> just<00:02:12.980> show<00:02:13.130> really<00:02:13.370> quick<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:20.120> the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
so you just show really quick so the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.630 
so you just show really quick so the
filling<00:02:20.540> have<00:02:20.660> pressurizes<00:02:21.340> pushes<00:02:22.340> down<00:02:22.460> the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
filling have pressurizes pushes down the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.580 
filling have pressurizes pushes down the
cylinder<00:02:22.820> rod<00:02:23.120> on<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.780> top<00:02:23.960> of<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.170> drawbar

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
cylinder rod on the top of the drawbar

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.580 
cylinder rod on the top of the drawbar
and<00:02:25.300> then<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.390> reaction<00:02:26.840> force<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.380> coming

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
and then the reaction force is coming

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.290 
and then the reaction force is coming
through

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
through

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.350 
through
moaning<00:02:29.300> plate<00:02:29.480> down<00:02:29.690> here<00:02:30.020> and<00:02:30.710> pushing<00:02:31.040> up

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
moaning plate down here and pushing up

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.840 
moaning plate down here and pushing up
when<00:02:32.360> it's<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.630> no<00:02:32.750> flange<00:02:32.990> here<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:34.520> this

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
when it's the no flange here so this

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.570 
when it's the no flange here so this
whole<00:02:35.090> unit<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.630> essentially<00:02:36.170> clothing<00:02:36.590> till

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
whole unit is essentially clothing till

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.190 
whole unit is essentially clothing till
you<00:02:37.670> put<00:02:37.850> pressure<00:02:38.000> on<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.960> then<00:02:39.080> it's

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
you put pressure on it and then it's

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.950 
you put pressure on it and then it's
like<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.830> syringe<00:02:40.190> pinching<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.420> compressing

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
like a syringe pinching and compressing

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.680 
like a syringe pinching and compressing
those<00:02:42.050> bail<00:02:42.260> bills<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:43.030> we<00:02:44.030> have<00:02:44.210> a<00:02:44.240> standard

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
those bail bills and we have a standard

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.160 
those bail bills and we have a standard
tormach<00:02:45.620> TTS<00:02:46.130> collet<00:02:46.880> in<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.300> inner<00:02:47.810> RH

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
tormach TTS collet in the inner RH

the<00:02:50.870> drawbar<00:02:51.290> down<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.740> course<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.010> drawbar

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
the drawbar down of course the drawbar

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.190 
the drawbar down of course the drawbar
down<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:53.150> causes<00:02:53.570> that<00:02:53.780> complimentary<00:02:54.470> leaks

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
down it causes that complimentary leaks

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.900 
down it causes that complimentary leaks
and<00:02:57.200> then<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:57.470> take<00:02:57.710> finger<00:02:58.610> off<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.760> button

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
and then you take finger off the button

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.480 
and then you take finger off the button
you<00:02:59.510> drop<00:02:59.720> pressure<00:03:00.040> melville's<00:03:01.040> expand

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
you drop pressure melville's expand

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.930 
you drop pressure melville's expand
pulling<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.360> drawbar<00:03:02.780> up<00:03:02.990> pulling<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.100> up

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
pulling the drawbar up pulling it up

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.550 
pulling the drawbar up pulling it up
with<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.270> tool<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:08.660> whole<00:03:08.810> thing<00:03:09.050> swings<00:03:09.380> out

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
with the tool the whole thing swings out

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.770 
with the tool the whole thing swings out
of<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.740> way<00:03:09.860> right<00:03:10.160> yeah<00:03:10.970> well<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.510> have<00:03:11.660> all

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
of the way right yeah well you have all

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.780 
of the way right yeah well you have all
this<00:03:11.900> mechanism<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.590> here<00:03:12.800> you<00:03:13.370> still<00:03:13.580> need<00:03:13.730> to

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
this mechanism in here you still need to

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.670 
this mechanism in here you still need to
be<00:03:13.820> able<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.030> do<00:03:14.150> belt<00:03:14.360> changes<00:03:14.750> so<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.410> was<00:03:15.650> a

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
be able to do belt changes so that was a

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.740 
be able to do belt changes so that was a
critical<00:03:16.130> element<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:16.640> design<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.209> how<00:03:17.690> do

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
critical element to the design is how do

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.540 
critical element to the design is how do
you<00:03:17.930> add<00:03:18.170> all<00:03:18.320> this<00:03:18.470> mechanism<00:03:18.830> in<00:03:19.190> an<00:03:19.280> area

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
you add all this mechanism in an area

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.300 
you add all this mechanism in an area
you<00:03:19.610> have<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.060> get<00:03:20.180> your<00:03:20.270> fingers<00:03:20.600> into<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.500> our

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
you have to get your fingers into so our

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.810 
you have to get your fingers into so our
system<00:03:22.790> easily<00:03:23.680> pivots<00:03:24.680> out<00:03:24.800> of<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.010> way<00:03:25.160> you

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
system easily pivots out of the way you

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.520 
system easily pivots out of the way you
can<00:03:25.940> still<00:03:26.120> access<00:03:26.330> your<00:03:27.160> attention<00:03:28.270> method

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
can still access your attention method

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.870 
can still access your attention method
mechanism<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.740> then<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:31.430> can<00:03:31.550> still<00:03:31.760> get

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
mechanism and then you can still get

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.870 
mechanism and then you can still get
your<00:03:31.970> hands<00:03:32.180> in<00:03:32.360> here<00:03:32.390> under<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.200> belt<00:03:33.380> itself

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
your hands in here under the belt itself

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.440 
your hands in here under the belt itself
if<00:03:34.880> that's<00:03:35.150> not<00:03:35.360> enough<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:36.650> whole<00:03:36.860> unit<00:03:37.450> will

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
if that's not enough the whole unit will

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.780 
if that's not enough the whole unit will
easily<00:03:38.660> pull<00:03:39.020> up

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.210 

nice<00:03:43.790> back<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:45.230> just<00:03:45.380> simply<00:03:45.709> put<00:03:45.890> it<00:03:46.040> back

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
nice back in you just simply put it back

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.940 
nice back in you just simply put it back
into<00:03:46.459> place<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:48.140> way<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:48.349> go<00:03:50.140> why<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.200> air

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
into place the way you go why the air

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.490 
into place the way you go why the air
over<00:03:52.099> air<00:03:52.370> cylinder<00:03:53.319> well<00:03:54.319> there<00:03:54.410> are<00:03:54.470> a

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
over air cylinder well there are a

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.260 
over air cylinder well there are a
number<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:54.770> different<00:03:55.069> ways<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.580> could<00:03:56.000> do<00:03:56.120> it

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
number of different ways you could do it

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.940 
number of different ways you could do it
you<00:03:56.390> could<00:03:56.420> do<00:03:56.660> straight<00:03:57.290> hydraulics<00:03:57.800> you

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
you could do straight hydraulics you

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.770 
you could do straight hydraulics you
could<00:03:58.069> use<00:03:58.190> an<00:03:58.310> air<00:03:58.489> hydraulic<00:03:59.030> or<00:03:59.180> hydraulics

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
could use an air hydraulic or hydraulics

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.229 
could use an air hydraulic or hydraulics
or<00:04:00.739> use<00:04:00.950> air<00:04:01.600> we<00:04:02.600> felt<00:04:03.670> while<00:04:04.670> hydraulic

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
or use air we felt while hydraulic

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.020 
or use air we felt while hydraulic
systems<00:04:05.630> can<00:04:05.930> be<00:04:06.080> more<00:04:06.260> compact<00:04:06.940> for<00:04:07.940> the

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
systems can be more compact for the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.059 
systems can be more compact for the
given<00:04:08.330> load<00:04:08.510> they're<00:04:08.690> applying<00:04:08.959> they<00:04:09.920> also

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
given load they're applying they also

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.420 
given load they're applying they also
add<00:04:10.340> in<00:04:11.150> an<00:04:11.360> extra<00:04:11.540> element<00:04:12.220> we'd<00:04:13.220> like<00:04:13.340> to

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
add in an extra element we'd like to

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.430 
add in an extra element we'd like to
keep<00:04:13.519> things<00:04:13.700> simple<00:04:13.819> so<00:04:14.630> we<00:04:14.840> figured<00:04:15.170> a

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
keep things simple so we figured a

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.250 
keep things simple so we figured a
double<00:04:15.980> cylinder<00:04:16.600> pneumatic<00:04:17.600> only<00:04:17.900> was<00:04:18.169> the

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
double cylinder pneumatic only was the

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.199 
double cylinder pneumatic only was the
best<00:04:18.470> way<00:04:18.590> to<00:04:18.620> go<00:04:18.829> so<00:04:19.100> really<00:04:19.760> this<00:04:19.880> is<00:04:19.940> two

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
best way to go so really this is two

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.759 
best way to go so really this is two
cylinders<00:04:20.630> pancaked<00:04:21.079> on<00:04:21.169> top<00:04:21.410> of<00:04:21.530> each<00:04:21.650> other

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
cylinders pancaked on top of each other

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.180 
cylinders pancaked on top of each other
about<00:04:22.490> a<00:04:22.550> four<00:04:22.790> inch<00:04:22.820> bore<00:04:23.120> cylinder<00:04:23.570> and

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
about a four inch bore cylinder and

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.710 
about a four inch bore cylinder and
they're<00:04:25.190> linked<00:04:25.910> mechanically<00:04:26.419> through<00:04:26.570> the

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
they're linked mechanically through the

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.500 
they're linked mechanically through the
rod<00:04:26.900> would<00:04:27.590> pressurize<00:04:27.979> you<00:04:28.460> can<00:04:28.610> see<00:04:28.760> here<00:04:29.000> we

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
rod would pressurize you can see here we

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.080 
rod would pressurize you can see here we
pressurize<00:04:29.870> both<00:04:30.260> ends<00:04:30.650> of<00:04:30.830> it<00:04:31.729> for<00:04:32.000> the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
pressurize both ends of it for the

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.300 
pressurize both ends of it for the
downforce<00:04:32.540> so<00:04:33.440> that's<00:04:33.620> essentially<00:04:33.979> giving

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
downforce so that's essentially giving

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.490 
downforce so that's essentially giving
two<00:04:34.550> four<00:04:34.880> inch<00:04:34.910> more<00:04:35.570> cylinders<00:04:36.020> pushing<00:04:36.380> on

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
two four inch more cylinders pushing on

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.670 
two four inch more cylinders pushing on
the<00:04:36.560> same<00:04:36.740> point<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.960> was<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.139> simpler

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
the same point and it was a simpler

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.219 
the same point and it was a simpler
setup<00:04:40.120> as<00:04:41.120> opposed<00:04:41.419> to<00:04:41.479> an<00:04:41.630> arrow<00:04:41.810> over<00:04:41.990> oil

between 100 and 120 psi of air pressure
that<00:05:01.640> adds<00:05:02.120> up<00:05:02.390> to<00:05:02.450> about<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:03.470> little<00:05:03.919> bit

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
that adds up to about a little bit

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.850 
that adds up to about a little bit
