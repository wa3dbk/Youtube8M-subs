00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.729 
mainly because it involves hand-eye
coordination<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.899> very<00:00:49.170> good<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.530> in

Tetris<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.910> terms<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.270> its<00:00:54.390> simplicity<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.500> I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
Tetris in terms of its simplicity so I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.139 
Tetris in terms of its simplicity so I
could<00:00:55.800> actually<00:00:55.890> play<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.520> she<00:00:56.910> offered

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.780 
could actually play it and she offered
me<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.300> go<00:00:59.420> if<00:01:00.420> like

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.300 

I'm<00:01:04.600> a<00:01:04.690> gentleman

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.090 

and<00:01:09.490> I<00:01:10.360> could<00:01:10.540> not<00:01:10.720> stop<00:01:11.050> playing<00:01:11.320> it<00:01:11.650> for

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
and I could not stop playing it for

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.830 
and I could not stop playing it for
hours

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.569 

and<00:01:15.470> I<00:01:15.530> was<00:01:15.649> trying<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:15.920> figure<00:01:16.159> out<00:01:16.220> what<00:01:16.490> it

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
and I was trying to figure out what it

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.850 
and I was trying to figure out what it
was<00:01:16.729> that<00:01:17.060> made<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.360> game<00:01:17.390> show<00:01:18.079> appealing<00:01:18.740> I

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
was that made the game show appealing I

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.770 
was that made the game show appealing I
think<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:19.430> was<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.640> little<00:01:19.780> confirmations

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
think it was the little confirmations

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.600 
think it was the little confirmations
that<00:01:21.290> it<00:01:21.380> would<00:01:21.500> scream<00:01:21.950> at<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:22.340> you'd<00:01:22.520> be
