around<00:01:24.380> eight<00:01:25.380> point<00:01:26.070> six<00:01:26.460> seven<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.570> was<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
around eight point six seven it was the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.429 
around eight point six seven it was the
thickness<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> phone<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.270> five<00:01:31.110> inches

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
thickness of the phone is five inches

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.090 
thickness of the phone is five inches
and<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.520> resolution<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.720> device<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.259> full

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
and the resolution of the device is full

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:45.590 
and the resolution of the device is full
at<00:01:35.340> Full<00:01:36.090> HD<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:38.840> 19<00:01:39.840> 20<00:01:40.460> /<00:01:41.460> 10<00:01:42.450> 80<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:44.600> maybe

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
at Full HD so is 19 20 / 10 80 so maybe

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.359 
at Full HD so is 19 20 / 10 80 so maybe
in<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.890> video<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:48.030> cannot<00:01:48.420> see

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
in the in this video you cannot see

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.249 
in the in this video you cannot see
hosting<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.329> quality<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.930> very<00:01:52.020> good

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
hosting but the quality is very good

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.600 
hosting but the quality is very good
also<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.490> angled<00:01:54.119> vision<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.810> very<00:01:55.140> very<00:01:55.380> good

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
also the angled vision is very very good

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.380 
also the angled vision is very very good
so<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.329> very<00:01:57.659> nice<00:01:58.649> device<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.759> one

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
so it's a very nice device with one

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.999 
so it's a very nice device with one
gigabyte<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.170> RAM<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:03.380> CPU<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
gigabyte of RAM and the CPU is a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:13.820 
gigabyte of RAM and the CPU is a
mediatek<00:02:08.569> mt6589<00:02:09.770> T<00:02:10.770> at<00:02:11.580> 1.5<00:02:12.510> gigahertz<00:02:13.170> so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
mediatek mt6589 T at 1.5 gigahertz so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.100 
mediatek mt6589 T at 1.5 gigahertz so
all<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.130> speed<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.910> device<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.720> very<00:02:15.750> good

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
all the speed of the device is very good

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.060 
all the speed of the device is very good
as<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.590> can<00:02:16.740> see<00:02:16.920> it's<00:02:17.070> very<00:02:17.100> flow<00:02:17.690> fluently

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
as you can see it's very flow fluently

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.740 
as you can see it's very flow fluently
so<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.210> all<00:02:21.620> from<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.800> device<00:02:23.130> and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
so this is all from this device and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.420 
so this is all from this device and
after<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.050> are<00:02:25.080> going<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.530> pass<00:02:26.160> through

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
after that we are going to pass through

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.150 
after that we are going to pass through
the<00:02:26.760> test
