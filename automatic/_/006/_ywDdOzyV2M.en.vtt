his life you might not think that a mile
is<00:03:19.790> very<00:03:19.970> far<00:03:20.239> away<00:03:20.269> but<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:20.810> an<00:03:21.019> awfully

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
is very far away but it is an awfully

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.900 
is very far away but it is an awfully
long<00:03:21.680> distance<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.160> drag<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.370> house<00:03:22.610> with<00:03:22.820> your

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
long distance to drag a house with your

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.509 
long distance to drag a house with your
teeth<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:24.590> have<00:03:24.799> to<00:03:24.950> move<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.280> all<00:03:25.459> around

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
teeth and you have to move it all around

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.479 
teeth and you have to move it all around
the<00:03:26.000> trees<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:27.350> that's<00:03:27.530> probably<00:03:28.070> why<00:03:28.310> they

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
the trees so that's probably why they

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.430 
the trees so that's probably why they
only<00:03:28.640> got<00:03:28.850> it<00:03:28.970> about<00:03:29.390> 1<00:03:29.720> mile<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:30.170> would<00:03:30.350> have
