00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 very good of all and welcome to 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.850
 toaster with the channel in which you 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.230
 We teach to collect information from 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.120
 video games and put it on your computer 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.940
 so that they march perfectly and today 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.769
 we started with a league of tutorial 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.690
 legends we have already done the tutorial 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.930
 how to maintain the performance in league 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.820
 of legends of two parts and today we go I go 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.770
 to bring how 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.140
 avoid disconnection errors in 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.240
 games or even in the lobby is worth 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.300
 so what so what happens is 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.129
 that they put a patch on and they made 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.629
 incoming connections will be blocked 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.379
 then many of you who are of 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.480
 vodafone orange Jazztel Ono worth it 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.430
 you will also be able to play because 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.290
 very many we could not play because I 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.000
 It was already then that he could give us a 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.230
 little enters our browser and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.540
 let's give him what we 're going to do 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.960
 be open the rosary ports give 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.300
 at the bar address 690 and 2168 point 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.539
 1.1 ok let's go in with our 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.539
 key 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.539
 let's go in with our key I guess 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.129
 that if you have the instructions of 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.839
 router if you do not call the company and you 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.159
 they say it because I can not right now 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.350
 say my key obviously because I've 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.310
 changed so no one enters 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.680
 then let's go where it says 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.009
 advanced setup we will get where it says 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.210
 nothing and we're going to open these ports all 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.789
 these the 5008 1,393 good all for 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.799
 open the ports get you to give aac 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.970
 let's go to give custom server we're going to 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.970
 put league of legends here 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.940
 and let's put 192,200 68.1 point yo 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.850
 I put 1 esla and I think it's the static ip 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.440
 ie which does not change but I think 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.780
 also in some cases of some 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.640
 router is the dynamic ip then of that 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.140
 you must go testing if you see that it follows 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.380
 putting then erase is everything and you put here 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.600
 the order of 2,168 point of 1,132 percent 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.850
 sixty-odd what you have here we go 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.980
 to open the ports that I have left you in 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.420
 the previous step that you stop the 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.400
 video and we're going to open the ports and 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.710
 when you finish you give the saif anna plate 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.630
 then you are going to go again to nat them 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.160
 are going to leave and open ports a 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.190
 Once this is done, what are we going to do? 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.430
 be going to league of legends is worth giving 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.430
 play 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.640
 but also that it opens and put us is 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.770
 I already have it in English but 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.040
 let's go and get in English so that 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.890
 honestly recognize this not me 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.680
 I did not know what could be done but for 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.910
 that we recognize a bit the connection 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.319
 then we will enter with our 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.030
 account 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.239
 once we have downloaded all the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.239
 English 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.870
 and let's see how it actually leaves us 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.180
 enter because in some cases we do not 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.180
 they would not even go in to see how it is going to 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.519
 let in 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.379
 perfect and let's see how all the 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.780
 news and everything have loaded because in 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.670
 other cases did not load and we will see 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.230
 also how we will be able to give play 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.510
 and etcetera once you have entered 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.519
 you can close perfectly back to 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.750
 enter and put it already in Spanish this 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.370
 it's simply to be recognized 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.139
 the incoming ports I hope that I have 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.139
 helped a greeting and until next time
