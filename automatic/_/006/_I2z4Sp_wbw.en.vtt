there's a checklist there's a few videos
we<00:02:16.290> had<00:02:16.409> to<00:02:16.469> watch<00:02:16.680> there's<00:02:17.129> a<00:02:17.189> road<00:02:17.459> test

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
we had to watch there's a road test

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.479 
we had to watch there's a road test
there<00:02:18.090> was<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.209> drunk<00:02:18.930> urine<00:02:19.260> analysis<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.159> a

there was a drunk urine analysis and a

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.459 
there was a drunk urine analysis and a
physical<00:02:20.939> I<00:02:21.120> was<00:02:21.659> one<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.870> first<00:02:22.019> people

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
physical I was one the first people

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.050 
physical I was one the first people
since<00:02:22.739> alphabetically<00:02:23.370> I'm<00:02:23.639> pretty<00:02:23.909> high<00:02:24.030> up

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
since alphabetically I'm pretty high up

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.670 
since alphabetically I'm pretty high up

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
another guy the other guy had about

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.470

eight years experience in the military

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.289 
eight years experience in the military
driving<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.469> I<00:02:31.500> took<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.400> upon<00:02:32.489> myself<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:33.060> let

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
driving so I took it upon myself to let

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.039 
driving so I took it upon myself to let
him<00:02:33.450> go<00:02:33.599> first

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
him go first

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.530 
him go first
this<00:02:34.950> time<00:02:35.159> it<00:02:35.280> was<00:02:35.370> an<00:02:35.459> 8<00:02:35.609> speed<00:02:35.790> instead<00:02:36.299> of<00:02:36.389> a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
this time it was an 8 speed instead of a

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.289 
this time it was an 8 speed instead of a
10<00:02:37.129> so<00:02:38.129> I<00:02:38.159> was<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> little<00:02:38.549> bit<00:02:38.669> different<00:02:38.909> and

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
10 so I was a little bit different and

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.729 
10 so I was a little bit different and
mentally<00:02:39.719> learned<00:02:40.049> one<00:02:40.230> way<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:40.590> then<00:02:40.650> you

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
mentally learned one way and then you

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.619 
mentally learned one way and then you
get<00:02:40.859> thrown<00:02:41.040> another<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.120> necessary

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
get thrown another it's not necessary

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.959 
get thrown another it's not necessary
easy<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.799> guy<00:02:43.950> had<00:02:44.129> a<00:02:44.159> little<00:02:44.280> bit<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.519> trouble

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:44.969

that the gear range correct you know

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.080 
that the gear range correct you know
thinking<00:02:53.040> you're<00:02:53.189> here<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:53.730> hit<00:02:53.969> the

we<00:02:58.079> finally<00:02:58.290> got<00:02:58.500> back<00:02:58.620> him<00:02:58.859> a<00:02:58.919> lot<00:02:59.419> trying<00:03:00.419> to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
we finally got back him a lot trying to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.050 
we finally got back him a lot trying to
get<00:03:00.629> into<00:03:01.019> second<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:02.010> roll<00:03:02.219> through<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.609> lot

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
why they stopped there of different

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.589 
why they stopped there of different
stars<00:04:36.009> for<00:04:36.280> different<00:04:36.580> places<00:04:37.060> because<00:04:37.449> uh
