00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.000
 what's up guys 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.040
 second video of announcements today the game of 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.850
 The reality that I have to say today is 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.869
 another talk with you about the beta 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.180
 people do not have much to talk about 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.539
 beta people were against the beta me too 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.220
 I'm against beto I'm still against beta 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.260
 but it's true that he's there then we 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.610
 You have to think what you 're going to do now. 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.890
 he is there there is a knock and in all he is 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.230
 bad in my opinion but it brings 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.100
 many good things pvp it 's okay 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.739
 best 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.780
 maybe even with junior that was with beta 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.969
 and yesterday was playing more beta already 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.410
 had played a game for other days and 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.350
 yesterday I was seeing that it really is not 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.050
 It's so bad so it's cool even in 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.360
 reality the combat evolution is good 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.699
 the only thing that is not our escape and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.750
 take our mosque and that's what 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.140
 bitchy people 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.460
 but in reality it is good and good new 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.869
 system is all good 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.710
 it's just not better than what we've already 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.840
 liked 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.570
 we are forced to like something new 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.600
 but think of beta as a new chance 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.640
 to learn new things that 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.409
 never tired of playing an escape 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.869
 so now you will have the opportunity to 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.759
 relearning di is discovering new things 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.070
 no escape 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.860
 I know it's hard to have to learn more 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.229
 If you are going to have a minimal cost, it will give you a 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.170
 This gas will have more things to do. 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.860
 especially if you already have all 99 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.360
 It's over there, man. You're not serious anymore. 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.860
 how many times already settled when 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.049
 says he already said it was all bullshit 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.729
 like the other games you 've played 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.560
 They say it's way better than this shit. 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.399
 Japanese kei who ended up coming back because 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.649
 liked 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.420
 Good now, you will not even have to leave. 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.610
 because the other games have a 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.259
 team will have and will continue to 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.210
 skills system will continue 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.939
 all that is the reef pe 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.090
 Only now it changes the combat I still 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.920
 I think pm also lacks evolution 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.960
 of combat but I imagine that with 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.620
 time they are releasing updates to 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.970
 improve is the pp dropped pvp is very 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.100
 funny in beta 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:24.430
 I have no criticisms to make about 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:26.320
 pvp a until oea and made of weapons like 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.780
 divine words that had not been 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.070
 disabled is now already putting and I 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.210
 I imagine they will put more 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.750
 effects on weapons as is design elÃ­sio 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.640
 future or even makes and legs 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.750
 virtue to increase the price of 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.910
 return 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.860
 I think they will have many updates 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.470
 updates the evolution of combat to 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.680
 improve and do according to the community 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.580
 want to be ajax that's it, she's to be congratulated 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.600
 because it went through the will of 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.910
 all to maintain their conviction that created 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.280
 What do you think would be the same 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.350
 community against and did the right thing 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.500
 this south 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.720
 if she can now start listening to the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.060
 people and putting the updates 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.720
 as we want with people, people 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.900
 asks 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.860
 of course the farms of evil that 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.070
 He denied that sends a bazooka in the game but 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.710
 and improving the game lapidar the evolution 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.060
 the focus of combat to be better 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.720
 for all 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.940
 Well , congratulations, but I'm going 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.520
 wait to see if the attitude of jagex 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.940
 now that they have released, they want what they wanted 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.870
 They'll listen to us to make the game. 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.150
 best 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.920
 in our opinion will continue 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.460
 closing ear for us doing what 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.500
 they want but it's a certain way we're going to give 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.900
 a chance for jackson to let them in 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.870
 show that we were wrong 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.690
 Let's show them that 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.120
 show that the evolution of combat is 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.760
 good and we can have fun 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.920
 I ask you not to take it seriously. 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.620
 quitem plays in a week 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.190
 plays in two weeks and I really see 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.140
 not worth what is there but does not face 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.540
 because it's the face that never played and 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.520
 attack so much that it goes 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.350
 just to deny so goes 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.730
 Just because you're young will not want to. 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.670
 to experiment 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.690
 the guy experiment before criticizing 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.450
 beauty 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.860
 hence after experiencing and the good is not 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.080
 also playing ten minutes speaks that it is a 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.150
 You dick, talk, you do not understand, you gave up on me. 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.280
 that you do not have to be nervous if you 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.060
 to do if you do not know how to do it is 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.270
 your 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.460
 everything is being serious, you have to 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.230
 learn from it can not expect the 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.930
 things come filled so that you 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.630
 either so that everything knows how life goes 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.270
 go is this point so tito will have to 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.100
 suit her either why you play 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.790
 some evolution of combat learn 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.680
 playing 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.380
 I had a lot of fun with the evolution of 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.070
 Fight the pvp I'm thinking too much 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.130
 going a lot from pvp in the beta I'm going to tvp no 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.150
 runescape normal yes and will be afraid of 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.670
 sin in the channel 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.560
 from what I saw what I said is that if 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.580
 continue the way I was going 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.500
 start there sin and even now it's kept 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.020
 who will be afraid to sin will be more 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.790
 green box is going to be because I think it's fine 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.550
 best make video balls that only peka 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.870
 peka peka in the video to sin for me 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.910
 type per month 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.880
 What a mistake, I find it very tiring to do. 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.940
 video and watch video sinned sin 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.040
 mostly for me it's not mine 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.040
 style but will be afraid to sin like this 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.370
 a lot of things will get easier 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.790
 easier for some things will give 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.350
 I'll give you some items for it's pricey at the beginning. 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.670
 I thought so there is a lot of appeal 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.740
 stay pressed by pressing number 1 and stay 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.560
 dropping men only falling 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.720
 has so much love using the boat there because 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.700
 it is good to have this to discourage a 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.890
 Fuck the woods because he's going 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.900
 use boats now just press number 1 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.300
 and there are so many people using a boat that 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.940
 People have 11 stays until half 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.590
 clung because of this because putz 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.810
 they get on well, we fuck each other then 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.090
 I think it's good until they put this down. 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.700
 presence of the use of the boxes and to 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.400
 everyone can do this because it is a 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.160
 reality, what many people have 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:25.630
 look that says 30 percent of skype should 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:28.570
 to use boat maybe up to 40 was to be seen 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.850
 so you can photo click then it's good they 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.040
 facilitate in some game things that 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.390
 many people before took advantage of 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.560
 pot to pm 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:41.380
 this resource is the market is this 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.390
 Experiment evolution of combat 12 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.310
 weeks before quetta 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.410
 There's going to be a lot of video on my channel about 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.910
 evolution of the fight then stand there can 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:53.740
