hi<00:00:10.019> guys<00:00:10.230> Paul<00:00:10.530> Young<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:10.980> we're<00:00:11.070> going<00:00:11.190> to

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
hi guys Paul Young and we're going to

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.610 
hi guys Paul Young and we're going to
run<00:00:11.400> through<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:12.210> basic<00:00:12.660> lad<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.440> nice

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
run through the basic lad of the nice

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.099 
run through the basic lad of the nice
thirty-two<00:00:14.099> board<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.540> sort<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.780> wiring

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
thirty-two board and the sort of wiring

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.080 
thirty-two board and the sort of wiring
that<00:00:16.230> we're<00:00:16.410> using<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.039> how<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:17.880> go<00:00:18.060> about

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
that we're using and how we go about

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.260 
that we're using and how we go about
getting<00:00:18.449> telemetry<00:00:18.750> back<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.270> Tyrannis

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
getting telemetry back to the Tyrannis

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.900 
getting telemetry back to the Tyrannis
radio<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.380> firstly<00:00:22.710> we've<00:00:23.070> got<00:00:23.220> two<00:00:23.400> Portilla

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
radio so firstly we've got two Portilla

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.670 
radio so firstly we've got two Portilla
this<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.720> one<00:00:25.470> from<00:00:25.800> abuse<00:00:26.760> mark<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
this one is one from abuse mark and

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.500 
this one is one from abuse mark and
basically<00:00:28.680> from<00:00:28.830> Japan<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.699> one<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
basically from Japan and this one is the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.290 
basically from Japan and this one is the
hobbyking<00:00:31.080> version<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.730> both<00:00:32.910> look<00:00:33.059> pretty

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
hobbyking version so both look pretty

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.630 
hobbyking version so both look pretty
much<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.660> same<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.079> lads<00:00:34.460> pretty<00:00:35.460> much

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
much the same in the lads pretty much

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.040 
much the same in the lads pretty much
identical<00:00:35.880> other<00:00:36.480> than<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.750> couple<00:00:36.899> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
identical other than a couple of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.619 
identical other than a couple of
components<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.460> run<00:00:38.640> through<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.270> basic

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
components but we run through the basic

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.229 
components but we run through the basic
layout<00:00:39.809> now<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:41.160> outside<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.730> board<00:00:41.969> all

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
layout now the outside of the board all

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.930 
layout now the outside of the board all
these<00:00:42.420> pins<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.320> outside<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.040> over<00:00:44.760> here

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
these pins on the outside and over here

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.360 
these pins on the outside and over here
as<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.210> see<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.559> are<00:00:47.160> all

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
as you can see and out there are all

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.160 
as you can see and out there are all
going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.969> negative<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.780> keep<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.110> in

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
going to be negative so keep that in

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.939 
going to be negative so keep that in
mind<00:00:49.500> okay<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:51.079> this<00:00:52.079> will<00:00:52.260> represent<00:00:52.469> motor

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
mind okay so this will represent motor

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.900 
mind okay so this will represent motor
one<00:00:53.239> moto2<00:00:54.239> moto3<00:00:54.510> motor<00:00:55.350> fault<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.699> we'll

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
one moto2 moto3 motor fault so we'll

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.490 
one moto2 moto3 motor fault so we'll
then<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> solver<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.539> some<00:00:57.780> pin<00:00:57.960> headers<00:00:58.260> for

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
then to solver in some pin headers for

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.979 
then to solver in some pin headers for
that<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.039> we'll<00:00:59.609> also<00:00:59.820> need<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> solder<00:01:00.780> in

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that and we'll also need to solder in

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.049 
that and we'll also need to solder in
some<00:01:01.199> pin<00:01:01.410> headers<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.460> region<00:01:02.850> also

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
some pin headers for this region also

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.090 
some pin headers for this region also
which<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.629> where<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.140> get<00:01:04.290> our<00:01:04.350> symmetry<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
which is where we get our symmetry and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.219 
which is where we get our symmetry and
run<00:01:05.250> our<00:01:05.369> passover<00:01:05.790> etc<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.540> my<00:01:06.780> current

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
run our passover etc in my current

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.440 
run our passover etc in my current
configuration<00:01:07.439> layer<00:01:07.950> I'm<00:01:08.189> running<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:08.970> two

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
configuration layer I'm running one two

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.060 
configuration layer I'm running one two
three<00:01:10.080> four<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.619> these

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
three four of these

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.219 
three four of these
and<00:01:11.159> they're<00:01:11.820> connected<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.330> my<00:01:12.450> es<00:01:12.659> es<00:01:12.990> and

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and they're connected to my es es and

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.710 
and they're connected to my es es and
only<00:01:13.890> one<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.310> es<00:01:14.490> es<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.939> providing<00:01:15.450> power

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
only one of the es es is providing power

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.539 
only one of the es es is providing power
back<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> board<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.100> other<00:01:17.250> ones<00:01:17.430> I've

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
back to the board on the other ones I've

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.980 
back to the board on the other ones I've
actually<00:01:17.670> cut<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.860> positive<00:01:19.860> lead<00:01:20.720> on<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
actually cut the positive lead on the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.929 
actually cut the positive lead on the
actual<00:01:22.290> air<00:01:22.409> T<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.310> only<00:01:23.400> one<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.700> them<00:01:23.880> is

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
actual air T so only one of them is

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.219 
actual air T so only one of them is
actually<00:01:24.240> connected<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> board<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.170> this

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
actually connected to the board in this

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770 
actually connected to the board in this
house<00:01:25.439> providing<00:01:25.920> power<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.369> board<00:01:26.780> now

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
house providing power to the board now

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
house providing power to the board now
over<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.500> side<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:29.340> only<00:01:29.579> using<00:01:29.790> three

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
over on this side I'm only using three

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.649 
over on this side I'm only using three
these<00:01:30.570> three<00:01:30.630> pads<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.920> two<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.259> three<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
these three pads one two and three and

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.319 
these three pads one two and three and
they<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.840> straight<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> PPM<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.400> D<00:01:39.030> for

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
they go straight to the PPM on my D for

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.069 
they go straight to the PPM on my D for
our<00:01:39.509> 2<00:01:39.750> receiver<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:41.659> I<00:01:42.659> don't<00:01:42.960> actually

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
our 2 receiver and I don't actually

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.139 
our 2 receiver and I don't actually
solder<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.860> any<00:01:43.979> pin<00:01:44.189> headers<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.820> I'm

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
solder it any pin headers on this I'm

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.310 
solder it any pin headers on this I'm
just<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> solve<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.840> directly<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
just going to solve it directly to the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.249 
just going to solve it directly to the
board<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:47.240> over<00:01:48.240> here<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.630> region<00:01:49.049> here

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
board and over here in this region here

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.160 
board and over here in this region here
we're<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> run<00:01:50.280> three<00:01:50.790> connections<00:01:51.540> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
we're going to run three connections and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.990 
we're going to run three connections and
keep<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.619> mind<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.100> negative<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
keep in mind the negative is on the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.719 
keep in mind the negative is on the
outside<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.259> first<00:01:55.530> one<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> be

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
outside so the first one is going to be

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.600 
outside so the first one is going to be
to<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.420> battery<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.079> will<00:01:58.259> go<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.610> your

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
to your battery and this will go to your

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.340 
to your battery and this will go to your
power<00:01:59.909> distribution<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.899> will<00:02:01.079> allow

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
power distribution and this will allow

actually<00:03:23.010> going<00:03:23.160> also<00:03:23.460> to<00:03:23.640> my<00:03:23.880> default<00:03:24.120> are

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
actually going also to my default are

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.770 
actually going also to my default are
two<00:03:24.780> receiver<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.800> connecting<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.780> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
two receiver and it's connecting to the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.450 
two receiver and it's connecting to the
black<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.500> green<00:03:28.680> wire<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:28.980> comes<00:03:29.280> out

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
black and the green wire that comes out

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.980 
black and the green wire that comes out
of<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:29.640> receiver<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.690> will<00:03:30.810> actually

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
of the receiver and that will actually

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.490 
of the receiver and that will actually
send<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:32.460> dilemma<00:03:32.790> tree<00:03:33.030> back<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.690> the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
send the dilemma tree back to the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.770 
send the dilemma tree back to the
default<00:03:34.920> r2<00:03:35.250> which<00:03:35.430> will<00:03:35.580> in<00:03:35.700> turn<00:03:35.730> send<00:03:36.660> it

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
default r2 which will in turn send it

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.380 
default r2 which will in turn send it
back<00:03:36.960> to<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.560> taranis<00:03:38.040> radio<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:39.060> that's<00:03:39.240> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
back to the taranis radio so that's the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.920 
back to the taranis radio so that's the
basic<00:03:39.720> wiring<00:03:39.990> inside<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.650> quadcopter

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.650 
solder joints that look nice and which
so<00:04:03.960> what<00:04:04.380> we<00:04:04.470> need<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.650> do<00:04:04.800> now<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.250> basically

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
so what we need to do now is basically

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.650 
so what we need to do now is basically
insert<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:07.050> pin<00:04:07.500> headers<00:04:07.890> into<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:09.000> PCB

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
insert the pin headers into the PCB

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.260 
insert the pin headers into the PCB
board<00:04:09.900> now<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:10.830> pin<00:04:11.250> here<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.490> I've<00:04:11.610> got<00:04:11.640> come

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
board now the pin here is I've got come

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.510 
board now the pin here is I've got come
in<00:04:12.540> there<00:04:13.080> lots<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:13.680> there's<00:04:14.010> six<00:04:14.280> pin

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
in there lots of this there's six pin

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.520 
in there lots of this there's six pin
headers<00:04:14.850> so<00:04:15.540> there's<00:04:15.720> four<00:04:15.960> groups<00:04:16.230> of<00:04:16.350> these

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
headers so there's four groups of these

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.520 
headers so there's four groups of these
that<00:04:16.680> I've<00:04:16.739> got<00:04:16.890> a<00:04:16.920> solver<00:04:17.310> in<00:04:17.540> so<00:04:18.540> what<00:04:19.440> I'm

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
that I've got a solver in so what I'm

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.140 
that I've got a solver in so what I'm
going<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.680> do<00:04:19.799> first<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.250> put<00:04:20.310> them<00:04:20.730> in<00:04:20.880> place

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
going to do first is put them in place

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.620 
going to do first is put them in place
and<00:04:22.130> let's<00:04:23.130> get<00:04:23.310> these<00:04:23.490> guys<00:04:23.700> in<00:04:23.940> here<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:26.510> one

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
and let's get these guys in here and one

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.970 
and let's get these guys in here and one
they're<00:04:27.750> in<00:04:27.870> place<00:04:28.140> what<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.440> want<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.710> do<00:04:28.830> is

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
they're in place what I want to do is

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.060 
they're in place what I want to do is
carefully<00:04:29.670> turn<00:04:30.090> this<00:04:30.300> over<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:30.990> place<00:04:31.800> it

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
carefully turn this over and place it

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.520 
carefully turn this over and place it
facedown<00:04:32.460> on<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.990> board

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
facedown on to the board

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.020 
facedown on to the board
you're<00:04:35.160> just<00:04:35.310> got<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.490> be<00:04:35.580> careful<00:04:35.910> it

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
you're just got to be careful it

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.220 
you're just got to be careful it
actually<00:04:36.330> drop<00:04:36.480> any<00:04:36.690> out<00:04:36.840> of<00:04:36.870> there<00:04:37.080> if<00:04:37.140> you

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
actually drop any out of there if you

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.680 
actually drop any out of there if you
can<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.710> just<00:04:37.940> position<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.030> in<00:04:39.210> place<00:04:39.480> and

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
can and just position it in place and

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.030 
can and just position it in place and
then<00:04:39.780> what<00:04:39.990> you<00:04:40.080> want<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.320> do<00:04:40.500> is<00:04:40.680> actually

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
then what you want to do is actually

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.940 
then what you want to do is actually
hold<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.760> PCB<00:04:42.270> down<00:04:42.570> with<00:04:43.410> something<00:04:43.770> and

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
hold the PCB down with something and

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.520 
hold the PCB down with something and
here<00:04:44.130> I'm<00:04:44.250> using<00:04:44.280> my<00:04:45.080> solder<00:04:46.080> assistant

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
here I'm using my solder assistant

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.620 
here I'm using my solder assistant
that's<00:04:47.220> just<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:47.610> thing<00:04:48.150> that's<00:04:48.270> got<00:04:48.420> two

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
that's just this thing that's got two

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.510 
that's just this thing that's got two
alligator<00:04:49.110> clips<00:04:49.350> on<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.800> just<00:04:50.010> helps

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
alligator clips on it and just helps

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.030 
alligator clips on it and just helps
hold<00:04:50.760> wires<00:04:51.060> etc<00:04:51.320> so<00:04:52.320> once<00:04:52.530> I've<00:04:52.650> got<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:52.830> in

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
hold wires etc so once I've got that in

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.890 
hold wires etc so once I've got that in
place<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.580> next<00:04:53.790> thing<00:04:53.910> you<00:04:54.060> want<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.300> do<00:04:54.540> is

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
place the next thing you want to do is

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.680 
place the next thing you want to do is
solder<00:04:55.890> in<00:04:56.160> place<00:04:56.400> at<00:04:56.640> least<00:04:56.670> one<00:04:57.180> pin<00:04:57.480> from

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
solder in place at least one pin from

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.720 
solder in place at least one pin from
each<00:04:57.930> one<00:04:58.140> of<00:04:58.230> those<00:04:58.320> pin<00:04:58.590> headers<00:04:58.890> and<00:04:59.070> the

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
each one of those pin headers and the

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.950 
each one of those pin headers and the
reason<00:05:00.030> for<00:05:00.060> that<00:05:00.210> is<00:05:00.450> we<00:05:00.660> don't<00:05:00.720> want<00:05:00.810> to

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
reason for that is we don't want to

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.930 
reason for that is we don't want to
solve<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.200> whole<00:05:01.500> lot<00:05:01.710> in<00:05:01.830> place<00:05:02.310> just<00:05:02.760> yet

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
solve the whole lot in place just yet

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.390 
solve the whole lot in place just yet
and<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.720> reason<00:05:04.110> being<00:05:04.530> that<00:05:04.710> in<00:05:05.100> case<00:05:05.370> you

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
and the reason being that in case you

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.790 
and the reason being that in case you
haven't<00:05:05.850> got<00:05:05.970> it<00:05:06.090> seated<00:05:06.450> down<00:05:06.600> properly<00:05:07.050> then

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
haven't got it seated down properly then

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.410 
haven't got it seated down properly then
it<00:05:07.950> could<00:05:08.100> become<00:05:08.340> an<00:05:08.460> issue<00:05:08.520> desoldering<00:05:09.150> a

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
it could become an issue desoldering a

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.090 
it could become an issue desoldering a
whole<00:05:09.570> upper<00:05:09.750> jaw<00:05:09.900> rivet<00:05:10.290> if<00:05:10.620> it's<00:05:10.740> only<00:05:10.860> one

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
whole upper jaw rivet if it's only one

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.190 
whole upper jaw rivet if it's only one
solder<00:05:11.520> joint<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:12.300> can<00:05:12.330> easily<00:05:12.690> push<00:05:12.900> it<00:05:13.050> down

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
solder joint you can easily push it down

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.460 
solder joint you can easily push it down
with<00:05:13.230> your<00:05:13.380> finger<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:13.800> read<00:05:14.010> with<00:05:14.580> the

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
with your finger and read with the

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.470 
with your finger and read with the
remelt<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.590> solder<00:05:17.040> and<00:05:17.220> then<00:05:17.670> I'll<00:05:17.850> reseat

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
remelt the solder and then I'll reseat

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.110 
remelt the solder and then I'll reseat
the<00:05:18.510> actual<00:05:19.140> pin<00:05:19.560> headers<00:05:19.860> so<00:05:20.700> that's<00:05:21.000> a

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
the actual pin headers so that's a

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.400 
the actual pin headers so that's a
theory<00:05:21.390> there<00:05:21.540> so<00:05:21.690> once<00:05:21.870> you've<00:05:21.960> actually<00:05:22.080> got

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
theory there so once you've actually got

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.290 
theory there so once you've actually got
each<00:05:22.620> one<00:05:22.890> of<00:05:23.010> them<00:05:23.100> sold<00:05:23.340> it<00:05:23.460> up<00:05:23.580> what<00:05:24.210> you

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
each one of them sold it up what you

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.760 
each one of them sold it up what you
want<00:05:24.450> to<00:05:24.510> do<00:05:24.660> is<00:05:24.810> flip<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.290> board<00:05:25.470> over<00:05:25.590> and

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
want to do is flip the board over and

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.010 
want to do is flip the board over and
just<00:05:26.040> confirm<00:05:26.670> that<00:05:26.700> you've<00:05:27.030> got<00:05:27.270> these<00:05:27.720> pin

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
just confirm that you've got these pin

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.870 
just confirm that you've got these pin
in<00:05:28.170> pin<00:05:28.410> headers<00:05:28.710> sitting<00:05:29.160> nice<00:05:29.400> and<00:05:29.430> neatly

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
in pin headers sitting nice and neatly

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.240 
in pin headers sitting nice and neatly
into<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.600> PCB<00:05:31.170> board<00:05:31.230> nice<00:05:31.590> and<00:05:31.800> flat<00:05:31.980> and

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
into the PCB board nice and flat and

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.890 
into the PCB board nice and flat and
they're<00:05:32.730> hard<00:05:32.970> up<00:05:33.090> against<00:05:33.390> the<00:05:33.510> piece<00:05:33.660> of<00:05:33.810> e

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
they're hard up against the piece of e

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.900 
they're hard up against the piece of e
like<00:05:34.200> that<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:35.220> once<00:05:35.490> you<00:05:35.610> know<00:05:35.730> they're

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
like that so once you know they're

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.090 
like that so once you know they're
pretty<00:05:36.390> much<00:05:36.630> in<00:05:36.870> place<00:05:37.170> and<00:05:37.500> they<00:05:37.620> look<00:05:37.800> fine

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
pretty much in place and they look fine

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.940 
pretty much in place and they look fine
the<00:05:38.790> next<00:05:39.090> step<00:05:39.240> is<00:05:39.390> really<00:05:39.680> basically<00:05:40.680> put<00:05:40.890> it

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
the next step is really basically put it

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.320 
the next step is really basically put it
back<00:05:41.100> down<00:05:41.310> in<00:05:41.490> position<00:05:41.640> again<00:05:41.940> use

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
back down in position again use

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.910 
back down in position again use
something<00:05:42.660> to<00:05:42.780> hold<00:05:42.990> it<00:05:43.140> down<00:05:43.320> and<00:05:43.590> once

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
something to hold it down and once

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.490 
something to hold it down and once
you've<00:05:44.130> actually<00:05:44.280> held<00:05:44.790> the<00:05:45.030> board<00:05:45.300> down<00:05:45.600> what

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
you've actually held the board down what

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.560 
you've actually held the board down what
you<00:05:46.650> want<00:05:46.860> to<00:05:46.950> do<00:05:47.100> is<00:05:47.340> solder<00:05:47.760> in<00:05:48.030> each<00:05:48.240> one<00:05:48.480> of

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
you want to do is solder in each one of

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.420 
you want to do is solder in each one of
them<00:05:48.660> there's<00:05:48.780> no<00:05:48.900> specific<00:05:49.320> sequence<00:05:50.070> you

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
them there's no specific sequence you

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.700 
them there's no specific sequence you
need<00:05:50.550> to<00:05:50.670> go<00:05:50.790> through<00:05:51.230> it's<00:05:52.230> just<00:05:52.470> a<00:05:52.530> matter<00:05:52.650> of

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
need to go through it's just a matter of

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.670 
need to go through it's just a matter of
getting<00:05:52.860> nice<00:05:53.130> clean<00:05:53.640> wet<00:05:54.060> joints<00:05:54.450> now<00:05:55.350> over

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
getting nice clean wet joints now over

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.110 
getting nice clean wet joints now over
here<00:05:55.830> as<00:05:55.980> you<00:05:56.100> can<00:05:56.160> see<00:05:56.370> I'm<00:05:56.490> using<00:05:56.520> a<00:05:56.850> very

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
here as you can see I'm using a very

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.640 
here as you can see I'm using a very
very<00:05:57.240> fine<00:05:57.600> tip<00:05:57.840> soldering<00:05:58.260> iron<00:05:58.530> and

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
very fine tip soldering iron and

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.230 
very fine tip soldering iron and
actually<00:05:58.920> that<00:05:59.010> sorry<00:05:59.460> I<00:05:59.610> should<00:06:00.030> have<00:06:00.120> been

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
actually that sorry I should have been

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.550 
actually that sorry I should have been
claimed<00:06:00.540> that<00:06:00.660> it's<00:06:00.840> actually<00:06:01.110> quite<00:06:01.290> awkward

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
claimed that it's actually quite awkward

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.280 
claimed that it's actually quite awkward
trying<00:06:01.860> to<00:06:02.010> do<00:06:02.130> this<00:06:02.280> with<00:06:02.550> a<00:06:02.990> camera<00:06:03.990> right

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
trying to do this with a camera right

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.140 
trying to do this with a camera right
over<00:06:04.500> the<00:06:04.860> PCB<00:06:05.340> board<00:06:05.550> so<00:06:05.670> I'm<00:06:05.730> sort<00:06:05.940> of<00:06:05.970> trying

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
over the PCB board so I'm sort of trying

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.660 
over the PCB board so I'm sort of trying
to<00:06:06.180> work<00:06:06.360> around<00:06:06.780> it<00:06:06.930> so<00:06:07.770> hence<00:06:08.010> I<00:06:08.190> look<00:06:08.580> a

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
to work around it so hence I look a

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.340 
to work around it so hence I look a
little<00:06:08.850> bit<00:06:08.940> awkward<00:06:09.120> I'm<00:06:09.480> doing<00:06:09.780> it<00:06:09.870> but<00:06:10.020> this

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
little bit awkward I'm doing it but this

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.840 
little bit awkward I'm doing it but this
is<00:06:10.530> you're<00:06:10.650> watching<00:06:10.920> this<00:06:11.040> in<00:06:11.190> real<00:06:11.370> time<00:06:11.610> and

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
is you're watching this in real time and

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.970 
is you're watching this in real time and
this<00:06:12.120> is<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.330> speed<00:06:12.720> at<00:06:12.870> which<00:06:12.900> you<00:06:13.860> would

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
this is the speed at which you would

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.040 
this is the speed at which you would
actually<00:06:14.160> solve<00:06:14.430> up<00:06:14.670> as<00:06:14.910> you<00:06:15.750> can<00:06:15.810> see<00:06:15.900> I've

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
actually solve up as you can see I've

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.660 
actually solve up as you can see I've
whipped<00:06:16.290> the<00:06:16.470> actual<00:06:16.800> soldering<00:06:17.160> iron<00:06:17.400> a<00:06:17.430> bit

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
whipped the actual soldering iron a bit

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.440 
whipped the actual soldering iron a bit
there<00:06:17.850> just<00:06:17.880> to<00:06:18.150> get<00:06:18.690> better<00:06:18.870> heat<00:06:19.140> transfer

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
there just to get better heat transfer

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.760 
there just to get better heat transfer
so<00:06:21.450> this<00:06:21.630> year<00:06:21.810> the<00:06:22.140> theory<00:06:22.500> is<00:06:22.620> actually

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
so this year the theory is actually

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.190 
so this year the theory is actually
pretty<00:06:23.130> simple<00:06:23.550> what<00:06:24.240> you<00:06:24.270> want<00:06:24.570> to<00:06:24.660> do<00:06:24.870> is

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
pretty simple what you want to do is

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.980 
pretty simple what you want to do is
heat<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:26.010> actual<00:06:26.280> surface<00:06:26.460> then<00:06:26.820> apply<00:06:27.150> the

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
heat the actual surface then apply the

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.900 
heat the actual surface then apply the
actual<00:06:28.350> this<00:06:28.440> is<00:06:28.500> slide<00:06:28.770> down<00:06:28.980> L<00:06:29.190> so<00:06:29.670> what<00:06:29.820> I'm

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
actual this is slide down L so what I'm

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.730 
actual this is slide down L so what I'm
doing<00:06:29.940> is<00:06:30.150> heating<00:06:30.390> the<00:06:30.600> surface<00:06:30.780> and<00:06:31.230> I<00:06:31.350> dab

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
doing is heating the surface and I dab

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.030 
doing is heating the surface and I dab
just<00:06:31.950> a<00:06:32.100> touch<00:06:32.370> of<00:06:32.400> solar<00:06:32.850> on<00:06:33.180> to<00:06:33.960> the<00:06:34.830> actual

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
just a touch of solar on to the actual

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.010 
just a touch of solar on to the actual
soldering<00:06:35.460> iron<00:06:35.640> and<00:06:35.880> that<00:06:36.540> will<00:06:36.690> allow<00:06:36.990> the

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
soldering iron and that will allow the

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.380 
soldering iron and that will allow the
heat<00:06:37.350> to<00:06:37.380> transfer<00:06:38.100> to<00:06:38.460> the<00:06:38.580> pin<00:06:38.820> and<00:06:39.060> also<00:06:39.300> the

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
heat to transfer to the pin and also the

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
heat to transfer to the pin and also the
pad<00:06:39.630> and<00:06:40.140> once<00:06:40.470> it's<00:06:40.680> actually<00:06:41.010> trained

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
pad and once it's actually trained

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.260 
pad and once it's actually trained
let's<00:06:41.830> heat<00:06:41.980> it<00:06:42.010> up<00:06:42.190> as<00:06:42.400> you<00:06:42.730> can<00:06:42.850> see<00:06:43.060> I<00:06:43.090> can

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
let's heat it up as you can see I can

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.570 
let's heat it up as you can see I can
apply<00:06:43.510> solder<00:06:43.810> to<00:06:44.050> it<00:06:44.140> and<00:06:44.380> it's<00:06:45.190> pretty<00:06:45.430> much

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
apply solder to it and it's pretty much

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.610 
apply solder to it and it's pretty much
good<00:06:45.850> to<00:06:45.940> go<00:06:45.970> and<00:06:46.330> the<00:06:46.990> rest<00:06:47.170> of<00:06:47.290> it<00:06:47.380> I'm<00:06:47.440> going

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
good to go and the rest of it I'm going

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.290 
good to go and the rest of it I'm going
to<00:06:47.680> solder<00:06:47.980> up<00:06:48.070> now<00:06:48.280> in<00:06:48.400> real<00:06:48.640> time<00:06:48.880> so<00:06:49.120> it's

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
to solder up now in real time so it's

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.600 
to solder up now in real time so it's
exactly<00:06:49.690> how<00:06:49.990> it<00:06:50.170> is<00:06:50.200> that<00:06:50.290> I'm<00:06:50.500> doing<00:06:50.650> it<00:06:50.920> so

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
exactly how it is that I'm doing it so

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.760 
exactly how it is that I'm doing it so
the<00:06:51.760> process<00:06:52.240> is<00:06:52.420> actually<00:06:52.870> pretty<00:06:53.350> quick

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
the process is actually pretty quick

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.250 
the process is actually pretty quick
so<00:06:53.950> we'll<00:06:54.610> go<00:06:54.850> through<00:06:54.880> and<00:06:55.390> solve<00:06:55.810> the<00:06:55.990> rest

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
so we'll go through and solve the rest

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.500 
so we'll go through and solve the rest
of<00:06:56.380> these<00:06:56.470> guys<00:06:56.830> up<00:06:57.070> I'll<00:06:57.700> let<00:06:58.120> you<00:06:58.240> watch<00:06:58.390> a

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
of these guys up I'll let you watch a

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.990 
of these guys up I'll let you watch a
few<00:06:58.720> more<00:06:58.930> in<00:06:59.110> real<00:06:59.320> time<00:06:59.590> and<00:06:59.860> then<00:07:00.820> what

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
few more in real time and then what

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.300 
few more in real time and then what
we'll<00:07:01.180> do<00:07:01.420> is<00:07:01.690> speed<00:07:02.290> this<00:07:02.620> video<00:07:03.130> up

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.580 

so<00:07:08.150> that's<00:07:08.330> pretty<00:07:08.540> much<00:07:08.630> it<00:07:08.780> it's<00:07:09.139> all<00:07:09.320> sold

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
so that's pretty much it it's all sold

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:10.900 
so that's pretty much it it's all sold
it<00:07:09.740> up<00:07:09.830> and<00:07:10.040> we're<00:07:10.160> pretty<00:07:10.370> much<00:07:10.610> good<00:07:10.790> to<00:07:10.880> go

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:10.910 
it up and we're pretty much good to go

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.580 
it up and we're pretty much good to go
all<00:07:11.240> we<00:07:11.420> need<00:07:11.540> to<00:07:11.630> do<00:07:11.750> now<00:07:11.870> is<00:07:12.020> flip<00:07:12.200> the<00:07:12.410> board

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.590 
all we need to do now is flip the board

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.560 
all we need to do now is flip the board
over<00:07:12.800> and<00:07:13.040> then<00:07:13.880> once<00:07:14.030> we've<00:07:14.150> got<00:07:14.300> it<00:07:14.389> flipped

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
over and then once we've got it flipped

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.750 
over and then once we've got it flipped
over<00:07:14.720> we<00:07:14.990> need<00:07:15.080> to<00:07:15.200> tin<00:07:15.530> these<00:07:15.950> three<00:07:16.250> pads<00:07:16.520> for

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760 
over we need to tin these three pads for

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.780 
over we need to tin these three pads for
the<00:07:16.850> PPM<00:07:17.330> and<00:07:17.680> the<00:07:18.680> same<00:07:18.860> process<00:07:19.310> exactly<00:07:19.580> a

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:19.790 
the PPM and the same process exactly a

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.070 
the PPM and the same process exactly a
little<00:07:19.970> bit<00:07:20.060> of<00:07:20.120> solder<00:07:20.419> than<00:07:20.540> apply<00:07:20.810> more

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
little bit of solder than apply more

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.150 
little bit of solder than apply more
solder<00:07:21.320> once<00:07:21.620> you<00:07:21.710> get<00:07:21.830> good<00:07:21.980> heat<00:07:22.130> transfer

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 
solder once you get good heat transfer

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.580 
solder once you get good heat transfer
and<00:07:22.790> that's<00:07:23.540> pretty<00:07:23.810> much<00:07:23.960> good<00:07:24.110> to<00:07:24.139> go<00:07:24.260> then

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:24.590 
and that's pretty much good to go then

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.620 
and that's pretty much good to go then
it's<00:07:24.710> just<00:07:24.800> a<00:07:24.919> matter<00:07:24.950> of<00:07:25.250> soldering<00:07:25.970> in<00:07:26.240> place

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:26.630 
it's just a matter of soldering in place

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.850 
it's just a matter of soldering in place
the<00:07:27.700> servo<00:07:28.700> connector<00:07:28.970> and<00:07:29.440> the<00:07:30.440> way<00:07:30.620> that's

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 
the servo connector and the way that's

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.170 
the servo connector and the way that's
done<00:07:31.040> keep<00:07:31.460> in<00:07:31.580> mind<00:07:31.730> to<00:07:31.850> have<00:07:31.940> actually

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:32.180 
done keep in mind to have actually

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.250 
done keep in mind to have actually
tinned<00:07:32.419> these<00:07:32.570> already<00:07:32.930> that's<00:07:33.020> already

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.260 
tinned these already that's already

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.170 
tinned these already that's already
these<00:07:33.440> wires<00:07:33.710> already<00:07:33.950> pretent<00:07:34.610> so<00:07:34.850> keep<00:07:35.060> that

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:35.180 
these wires already pretent so keep that

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.480 
these wires already pretent so keep that
in<00:07:35.240> mind<00:07:35.360> I'm<00:07:36.020> not<00:07:36.080> just<00:07:36.530> melting<00:07:37.400> them

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.490 
in mind I'm not just melting them

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.100 
in mind I'm not just melting them
straight<00:07:37.700> into<00:07:37.820> the<00:07:37.970> solver<00:07:38.300> so<00:07:38.960> that's

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.110 
straight into the solver so that's

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.480 
straight into the solver so that's
pretty<00:07:39.290> much<00:07:39.350> it<00:07:39.470> it's<00:07:39.800> all<00:07:39.950> soldered<00:07:40.370> in

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:40.490 
pretty much it it's all soldered in

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.210 
pretty much it it's all soldered in
place<00:07:40.520> and<00:07:41.030> the<00:07:41.660> board<00:07:41.900> is<00:07:42.169> pretty<00:07:42.590> much<00:07:42.890> good

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.220 
place and the board is pretty much good

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.220 
place and the board is pretty much good
to<00:07:43.250> go<00:07:43.370> ready<00:07:43.790> to<00:07:43.850> go<00:07:43.970> into<00:07:44.480> your<00:07:44.660> multi<00:07:45.050> rotor

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:45.230 
to go ready to go into your multi rotor

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.740 
to go ready to go into your multi rotor
and<00:07:45.560> as<00:07:46.280> you<00:07:46.370> can<00:07:46.460> see<00:07:46.520> we've<00:07:46.820> got<00:07:46.850> nice<00:07:47.300> clean

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:47.750 
and as you can see we've got nice clean

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.110 
and as you can see we've got nice clean
solder<00:07:48.110> joints<00:07:48.530> underneath<00:07:48.890> and<00:07:49.220> that's

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 
solder joints underneath and that's

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.270 
solder joints underneath and that's
pretty<00:07:50.419> much<00:07:50.570> what<00:07:50.780> we're<00:07:50.900> after<00:07:51.020> and<00:07:51.290> we'll

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 
pretty much what we're after and we'll

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.730 
pretty much what we're after and we'll
continue<00:07:52.580> on<00:07:52.970> with<00:07:53.270> part<00:07:53.600> two<00:07:54.020> in<00:07:54.260> the<00:07:54.500> next

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:54.740 
continue on with part two in the next

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.740 
continue on with part two in the next
