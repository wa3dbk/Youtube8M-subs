00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.750
 when talking to these people sing again 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.420
 I'm going to do some super nice projects 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.180
 if it's not a 4 photo organizer or 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.460
 notes or how you want to see it for 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.260
 decorate our room our house 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.270
 some wall that looks half empty 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.010
 second project is also to do 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.930
 that maybe meet with your home is 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.820
 stop looking so boring and to 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.949
 develop a little something that maybe not 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.600
 I would have very much both projects 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.260
 they have things that are super cheap 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.879
 because you can even have at home 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.309
 the first project that is this 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.589
 organizer of photos and notes and 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.800
 we come back to tell you what is 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.100
 sure we're going to need a framework 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.100
 wood 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.390
 nails 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:13.280
 rope ribbon or rope paintings 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:16.450
 acrylic or spray 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.450
 a hammer 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.370
 post its and photos 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.330
 clothespins for hanging wooden clothes 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.330
 scissors 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.000
 a sandpaper or a nail file 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.179
 Brushes 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.920
 and that's it, we're going to start painting 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.240
 the wooden frame with white paint 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.770
 or of any color 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.770
 that you choose 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.740
 let's let it dry a bit and 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.740
 let's give a second more 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.360
 I decided to put details in gold like that 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.340
 I use a sponge and paint it a 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.360
 little with the golden paint and then I went 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.360
 patting 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.670
 then we are going to sanding a bit so that 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.800
 look old 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.420
 I also decided to paint the clip with 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.420
 gold and nails 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.140
 We are going to measure the rope and we are going to 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.760
 put a size a little bigger 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.030
 that the size of the frame and we're going to 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.030
 cut 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.340
 Now be very careful not to get stuck 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.160
 a finger to the frame we are going to put the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.569
 nails on the shore leaving a space 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.569
 to hang the photos 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.440
 finally we are going to tie the rope or 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.299
 ribbon on each of the nails 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.299
 doing as small clotheslines 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.610
 and this is how it is 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.720
 and you thought it was super nice not 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.190
 can give a special touch to your house 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.280
 You can even give it to your 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.709
 best friend to your boyfriend 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.660
 gualinga represent its figures in 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.390
 our second project to beautify 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.000
 or an armed sail or that does not have much 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.720
 joke and we're going to make it look like something 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.670
 super nice for our 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.670
 We are going to need scissors 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.329
 glue but powerful that sticks a lot 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.510
 wooden wands 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:11.010
 and raffia or lasso and finally a candle 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.840
 let's measure the sticks so that 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.980
 they are more or less the size of the candle 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.980
 and we are going to start cutting them 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.850
 we're going to put a lot of glue on 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.770
 one side of our candle and we're going to 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.980
 start to stick the sticks 1 point of 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.980
 other 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.190
 If we have some small space left 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.599
 we can stick a little piece of stick 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.599
 wood so that it is not so ugly 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.500
 in this all around covered in 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.570
 wooden sticks let's grab a 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.570
 chub of raffia and let's make a bun 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.680
 and that's how our candle looks 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.220
 what about and super heart every without spending 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.080
 we can have some super nice in 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.880
 our house made with our own 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.800
 hands and listening to have a bit of 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.750
