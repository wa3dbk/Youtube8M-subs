00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
could take a few cells from the source

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.310 
could take a few cells from the source
the<00:01:20.159> young<00:01:20.460> healthy<00:01:21.030> living<00:01:21.360> skin<00:01:21.719> cells<00:01:22.020> and

the young healthy living skin cells and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.679 
the young healthy living skin cells and
they<00:01:22.590> could<00:01:22.770> grow<00:01:23.009> them<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.520> by<00:01:24.240> growing<00:01:24.450> them

they could grow them and by growing them

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.760 
they could grow them and by growing them
they<00:01:24.840> could<00:01:24.990> get<00:01:25.140> them<00:01:25.289> to<00:01:25.380> produce<00:01:25.530> this

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
they could get them to produce this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.100 
they could get them to produce this

and realized that we could take the soup
and<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.289> it<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.469> chicken<00:01:43.649> soup<00:01:43.950> for
