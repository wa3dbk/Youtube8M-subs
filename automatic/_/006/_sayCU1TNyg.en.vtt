lucid in the centrifugal force video we

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.280 
lucid in the centrifugal force video we
got<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.760> see<00:00:08.940> how<00:00:09.090> weird<00:00:09.389> things<00:00:09.750> look<00:00:10.050> and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
got to see how weird things look and

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.930 
got to see how weird things look and
feel<00:00:10.620> when<00:00:10.860> you're<00:00:11.010> rotating<00:00:11.580> but<00:00:11.790> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
feel when you're rotating but the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.459 
feel when you're rotating but the
weirdness<00:00:12.210> doesn't<00:00:12.660> stop<00:00:12.900> there

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469

off<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.210> earth<00:01:42.570> though<00:01:42.930> you'll<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.470> see<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
off the earth though you'll just see the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.679 
off the earth though you'll just see the
rotation<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> earth<00:01:44.579> exerting<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.390> torque

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
tropical cyclones are so big you can see

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
major part of how hurricanes work they

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.680 
major part of how hurricanes work they
can't<00:02:09.250> even<00:02:09.369> cross<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.910> equator<00:02:10.149> this

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
notice the gap at the equator if you

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.580 
notice the gap at the equator if you
zoom<00:02:18.790> in<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.000> can<00:02:19.209> actually<00:02:19.540> see<00:02:20.110> some<00:02:20.140> of

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
them approach the equator and veer off

them approach the equator and veer off
along<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.140> like<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.560> wall<00:02:23.770> we<00:02:24.310> can<00:02:24.430> also

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
along it like it's a wall we can also

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.880 
along it like it's a wall we can also
make<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.030> Coriolis<00:02:25.630> force<00:02:25.900> more<00:02:26.110> significant

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
make the Coriolis force more significant

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.110

weirdness<00:02:32.290> let's<00:02:32.830> say<00:02:32.980> I'm<00:02:33.130> on<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
weirdness let's say I'm on the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.920 
weirdness let's say I'm on the
merry-go-round<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.209> decide<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.570> throw<00:02:34.720> a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
merry-go-round and I decide to throw a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.600 
merry-go-round and I decide to throw a
ball<00:02:35.140> if<00:02:35.530> you're<00:02:35.860> watching<00:02:36.280> from<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.520> ground

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
ball if you're watching from the ground

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.030 
ball if you're watching from the ground
then<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.510> ball<00:02:37.720> appears<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.440> basically

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
then the ball appears to basically

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.040 
then the ball appears to basically
travel<00:02:39.459> straight<00:02:39.730> once<00:02:40.060> released<00:02:40.420> it's<00:02:40.870> only

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
travel straight once released it's only

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.870 
travel straight once released it's only
being<00:02:41.290> pulled<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.860> ground<00:02:42.100> by<00:02:42.400> gravity

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
being pulled to the ground by gravity

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.670 
being pulled to the ground by gravity
which<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.209> exactly<00:02:43.720> what<00:02:43.959> you'd<00:02:44.080> expect<00:02:44.200> for

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
which is exactly what you'd expect for

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.260 
which is exactly what you'd expect for
something<00:02:45.010> without<00:02:45.100> any<00:02:45.430> other<00:02:45.670> forces<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:46.239> it

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
something without any other forces on it

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.600 
something without any other forces on it
but<00:02:46.660> that's<00:02:46.840> not<00:02:47.080> what<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.290> see<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:48.070> anyone<00:02:48.489> on

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
but that's not what I see to anyone on

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.550 
but that's not what I see to anyone on
the<00:02:48.760> merry-go-round<00:02:49.060> things<00:02:49.750> look<00:02:49.989> really

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
the merry-go-round things look really

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.030 
the merry-go-round things look really
weird

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
weird

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.310 
weird
see<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.520> ball<00:02:51.700> veer<00:02:52.090> off<00:02:52.270> to<00:02:52.300> one<00:02:52.660> side<00:02:52.690> it

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
see the ball veer off to one side it

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.840 
see the ball veer off to one side it
looks<00:02:53.590> like<00:02:53.770> there's<00:02:54.010> some<00:02:54.220> other<00:02:54.250> weird

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
looks like there's some other weird

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.540 
looks like there's some other weird
force<00:02:55.270> on<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:56.050> force<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.739> Coriolis

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
force on it that force is the Coriolis

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.729 
force on it that force is the Coriolis
force<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.180> it's<00:02:58.510> fictitious<00:02:59.200> it's<00:02:59.530> an

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
force and it's fictitious it's an

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.250 
force and it's fictitious it's an
illusion<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:01.000> Coriolis<00:03:01.660> force<00:03:02.020> is

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
illusion the Coriolis force is

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.770 
illusion the Coriolis force is
determined<00:03:03.040> by<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.310> mass<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.030> ball<00:03:04.299> the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
determined by the mass of the ball the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.210 
determined by the mass of the ball the
rotational<00:03:05.440> speed<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.920> merry-go-round

rotational speed of the merry-go-round

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.580 
rotational speed of the merry-go-round
and<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:07.269> motion<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.840> ball<00:03:07.989> in<00:03:08.320> other

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
and the motion of the ball in other

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.100 
and the motion of the ball in other
words<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.130> only<00:03:09.190> acts<00:03:09.730> on<00:03:09.970> moving<00:03:10.330> objects<00:03:10.900> and

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
words it only acts on moving objects and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.840 
words it only acts on moving objects and
only<00:03:11.620> when<00:03:11.799> you're<00:03:11.920> taking<00:03:12.310> measurements

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
only when you're taking measurements

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.550 
only when you're taking measurements
from<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.150> rotating<00:03:13.660> perspective<00:03:14.230> these

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
from the rotating perspective these

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.710 
from the rotating perspective these
things<00:03:14.860> are<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.070> coolest<00:03:15.370> so<00:03:16.030> much<00:03:16.239> science

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
things are the coolest so much science

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.600 
things are the coolest so much science
so<00:03:17.320> why<00:03:17.470> don't<00:03:17.650> we<00:03:17.680> just<00:03:17.890> always<00:03:18.220> look<00:03:18.400> from

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
so why don't we just always look from

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.860 
so why don't we just always look from
the<00:03:18.700> outside<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.269> forget<00:03:19.570> this<00:03:19.690> whole

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
the outside and forget this whole

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.320 
the outside and forget this whole
Coriolis<00:03:20.500> thing<00:03:20.739> that's<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.310> good<00:03:21.489> idea<00:03:21.610> and<00:03:22.150> in

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
Coriolis thing that's a good idea and in

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.380 
Coriolis thing that's a good idea and in
the<00:03:22.420> centrifugal<00:03:23.019> force<00:03:23.170> video<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:23.860> did<00:03:24.250> say<00:03:24.549> if
