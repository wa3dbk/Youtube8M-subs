00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:04.750 
so last week we started by pouring the

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.139 
so last week we started by pouring the
footings<00:00:05.200> and<00:00:05.350> setting<00:00:05.740> up<00:00:05.890> the<00:00:06.040> rebar<00:00:06.460> and

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.149 
footings and setting up the rebar and

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:08.759 
footings and setting up the rebar and
today<00:00:07.540> we're<00:00:07.720> working<00:00:07.839> on<00:00:08.080> stacking<00:00:08.620> the

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:08.769 
today we're working on stacking the

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.120 
today we're working on stacking the
blocks<00:00:08.920> as<00:00:09.400> well<00:00:09.429> as<00:00:09.849> fitting<00:00:10.780> the<00:00:11.080> rebar<00:00:11.710> with

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.130 
blocks as well as fitting the rebar with

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.280 
blocks as well as fitting the rebar with
inch<00:00:12.519> and<00:00:12.580> a<00:00:12.670> half<00:00:12.700> pieces<00:00:13.120> of<00:00:13.360> PVC<00:00:13.570> so<00:00:14.170> that

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
inch and a half pieces of PVC so that

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.500 
inch and a half pieces of PVC so that
once<00:00:14.530> all<00:00:14.740> the<00:00:14.860> block<00:00:15.099> is<00:00:15.309> stacked<00:00:15.610> from<00:00:16.390> the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
once all the block is stacked from the

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.200 
once all the block is stacked from the
top<00:00:16.750> of<00:00:16.930> the<00:00:16.990> block<00:00:17.230> we<00:00:17.890> slide<00:00:18.340> in<00:00:18.730> the

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
top of the block we slide in the

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.570 
top of the block we slide in the
vertical<00:00:19.660> rebar<00:00:20.050> and<00:00:20.350> because<00:00:21.250> you<00:00:21.369> can't

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
vertical rebar and because you can't

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.480 
vertical rebar and because you can't
twist<00:00:21.850> high<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:22.630> StubHub<00:00:23.590> vertical<00:00:24.039> rebar

with the vertical rebar that's in the
form<00:00:26.439> we<00:00:26.949> use<00:00:26.980> these<00:00:27.519> PVC<00:00:28.449> pieces<00:00:29.080> that<00:00:29.230> you'll

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
form we use these PVC pieces that you'll

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.459 
form we use these PVC pieces that you'll
see<00:00:29.590> in<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:29.800> pudding<00:00:30.160> and<00:00:30.310> they<00:00:30.880> keep<00:00:31.359> the<00:00:31.720> two

vertical rebars together very important

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.959 
vertical rebars together very important
when<00:00:35.770> you're<00:00:35.920> doing<00:00:36.040> these<00:00:36.309> footings<00:00:36.730> that

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
when you're doing these footings that

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.630 
when you're doing these footings that
they<00:00:37.120> are<00:00:37.480> perfectly<00:00:38.410> leveled<00:00:38.920> or<00:00:39.190> within<00:00:39.460> a

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
they are perfectly leveled or within a

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.369 
they are perfectly leveled or within a
quarter<00:00:39.969> of<00:00:40.059> an<00:00:40.149> inch<00:00:40.239> so<00:00:40.840> that<00:00:41.050> way<00:00:41.200> you're

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
quarter of an inch so that way you're

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.650 
quarter of an inch so that way you're
stacking<00:00:41.710> your<00:00:42.040> block<00:00:42.280> you<00:00:42.610> have<00:00:42.910> minimal

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
stacking your block you have minimal

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.020 
stacking your block you have minimal
amounts<00:00:44.079> of<00:00:44.230> trouble<00:00:44.710> what<00:00:45.370> you<00:00:45.460> see<00:00:45.670> here<00:00:45.940> is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
amounts of trouble what you see here is

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.209 
amounts of trouble what you see here is
the<00:00:46.180> first<00:00:46.390> two<00:00:46.629> courses<00:00:46.960> we<00:00:47.770> stacked<00:00:48.070> the

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
the first two courses we stacked the

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.819 
the first two courses we stacked the
first<00:00:48.460> two<00:00:48.640> courses<00:00:48.940> all<00:00:49.329> the<00:00:49.660> way<00:00:49.780> around<00:00:50.170> to

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
first two courses all the way around to

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.799 
first two courses all the way around to
determine<00:00:51.370> if<00:00:51.520> there's<00:00:51.730> any<00:00:51.879> low<00:00:52.210> spots<00:00:52.239> or

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
determine if there's any low spots or

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.350 
determine if there's any low spots or
high<00:00:52.960> spots<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.530> then<00:00:54.100> we<00:00:54.280> shim<00:00:54.640> or<00:00:54.879> cut<00:00:55.239> the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
high spots and then we shim or cut the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.299 
high spots and then we shim or cut the
block<00:00:55.570> accordingly<00:00:56.140> hopefully<00:00:57.100> you're<00:00:57.250> not

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
block accordingly hopefully you're not

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:06.830 
block accordingly hopefully you're not
cutting<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.760> block

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.060 

once<00:01:07.840> everything<00:01:08.380> looks<00:01:08.620> like<00:01:08.830> it's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
once everything looks like it's

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.610 
once everything looks like it's
perfectly<00:01:09.580> level<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.240> we<00:01:10.960> do<00:01:11.110> that<00:01:11.320> using

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
perfectly level and we do that using

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.330 
perfectly level and we do that using
laser<00:01:12.220> levels<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.120> sight<00:01:13.840> transoms<00:01:14.410> then<00:01:15.160> we

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
laser levels and sight transoms then we

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.920 
laser levels and sight transoms then we
glue<00:01:15.730> the<00:01:15.910> block<00:01:16.090> down<00:01:16.330> through<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.690> concrete

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
glue the block down through the concrete

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.190 
glue the block down through the concrete
using<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:17.980> standard<00:01:18.370> spray<00:01:18.610> foam<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.960> there

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
using a standard spray foam from there

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.790 
using a standard spray foam from there
we<00:01:20.620> shoot<00:01:20.980> two<00:01:21.670> by<00:01:21.850> fours<00:01:22.210> into<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:23.230> footing

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
we shoot two by fours into the footing

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.000 
we shoot two by fours into the footing
in<00:01:23.950> front<00:01:24.430> of<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.610> block<00:01:25.050> we<00:01:26.050> then<00:01:26.260> use<00:01:26.800> those

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
in front of the block we then use those

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:43.760 
in front of the block we then use those
two<00:01:27.280> by<00:01:27.460> fours<00:01:27.790> to<00:01:28.030> attach<00:01:28.330> our<00:01:28.570> scaffolding

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
you see with the latter you also need

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.289 
you see with the latter you also need
access<00:01:46.860> from<00:01:47.860> both<00:01:48.460> sides<00:01:48.789> of<00:01:48.969> the<00:01:49.119> wall

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
access from both sides of the wall

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.810 
access from both sides of the wall
during<00:01:49.630> construction<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:51.159> got<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.399> figure<00:01:51.579> on

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
during construction you got to figure on

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.270 
during construction you got to figure on

and them getting moved around the block

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.070 
and them getting moved around the block
oh<00:02:08.769> well<00:02:09.280> once<00:02:09.519> they're<00:02:09.759> glued<00:02:09.970> down<00:02:10.209> they're

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
oh well once they're glued down they're

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.770 
oh well once they're glued down they're
really<00:02:11.470> glued<00:02:11.709> down<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.069> they<00:02:12.130> don't<00:02:12.370> move
