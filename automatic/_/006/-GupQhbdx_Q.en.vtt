climbing carabiner up at the tree you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.899 
climbing carabiner up at the tree you
could<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:41.040> easily<00:01:41.220> go<00:01:41.520> through<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> eye

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
single descender ring and what I've done

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.170 
single descender ring and what I've done
here<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:10.410> guess<00:03:11.130> could<00:03:11.430> best<00:03:11.609> be<00:03:11.700> described

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
here is I guess could best be described

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.330 
here is I guess could best be described
as<00:03:12.329> a<00:03:12.389> double<00:03:12.840> slippery<00:03:13.290> half<00:03:13.470> hitch<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.220> what

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
as a double slippery half hitch so what

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.280 
as a double slippery half hitch so what
you<00:03:14.459> do<00:03:14.579> is<00:03:14.609> you<00:03:15.389> end<00:03:15.510> up<00:03:15.599> coming<00:03:15.660> down<00:03:16.049> and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
you do is you end up coming down and

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.379 
you do is you end up coming down and
through<00:03:16.829> your<00:03:16.950> descender<00:03:17.310> ring<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:18.180> make<00:03:18.359> a

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
through your descender ring you make a

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.059 
through your descender ring you make a
slippery<00:03:18.780> half<00:03:19.079> hitch<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.620> pull<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:19.859> loop

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
slippery half hitch you pull a loop

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.520 
slippery half hitch you pull a loop
through<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.609> then<00:03:21.329> you<00:03:21.480> end<00:03:21.690> up<00:03:21.870> pulling<00:03:22.349> an

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
through and then you end up pulling an

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.909 
through and then you end up pulling an
additional<00:03:22.980> loop<00:03:23.190> through<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.940> living<00:03:24.919> it

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
additional loop through that living it
