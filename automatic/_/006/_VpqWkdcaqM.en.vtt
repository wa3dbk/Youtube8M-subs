00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
was much more concentration than usual

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.950 
was much more concentration than usual
when<00:02:17.700> writing<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.090> book<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.450> that's<00:02:18.750> why<00:02:18.930> I

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
when writing a book and that's why I

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.470 
when writing a book and that's why I
shot<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.440> book<00:02:19.590> as<00:02:19.710> well<00:02:19.740> because<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:21.300> were

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
shot the book as well because we were

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.820 
shot the book as well because we were
writing<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.900> recipes<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.440> developed

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
writing the recipes and developed

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.730 
writing the recipes and developed
developing<00:02:23.640> them<00:02:23.730> much<00:02:23.940> much<00:02:24.180> slower<00:02:24.390> than<00:02:24.810> we

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
developing them much much slower than we

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.430 
developing them much much slower than we
normally<00:02:25.920> would<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:27.150> it's<00:02:27.720> more<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.170> diary

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
normally would so it's more of a diary

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.720 
normally would so it's more of a diary
and<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:30.450> know<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.840> challenge<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.640> taking<00:02:32.640> a

beautiful thing and go for it but

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.870 
beautiful thing and go for it but
actually<00:02:46.260> being<00:02:46.740> able<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.040> do<00:02:47.250> an<00:02:47.370> expression

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
actually being able to do an expression

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.760 
actually being able to do an expression
of<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.180> that's<00:02:48.390> got<00:02:48.630> those<00:02:48.810> vibes<00:02:49.200> going<00:02:49.470> on

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
of that that's got those vibes going on

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.160 
of that that's got those vibes going on
but<00:02:50.460> it<00:02:50.550> fits<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.120> book<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.750> know<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.930> got

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
but it fits in the book you know you got

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.570 
but it fits in the book you know you got
to<00:02:52.260> be<00:02:52.290> clever<00:02:52.530> how<00:02:52.830> can<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.070> take<00:02:53.370> those

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
to be clever how can I take those

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.360 
to be clever how can I take those
dynamics<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.210> we<00:02:54.990> love<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.560> actually<00:02:55.950> do

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
dynamics that we love and actually do

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.310 
dynamics that we love and actually do
something<00:02:56.640> modern<00:02:56.970> contemporary<00:02:57.540> beautiful

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
something modern contemporary beautiful

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.320 
something modern contemporary beautiful
you'd<00:02:58.830> think<00:02:59.100> it's<00:02:59.460> about<00:02:59.820> taking<00:03:00.210> things

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
you'd think it's about taking things

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.480 
you'd think it's about taking things
away<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:00.690> often<00:03:01.200> it's<00:03:01.320> giving<00:03:01.710> life<00:03:02.160> balance

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
away but often it's giving life balance

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.190 
away but often it's giving life balance
the<00:03:02.760> plate<00:03:02.970> oh<00:03:03.150> what<00:03:03.330> can<00:03:03.420> have<00:03:03.540> more<00:03:03.720> oh<00:03:03.930> yeah

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
the rhythm of every day becomes a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.490 
the rhythm of every day becomes a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.890 
day for two weeks I think it will change
the<00:03:34.260> way<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:34.410> cook<00:03:34.620> forever<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:36.000> think<00:03:36.030> you

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
will learn rhythms and techniques that

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.390 
will learn rhythms and techniques that

been<00:03:44.610> great<00:03:44.910> it's<00:03:45.330> been<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.690> best<00:03:45.840> thing<00:03:45.930> I've

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
been great it's been the best thing I've

been great it's been the best thing I've
ever<00:03:46.110> done<00:03:46.230> learning<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.160> nutrition<00:03:47.550> thing

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
ever done learning the nutrition thing

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.300 
ever done learning the nutrition thing
was<00:03:47.880> really<00:03:48.150> amazing<00:03:48.390> for<00:03:48.690> me<00:03:48.810> because<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.920> had
