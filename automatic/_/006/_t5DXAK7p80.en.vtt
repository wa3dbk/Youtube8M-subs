00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.050
 Retiring this word is so terrible because I believe you 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.730
 Judges Captain Hermann Petz died nice then is really 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.460

 at least as great as the love of the dog 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.070
 of course, is the love of playing the piano 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.040

 She also does not leave the university completely abandoned 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.690
 because she still has some students here 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.120
