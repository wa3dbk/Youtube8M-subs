00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.410
 Hello friends with you vulture and most 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.890
 frequently asked question lately 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.210
 this is what happened to the ranks supposedly we beat 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.099
 thresh a bunch of missions and things are there 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.140
 having rummaged in English-speaking forums I 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.110
 found the story of one pilot in which he 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.620
 shared with other players considerations 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.290
 about this this text is free 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.530
 translation of this topic by me therefore 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.199
 don't distract you i won't 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.809
 to get involved in video series links to both topics 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.300
 the story of the boar pilots and strategies from 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.329
 pilot samosa from the official forum I 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.640
 threw in the video description 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.500
 I myself can not verify their loyalty 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.539
 reasoning but the topic is full 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.210
 confirmation from pilots so 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:10.570
 roughly she is so our hero playing with 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.909
 April to release 1.3 received Baron 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.850
 empire and post commanders federation 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.510
 especially a lot of mission did not rank 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.570
 fell for every 10 20 missions with exit 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.600
 1.3 he over the weekend got the duke in 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.010
 empire and then went out alone. 301 and 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.840
 progress stopped he played almost 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.600
 month performing 10 20 combat 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.090
 fractional missions per day but his rank is not 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.000
 grew up not in a non federation empire 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.850
 it strained the boar pilot and he wrote 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.970
 support service to look 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.460
 given by his account there u answered that 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.380
 there is some hidden parameter faction 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.750
 experience which is responsible for 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.580
 availability of ranked missions and reported 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.720
 the value of this parameter for its 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.270
 account value of this parameter lies 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.070
 for pilots ranging from zero to one hundred 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.070
 for each of the fraction where 100 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.379
 corresponds to the maximum rank this 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.479
 parameter grows from all actions of pilots 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.500
 favor of major fraction similar 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.840
 reputation but depending on reputation 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.550
 does not depend on it does not decrease if 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.060
 do nothing that is he just 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.209
 accumulates 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.830
 the third spider pilot has developed one model 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.690
 how they did it I do not know count 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.930
 and yet by some miracle I'm not in this 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.180
 digging absolutely means a table for it 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.280
 you see on the screen which calculated 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.250
 how much of this parameter is needed for each 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.819
 next rank and data obtained 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.580
 boar and 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.160
 from support fit into it in this 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.170
 model of the commune screwed to this table 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.410
 number of charity missions 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.019
 How much should be done in his opinion to 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.349
 get the next rank 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.569
 from current this is the last column 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.579
 before the last column this figure is from 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.920
 number of charity pilots 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.890
 missions that they performed for 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.920
 goto rank maybe there weren't 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.260
 only charity mission from so 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.110
 how different pilots performed these missions 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.049
 there means several meanings 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.900
 the ones that the boar has as you see for 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.280
 last two or three ranks figures 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.500
 charity missions are equal 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.410
 a few hundred now some more 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.600
 theories to earn points 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.950
 These fiction experience necessary 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.200
 do any missions 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.190
 from minor fractions associated with the empire 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.560
 and the federation can also trade on 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.380
 stations owned by such a minor 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.470
 fractions can be rewarded for 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.500
 criminals however guys note that 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.639
 although any actions are taken into account 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.799
 feeling that 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.840
 trade and bounty for criminals 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.060
 their contribution is not always correct 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.400
 very small therefore 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.560
 advise doing missions first 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.900
 and from the mission is recommended first 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.349
 take missions to charity 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:09.970
 because all you need is right there 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:11.799
 pass some money roughly calculated 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.810
 what's one point faction experience 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.849
 turns out in about 30 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.130
 charity missions that is 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.459
 for about 300 thousand donated 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.680
 credit reputation hold ally not 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.669
 necessarily bonuses to 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.890
 Allies or not 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.140
 the main thing is not to be hostile but here 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.030
 for the mission itself is required 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.800
 at least friends 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.680
 on reputation the pilot herself creates 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.990
 The following recommendations for pumping take 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.420
 missions only from minor factions 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.880
 associated with an empire or a federation 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.600
 these are the fractions of the system about which 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.900
 there is an icon 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.380
 now and either federation switch 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.510
 between solo modes and experience will 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.020
 updated bulletin board and will 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.090
 new reputation charity mission 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.370
 and influences are not related to military 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.220
 rank ignore them i mean i understand 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.160
 You can find a system with several 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.290
 imperial factions and help immediately 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.240
 taking all these imperial factions 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.920
 charity missions for everyone 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.920
 immediately imperial factions 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.350
 a charitable mission requires an average 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.850
 10,000 donations for the mission and that 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.250
 means that for top ranks you need 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.590
 several million drain on 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.420
 charity for every rank 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.460
 do other missions in parallel 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.440
 only charities they will also 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.510
 increase your points fiction experience 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.660
 all of the above does not differ much 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:49.290
 with my past tips from 17 in my 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.630
 news release or from 19 on leveling 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.520
 rank in the empire is true I advised 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.430
 do missions from only one of the factions 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.470
 systems and of course wildly increased 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.840
 number of missions for top ranks 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.820
 that need to be done and in general 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.010
 generally 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.810
 so fly carry money do 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.840
 missions i hope you all have 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.850
 turn out if someone as a result 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.850
 This guide will match the values ​​at least 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.830
 even starting with minimal missions 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.480
 post in the comments to my 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.340
 other pilots knew that this thing 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.160
 works 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.320
 I hope that in the near future they will add 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.360
 or an indicator of the ranks of military missions or 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.030
 along the way will cheer the player 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.310
 some sort of message because of course 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:36.510
 do a few hundred missions don't know in 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.280
 tule that side you move it hard on 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.130
 that's all 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.590
 I wish you a good flight by yourself long 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.360
 who managed to grab off the rank of king in 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.050
 Empire before it is spun 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.199
 parsley 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:53.569
 and the rank of the federation I, in general, and not myself 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:53.569
 I want to get all the guys good luck
