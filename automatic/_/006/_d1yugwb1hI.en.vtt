in<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.930> sketchup<00:00:16.410> tutorial<00:00:17.040> i<00:00:17.220> want<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.520> go

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
in this sketchup tutorial i want to go

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.540 
in this sketchup tutorial i want to go
over<00:00:18.090> how<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.390> use<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.960> push/pull<00:00:19.320> tool<00:00:19.650> so

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
over how you use the push/pull tool so

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.460 
over how you use the push/pull tool so
in<00:00:20.670> previous<00:00:20.850> videos<00:00:21.390> i've<00:00:21.630> gone<00:00:21.779> over<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
in previous videos i've gone over the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.350 
in previous videos i've gone over the
line<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:23.099> all<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> rectangle<00:00:23.849> tool<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.119> how

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
line to all the rectangle tool and how

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.150 
line to all the rectangle tool and how
you<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.750> start<00:00:25.410> building<00:00:25.470> things<00:00:25.920> up<00:00:26.040> in

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
you can start building things up in

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.370 
you can start building things up in
three<00:00:26.310> dimensions<00:00:26.790> but<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.750> actually<00:00:27.990> use

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
three dimensions but we can actually use

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.529 
three dimensions but we can actually use
this<00:00:28.710> tool<00:00:29.009> right<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:30.000> push-pull<00:00:30.510> tool

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
this tool right here the push-pull tool

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.979 
this tool right here the push-pull tool
to<00:00:31.500> actually<00:00:32.030> do<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> lot<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.449> work<00:00:33.540> for<00:00:33.870> us

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
to actually do a lot of that work for us

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.420 
to actually do a lot of that work for us
so<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.170> don't<00:00:34.199> have<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.500> construct<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.980> by<00:00:35.010> hand

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
so we don't have to construct it by hand

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.000 
so we don't have to construct it by hand
what<00:00:36.210> I'm<00:00:36.330> gonna<00:00:37.019> start<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
what I'm gonna start with is just a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.380 
what I'm gonna start with is just a
plain<00:00:38.250> rectangle<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:38.910> we're<00:00:39.030> gonna<00:00:39.120> draw

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
plain rectangle and we're gonna draw

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.080 
plain rectangle and we're gonna draw
that<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.050> ground<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:41.070> gonna<00:00:41.190> start<00:00:41.730> in

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
that on the ground so I'm gonna start in

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.390 
that on the ground so I'm gonna start in
between<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.750> red<00:00:43.080> and<00:00:43.410> green<00:00:43.680> axis<00:00:44.160> here

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
between this red and green axis here

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.510 
between this red and green axis here
just<00:00:45.269> click<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.690> pull<00:00:45.870> my<00:00:45.960> mouse<00:00:46.170> out<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.860> I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
just click and pull my mouse out and I

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.450 
just click and pull my mouse out and I
will<00:00:47.670> make<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> 10<00:00:48.239> foot<00:00:48.600> by<00:00:49.170> 10<00:00:49.649> foot<00:00:51.110> square

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
will make a 10 foot by 10 foot square

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.930 
will make a 10 foot by 10 foot square
when<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.489> do<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:54.059> what<00:00:54.570> I've<00:00:54.719> created<00:00:54.960> is

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
when I do that what I've created is

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.369 
when I do that what I've created is
essentially<00:00:56.940> an<00:00:57.030> object<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.570> five<00:00:57.899> parts

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
essentially an object with five parts

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.130 
essentially an object with five parts
have<00:00:58.590> four<00:00:58.890> edges<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.760> face<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.930> want<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
have four edges and a face if I want to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.200 
have four edges and a face if I want to
select<00:01:01.289> any<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.800> those<00:01:01.950> I<00:01:02.219> need<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.640> go<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
select any of those I need to go up and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
select any of those I need to go up and
grab<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.570> black<00:01:03.840> selection<00:01:04.440> tool<00:01:04.619> or<00:01:04.860> hit<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
each edge or the face and I know the

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.170 
each edge or the face and I know the
face<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.590> active<00:01:14.009> when<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.190> has<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.820> sort<00:01:15.090> of

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.580 
shaded dot pattern on it if I want to
pull<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.830> up<00:01:20.040> into<00:01:20.250> 3d<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.880> make<00:01:21.060> an<00:01:21.210> actual

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
pull this up into 3d and make an actual

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.800 
pull this up into 3d and make an actual
shape<00:01:22.590> out<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.420> come

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and grab my push-pull or I can use P as

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.130 
and grab my push-pull or I can use P as
a<00:01:28.020> keyboard<00:01:28.680> shortcut<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.360> will<00:01:30.360> click<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.780> this

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
a keyboard shortcut I will click on this

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.920 
a keyboard shortcut I will click on this
face<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.090> simply<00:01:33.210> click<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.689> let

cute alright and now we have something

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.370 
cute alright and now we have something
that's<00:01:46.909> three-dimensional<00:01:48.020> we<00:01:49.020> could<00:01:49.290> have

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
that's three-dimensional we could have

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.200 
that's three-dimensional we could have
made<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.770> more<00:01:50.009> interesting<00:01:50.490> while<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.150> were

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
made this more interesting while we were

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.640 
made this more interesting while we were
drawing<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.810> ground<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> more

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
drawing it on the ground to have a more

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.950 
drawing it on the ground to have a more
unique<00:01:53.009> shape<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:54.030> one<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> beautiful

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
unique shape but one of the beautiful

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.770 
unique shape but one of the beautiful
things<00:01:55.140> about<00:01:55.409> Sketchup<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:57.030> really

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
things about Sketchup is that you really

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.960 
things about Sketchup is that you really
have<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.170> fluid<00:01:58.649> process<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.490> can<00:01:59.700> you

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
have this fluid process that you can you

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.179 
have this fluid process that you can you
know<00:02:00.060> come<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.600> go<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:00.990> keep<00:02:01.500> drawing<00:02:01.860> things

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
know come and go and keep drawing things

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.550 
know come and go and keep drawing things
on<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.820> surface<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.020> work<00:02:04.290> so

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
on the surface as you as you work so

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.850 
on the surface as you as you work so
it's<00:02:04.680> not<00:02:04.860> you're<00:02:05.850> not<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.090> stuck<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.380> might

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
it's not you're not so stuck so I might

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.859 
it's not you're not so stuck so I might
go<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.100> grab<00:02:08.280> my<00:02:08.429> pencil<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.090> divide<00:02:09.509> this

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
go and grab my pencil and divide this

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.890 
go and grab my pencil and divide this
shape<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.769> a<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:11.070> bit<00:02:11.390> when<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.420> have<00:02:12.660> my

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
shape up a little bit when I have my

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.410 
shape up a little bit when I have my
line<00:02:13.320> tool<00:02:13.680> active<00:02:14.220> you'll<00:02:14.549> see<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.000> can

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
line tool active you'll see that I can

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.050 
line tool active you'll see that I can
basically<00:02:16.140> snap<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.130> any<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.430> these<00:02:17.549> edges

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
basically snap to any of these edges

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.410 
basically snap to any of these edges
these<00:02:18.390> lines<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.310> when<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> start<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.239> just

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
these lines and when I start to just

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.690 
these lines and when I start to just
right<00:02:21.720> along<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.200> edge<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.739> will<00:02:22.890> grab<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.550> it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
right along the edge it will grab to it

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.809 
right along the edge it will grab to it
and<00:02:23.879> be<00:02:24.000> read<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.690> means<00:02:24.900> I'm<00:02:25.080> on<00:02:25.290> that

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
and be read that just means I'm on that

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.140 
and be read that just means I'm on that
somewhere<00:02:26.450> when<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.290> get<00:02:27.499> to<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.650> corner<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.640> it

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
somewhere when I get to a corner and it

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.000 
somewhere when I get to a corner and it
snaps<00:02:29.510> pretty<00:02:29.780> hard<00:02:30.049> and<00:02:30.319> turns<00:02:30.499> green<00:02:30.799> that

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
snaps pretty hard and turns green that

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.729 
snaps pretty hard and turns green that
means<00:02:31.189> I'm<00:02:31.310> at<00:02:31.519> an<00:02:31.639> end<00:02:31.849> point<00:02:32.359> of<00:02:32.659> a<00:02:32.749> line<00:02:32.930> and

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
means I'm at an end point of a line and

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.679 
means I'm at an end point of a line and
if<00:02:34.219> I<00:02:34.310> come<00:02:34.489> along<00:02:34.639> you'll<00:02:35.239> see<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.540> it'll

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
if I come along you'll see that it'll

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.160 
if I come along you'll see that it'll
actually<00:02:35.810> snap<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.439> the<00:02:36.530> middle<00:02:36.859> as<00:02:37.189> well<00:02:38.139> so<00:02:39.139> I

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
actually snap to the middle as well so I

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.490 
actually snap to the middle as well so I
might<00:02:39.379> just<00:02:39.409> divide<00:02:39.889> this<00:02:41.170> surface<00:02:42.170> here<00:02:42.349> this

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
might just divide this surface here this

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.860 
might just divide this surface here this
face<00:02:42.799> up<00:02:43.099> in<00:02:43.250> half<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:43.909> I'll<00:02:44.000> just<00:02:44.180> click<00:02:44.450> here

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
face up in half so I'll just click here

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.140 
face up in half so I'll just click here
and<00:02:45.139> then<00:02:45.230> down<00:02:45.439> at<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.590> bottom<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:47.090> know

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
and then down at the bottom and I know

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.020 
and then down at the bottom and I know
that<00:02:47.480> I'm<00:02:47.659> perfectly<00:02:48.590> vertical<00:02:49.069> because<00:02:49.790> it's

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
that I'm perfectly vertical because it's

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.119 
that I'm perfectly vertical because it's
turning<00:02:50.299> blue<00:02:50.569> so<00:02:50.840> I'm<00:02:50.930> parallel<00:02:51.919> with<00:02:52.099> that

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
turning blue so I'm parallel with that

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.830 
turning blue so I'm parallel with that
blue<00:02:52.579> z-axis<00:02:53.389> so<00:02:53.629> I'll<00:02:54.530> click<00:02:55.659> hit<00:02:56.659> my

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
blue z-axis so I'll click hit my

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.659 
blue z-axis so I'll click hit my
spacebar<00:02:57.109> to<00:02:57.469> get<00:02:57.590> out<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:57.829> that<00:02:57.919> line<00:02:58.219> command

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669 
spacebar to get out of that line command

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.390 
spacebar to get out of that line command
and<00:02:59.000> now<00:02:59.359> I've<00:02:59.480> divided<00:02:59.870> this<00:03:00.230> face<00:03:00.889> up<00:03:01.129> into

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
and now I've divided this face up into

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.059 
and now I've divided this face up into
two<00:03:01.639> parts<00:03:01.939> I<00:03:02.329> can<00:03:02.840> see<00:03:03.109> that<00:03:03.319> if<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.650> click<00:03:03.680> on

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
two parts I can see that if I click on

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.189 
two parts I can see that if I click on
this<00:03:04.250> face<00:03:04.519> or<00:03:04.969> this<00:03:05.359> face<00:03:05.599> there<00:03:05.959> are<00:03:06.019> two

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:06.199 
this face or this face there are two

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:10.869 
this face or this face there are two
separate<00:03:06.620> sections<00:03:06.859> now<00:03:07.840> if<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:09.829> want<00:03:10.099> to<00:03:10.310> you

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
separate sections now if I want to you

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.459 
separate sections now if I want to you
know<00:03:11.000> make<00:03:11.180> more<00:03:11.359> of<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> unique<00:03:11.780> shape<00:03:12.079> there

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:12.469 
know make more of a unique shape there

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.369 
know make more of a unique shape there
I'll<00:03:12.769> use<00:03:13.040> my<00:03:13.069> push-pull<00:03:13.790> tool<00:03:14.019> click<00:03:15.019> on<00:03:15.139> this

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
I'll use my push-pull tool click on this

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.890 
I'll use my push-pull tool click on this
face<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.010> pull<00:03:16.519> out<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.299> could<00:03:17.540> say<00:03:17.719> that<00:03:17.870> I

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
face and pull out and I could say that I

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.990 
face and pull out and I could say that I
want<00:03:18.139> to<00:03:18.199> go<00:03:18.349> this<00:03:18.739> direction<00:03:18.889> five<00:03:19.609> feet

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
want to go this direction five feet

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.459 
want to go this direction five feet
enter<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.219> now<00:03:22.219> I<00:03:22.250> have<00:03:22.909> a<00:03:23.299> more<00:03:24.079> interesting

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:24.469 
enter and now I have a more interesting

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:29.110 
enter and now I have a more interesting
shape<00:03:24.889> than<00:03:25.099> the<00:03:25.159> cube<00:03:25.459> I<00:03:27.609> could<00:03:28.609> grab<00:03:28.849> this

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
shape than the cube I could grab this

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.920 
shape than the cube I could grab this
and<00:03:29.510> come<00:03:29.810> this<00:03:30.079> direction<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.370> go<00:03:32.030> three

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
and come this direction and go three

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.399 
and come this direction and go three
feet<00:03:33.199> enter<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:34.009> so<00:03:34.970> on<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.449> at<00:03:35.720> any<00:03:35.900> point<00:03:35.989> if

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
feet enter and so on and at any point if

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.349 
feet enter and so on and at any point if
I<00:03:36.530> want<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:37.009> divide<00:03:37.370> this<00:03:37.489> up<00:03:37.669> again<00:03:37.970> I<00:03:38.150> can

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
I want to divide this up again I can

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.099 
I want to divide this up again I can
simply<00:03:38.629> grab<00:03:38.750> my<00:03:38.959> pencil<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.799> start<00:03:40.609> drawing

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
simply grab my pencil and start drawing

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.179 
simply grab my pencil and start drawing
right<00:03:42.109> now<00:03:42.139> we're<00:03:42.409> keeping<00:03:42.709> it<00:03:42.799> simple<00:03:42.979> and

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189 
right now we're keeping it simple and

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:49.929 
right now we're keeping it simple and
just<00:03:43.400> doing<00:03:44.620> midpoints<00:03:48.609> we'll<00:03:49.609> get<00:03:49.759> into

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:49.939 
just doing midpoints we'll get into

00:03:49.939 --> 00:04:01.250 
just doing midpoints we'll get into
using<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.359> tape<00:03:50.569> measure<00:03:50.810> tool<00:03:51.729> later

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.350 

there<00:04:01.860> you<00:04:02.010> can<00:04:02.069> see<00:04:02.159> it's<00:04:02.400> very<00:04:02.459> easy<00:04:02.760> to

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
there you can see it's very easy to

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.940 
there you can see it's very easy to
manipulate<00:04:04.610> objects<00:04:05.610> in<00:04:05.730> Sketchup<00:04:06.650> based<00:04:07.650> on

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
manipulate objects in Sketchup based on

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.309 
manipulate objects in Sketchup based on
grabbing<00:04:08.700> their<00:04:08.819> faces<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.689> letting<00:04:10.230> the

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
grabbing their faces and letting the

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.569 
grabbing their faces and letting the
edges<00:04:10.650> do<00:04:10.829> all<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.099> work

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
edges do all the work

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.530 
edges do all the work
now<00:04:12.420> if<00:04:12.720> you've<00:04:12.930> accidentally<00:04:14.450> deleted<00:04:15.450> a

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
now if you've accidentally deleted a

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.789 
now if you've accidentally deleted a
face<00:04:15.750> if<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.049> select<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.620> hit<00:04:16.769> delete

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
face if I select that and hit delete

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.740 
face if I select that and hit delete
first<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:20.010> all<00:04:20.130> you'll<00:04:20.370> see<00:04:20.459> that<00:04:20.760> inside<00:04:21.359> it's

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
first of all you'll see that inside it's

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.000 
first of all you'll see that inside it's
actually<00:04:22.019> Hollow

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
actually Hollow

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.490 
actually Hollow
when<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:23.520> create<00:04:23.930> objects<00:04:24.930> in<00:04:25.050> Sketchup

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
when you create objects in Sketchup

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.159 
when you create objects in Sketchup
they're<00:04:26.340> hollow<00:04:26.699> and<00:04:27.150> you'll<00:04:27.750> see<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.050> the

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
they're hollow and you'll see that the

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.670 
they're hollow and you'll see that the
inside<00:04:28.979> of<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.910> faces<00:04:30.360> are<00:04:30.570> this<00:04:31.020> purple

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
inside of the faces are this purple

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.180 
inside of the faces are this purple
color<00:04:31.889> and<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.490> outsides<00:04:32.940> are<00:04:33.180> white<00:04:34.190> if

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
color and the outsides are white if

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.129 
color and the outsides are white if
you've<00:04:35.610> done<00:04:35.850> that<00:04:36.030> by<00:04:36.150> accident<00:04:36.180> or<00:04:36.900> you've

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
you've done that by accident or you've

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.330 
you've done that by accident or you've
created<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.500> shape<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:37.770> you<00:04:37.860> want<00:04:38.039> to<00:04:38.160> close

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
created a shape and you want to close

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.159 
created a shape and you want to close
that<00:04:38.580> in<00:04:38.789> there's<00:04:39.419> a<00:04:39.510> simple<00:04:39.840> little<00:04:39.930> trick

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
that in there's a simple little trick

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.320 
that in there's a simple little trick
you<00:04:40.289> can<00:04:40.380> use<00:04:40.770> you<00:04:41.310> can<00:04:41.340> grab<00:04:41.669> your<00:04:41.699> line<00:04:42.060> tool

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
you can use you can grab your line tool

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.700 
you can use you can grab your line tool
and<00:04:42.770> just<00:04:43.770> basically<00:04:44.460> redraw<00:04:45.300> one<00:04:46.260> of<00:04:46.500> these

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
and just basically redraw one of these

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.550 
and just basically redraw one of these
edges<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.580> when<00:04:48.389> you<00:04:48.510> do<00:04:48.750> Sketchup<00:04:49.530> will

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
edges and when you do Sketchup will

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.610 
edges and when you do Sketchup will
close<00:04:50.340> in<00:04:50.669> that<00:04:51.030> shape<00:04:51.330> for<00:04:51.570> you<00:04:51.660> again<00:04:51.900> so<00:04:52.169> if

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
close in that shape for you again so if

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.620 
close in that shape for you again so if
you<00:04:52.949> end<00:04:53.250> up<00:04:53.490> with<00:04:53.789> you<00:04:54.120> know<00:04:54.210> big<00:04:54.389> hole

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
you end up with you know big hole

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.330 
you end up with you know big hole
somewhere<00:04:55.229> something<00:04:55.500> slit<00:04:55.889> something<00:04:56.250> like

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
somewhere something slit something like

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.189 
somewhere something slit something like
that's<00:04:56.550> happen<00:04:56.970> if<00:04:57.120> you<00:04:57.210> just<00:04:57.389> redraw<00:04:57.780> one<00:04:58.050> of

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
that's happen if you just redraw one of

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.800 
that's happen if you just redraw one of
those<00:04:58.380> edges<00:04:59.039> you'll<00:05:00.030> be<00:05:00.180> good<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.479> go

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
those edges you'll be good to go

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.540 
those edges you'll be good to go
so<00:05:01.289> that's<00:05:01.470> using<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.979> push-pull<00:05:02.520> tool

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
so that's using the push-pull tool

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.060 
so that's using the push-pull tool
keyboard<00:05:03.449> shortcut<00:05:04.020> P<00:05:04.320> to<00:05:04.740> create
