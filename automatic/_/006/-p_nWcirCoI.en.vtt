00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 mind all ragas are creepy buti 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.730
 this new video we are back today 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.779
 with the coaching career always with the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.790
 barsa b 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.380
 missing two games for play offs for 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.330
 go up in liga bbva by now 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.840
 mathematically we are in but 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.529
 unfortunately we cannot even matia 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.070
 mathematically go up in liga bbva 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.660
 you are directly seeing the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.070
 highlights of the first match 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.529
 today we're going to see you gone that 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.550
 return of the first play off however first 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.840
 we naturally have the first two 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.640
 end-of-season matches the first against 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.020
 the dawn immediately looked very dangerous 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.460
 bones think that the most opportunities have 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.350
 committed our goalkeeper then there 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.870
 puts a piece instead of his 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.160
 goalkeeper on this conclusion of al 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.530
 instead he can't find the goal 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.000
 we are at the second time 64 minutes cross 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.850
 at the center here is a waste of time 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.250
 really great head 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.629
 the attacking opponent then tries with 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.910
 this title is not very precise 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.440
 but also on this occasion goalkeeper 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.600
 opponent is engaged then watch 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.190
 at minute 87 a fantastic ball for 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.860
 length faq here comes however the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.960
 miracle of the extreme defender that me 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.930
 denies the advantage will end just like that 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.140
 deportivo alavés 0 barsa of zero then 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.500
 for last league game that not 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.009
 they must draw the last one instead 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.090
 we will play at home against the leganés 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.920
 let's play with our usual 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.299
 training even if you see 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.540
 later also in the episodes 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.430
 later that we will have several problems 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.110
 physical with different players than a lot 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.880
 probably they got very tired 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.560
 also because I made few changes where 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.150
 be honest throughout the series 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.310
 so let's say the training is 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.380
 had always been pretty equal had 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.840
 made however changes only ed 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.460
 exclusively to game started on TV on 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.220
 those halilovic is our company 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.060
 which brings us a lot of advantage 20 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.040
 instead we try the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.360
 lega nation this opportunity is not 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.829
 still over here because still at 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.680
 end of the first half look here 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.720
 unfortunately the uncertainty comes, however 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.670
 dimitru scheme that gives 1 to 1 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.470
 then a draw established by the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.149
 my opponent still believes in it 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.740
 very much look at the ball here 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.289
 fantastic for test bodies coming out of 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.899
 very little to the side of the goalkeeper we are 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.760
 instead at this time in possession of 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.190
 ball arrives a few months later 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.989
 fantastic action length faq that 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.120
 serves his Roman companion on the feet and 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.510
 arrives the goal of 2 to 1 will end up like this 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.370
 match 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.209
 therefore we conclude with a very great one 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.370
 let's win our championship 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.870
 to challenge instead in the first game of 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.080
 play off 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.549
 the match logo that sees us initially 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.200
 away from home so we went 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:43.120
 of course words choose the shirts 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.410
 and to play with doom safak less e 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.620
 other players I can't remember now 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.269
 center of attack for if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.040
 bicio seems to me like this 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.320
 but immediately the goal of the advantage arrives 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.239
 at the tenth minute of adama on this 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.010
 perfect launch comes the stop then the 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.600
 conclusion that sometimes advantage our 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.239
 then look here at Rome in the greatest 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.430
 number in the left lane again 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.750
 of head from but very dangerous but it arrives 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.670
 the miracle of the goalkeeper from the second 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.560
 time will come the 66 minute opportunity with 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.810
 this grimaldo conclusion that 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.840
 we barely touch the crossbar 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.000
 double up and look at the lugo instead 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.310
 risks taking one on one 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.780
 marina mit ruskin redeeming the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.269
 previous game where he had performed 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.000
 that uncertainty in finding new instead 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:29.019
 bicio substitute of doom safak door i 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.959
 ours on the 2 0 then we go to score 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.609
 another very important goal that will be 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.620
 essential in the return match 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.160
 just because away goals are worth 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.769
 double 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.109
 let's finally see the last one 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:45.220
 Today's game the return of play off 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:47.590
 raga and our opponent will always be 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.130
 naturally the long but we will play in 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.500
 home 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.200
 lugo who takes his own advantage 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.609
 like we did the first few minutes 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.740
 of the game as we did 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.510
 in the outward journey but ours don't give up 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.530
 they arrive immediately very dangerous 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.630
 in the opposing area with this one 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.550
 conclusion that he is president parry 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.170
 from there on the line aside from a 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.760
 opponent defender and puts us here 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.310
 another piece the doorman but look 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.190
 roman the first crossbar to hit 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.050
 but it won't be so finished because you look 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.840
 a few minutes later he again crosses 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.850
 still rom that headed this today 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.300
 own game there is no long throw for 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.100
 room that puts it down very well arrives 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.180
 the conclusion look a little at what it is 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.120
 eats blatantly but at 75 minutes yes 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.730
 presents on the disk Roman cannot 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.250
 absolutely wrong so it pulls one 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.440
 conclusion that pierces the goalkeeper and 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.480
 carries in itself 1 to 1 goal that has us 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.330
 given the certainty of being 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.790
 in the past it will be just so we are 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.500
 to the last game always gone e 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.820
 return of the play offs 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.350

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.670
