watch other people play it and as I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.080 
watch other people play it and as I
watched<00:01:40.890> them<00:01:41.100> play<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.400> I've<00:01:41.670> seen<00:01:41.939> them

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
watched them play it I've seen them

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.580

discover<00:01:42.509> frustrating<00:01:43.110> bugs<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
discover frustrating bugs and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.679 
discover frustrating bugs and
frustrating<00:01:43.979> things<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.420> annoyances<00:01:45.420> and

frustrating things and annoyances and
issues<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.680> stuff<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.700> I

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
issues and and stuff like that so I

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.080 
issues and and stuff like that so I
thought<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.149> was<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> fairly<00:01:48.570> easy<00:01:48.899> bet<00:01:49.820> but<00:01:50.820> if

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
thought it was a fairly easy bet but if

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.149 
thought it was a fairly easy bet but if
you<00:01:51.180> want<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.540> know<00:01:51.689> my<00:01:51.960> actual<00:01:52.560> opinion<00:01:53.009> ah

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
you want to know my actual opinion ah

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.510 
you want to know my actual opinion ah
it's<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:54.420> even<00:01:54.840> grimmer<00:01:55.170> than<00:01:55.399> Francis's<00:01:56.399> in

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
it's a even grimmer than Francis's in

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.630 
it's a even grimmer than Francis's in
some<00:01:56.759> ways<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:58.020> only<00:01:58.590> played<00:01:58.950> elder<00:01:59.310> scrolls

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
some ways I only played elder scrolls

some ways I only played elder scrolls
sparingly<00:02:00.420> I've<00:02:00.750> leveled<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.530> character<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
sparingly I've leveled a character up to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.389 
sparingly I've leveled a character up to
12<00:02:02.790> about<00:02:03.119> twice<00:02:03.479> um<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.680> did<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.979> once<00:02:05.189> during

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
12 about twice um I did it once during

12 about twice um I did it once during
beta<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.240> did<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.509> once<00:02:06.689> on<00:02:06.810> live<00:02:07.049> I

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
beta and then I did it once on live I

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.100 
beta and then I did it once on live I
did<00:02:08.369> not<00:02:08.520> find<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> game<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.660> particularly

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
did not find the game to be particularly

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.710 
did not find the game to be particularly
mold<00:02:10.890> breaking<00:02:11.400> or<00:02:11.610> particularly<00:02:12.000> innovative

well<00:02:15.060> done<00:02:15.379> but<00:02:16.379> then<00:02:16.530> I'm<00:02:16.739> also<00:02:17.010> kind<00:02:17.519> of<00:02:17.670> over

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
well done but then I'm also kind of over

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.080 
well done but then I'm also kind of over
mmo's<00:02:18.659> right<00:02:18.930> now<00:02:19.109> all<00:02:19.890> mmo's<00:02:20.519> seem<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.939> have

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
mmo's right now all mmo's seem to have

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.699 
mmo's right now all mmo's seem to have
one<00:02:21.420> problem<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.469> general<00:02:23.659> they<00:02:24.659> suck<00:02:24.900> they're

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
one problem in general they suck they're

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.039 
one problem in general they suck they're
generally<00:02:26.219> unfinished<00:02:26.939> unbaked<00:02:27.510> products

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
generally unfinished unbaked products

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.229 
generally unfinished unbaked products
that<00:02:28.439> are<00:02:28.560> pushed<00:02:28.769> out<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:28.980> door<00:02:29.239> halfway

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
that are pushed out the door halfway

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.910 
that are pushed out the door halfway
through<00:02:30.480> funding<00:02:30.870> halfway<00:02:31.290> through<00:02:31.530> coding

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
through funding halfway through coding

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.160 
through funding halfway through coding
so<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:32.549> we<00:02:32.879> can<00:02:33.150> deal<00:02:33.329> with<00:02:33.359> the<00:02:33.569> beta<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.049> we

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
so that we can deal with the beta and we

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.849 
so that we can deal with the beta and we
can<00:02:34.319> pay<00:02:34.500> for<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.329> and<00:02:36.329> to<00:02:37.140> do<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.590> with

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
can pay for it and and to do that with

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.319 
can pay for it and and to do that with
Elder<00:02:38.129> Scrolls<00:02:38.459> online<00:02:38.579> and<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.030> think<00:02:39.209> is<00:02:39.299> a

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
Elder Scrolls online and I think is a

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.690 
Elder Scrolls online and I think is a
huge<00:02:39.569> mistake<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:41.040> do<00:02:41.099> feel<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.579> that

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
huge mistake and I do feel that that

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.879 
huge mistake and I do feel that that
game<00:02:41.909> is<00:02:42.060> not<00:02:42.209> complete<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.019> think<00:02:43.500> most<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.799> the

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
game is not complete I think most of the

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.050 
game is not complete I think most of the
people<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.159> have<00:02:44.250> played<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.549> will<00:02:44.700> say<00:02:44.909> that

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
people that have played it will say that

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.699 
people that have played it will say that
it's<00:02:45.180> certainly<00:02:45.450> not<00:02:45.720> complete<00:02:46.139> and<00:02:46.379> I<00:02:46.650> know

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
it's certainly not complete and I know

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.140 
it's certainly not complete and I know
that<00:02:47.040> we're<00:02:47.129> looking<00:02:47.430> at<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.639> gaming<00:02:47.819> around

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
that we're looking at the gaming around

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.309 
that we're looking at the gaming around
for<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.299> next<00:02:48.480> two<00:02:48.540> or<00:02:48.569> three<00:02:48.689> or<00:02:48.870> four<00:02:48.989> years

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.050 
for the next two or three or four years
and<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:50.010> they're<00:02:50.430> going<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.609> continue<00:02:50.760> add

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
and that they're going to continue add

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.789 
and that they're going to continue add
content<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.569> continue<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.959> do<00:02:52.049> stuff<00:02:52.290> but

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
content and continue to do stuff but

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.399

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
all this basic stuff that we take for

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.149 
all this basic stuff that we take for

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.539 
granted when we play World of Warcraft
that's<00:04:02.909> the<00:04:03.239> baseline<00:04:03.750> for<00:04:04.199> a<00:04:04.229> new<00:04:04.349> MMO<00:04:04.829> they

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
that's the baseline for a new MMO they

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.780 
that's the baseline for a new MMO they
have<00:04:05.849> to<00:04:06.150> do<00:04:06.419> better<00:04:06.959> than<00:04:07.739> World<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.280> Warcraft
