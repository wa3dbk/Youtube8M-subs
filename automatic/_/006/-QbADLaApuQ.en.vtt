00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hi guys, how are you? Welcome to our 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.710
 youtube channel of our blog on gringa 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.260
 Today's video is coming to you. 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.620
 a cool tip I think 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.619
 You'll like it, there's a lot of people who 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.420
 come to las vegas and would love to do 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.510
 helicopter ride las vegas like 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.180
 White is this tour in fact 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.830
 they run a little expensive okay and there 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.890
 several companies in the market offering 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.140
 this tour leaving las vegas to the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.540
 and you can see a variety of 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.660
 prices from $ 450 to $ 600 per 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.879
 person and on my last visit in grand 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.550
 canyon and I ended up discovering an option 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.350
 very cool and much cheaper to 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.750
 power of this kind of walk there 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.700
 It's in November when my friends, 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.399
 were still here we take a little jump 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.809
 There I was and I took them there. 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.750
 boys really wanted to do this 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.270
 helicopter ride is only that was 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.250
 It's expensive, I still told you. 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.120
 that las vegas is there and there 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.890
 grand canyon 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.589
 we went to look at the packages and they 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.960
 offer out of the antone itself 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.180
 I think they have 4 314 companies 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.990
 who take a helicopter ride through 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 right there 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.490
 there you have two options and if you have option 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.130
 only fly over the grand canyon for 130 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.479
 dollars plus tax and this tour lasted 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.939
 35 minutes 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.650
 or you can make the option to fly over 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.930
 grand canyon send there in the middle of 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.909
 helicopter after being up to the colorado 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.310
 will get a boat to walk one 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.920
 Little by the river and then back there 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.810
 because the $ 180 was this 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.159
 the ride that my friends did 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.770
 they loved it 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.880
 The tour lasts an hour from us and I 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.850
 I think it is very worthwhile is a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.420
 huge price difference to 180 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.060
 450 dollars is just saved 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.360
 and enjoy las vegas at shows 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.670
 shopping whatever you want ok then 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.090
 so I found it very cool 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.250
 They liked it very much and then you have it. 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.719
 the option of returning from the tour of 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.240
 helicopter you can buy another one 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.490
 package for 45 dollars 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.469
 There you pick up the bus and walk in there. 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.840
 the park you notice that not by 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.160
 top take the photo 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.280
 they take you two points 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.630
 many different 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.030
 And you can stay as long as you 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.530
 You want to have 101 buses coming and going all 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.319
 Once I go in the grand canyon I went there 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.250
 a four five times nor land is me 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.140
 I do this tour, it's wonderful who 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.330
 is in las vegas have to make a leap 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.950
 It takes a while to get there. 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.290
 do that kind of ride that will stay 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.030
 forever in your memory, people are 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.860
 a national party that I think all 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.080
 world coming in state avoid party 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.810
 try to enjoy the great it is very 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.239
 large then it covers some states 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.150
 and the one that is in the state of Arizona that 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.670
 the motto with snowfall is the grand canyon 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.610
 west and is coordinated by a tribe 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.550
 calling father called roll 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.220
 you will observe the Indians have bishop 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.110
 and it's really cool even people are worth it 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.959
 And for those who want, there's also that 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.030
 platform the skywalk you walks can 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.950
 observe what she gave metal 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.160
 I did not find anything else to do. 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.440
 architecture is undoubtedly a huge 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.300
 beautiful but you can not take your 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.860
 camera thing and such and if it has to pay 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.130
 so the photos are always a 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.799
 way they end up arranging 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.530
 You always have to pay a little more. 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:26.019
 and for me, I enjoy being the great genius. 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.720
 When it 's the way there, take the 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.370
 my photos where the silence from there is 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.959
 something like that energy is one thing 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.560
 wonderful and I think everyone has 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.700
 that's my opinion 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.209
 so if you want to take a walk 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.859
 with the 180 dollars to fly over the canyon 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.380
 for an hour do this tour of 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.090
 helicopter and then pay another 45 to 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.370
 walking by can think is worth a lot 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.700
 worth us is a thing without 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.560
 doubt that it will be unforgettable that 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.570
 You will have wonderful beautiful photos. 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.690
 and the whiteness is undoubtedly a 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.100
 that it is worth knowing the 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.650
 my friends actually only made one 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.170
 Helicopter ride they were not is 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.670
 take this bus tour and you can 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.980
 you have an idea of ​​what the big 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.430
 genius even then so is the tip 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.530
 I hope you have enjoyed it, and for 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.930
 Who was in Vegas and want to know one? 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.329
 A little more actually the tour the 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.250

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.210
 I also told you on the blog there to 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.000
 You have several tourist attractions. 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.930
 so you can stop taking picture is too much 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.240

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.979
 there when you enter the 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.139

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.639

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.930
 you get in the middle of the way the 15 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.970
 minutes of gravel road 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.470
 You're going to get a lot of dust a lot because 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.240
 There's a lot of car traffic there. 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.759
 people who are going to visit the great genius 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.680
 so we'll stay as soon as we get 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.509
 convertible people do not even think that it will not 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.310
 give to stay like it is when the top 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.289

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.569

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.370

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.130
 You already enter the park all
