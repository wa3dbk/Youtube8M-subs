my<00:01:06.450> suggestion<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.890> lower<00:01:08.100> half

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
my suggestion is on the lower half

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.370 
my suggestion is on the lower half
section<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.479> same<00:01:09.750> pocket<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
section we have that same pocket on the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.770 
section we have that same pocket on the
inside<00:01:10.500> as<00:01:11.070> well<00:01:11.369> which<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.240> where<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.630> want

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
inside as well which is where you want

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.090 
inside as well which is where you want
to<00:01:12.840> put<00:01:12.990> your<00:01:13.080> water<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.470> your<00:01:13.650> heavy<00:01:13.860> gear

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
half to keep that weight against your

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.609

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
waist with that divider we took that a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.749 
waist with that divider we took that a
step<00:01:22.229> further<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.920> year<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.280> actually<00:01:23.400> made
