so now you fold this in like this and

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.360 
so now you fold this in like this and
there's<00:04:36.140> already<00:04:36.320> a<00:04:36.500> creased<00:04:36.830> there<00:04:37.040> from<00:04:37.220> one

there's already a creased there from one
you<00:04:37.490> made<00:04:37.640> earlier<00:04:38.410> and<00:04:39.430> then<00:04:40.430> do<00:04:41.150> that<00:04:41.210> with

possible okay then you take these these

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.410 
possible okay then you take these these
corners<00:04:54.190> fold<00:04:55.190> them<00:04:55.400> in<00:04:55.550> this<00:04:55.970> will<00:04:56.150> make<00:04:56.240> the

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
corners fold them in this will make the

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.680
