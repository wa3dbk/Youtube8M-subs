00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:08.069
 so today a video on the installation 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.710
 a clutch of sa2 karl 50 or the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.179
 older swallow engines and maybe 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.710
 you can see it a bit of a quality 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.650
 I have a new camera 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.609
 worried about the whole thing to the movie 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.320
 Let's see how it works 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.949
 or how the pictures are then 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.369
 there can be synonymous then finally 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.050
 come opinion 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.050
 if this is so ok 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.100
 yes hello dear silver driver friends and 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.199
 june about bad i have one 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.300
 new camera worried because the old one 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.620
 hopes to get a bit years 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.409
 was and the pictures are not so nice 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.750
 were and also had the problem 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.320
 that the batteries are pretty fast all 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.600
 and then you had to new ones 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.090
 get that was very annoying because of that 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.869
 I have a canon powershot 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.140
 worried times look like the pictures are 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.179
 and today systematically around the sa2 engine 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.220
 go 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:22.520
 the cultivation of the clutch that is yes 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.020
 the usa 250 engines or even the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.210
 Swabian motors of the fall 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.200
 that are yes this coupling with 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.909
 four such feathers here tell me 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 built and these errors and press 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.209
 then, so to speak, this clutch together 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.429
 that is often very difficult for them 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:41.600
 are under a lot of pressure and that is 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.659
 always a thing to expand that 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.310
 so a little tip from me you if 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.450
 you have the special tool to me 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.289
 then you can help them by 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.049
 here you take a kombizange sets the 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.380
 both end up in this and then 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.240
 Push the spring down so far 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.200
 you were, a pressed error 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.259
 has and then you can with the other 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.969
 then hand this pen back here 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.810
 install 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.399
 Of course, that's always the case 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.039
 a little tricky because that's two 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.810
 work this powerful once 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.630
 press the feather that is with the one 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.799
 hand so we take care a bit 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.630
 and then on the one hand the or 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.340
 On the other hand, this installation of this 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.709
 it will be installed again 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.329
 You have to watch this fine work 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.700
 you have to practice a bit but that 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.290
 should actually work and 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.880
 if you divulge that four on each one 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.370
 then made within this coupling 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.450
 then has first clutch again 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.280
 assembled 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.079
 So as I said with a kombizange 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.970
 on this press that this really 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.959
 a thaw and then use this pen 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.489
 and then that should be 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.260
 work there is also one 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.639
 special tools where to get the order down 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.660
 but I can press that myself 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.459
 also not available 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.609
 yes, I 've already done that several times 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.420
 with this method and that works 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.980
 actually pretty good 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.600
 ok otherwise as I said so netzer 2 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.980
 engine 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.170
 he has in principle for the 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.730
 simmeringer outside the rum one can 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.050
 actually very nice changes 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.200
 to make a knife two motor 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.400
 actually less the problem with 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.010
 motors that's the problem then 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.790
 the simmeringer sitting in the motor housing 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.340
 you have to split it and then immediately 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.380
 otherwise as I said a bit 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.510
 Pay attention to how the like this picture 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.160
 the camera is maybe mine 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.380
 leave rating if that's okay 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.730
 Above all, it is a bit pure so is 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.430
 actually a lot better than that 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.590
 the other camera I think 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.270
 you do not look very detailed too 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.510
 with nahaufnahmen actually works 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.910
 very good and the next videos will be 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.830
 then qualitatively better and there 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.460
 if you have it again then several 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.860
 to devote to topics 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.180
 yes, please also in the comments 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.710
 write any topic wishes 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.700
 or if I'm something else 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.630
 still to show 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.500
 then I can gladly record that 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.500
 I wish you a nice day
