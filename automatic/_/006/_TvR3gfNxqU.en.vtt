world champion match and time to reflect
on<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:08.220> first<00:00:08.519> two<00:00:08.730> games<00:00:09.650> well<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:10.860> far<00:00:10.920> we've

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
on the first two games well so far we've

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.020 
on the first two games well so far we've
had<00:00:11.280> two<00:00:11.910> relatively<00:00:12.870> short<00:00:13.410> draws<00:00:14.030> they've

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
had two relatively short draws they've

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.900 
had two relatively short draws they've
been<00:00:15.299> quite<00:00:15.900> tense<00:00:16.640> encounters<00:00:19.220> perhaps<00:00:20.220> not

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
been quite tense encounters perhaps not

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.200 
been quite tense encounters perhaps not
to<00:00:21.150> everyone's<00:00:21.600> taste<00:00:22.130> personally<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.340> found

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
to everyone's taste personally I found

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.769 
to everyone's taste personally I found
them<00:00:24.330> rather<00:00:24.570> deep<00:00:26.119> there's<00:00:27.119> been<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.539> a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
them rather deep there's been as a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.269 
them rather deep there's been as a
dynamic<00:00:28.289> equilibrium<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:30.000> maintained<00:00:30.660> and

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
dynamic equilibrium was maintained and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.180 
dynamic equilibrium was maintained and
but<00:00:32.279> only<00:00:32.640> by<00:00:32.759> very<00:00:33.210> precise<00:00:33.840> play<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.620> uh

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
but only by very precise play if uh

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.520 
but only by very precise play if uh
neither<00:00:35.579> player<00:00:35.969> had<00:00:36.630> played<00:00:36.870> inaccurately

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
neither player had played inaccurately

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
neither player had played inaccurately
then<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> whole<00:00:38.129> thing<00:00:38.460> could<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.120> tipped

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
then the whole thing could have tipped

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.110 
then the whole thing could have tipped
over<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.530> think<00:00:40.800> we've<00:00:40.920> seen<00:00:41.250> much<00:00:41.579> longer

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
over and I think we've seen much longer

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.310 
over and I think we've seen much longer
games<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.899> very<00:00:43.559> very<00:00:43.680> tense<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.670> far<00:00:45.000> but

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
games so very very tense so far but

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.979 
games so very very tense so far but
clearly<00:00:46.320> not<00:00:46.700> to<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> taste<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.660> lot<00:00:48.809> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
clearly not to the taste of a lot of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.020 
clearly not to the taste of a lot of
chess<00:00:49.289> fans<00:00:49.590> around<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.160> world<00:00:50.219> who<00:00:50.789> are

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
chess fans around the world who are

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.160 
chess fans around the world who are
looking<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.449> more<00:00:51.840> exciting<00:00:52.530> encounters

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
looking for more exciting encounters

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
looking for more exciting encounters
it's<00:00:55.170> been<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> slow<00:00:55.829> burner<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.489> far<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.180> I'm

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it's been a slow burner so far but I'm

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.139 
it's been a slow burner so far but I'm
sure<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.170> match<00:00:58.379> will<00:00:58.770> catch<00:00:59.190> fire<00:00:59.219> at<00:00:59.879> some

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
sure the match will catch fire at some

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.389 
sure the match will catch fire at some
point<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.469> think<00:01:01.649> maybe<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.309> be

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
point but I think maybe it's to be

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.660 
point but I think maybe it's to be
expected<00:01:02.430> because<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.199> both<00:01:04.920> anand<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
expected because you know both anand and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.289 
expected because you know both anand and
Gelfand<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.420> very<00:01:06.600> even<00:01:07.610> temperaments<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.030> I

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
Gelfand have very even temperaments so I

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.640 
Gelfand have very even temperaments so I
think<00:01:09.420> we're<00:01:09.720> going<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.930> see<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.140> lot<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.380> this

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
think we're going to see a lot of this

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.609 
think we're going to see a lot of this
kind<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.010> chess<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> match<00:01:12.290> but<00:01:13.290> okay<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
kind of chess in the match but okay to

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.520 
kind of chess in the match but okay to
satisfy<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:15.090> bloodlust<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> lot<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.409> you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
satisfy the bloodlust of a lot of you

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.530 
satisfy the bloodlust of a lot of you
out<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.909> show<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.299> game

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
out there I'm going to show you a game

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.390 
out there I'm going to show you a game
from<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.110> board<00:01:19.259> champion<00:01:19.680> match<00:01:19.860> from<00:01:20.130> two

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
from the board champion match from two

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.820 
from the board champion match from two
years<00:01:20.640> ago<00:01:20.820> between<00:01:21.299> anand<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.320> topple<00:01:22.799> off

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
years ago between anand and topple off

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.010 
years ago between anand and topple off
now<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.670> was<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> very<00:01:23.970> different<00:01:24.659> kind<00:01:24.840> of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
now that was a very different kind of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.910 
now that was a very different kind of
encounter<00:01:25.700> where<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.299> had<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.540> par<00:01:27.990> love<00:01:28.259> who

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
encounter where you had to par love who

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.780 
encounter where you had to par love who
is<00:01:29.790> kind<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.299> bursting<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.020> energy<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.890> it's

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
is kind of bursting with energy and it's

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.280 
is kind of bursting with energy and it's
quite<00:01:33.030> an<00:01:33.180> erratic<00:01:33.720> player<00:01:33.990> sometimes

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
quite an erratic player sometimes

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.039 
quite an erratic player sometimes
absolutely<00:01:35.220> brilliant<00:01:35.600> but<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> next

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
absolutely brilliant but then the next

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.249 
absolutely brilliant but then the next
moment<00:01:37.400> playing<00:01:38.400> rather<00:01:39.119> poor<00:01:39.540> chess<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:40.020> well

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
moment playing rather poor chess as well

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.179 
moment playing rather poor chess as well
so<00:01:41.299> because<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:43.020> saw<00:01:43.290> some<00:01:43.560> very<00:01:43.920> very

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
so because of that we saw some very very

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.670 
so because of that we saw some very very
exciting<00:01:44.729> chess<00:01:45.000> indeed<00:01:45.450> let<00:01:46.320> me<00:01:46.439> show<00:01:46.649> you

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680

if the queen is just left there on its
own<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.510> only<00:02:23.690> needs<00:02:23.959> one<00:02:24.050> more<00:02:24.530> piece<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.160> it

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.110 
will be able to force a checkmate so
it's<00:02:28.100> vital<00:02:28.489> that<00:02:29.030> black<00:02:29.830> connects<00:02:30.830> with<00:02:31.819> his

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
it's vital that black connects with his

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.590 
it's vital that black connects with his
Queen<00:02:32.510> on<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.280> King<00:02:34.489> side<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.360> this

Queen on to the King side and and this

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.229 
Queen on to the King side and and this
is<00:02:35.750> really<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.170> theme<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.530> this<00:02:36.920> attack<00:02:37.310> if

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
is really the theme of this attack if

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.470 
is really the theme of this attack if
black<00:02:38.840> can<00:02:39.260> get<00:02:39.470> his<00:02:39.620> Queen<00:02:39.920> over<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:41.090> defend

black can get his Queen over to defend

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
black can get his Queen over to defend
then<00:02:42.140> White's<00:02:42.440> attack<00:02:42.800> will<00:02:43.040> come<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.430> nothing

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
then White's attack will come to nothing

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.759 
then White's attack will come to nothing
so<00:02:45.500> that's<00:02:46.370> why<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.150> Paula<00:02:47.660> played<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.500> pawn

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
so that's why to Paula played the pawn

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.360 
so that's why to Paula played the pawn
to<00:02:48.920> f6<00:02:49.510> he's<00:02:50.510> now<00:02:50.750> threatening<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.470> swing<00:02:51.950> his

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370

Queen<00:02:52.760> across<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:54.110> that<00:02:54.260> will<00:02:54.410> neutralize

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
Queen across and that will neutralize

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.930 
Queen across and that will neutralize
White's<00:02:56.030> queen<00:02:56.450> here<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:58.040> it's<00:02:58.190> vital<00:02:58.489> that

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
White's queen here so it's vital that

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.539 
White's queen here so it's vital that
Anand<00:02:59.870> reacts<00:03:00.440> very<00:03:00.830> quickly<00:03:01.190> in<00:03:01.430> this

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
Anand reacts very quickly in this

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.750 
Anand reacts very quickly in this
position<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:03.040> therefore<00:03:04.040> he<00:03:04.220> played<00:03:04.459> 'if

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
position and therefore he played 'if

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.640 
position and therefore he played 'if
I've<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.600> is<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.810> very<00:03:06.049> strong<00:03:06.410> move

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
indeed so he's simply threatening to

capture the wishbone C 6 therefore top

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.050

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
going to set you a little puzzle of

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.450 
going to set you a little puzzle of
course<00:06:02.260> you<00:06:02.440> can<00:06:02.590> always<00:06:03.240> pause<00:06:04.650> this<00:06:05.650> clip

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
course you can always pause this clip

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.350 
course you can always pause this clip
and<00:06:07.350> try<00:06:08.350> to<00:06:08.410> work<00:06:08.620> out<00:06:08.860> the<00:06:09.010> solution<00:06:09.520> so<00:06:10.000> this

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
and try to work out the solution so this

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.280 
and try to work out the solution so this
position<00:06:10.870> this<00:06:11.470> is<00:06:11.620> where<00:06:11.830> top<00:06:12.340> allah<00:06:13.290> took

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
position this is where top allah took

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.510 
position this is where top allah took
the<00:06:14.350> bishop<00:06:14.710> back<00:06:14.890> to<00:06:15.070> e4

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
the bishop back to e4

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.749 
the bishop back to e4
but<00:06:17.300> my<00:06:17.539> question<00:06:17.599> for<00:06:18.199> you<00:06:18.259> is<00:06:18.410> this<00:06:18.770> how

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 
but my question for you is this how

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.710 
but my question for you is this how
would<00:06:19.970> an<00:06:20.180> end<00:06:20.479> win<00:06:21.050> if<00:06:22.090> his<00:06:23.090> opponents<00:06:23.629> have

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
would an end win if his opponents have

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.439 
would an end win if his opponents have
played<00:06:23.960> Bishop<00:06:24.470> to<00:06:24.650> d5<00:06:25.370> which<00:06:25.789> looks<00:06:26.150> on<00:06:26.360> the

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 
played Bishop to d5 which looks on the

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.499 
played Bishop to d5 which looks on the
surface<00:06:27.409> of<00:06:27.530> it<00:06:27.650> more<00:06:28.400> logical<00:06:28.879> move<00:06:29.060> because

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509 
surface of it more logical move because

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.779 
surface of it more logical move because
it<00:06:30.050> tries<00:06:30.259> to<00:06:30.319> shut<00:06:30.800> out<00:06:31.009> this<00:06:31.250> rook<00:06:31.580> the

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
it tries to shut out this rook the

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.070 
it tries to shut out this rook the
bishop<00:06:32.150> of<00:06:32.240> course<00:06:32.479> protects<00:06:32.960> the<00:06:33.770> porn<00:06:34.069> on<00:06:34.280> e6

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
bishop of course protects the porn on e6

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.249 
bishop of course protects the porn on e6
so<00:06:36.080> how<00:06:36.289> does<00:06:36.580> white<00:06:37.720> breakthrough<00:06:38.720> in<00:06:38.960> this

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
so how does white breakthrough in this

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.439 
so how does white breakthrough in this
position<00:06:39.800> queens<00:06:40.699> in<00:06:40.909> an<00:06:41.030> excellent<00:06:41.300> position

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
position queens in an excellent position

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.040 
position queens in an excellent position
but<00:06:42.229> the<00:06:42.319> Queen<00:06:42.590> needs<00:06:43.099> some<00:06:43.490> support<00:06:43.930> if<00:06:44.930> you

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
but the Queen needs some support if you

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.559 
but the Queen needs some support if you
want<00:06:45.199> to<00:06:45.259> pause<00:06:45.669> try<00:06:46.669> to<00:06:46.729> find<00:06:46.970> the<00:06:47.060> solution

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:47.569 
want to pause try to find the solution

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:49.930 
want to pause try to find the solution
do<00:06:47.960> so<00:06:48.199> now<00:06:48.409> otherwise<00:06:49.069> I'm<00:06:49.460> going<00:06:49.669> to<00:06:49.759> show

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
do so now otherwise I'm going to show

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.909 
do so now otherwise I'm going to show
you<00:06:50.000> the<00:06:50.180> solution<00:06:50.330> there's<00:06:51.289> a<00:06:51.409> very<00:06:51.440> nice

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 
you the solution there's a very nice

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.809 
you the solution there's a very nice
winning<00:06:52.909> continuation<00:06:53.659> first<00:06:54.289> of<00:06:54.409> all<00:06:54.560> a

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:54.819 
winning continuation first of all a

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:58.809 
winning continuation first of all a
check<00:06:56.710> the<00:06:57.710> King<00:06:57.919> has<00:06:58.099> to<00:06:58.250> go<00:06:58.370> in<00:06:58.490> the<00:06:58.580> corner

00:06:58.809 --> 00:06:58.819 
check the King has to go in the corner

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.200 
check the King has to go in the corner
so<00:06:59.530> what<00:07:00.530> we<00:07:00.680> need<00:07:00.830> to<00:07:00.949> do<00:07:01.069> now<00:07:01.280> is<00:07:01.310> if<00:07:01.669> we<00:07:02.090> can

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
so what we need to do now is if we can

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.490 
so what we need to do now is if we can
get<00:07:02.300> a<00:07:02.360> look<00:07:02.569> here<00:07:02.630> then<00:07:03.229> we're<00:07:03.349> going<00:07:03.440> to

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
get a look here then we're going to

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.059 
get a look here then we're going to
force<00:07:03.710> checkmate<00:07:04.190> and<00:07:05.319> we<00:07:06.319> can<00:07:06.560> get<00:07:06.800> a<00:07:06.830> rook
