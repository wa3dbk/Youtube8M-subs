00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.190 
occasionally just to check out the area
so<00:01:23.850> anyway<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> really<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.780> area<00:01:24.840> it's

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
so anyway I really like this area it's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.819 
so anyway I really like this area it's
like<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> big<00:01:25.590> desert<00:01:26.250> area<00:01:26.700> bordered<00:01:27.060> by<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
like a big desert area bordered by a

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.230 
like a big desert area bordered by a
bunch<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.920> forces<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.520> swamp<00:01:29.790> over<00:01:30.030> there

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
bunch of forces to swamp over there

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.030 
bunch of forces to swamp over there
there<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:30.990> nice<00:01:31.229> river<00:01:31.530> over<00:01:31.829> there

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
there was a really nice river over there

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.260 
there was a really nice river over there
and<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:33.060> nice-looking

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and it just is a really nice-looking

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.330 
and it just is a really nice-looking
world<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.170> was<00:01:34.500> walking<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.009> desert

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
world now I was walking on the desert

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.740 
world now I was walking on the desert
and<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.490> came<00:01:35.700> across<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.600> obviously

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and I came across this it obviously

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.140 
and I came across this it obviously
wasn't<00:01:37.200> his<00:01:37.380> dugout<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.030> see<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
wasn't his dugout and you can see the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.429 
wasn't his dugout and you can see the
spawner<00:01:39.570> down<00:01:39.810> there<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.110> came<00:01:40.320> across

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
spawner down there but I came across

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.770 
spawner down there but I came across
some<00:01:40.799> cobblestone<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.610> instantly<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.659> was

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
some cobblestone and instantly I was

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.880 
some cobblestone and instantly I was
like<00:01:42.899> all<00:01:43.049> right<00:01:43.079> there's<00:01:43.350> something<00:01:43.740> down

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
like all right there's something down

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.319 
like all right there's something down
here<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.369> wasn't<00:01:44.729> sure<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.090> was<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.299> a

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
here I wasn't sure if it was like a

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.850 
here I wasn't sure if it was like a
glitch<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.930> figured<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.320> was<00:01:46.409> probably<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
glitch but I figured it was probably a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.859 
glitch but I figured it was probably a
dungeon<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.399> turned<00:01:47.579> out<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.880> was<00:01:48.180> so

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
dungeon it turned out that it was so

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.260 
dungeon it turned out that it was so
there's<00:01:49.320> actually<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.710> skeleton<00:01:50.520> spawner<00:01:50.909> down

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
there's actually a skeleton spawner down

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.690 
there's actually a skeleton spawner down
here<00:01:51.570> which<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.320> awesome<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:52.979> using<00:01:53.460> this

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
here which is awesome because using this

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.600 
here which is awesome because using this
I<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.060> now<00:01:54.149> make<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.600> XP<00:01:55.409> farm<00:01:55.649> from<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.369> kind

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
I can now make a XP farm from this kind

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.300 
I can now make a XP farm from this kind
of<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.950> actually<00:01:58.950> published

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
of like the one in actually published

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.700 
of like the one in actually published
insanely<00:01:59.700> I'm<00:01:59.969> anyway<00:02:00.719> kind<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.259> an<00:02:01.350> exp

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
insanely I'm anyway kind of like an exp

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.789 
insanely I'm anyway kind of like an exp
farm<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.729> used<00:02:03.420> recently<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
farm that I have I used recently but I

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.740 
farm that I have I used recently but I
can<00:02:05.340> make<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.640> into<00:02:05.850> an<00:02:05.939> exp<00:02:06.270> farm<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
can make this into an exp farm but the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.180 
can make this into an exp farm but the
best<00:02:06.960> part<00:02:07.140> about<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
best part about this is that this is a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.550 
best part about this is that this is a
skeleton<00:02:08.849> spawner<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.959> all<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
skeleton spawner and out of all the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.430 
skeleton spawner and out of all the
things<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.280> get<00:02:11.459> for<00:02:11.760> spawner

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
things that you can get for spawner

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.980 
things that you can get for spawner
skeletons<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.590> best

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
skeletons of the best

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.120 
skeletons of the best
papers<00:02:14.170> are<00:02:14.290> crap<00:02:14.530> because<00:02:14.680> they<00:02:14.800> only<00:02:14.920> give

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
papers are crap because they only give

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.800 
papers are crap because they only give
you<00:02:15.160> gunpowder<00:02:15.610> zombies<00:02:16.390> only<00:02:16.630> give<00:02:16.780> you

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
you gunpowder zombies only give you

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.440 
you gunpowder zombies only give you
rotten<00:02:17.260> flesh<00:02:17.530> now<00:02:17.800> spiders<00:02:18.700> are<00:02:18.940> really

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
rotten flesh now spiders are really

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.910 
rotten flesh now spiders are really
difficult<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.960> deal<00:02:20.110> with<00:02:20.140> even<00:02:20.680> though<00:02:20.770> they

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
difficult to deal with even though they

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.320 
difficult to deal with even though they
do<00:02:20.980> give<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.400> string<00:02:21.670> which<00:02:21.850> is<00:02:22.000> somewhat

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
do give you string which is somewhat

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.360 
do give you string which is somewhat
useful<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:23.110> sculpting<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.650> skeletons<00:02:24.220> give

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
useful but sculpting the skeletons give

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.710 
useful but sculpting the skeletons give
you<00:02:24.490> bones<00:02:24.760> which<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.150> can<00:02:25.270> use<00:02:25.300> for<00:02:25.390> bone

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
you bones which you can use for bone

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.090 
you bones which you can use for bone
meal<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.230> they<00:02:26.290> give<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.500> arrows<00:02:26.920> which

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
meal and they give you arrows which

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.500 
meal and they give you arrows which
obviously<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.580> can<00:02:27.730> use<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.060> shoot<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.360> other

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
obviously you can use to shoot it other

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.420 
obviously you can use to shoot it other
mobs<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:29.380> this<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:29.980> going<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.130> be<00:02:30.280> awesome

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
mobs so this is going to be awesome

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.300 
mobs so this is going to be awesome
going<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.880> develop<00:02:31.210> this<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.510> no<00:02:31.600> really<00:02:31.780> nice

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
going to develop this and no really nice

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.500 
going to develop this and no really nice
exp<00:02:33.310> farm<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:33.790> i'll<00:02:33.850> bring<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.090> mobs<00:02:34.360> up

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
exp farm so i'll bring the mobs up

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.000 
exp farm so i'll bring the mobs up
twenty<00:02:34.750> four<00:02:34.900> blocks<00:02:35.140> then<00:02:35.410> drop<00:02:35.650> them<00:02:35.830> down

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
twenty four blocks then drop them down

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.580 
twenty four blocks then drop them down
so<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.700> i<00:02:36.820> can<00:02:36.940> i<00:02:37.540> can<00:02:37.690> kill<00:02:37.930> them<00:02:38.050> easily<00:02:38.260> and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
so that i can i can kill them easily and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.670 
so that i can i can kill them easily and
i'll<00:02:39.580> make<00:02:39.820> this<00:02:40.000> probably<00:02:40.440> around<00:02:41.440> the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
i'll make this probably around the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.920 
i'll make this probably around the
center<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.100> my<00:02:42.430> area<00:02:42.730> but<00:02:43.180> i<00:02:43.210> know<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.480> over

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
center of my area but i know that over

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.210 
center of my area but i know that over
here<00:02:44.140> somewhere<00:02:44.380> i'll<00:02:44.620> build<00:02:44.860> kind<00:02:45.070> of<00:02:45.130> like

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
here somewhere i'll build kind of like

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.740 
here somewhere i'll build kind of like
my<00:02:45.370> main<00:02:45.550> house<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.120> then<00:02:46.240> just<00:02:46.450> kind<00:02:46.630> of

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
my main house and then just kind of

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.050 
my main house and then just kind of
spurt<00:02:47.020> off<00:02:47.200> from<00:02:47.380> this<00:02:47.530> whole<00:02:47.760> central<00:02:48.760> area

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
spurt off from this whole central area

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.240 
spurt off from this whole central area
here<00:02:49.210> i<00:02:49.240> am<00:02:49.420> playing<00:02:49.630> on<00:02:49.780> easy<00:02:49.990> difficulty<00:02:50.470> so
