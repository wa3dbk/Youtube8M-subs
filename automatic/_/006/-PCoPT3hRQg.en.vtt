00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.730
 yeah i mean ok that's fine 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.199
 work during that hundredths to aa1 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.460
 bravo but what was it at 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.000
 departure what was it that this 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.340
 magazine 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.259
 it's a magazine dedicated to the raids 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.510
 real sports to ball sports or a 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.710
 bridge or pledge jed contention stockings 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.519
 that's it I 'm going to know it's more 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.070
 easy huh 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.870
 and why, why trail raid 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.190
 endurance went astray 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.659
 why the call seems endurance 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.920
 because endurance the real is the 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.449
 rule is when you go mountain biking 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.339
 for more than four hours and that 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.900
 behind tally quadri exploded reading 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.220
 not running and that you made the 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.989
 canoe that you could poles but 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.250
 Norman football is hoisted orange because 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.260
 that's it there is the orienteering 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.299
 so everything is signposted on the train and 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.799
 everything is tagged a knee is what these 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.210
 tags and no it's us who the 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.400
 furrows like men lost in the 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.809
 nature then a pencil in I want well 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.729
 at first it was hard is done now 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.280
 at aix and why and why 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.820
 but because it shows for the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.409
 dough 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:18.240

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:24.240
 he was able to start selling 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.430
 stocks of product products for the 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.619
 breakfast for meals that we do not 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.899
 did not sell for lack of gourin and 

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:32.369
 it's on a slightly original idea 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:33.599
 related to the world of sport when we went 

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:36.240
 said there may be way to 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.249
 sell all our stocks which 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.770
 does that our our old 4/4 to 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:42.990
 chocolates with butter aromas is 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.749
 become like that on an idea of like 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.569
 cake then this is selling like 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:50.339
 rolls if I can say it's to be 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.689
 praised to party is to stop at 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:53.939
 ravito and then see a little bit of 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:55.559
 hooch and then until the end we go 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.629
 to the end until 1 3 km from the end 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:59.339
 because after good ben had to 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.709
