00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 hello members and members of the technology 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.719
 definitely 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.440
 this is going to be the year - cheap mini laptops 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.329
 which are also known as netbooks 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:14.669
 the revolution started soda at the end of last year 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.880
 and then this little computer manages to get out little cousins ​​what 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.859
 What happens is that these 500 have been much faster than him 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.509
 the sale to the market before even the own asus per cent efe 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.499
 some of them 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.579
 they have even improved many more features 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.879
 like for example this to the sepes removed cook mentioned 33 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.200
 and is that the hp in 21 33 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.000
 is the first laptop of its kind 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.990
 thought directly for companies or professionals 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.920
 who are looking for the concept of menu 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.500
 who does not want to limit 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.860
 to have an alvarez case for limiting costs let's take almost everything and 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.320
 that's why it costs more pestis like so high miniature laptop itself 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.239
 let's throw a leaf 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.330
 the design is without a doubt the best of all we have tried 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.280
 rounded shapes 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.410
 Anodized palominillo finish 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.040
 what is the hand of pimp 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.050
 It also has a very solid construction 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.780
 even though 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.770
 its weight that part d1 com 13 kilos we open it and 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.550
 Katzman 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.930
 the penis more 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.680
 a screen has made me like a 9-inch min resolution 3 166 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.620
 766 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.630
 been the company justifies 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.450
 the weight 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.070
 and also justifies its price 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.200
 the screen is perfectly integrated in its surface and also 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.550
 has two speakers 1 acted in the do 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.030
 and another thing that has 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.220
 big the keyboard 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.320
 from xunta absolutely surprising 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.509
 just be 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.409
 5% lower than the usual notebook keyboards 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.370
 the only thing I do not like 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.370
 is that they have had to reduce 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.880
 the size of the trackback and they have to put the buttons on each side 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.659
 I do not know if this can apply to me but now 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.249
 let's see it by tonalá perales 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.299
 in this one we find the video alida 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.739
 the ventilation moon that makes the equipment does not get too hot 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.819
 we also have an excellent port 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.369
 and we also have the audio input output 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.760
 on the front is very simple 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.649
 we have only the on / off button 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:37.820
 ll the watán d lit 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.819
 and off d luigi 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.379
 and on that side we have 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.829
 a slot for the cable that in zintan 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.349
 then they take it 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.029
 feeding 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.059
 at your side we have the connection the cermi 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:53.959
 we also have a connection vs real 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.809
 an sd card reader 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:00.149
 and beware that this is new in that type of equipment 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:02.779
 a card slot is to fish 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:04.120
 to which we have a 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.220
 I love integrated that is a little bit just for video conferencing 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:08.950
 on the sides 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.969
 we also have stereo microphones a detail that we liked a lot 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.969
 is that just above the trackpad 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:16.949
 we have 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.260
 a little button 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
 that when pressed 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.539
 that this can no longer be used 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:26.439
 and it serves 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.980
 if you have a betrayal to be able to put it and in the case where it is touching 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.779
 this the cursor does not move 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.879
 this is the small battery d three cells 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.139
 but with final equipment a horned autonomy eat 45 hours 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.010
 If you want more autonomy you can use 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.900
 the 6 cells is up to four hours but there have also been little things that we 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.229
 He liked it so much that 21 33 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.719
 one of them 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:52.519
 of course he uses sight 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.139
 kevin slow down the use of the equipment 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.549
 the other is 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.099
 its charger is similar to the one it used in conventional laptops 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.980
 nothing to do with the charger for example 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.049
 of the asus 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.049
 which is much more successful attack and you can take better travel 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:10.840
 it's more you killed it and it also heats up 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.319
 but of course it also has its advantages 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.840
 all against each other 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.430
 the hp cable mining horns more meters 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.360
 he said do not go to me but because they could not leave any more the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.259
 rest of departures 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.069
 has different configurations 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.849
 but it is to put it from 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.639
 a processor of mine 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.110
 c7 m 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.400
 as in this case there was in the future to be able to expose him to ashton 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.890
 as well 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.129
 you can put 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.340
 4 gigas d memory in solid state 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.150
 with 160 gigas mendi hard sco 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.620
 and finally the ram memory that can go from the 512 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.199
 up to two gigas 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.400
 depending on the configuration you choose the operating system also 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.240
 may be 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.120
 with windows or linux 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.130
 this model in particular 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.289
 integra min 2 view of isi 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.400
 and has a hard drive with 120 gigabytes on a processor 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.599
 c7 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.490
 its price is 499 euros 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.749
 the family will go from a price a little cheaper 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:17.990
 up to 699 euros that has the most expensive configuration the others 

00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:21.620
 poor deluded we thought that this refusal to last as long 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.050
 two laptops more again 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.419
 hello we have a lot of equipment to compare 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.779
 and we are making a real mess 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.710
 so 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.940
 I think this time for another thousand star 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.370
 lester I stayed a little bit more 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.699
 until the next level loves
