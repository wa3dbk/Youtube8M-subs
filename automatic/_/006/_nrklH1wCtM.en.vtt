00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
just going to trail around in this

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.240 
just going to trail around in this
position<00:01:12.330> okay<00:01:12.840> start<00:01:13.619> bring<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.950> forward

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
position okay start bring it forward

I'll show you when to bring it forward
so<00:01:16.680> let's<00:01:16.710> try<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> spin<00:01:17.880> without<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.930> arms

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
so let's try the spin without the arms

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.899 
so let's try the spin without the arms
just<00:01:19.439> keep<00:01:19.650> them<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> keeps<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:20.670> bit

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
just keep them in it keeps a little bit

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.590 
just keep them in it keeps a little bit
easier<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.509> now<00:01:21.770> from<00:01:22.770> our<00:01:22.920> three<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:24.270> left

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
easier for now from our three that left

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.630 
easier for now from our three that left
leg<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.860> scoot<00:01:26.670> around<00:01:27.200> like<00:01:28.200> so

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
leg is going to scoot around like so

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.679 
leg is going to scoot around like so
when<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.759> get<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> front<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.540> this

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
when you get to the front in this

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.780

position the left leg is now going to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.600 
position the left leg is now going to
come<00:01:32.970> around<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.360> front<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.290> step<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.979> okay

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
come around the front and step in okay

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.780 
come around the front and step in okay
so<00:01:36.150> nice<00:01:36.479> stretch<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:38.130> make<00:01:38.400> sure<00:01:38.430> that
