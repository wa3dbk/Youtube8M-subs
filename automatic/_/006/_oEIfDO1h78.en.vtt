solo<00:01:03.539> although<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.229> gameplays<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.830> get

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
solo although the gameplays you get

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.429 
solo although the gameplays you get
aren't<00:01:05.430> absolutely<00:01:06.200> amazing<00:01:07.200> it's

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
aren't absolutely amazing it's

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.200 
aren't absolutely amazing it's
definitely<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> lot<00:01:08.159> more<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.549> challenge<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
definitely a lot more of a challenge and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.690 
definitely a lot more of a challenge and
I<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.619> overall<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.369> bit<00:01:11.549> more

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
I think overall it's a bit more

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.429 
I think overall it's a bit more
entertaining<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> bit<00:01:12.570> more<00:01:12.720> impressive

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
entertaining it's a bit more impressive

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.679 
entertaining it's a bit more impressive
if<00:01:13.590> someone<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.130> get<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> triple<00:01:14.700> Moab<00:01:14.820> solo

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
if someone can get a triple Moab solo

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.649 
if someone can get a triple Moab solo
than<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> triple<00:01:16.409> Moab<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.009> full<00:01:17.250> party<00:01:17.659> but

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
than a triple Moab and a full party but

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.560 
than a triple Moab and a full party but
that's<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.900> my<00:01:19.049> opinion<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:21.330> some

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that's just my opinion and I have some

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.719 
that's just my opinion and I have some
black<00:01:21.960> ops<00:01:22.229> 2<00:01:22.500> gameplay<00:01:22.770> saved<00:01:23.310> up<00:01:23.549> but
