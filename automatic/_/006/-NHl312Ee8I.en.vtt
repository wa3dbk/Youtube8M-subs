00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
the only company that can kind of

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.059 
the only company that can kind of
compete<00:03:07.959> with<00:03:08.080> W<00:03:08.470> I'm<00:03:08.560> not<00:03:08.680> going<00:03:08.800> to<00:03:08.860> say<00:03:08.920> they

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
compete with W I'm not going to say they

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.770 
compete with W I'm not going to say they
can<00:03:09.220> compete<00:03:09.489> directly<00:03:09.670> with<00:03:09.970> every<00:03:10.209> W<00:03:10.450> but<00:03:10.660> I

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
can compete directly with every W but I

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.410 
can compete directly with every W but I
mean<00:03:10.930> they<00:03:11.050> do<00:03:11.110> have<00:03:11.319> their<00:03:11.470> own<00:03:11.560> TV<00:03:11.769> show<00:03:12.130> and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
mean they do have their own TV show and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.819 
mean they do have their own TV show and
they're<00:03:13.420> probably<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.959> second<00:03:14.380> most<00:03:14.410> known

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
they're probably the second most known

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.979 
they're probably the second most known
because<00:03:15.700> of<00:03:15.730> TV<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.420> United<00:03:16.750> States

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
because of TV in the United States

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.069 
because of TV in the United States
anyways<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:19.060> second<00:03:19.420> most<00:03:19.540> known<00:03:19.690> wrestling

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
anyways the second most known wrestling

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.319 
anyways the second most known wrestling
organization<00:03:20.709> so<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.700> don't<00:03:21.910> know<00:03:22.000> why<00:03:22.180> they

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
organization so I don't know why they

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.360 
organization so I don't know why they
keep<00:03:22.540> doing<00:03:22.660> all<00:03:22.840> this<00:03:23.019> stuff<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.500> I've<00:03:24.190> been

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
keep doing all this stuff and I've been

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.680 
keep doing all this stuff and I've been
talking<00:03:24.670> about<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.940> over<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.150> past<00:03:25.360> couple<00:03:25.480> of

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
talking about it over the past couple of

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.819 
talking about it over the past couple of
videos<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.230> just<00:03:26.410> think<00:03:26.590> eventually

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
videos and I just think eventually

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.860 
videos and I just think eventually
probably<00:03:27.730> within<00:03:28.000> two<00:03:28.209> years<00:03:28.420> team<00:03:28.690> they's

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
probably within two years team they's

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.120 
probably within two years team they's
gonna<00:03:28.989> fall<00:03:29.260> apart<00:03:29.560> that's<00:03:29.739> just<00:03:29.950> my<00:03:30.070> opinion

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
gonna fall apart that's just my opinion

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.289 
gonna fall apart that's just my opinion
