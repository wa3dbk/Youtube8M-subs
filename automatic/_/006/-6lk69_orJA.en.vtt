00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.240
 hello my name is rita and is here to 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.190
 bring them another video from the series how 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.050
 make ecological portfolios that sweat how 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.060
 is the step that we will be seeing 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.119
 today is how to sew the zipper of the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.859
 portfolio that is so simple does not 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.199
 complicate is only going to take 30 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.060
 minutes maybe a little more but not 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.679
 very much then if they want to continue 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.550
 learning by winter weather 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.550
 what is next 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.940
 to start let's take our needle 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.550
 and we are going to introduce it into the role of 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.550
 orange color with audio jones 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.949
 it was the same 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.910
 and now we're going to put it on paper 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.910
 red 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.249
 be careful if you are colorblind 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:12.680
 and now they 're going to get into the role of 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.680
 orange color with 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.640
 to 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.730
 and you will keep these two extremes 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.640
 who are going to tie 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.800
 so they start by securing their thread to 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.820
 start sensible thing 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:34.200
 the channel of 3 to 4 knots and do the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.200
 strong because 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.300
 and pull hard because they want you not to 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.300
 is hidden inside the tissue 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.390
 they go after their appointment in the estimated 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.079
 and they're going to start doing the first 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.079
 tip 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.040
 you do not have to take a lot of cloth a 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.970
 little enough and they want everything 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.140
 stay as short as possible inside the 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:11.610
 fabric and that everything looks pretty clean 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.610
 and verify 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.069
 now I'm going to introduce me google inside 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.069
 of orange paper with red 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.910
 and now through the role of an hour 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.410
 coloration 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.100
 and now 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.100
 Health 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.180
 as always something for the scj and mint 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.950
 and now I'm going to make a stitch through 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.220
 of the two ends of a zipper 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.780
 to ensure that my zipper is in its 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.360
 place when I'm opening it and 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.360
 closing that moves as little as possible 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.700
 safe 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.810
 now they put the needle through the paper 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.810
 mustard 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.390
 or yellow according to how you see it and 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.810
 what through the colored paper 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.810
 silver 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.290
 halo and I repeat the process again 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.950
 a stitch 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.950
 things 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.070
 and decide 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.790
 now then with my needle on the paper 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.790
 mustard color life 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.610
 and now in the chapter paper 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.370
 Y 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.710
 there I come, we are going to stay 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.420
 now I repeat the process until 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.819
 tip 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.220
 under my needle by colored paper 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:10.610
 White 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.610
 and its through the color paper like 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.630
 this is how the chair will be 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.920
 once they have done all this 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.920
 around the race 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.889
 and then these two are going to be 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.500
 ends that are going to be the end with the 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.930
 that we initially started from the portfolio 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.980
 and with the one that ended at the end they're going to 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.919
 be 3 to 4 knots and now to hide 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.570
 the first end to enter the 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.960
 needle on blue paper with 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.960
 now 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.610
 and now I'm going to introduce the needles into 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.610
 purple paper 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.150
 to 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.009
 enough for the knot to be 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.969
 enter inside the fabric that well 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.309
 slow 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.829
 Now let's do the same with the other 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:11.219
 ends all using a palette 

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:13.380
 to help introduce the thread to 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:16.170
 through the tissue 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.160
 since that end had no needle cut 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.580
 the excess and so we have the portfolio very 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.580
 simple 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:28.429
 but if you lose to quarry it's super 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.809
 simple do not get complicated with you 

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:31.429
 all that creativity and in that of 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:34.519
 positivity and they will find you 

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:36.499
 you make precious then if you 

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:38.449

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:41.119

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:44.419
