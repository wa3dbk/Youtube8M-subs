00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
they've sort of hidden in amongst the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.089 
they've sort of hidden in amongst the
big<00:00:30.300> game<00:00:30.420> play<00:00:30.599> they<00:00:31.349> haven't<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.769> thrown

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
big game play they haven't just thrown

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.549 
big game play they haven't just thrown
anything<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.960> I'm<00:00:33.960> saying<00:00:34.260> I've<00:00:34.410> been

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
anything in this I'm saying I've been

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.810 
anything in this I'm saying I've been
really<00:00:34.739> selective<00:00:35.070> about<00:00:35.340> what<00:00:35.460> they<00:00:35.579> put<00:00:35.730> in

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
really selective about what they put in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.600 
really selective about what they put in
and<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.750> think<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.079> ordinance<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.340> kind<00:00:38.550> of

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
and I think the ordinance can be kind of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.389 
and I think the ordinance can be kind of
explained<00:00:39.030> now<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.050> works<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:41.219> let<00:00:41.340> me

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
explained now of how it works so let me

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.549 
explained now of how it works so let me
just<00:00:41.489> take<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.670> through<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.260> also<00:00:43.260> I'm<00:00:43.440> not

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
just take you through that also I'm not

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.900 
just take you through that also I'm not
saying<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.190> hundred<00:00:44.250> percent<00:00:44.430> true

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
saying this is one hundred percent true

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.139 
saying this is one hundred percent true
I<00:00:45.539> mean<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.620> true<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.129> far<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:47.399> I'm<00:00:47.520> as<00:00:47.850> far<00:00:48.059> as

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
I mean it's true as far as I'm as far as

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.880 
I mean it's true as far as I'm as far as
i<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:48.539> i<00:00:48.750> was<00:00:49.079> saying<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.379> right<00:00:49.620> I'm

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
i know but i was saying it's right I'm

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.520 
i know but i was saying it's right I'm
this<00:00:50.219> I'm<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.579> speculating<00:00:50.760> at<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.180> moment

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
this I'm just speculating at the moment

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.360 
this I'm just speculating at the moment
so<00:00:52.530> let<00:00:52.680> me<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.829> take<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.010> through<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.219> I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
so let me just take you through what I

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.470 
so let me just take you through what I
think<00:00:54.559> basically<00:00:55.559> ordinance<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.329> going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> be

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
think basically ordinance is going to be

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.420 
think basically ordinance is going to be
the<00:00:57.600> one<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> new<00:00:58.500> features<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the one of the new features one of the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.240 
the one of the new features one of the
key<00:00:59.609> features<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.239> multiplayer<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
key features in multiplayer and the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.820 
key features in multiplayer and the
competitive<00:01:03.090> multiplayer<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.660> probably<00:01:04.530> our

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
competitive multiplayer and probably our

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.620 
competitive multiplayer and probably our
co-op<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.670> well<00:01:05.820> I'm<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.000> quite<00:01:06.150> sure<00:01:06.180> yet<00:01:06.450> but

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
co-op as well I'm not quite sure yet but

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.780 
co-op as well I'm not quite sure yet but
um<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.650> see<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.130> sort<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.490> works<00:01:08.640> like

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
um as you see it sort of works like

and<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.899> do<00:01:43.049> really

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
and you can see if I just do really

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.289 
and you can see if I just do really
carefully<00:01:43.829> here<00:01:43.950> an<00:01:44.130> ordinance<00:01:44.520> ready<00:01:44.820> ribbon

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
carefully here an ordinance ready ribbon

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.830 
carefully here an ordinance ready ribbon
ribbon<00:01:45.829> just<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.340> bar<00:01:47.640> appears<00:01:48.060> across

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
ribbon just just a bar appears across

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.389 
ribbon just just a bar appears across
the<00:01:48.990> screen<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.530> then<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> cuts<00:01:50.040> into<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
the screen and then it cuts into a

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.030 
the screen and then it cuts into a
different<00:01:50.759> game<00:01:51.090> where<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.649> guy<00:01:52.860> has

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
different game where this guy has

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.380 
different game where this guy has
actually<00:01:53.369> got<00:01:53.520> his<00:01:53.549> ordinance<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.210> ready

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
actually got his ordinance just ready

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.600 
actually got his ordinance just ready
just<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.049> once<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.920> get<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.100> ordinary

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
just then and once you get your ordinary

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.719 
just then and once you get your ordinary
you<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.180> three<00:01:57.420> options<00:01:57.840> by<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.079> looks<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
you get three options by the looks of it

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.840 
you get three options by the looks of it
so<00:01:59.729> he's<00:02:00.090> got<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.799> scattershot<00:02:02.369> which<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
so he's got the scattershot which is the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.230 
so he's got the scattershot which is the
forerunner<00:02:03.060> shotgun<00:02:03.750> equivalent<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:05.240> down

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
forerunner shotgun equivalent the down

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.719 
forerunner shotgun equivalent the down
here<00:02:06.420> he's<00:02:06.509> got<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.810> nila<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.550> over<00:02:08.550> here

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
here he's got the nila and over here

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.210 
here he's got the nila and over here
he's<00:02:08.819> got<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.270> nut

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
he's got a nut

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.580 
he's got a nut
it's<00:02:11.120> not<00:02:11.390> known<00:02:11.570> at<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.080> moment<00:02:12.350> well<00:02:12.560> I

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
it's not known at the moment well I

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.740 
it's not known at the moment well I
don't<00:02:13.010> know<00:02:13.160> what<00:02:13.460> sort<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.150> our<00:02:14.270> pocket<00:02:14.660> is

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
don't know what sort of our pocket is

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.260 
don't know what sort of our pocket is
I'm<00:02:14.960> guessing<00:02:15.230> it's<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.380> shield<00:02:15.710> perk<00:02:16.310> if

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
I'm guessing it's the shield perk if

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.310 
I'm guessing it's the shield perk if
you've<00:02:17.420> seen<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.720> other<00:02:17.840> videos<00:02:17.900> you'll<00:02:18.230> know

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
you've seen the other videos you'll know

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.220 
you've seen the other videos you'll know
what<00:02:18.440> I'm<00:02:18.500> talking<00:02:18.560> about<00:02:18.830> where<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.430> player

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
what I'm talking about where the player

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.050 
what I'm talking about where the player
ish<00:02:21.230> they<00:02:21.680> get<00:02:21.860> like<00:02:21.950> an<00:02:22.100> energy<00:02:22.370> shield<00:02:22.550> in

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
ish they get like an energy shield in

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.820 
ish they get like an energy shield in
front<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.420> them<00:02:23.510> they<00:02:24.170> can<00:02:24.320> walk<00:02:24.440> around<00:02:24.680> with

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
front of them they can walk around with

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.070 
front of them they can walk around with
it<00:02:25.150> similar<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.210> what<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.360> jackal<00:02:26.660> does<00:02:26.750> except

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
it similar to what a jackal does except

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.320 
it similar to what a jackal does except
a<00:02:27.110> little<00:02:27.170> cool<00:02:27.620> cool<00:02:28.070> put<00:02:28.700> on<00:02:28.820> so<00:02:29.120> doesn't

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
a little cool cool put on so doesn't

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.730 
a little cool cool put on so doesn't
look<00:02:29.420> like<00:02:29.570> ordinance<00:02:29.990> can<00:02:30.110> be<00:02:30.200> just<00:02:30.440> weapons

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
look like ordinance can be just weapons

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.070 
look like ordinance can be just weapons
it<00:02:31.280> can<00:02:31.430> also<00:02:31.580> be<00:02:31.700> armored<00:02:32.450> perks<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:32.930> stuff

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
it can also be armored perks and stuff

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.230 
it can also be armored perks and stuff
like<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.730> see<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:34.940> got<00:02:35.060> three

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
like that so you see you got three

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.820 
like that so you see you got three
options<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.750> I'd<00:02:36.200> say<00:02:36.350> you<00:02:36.410> just<00:02:36.470> use<00:02:36.710> the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
options and I'd say you just use the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.860 
options and I'd say you just use the
d-pad<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.400> select<00:02:37.640> which<00:02:37.760> one<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.000> want<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.570> in

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
d-pad to select which one you want so in

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.740 
d-pad to select which one you want so in
this<00:02:38.960> case<00:02:39.140> he<00:02:39.320> selects<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.800> scattershot<00:02:40.750> and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
this case he selects the scattershot and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.180 
this case he selects the scattershot and
so<00:02:42.020> once<00:02:42.260> he<00:02:42.320> selects<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.680> Scottish<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.040> can

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
so once he selects the Scottish I can

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.050 
so once he selects the Scottish I can
see<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.340> little<00:02:43.490> a<00:02:43.670> marker<00:02:44.500> spawn<00:02:45.500> here<00:02:45.740> and

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
see a little a marker spawn here and

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.480 
see a little a marker spawn here and
then<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:48.290> ordinance<00:02:48.650> will<00:02:48.830> fly<00:02:49.130> down<00:02:50.140> cause<00:02:51.140> a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
then the ordinance will fly down cause a

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.030 
then the ordinance will fly down cause a
pretty<00:02:52.490> big<00:02:52.730> explosion<00:02:53.270> and<00:02:53.450> then<00:02:54.200> pop<00:02:54.860> open

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
pretty big explosion and then pop open

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.010 
pretty big explosion and then pop open
as<00:02:55.520> you<00:02:55.790> can<00:02:55.850> see<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.209> pops<00:02:56.480> open<00:02:56.690> and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
as you can see that pops open and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.260 
as you can see that pops open and
there's<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.980> scattershot<00:02:58.310> inside<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.060> there

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
there's the scattershot inside it there

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.390 
there's the scattershot inside it there
and<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:02.180> once<00:03:03.050> he<00:03:03.170> pick<00:03:03.410> up<00:03:03.530> scattershot<00:03:03.950> he

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
and so once he pick up scattershot he

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.280 
and so once he pick up scattershot he
pretty<00:03:04.610> much<00:03:04.700> he's<00:03:05.510> pretty<00:03:05.750> much<00:03:05.840> set<00:03:06.110> so

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
pretty much he's pretty much set so

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.770 
pretty much he's pretty much set so
that's<00:03:06.440> how<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.590> orleans<00:03:07.010> will<00:03:07.160> work<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:07.940> what

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
that's how the orleans will work so what

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.440 
that's how the orleans will work so what
we<00:03:08.870> know<00:03:08.990> now<00:03:09.020> is<00:03:09.440> that<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.760> ordinance<00:03:10.970> bar<00:03:11.270> is

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
we know now is that the ordinance bar is

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.170 
we know now is that the ordinance bar is
filled<00:03:11.750> by<00:03:11.959> killing<00:03:12.820> characters<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:16.180> once

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
filled by killing characters and once

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.160 
filled by killing characters and once
you<00:03:17.269> get<00:03:17.420> orders<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.780> have<00:03:17.900> three<00:03:18.140> options

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
you get orders you have three options

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.320 
you get orders you have three options
not<00:03:18.860> only<00:03:19.130> weapons<00:03:19.459> but<00:03:19.610> also<00:03:19.790> armor<00:03:20.120> perks

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
not only weapons but also armor perks

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.620 
not only weapons but also armor perks
and<00:03:21.140> once<00:03:21.320> you<00:03:21.410> select<00:03:21.769> your<00:03:21.950> ordnance<00:03:22.630> you

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
and once you select your ordnance you

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.560 
and once you select your ordnance you
also<00:03:24.730> whether<00:03:25.730> or<00:03:25.880> not<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.209> drops<00:03:26.480> down

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
also whether or not it drops down

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.470 
also whether or not it drops down
randomly<00:03:27.110> or<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.350> drop<00:03:27.620> stamp<00:03:28.060> close<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.330> on

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
randomly or a drop stamp close to you on

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.720 
randomly or a drop stamp close to you on
purpose<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:30.050> I'm<00:03:30.709> not<00:03:30.890> sure<00:03:30.950> maybe<00:03:31.400> this<00:03:31.610> guy

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
purpose is I'm not sure maybe this guy

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.210 
purpose is I'm not sure maybe this guy
just<00:03:31.790> got<00:03:32.000> lucky<00:03:32.150> but<00:03:32.450> I'd<00:03:32.959> say<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:33.410> by<00:03:33.980> looks

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
just got lucky but I'd say that by looks

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.259 
just got lucky but I'd say that by looks
of<00:03:34.340> things<00:03:34.430> all<00:03:34.670> this<00:03:34.820> is<00:03:34.910> going<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.150> drop

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
of things all this is going to drop

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.949 
of things all this is going to drop
close<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.750> you<00:03:35.840> in<00:03:36.440> specific<00:03:36.920> spots<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:38.390> so

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
close to you in specific spots and so

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.120 
close to you in specific spots and so
yeah<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.110> think<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:39.620> think<00:03:39.650> it's<00:03:39.860> going<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.040> be

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
yeah I think it I think it's going to be

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.820 
yeah I think it I think it's going to be
a<00:03:40.160> really<00:03:40.400> cool<00:03:40.549> feature<00:03:40.700> in<00:03:41.000> map<00:03:41.209> but<00:03:41.420> so<00:03:41.830> like

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
a really cool feature in map but so like

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.160 
a really cool feature in map but so like
I<00:03:42.950> said<00:03:43.010> it's<00:03:43.400> it's<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.239> tune<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.720> want<00:03:45.080> to

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
I said it's it's the tune you want to

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.550 
I said it's it's the tune you want to
get<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.350> by<00:03:45.440> kills<00:03:46.060> or<00:03:47.140> whether<00:03:48.140> or<00:03:48.290> not<00:03:48.410> you

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
get it by kills or whether or not you

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.620 
get it by kills or whether or not you
get<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.739> by<00:03:48.799> kills<00:03:49.040> or<00:03:49.220> whether<00:03:49.400> 10<00:03:49.790> 10<00:03:50.299> points

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
get it by kills or whether 10 10 points

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.090 
get it by kills or whether 10 10 points
for<00:03:50.720> an<00:03:50.810> assist<00:03:51.110> will<00:03:51.290> count<00:03:51.560> towards<00:03:51.920> this

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
for an assist will count towards this

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.860 
for an assist will count towards this
I'm<00:03:52.310> not<00:03:52.340> sure<00:03:52.489> yet<00:03:52.820> whether<00:03:53.120> it's<00:03:53.269> points<00:03:53.720> or

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
I'm not sure yet whether it's points or

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.900 
I'm not sure yet whether it's points or
just<00:03:54.140> actual<00:03:54.560> kills<00:03:54.799> but<00:03:55.040> at<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.580> moment<00:03:55.670> it

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
just actual kills but at the moment it

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.020 
just actual kills but at the moment it
just<00:03:55.940> looks<00:03:56.209> like<00:03:56.239> it<00:03:56.420> skills<00:03:56.720> and<00:03:57.610> yeah<00:03:58.610> as<00:03:58.910> I

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
just looks like it skills and yeah as I

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.979

said<00:03:59.060> before<00:03:59.239> I<00:03:59.480> think<00:03:59.630> it's<00:03:59.720> going<00:03:59.780> to<00:03:59.870> be<00:03:59.930> a

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989

said before I think it's going to be a
really<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.320> really<00:04:01.070> cool<00:04:01.700> feature<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.330> it's
