have<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.580> blue<00:01:26.820> turtle<00:01:27.240> 1<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.990> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
have the blue turtle 1 and this is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.539 
have the blue turtle 1 and this is
actually<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.470> great<00:01:28.799> clip<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.310> wouldn't

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
actually a great clip and it wouldn't

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.760 
actually a great clip and it wouldn't
normally<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.850> an<00:01:30.000> account<00:01:30.270> down<00:01:30.450> extra<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.740> i

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
normally be an account down extra but i

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.289 
normally be an account down extra but i
don't<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.640> more<00:01:32.820> fit<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
don't really like it more fit for you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.520 
don't really like it more fit for you
and<00:01:33.420> people<00:01:33.540> sending<00:01:33.869> clips<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.229> aren't<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and people sending clips that aren't the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.200 
and people sending clips that aren't the
regular<00:01:34.950> game<00:01:35.130> modes<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:35.939> not

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
regular game modes I think it's not

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.149 
regular game modes I think it's not
quite<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:37.259> know<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.680> part<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> normal

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
quite you know it's not part of a normal

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.679 
quite you know it's not part of a normal
game<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.729> already<00:01:38.939> consider<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> clip

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
game so we already consider it a clip

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.840 
game so we already consider it a clip
but<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.590> such<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> great<00:01:41.250> streak<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.790> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
but this is such a great streak that I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
but this is such a great streak that I
had<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> put<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> countdown<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.530> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
had to put it in the countdown so it is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770 
had to put it in the countdown so it is
a<00:01:43.860> countdown<00:01:44.189> extra<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.880> mean<00:01:45.030> I've<00:01:45.299> anemic<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780

anyway<00:02:22.710> this<00:02:23.100> was<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:23.910> difficult<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.780> play<00:02:25.020> and

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
anyway this was so difficult to play and

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.080 
anyway this was so difficult to play and
just<00:02:25.500> watching<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:26.160> after<00:02:26.580> having<00:02:26.820> just

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
played the game just blows my mind

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.520 
played the game just blows my mind
because<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.460> timing<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:30.570> has<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.110> be<00:02:31.140> so

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
because the timing is just has to be so

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.530 
because the timing is just has to be so
spot-on<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.730> game<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.150> really

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
spot-on on this game it's really

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.210 
spot-on on this game it's really
unforgiving<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.410> get<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> timing<00:02:34.950> wrong

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
unforgiving if you get the timing wrong

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.850 
unforgiving if you get the timing wrong

bits<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.330> go<00:02:48.480> those<00:02:48.930> moves<00:02:49.260> are<00:02:49.410> really

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
bits to go those moves are really

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.110 
bits to go those moves are really
difficult<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.100> turn<00:02:50.310> back<00:02:50.490> on<00:02:50.550> yourself<00:02:51.000> and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
difficult you turn back on yourself and

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.300 
difficult you turn back on yourself and
then<00:02:51.240> jump<00:02:51.450> over<00:02:51.780> something<00:02:52.200> awesome<00:02:53.040> stuff

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
then jump over something awesome stuff

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.160 
then jump over something awesome stuff

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
any better than this the people who play

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.270 
any better than this the people who play
this<00:03:30.210> game<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.780> are<00:03:31.140> good<00:03:31.320> at<00:03:31.500> our<00:03:31.650> absolute

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
this game and are good at our absolute

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.120 
this game and are good at our absolute
robots<00:03:32.820> because<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.570> precision<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:34.680> the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
robots because the precision in the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.040 
robots because the precision in the
driving<00:03:35.460> lions<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.210> mean<00:03:36.360> I<00:03:36.480> know<00:03:36.510> it's<00:03:36.840> an

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
driving lions I mean I know it's an

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.020 
driving lions I mean I know it's an
arcade-style<00:03:37.560> racer<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.310> not<00:03:38.460> simulation

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
arcade-style racer it's not simulation

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.230 
arcade-style racer it's not simulation
but<00:03:39.480> still<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.050> absolute<00:03:40.650> control<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.760> the

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
but still the absolute control of the

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.640 
but still the absolute control of the
vehicle<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.750> obviously<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.200> must<00:03:43.320> have<00:03:43.530> to

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
vehicle and obviously you must have to

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.530 
vehicle and obviously you must have to
play<00:03:43.830> some<00:03:44.040> respect<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.580> lot<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.060> times<00:03:45.300> because

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
play some respect a lot of times because

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.060 
play some respect a lot of times because
there's<00:03:45.690> some<00:03:45.840> really<00:03:46.080> difficult<00:03:46.320> turns<00:03:46.890> in

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
there's some really difficult turns in

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.350 
there's some really difficult turns in
here<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.490> couldn't<00:03:47.820> just<00:03:48.030> do<00:03:48.180> on-site

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
here that you couldn't just do on-site

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.330 
here that you couldn't just do on-site
you'd<00:03:49.050> have<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.380> learn<00:03:49.530> them<00:03:49.740> so<00:03:49.920> props<00:03:50.250> to

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
you'd have to learn them so props to

really epic like this so the appletini
here<00:04:04.530> riding<00:04:05.250> around<00:04:05.459> in<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.910> Harrier<00:04:06.300> and

here riding around in the Harrier and
he's<00:04:07.200> gonna<00:04:07.320> do<00:04:07.470> something<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:07.980> think

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220

but it's so good when someone falls off
there<00:04:12.270> it<00:04:12.450> just<00:04:12.840> blows<00:04:12.990> my<00:04:13.140> mind<00:04:13.380> so<00:04:13.530> well

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740
