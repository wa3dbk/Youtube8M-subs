00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
same thing with mw2 is the same thing I

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.240 
same thing with mw2 is the same thing I
noticed<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.569> nw2<00:02:52.079> is<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.410> rankings<00:02:52.920> are<00:02:53.069> very

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
low but yeah so I guess to get to the

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.000 
low but yeah so I guess to get to the
heart<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.000> video<00:02:57.769> girls<00:02:58.769> are<00:02:58.920> very
