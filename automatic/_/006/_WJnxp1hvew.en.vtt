00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
think is really interesting instead of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.340 
think is really interesting instead of
me<00:00:41.100> trying<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.820> plan<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.420> course<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.989> advance

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
me trying to plan a course in advance

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and develop it over time you know kind

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.930 
and develop it over time you know kind
of<00:00:46.110> guessing<00:00:46.410> what<00:00:46.770> people<00:00:47.100> want<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.399> see<00:00:47.820> in
