that is going to be taking place and now
initially<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.160> thought<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.520> would<00:00:59.579> be

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
initially I thought it would be

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.610 
initially I thought it would be
somewhere<00:01:00.000> around<00:01:00.030> black<00:01:00.539> ops<00:01:00.780> 2<00:01:00.930> likely<00:01:01.260> 20

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
somewhere around black ops 2 likely 20

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.759 
somewhere around black ops 2 likely 20
25<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.219> 20<00:01:02.550> 30<00:01:02.850> era<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.840> aren't<00:01:04.049> actually<00:01:04.619> a

25 to 20 30 era but we aren't actually a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.740 
25 to 20 30 era but we aren't actually a
lot<00:01:05.070> further<00:01:05.339> into<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> future<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.450> lot<00:01:06.720> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
lot further into the future and a lot of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.850 
lot further into the future and a lot of
the<00:01:06.930> stuff<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.170> we're<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.590> seeing

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
stuff it's going to be plausible by that

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
completely plausible to be viable

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.179 
completely plausible to be viable
options<00:01:35.579> for<00:01:35.820> warfare<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.420> 2050<00:01:37.350> too<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.920> let's
