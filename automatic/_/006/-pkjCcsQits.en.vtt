00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:07.149
 The subject of the brain is how physiological 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.519
 the basis of the psyche on remember one of 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.389
 definitions of the psyche 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.639
 psyche is a property 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.830
 highly organized matter 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.020
 brain reflect objective 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.200
 reality in this way 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.940
 the material basis of the psyche is 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:27.160
 brain and nervous system in general thanks to 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.000
 the nervous system man is able 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.410
 receive information about the outside world 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.550
 analyze it and shape it 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:40.050
 adequate behavior nervous system 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:45.100
 human consists of two sections 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.840
 central and peripheral in its 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.280
 queue central nervous system 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.500
 consists of the brain and spinal cord 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.090
 and peripheral nervous system 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.530
 formed by nerves nerve endings 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.330
 and nerve nodes 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.030
 central nervous system is associated with 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:12.720
 all human organs and tissues 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.720
 the body and this connection provide the nerves 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.460
 in man all the nerves are subdivided into 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.710
 two groups to the first group include 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.430
 afferent nerves that conduct 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:32.410
 signals from the outside world and structures 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.450
 the body's central nervous system 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.590
 nerves that carry signals out 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.740
 central nervous system of the periphery to 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.760
 organs to the muscles go to another group and 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.680
 are called afferent 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.470
 on the periphery of the nervous system are 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.810
 miniature device 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.010
 the receptors they are meant to 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.150
 perception of different types of energy 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.290
 mechanical electromagnetic chemical 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.830
 and they transform this energy into 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.580
 nerve energy receptors 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.320
 located throughout the human body 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.020
 especially many receptors in organs 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.230
 feelings that are specifically designed 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.150
 for the perception of information about the environment 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.330
 the world 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.489
 I wonder what receptors perceive and 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.970
 recycle only one species 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.220
 impacts therefore receptors are divided into 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.540
 visual and auditory flavoring and 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.489
 olfactory and skin and information 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.950
 derived from receptors 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.900
 transferred further to the appropriate department 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.800
 central nervous system 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.260
 including the cerebral cortex area 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.650
 cerebral cortex where does 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.930
 receptor information 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.160
 are called primary projection 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.610
 primary areas of the cerebral cortex 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.640
 projection areas of the cerebral cortex 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.720
 also called all weedy 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.750
 sensitive areas of the cerebral cortex 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.100
 brain because they are associated with 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.470
 the formation of certain sensations if 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.920
 any zone is destroyed then man 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.690
 may lose the ability to feel 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.799
 perceive a certain kind of information 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.980
 for example if the visual zone is destroyed 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.110
 then a person can stop seeing he 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.370
 maybe blind 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.800
 whether it is a person's feeling depends 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.920
 not only on the level of integrity development 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.270
 the senses our example eyes 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.620
 but also the integrity of the pathways and 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.660
 primary projection area of ​​the cortex 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:52.650
 brain in the cerebral cortex 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:58.320
 are as sensitive 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:02.020
 so and motor motor zone 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.400
 motor areas are located in the frontal 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.400
 lobes of the cerebral cortex 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.370
 and each area of ​​the cortex corresponds to 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.440
 a certain group of muscles compliance 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.650
 between certain zones trough 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.250
 muscles first established scientist penfield 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.230
 who made a map of the brain 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.530
 the resulting image of a man was 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:30.270
 named for him penfield man 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.790
 on this map you can see which part of the cortex 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:39.220
 responsible for the movement of a particular group 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:41.350
 muscle primary fields occupied 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.750
 relatively small area of ​​the cortex 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.440
 brain no more than one third 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.700
 parts occupy a much larger area 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.540
 secondary fields are often called 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.790
 associative or integrative 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:01.390
 the secondary fields of the car are 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:04.510
 sort of superstructure over primary fields 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.780
 their function is to 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:11.850
 synthesize and integrate individual 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:15.070
 elements of information in a coherent picture 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:17.440
 thanks to sensory integrative fields 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.120
 separate sensations add up to 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.700
 holistic perception 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.970
 and thanks to motor integrative 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.910
 fields, separate movements are formed in 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.310
 holistic motor act practically 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.710
 all departments central and peripheral 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.180
 nervous system 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.490
 involved in mental activity 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:41.210
 however, the main organ of the psyche and 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:44.300
 is the brain the brain has 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.780
 complex organization and includes three 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.750
 main block 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.780
 energy corresponds to him 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:57.620
 upper brain stem block 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.710
 receiving processing and storage of information 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:05.840
 parietal occipital 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:09.349
 and perry juicy sections of the bark and 3 head 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:14.620
 brain block programming regulation and 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:17.419
 control activities of the frontal lobes of the cortex 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.770
 it's no secret to anyone in the head 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:24.919
 brain produce left and right hemispheres 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:28.880
 who perform different functions work 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:31.900
 the left hemisphere determines speech and 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:36.280
 other speech related functions 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:38.419
 reading letter account logical memory 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.639
 verbal or abstract 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:44.150
 thinking 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:45.680
 the right hemisphere performs unrelated 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.310
 with speech function 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.490
 she manages the processes that are usually 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.469
 flow on a sensory level for 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:58.070
 right hemisphere is characterized by high 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:07:00.919
 the rate of identification of objects surrounding 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.479
 world this way of knowing can 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.880
 define as integral 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.740
 synthetic 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:10.819
 holistic that is right hemisphere 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:13.060
 responsible for holistic perception left 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:16.250
 hemisphere functions based on 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.580
 analytical approach analytical 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:22.190
 approach is a brute force 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.680
 individual elements of information that is 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.419
 left hemisphere mapping 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.289
 the subject 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:32.060
 folding it from separate parts 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:35.090
 of course the perception of the world involved 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.610
 both hemispheres if the activity of any 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.190
 from the hemispheres is disturbed it may 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:43.750
 lead to impossibility of interaction 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.750
 person with the surrounding reality 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:49.560
 so we looked at the structure of the brain and 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:53.510
 the nervous system without which no 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.510
 there would be a psyche
