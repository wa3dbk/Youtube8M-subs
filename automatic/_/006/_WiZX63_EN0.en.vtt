are fairly straightforward all you

are fairly straightforward all you

really need to know is that they're

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.140 
really need to know is that they're
constants<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.619> when<00:01:11.040> set<00:01:11.369> will<00:01:11.729> not<00:01:11.880> change

this<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.220> probably<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.549> good<00:01:26.700> time<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.000> mention

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
this is probably a good time to mention

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.359 
this is probably a good time to mention
the<00:01:27.540> timekeeping<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.260> spawner<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.920> counts

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the timekeeping of the spawner it counts

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.820 
the timekeeping of the spawner it counts
using<00:01:29.640> in-game<00:01:29.880> ticks<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.440> really<00:01:31.619> need

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
using in-game ticks all you really need

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.100 
using in-game ticks all you really need
to<00:01:31.860> remember<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.850> 20<00:01:33.270> ticks<00:01:33.540> are<00:01:33.750> equal

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
to remember is that 20 ticks are equal

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.350 
to remember is that 20 ticks are equal
to<00:01:34.260> one<00:01:34.440> second<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.190> all<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.760> values<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.210> put

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
to one second and all the values you put

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.179 
to one second and all the values you put
into<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:36.659> spawner<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.229> measured<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.920> ticks

into the spawner on measured in ticks
now<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.510> clear<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.930> any<00:01:40.080> confusion<00:01:40.830> the

now just to clear out any confusion the

as redstone ticks red cent ticks are the

as redstone ticks red cent ticks are the

there<00:01:52.380> are<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> few<00:01:52.619> more<00:01:52.799> tax<00:01:53.090> there<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
there are a few more tax there is the

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.480 
there are a few more tax there is the
maximum<00:01:54.810> by<00:01:54.930> entities<00:01:55.290> tag<00:01:55.710> which<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.130> fairly

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
maximum by entities tag which is fairly

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.830 
maximum by entities tag which is fairly
simple<00:01:56.850> now<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.330> know<00:01:57.479> what<00:01:57.600> entities

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
simple now that you know what entities

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.200 
simple now that you know what entities
are<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:59.009> need<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.400> know<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.850> that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
are all you really need to know is that

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.370 
are all you really need to know is that
what<00:02:00.330> you're<00:02:00.450> doing<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:00.840> checking<00:02:01.049> for

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
what you're doing is checking for

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.350 
what you're doing is checking for
entities<00:02:01.830> of<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> same<00:02:02.460> type<00:02:02.880> that's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
entities of the same type that's

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.780 
entities of the same type that's
transport<00:02:04.020> which<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.740> shown<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.280> identity

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790

ID<00:02:05.939> tag<00:02:06.270> next<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.680> discuss<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.159> spawn

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
ID tag next we can discuss the spawn

ID tag next we can discuss the spawn
range<00:02:08.700> type<00:02:08.939> now<00:02:09.420> personally<00:02:09.689> I<00:02:09.929> can't<00:02:10.140> be

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
range type now personally I can't be

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.809 
range type now personally I can't be
100%<00:02:10.379> sure<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:10.979> what<00:02:11.189> it's<00:02:11.340> supposed<00:02:11.579> to<00:02:11.670> do

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
100% sure on what it's supposed to do

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.280 
100% sure on what it's supposed to do
because<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.360> only<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.750> where<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.989> know<00:02:13.170> about

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
because I only know where I know about

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.199 
because I only know where I know about
this<00:02:13.590> by<00:02:13.769> conducting<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.280> few<00:02:14.489> experiments

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
this by conducting a few experiments

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.270 
this by conducting a few experiments
hence<00:02:15.569> what<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.020> can<00:02:16.230> deduce<00:02:16.470> about<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.890> tag<00:02:17.099> is

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
hence what I can deduce about the tag is

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.870 
hence what I can deduce about the tag is
there<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.849> value<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.390> our<00:02:18.510> spawn

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
there it's the value that our spawn

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.120 
there it's the value that our spawn
users<00:02:19.240> as<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.630> radius<00:02:20.230> for<00:02:20.470> region<00:02:20.920> their

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
users as a radius for region their

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.800 
users as a radius for region their
checks<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.790> see<00:02:22.030> if<00:02:22.240> there<00:02:22.570> are<00:02:22.660> enough

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
checks to see if there are enough

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.130 
checks to see if there are enough
entities<00:02:23.320> in<00:02:23.920> based<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.210> max<00:02:25.750> nearby

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
entities in based on the max nearby

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.160 
entities in based on the max nearby
entities<00:02:26.560> ready<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.630> make<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.990> little

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
entities ready so to make it a little

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.300 
entities ready so to make it a little
bit<00:02:29.260> more<00:02:29.410> simple<00:02:29.620> I'm<00:02:29.830> gonna<00:02:30.040> give<00:02:30.220> an

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
bit more simple I'm gonna give an

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.430 
bit more simple I'm gonna give an
example<00:02:30.670> if<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.540> max<00:02:31.750> made<00:02:31.990> by<00:02:32.110> entities

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
example if the max made by entities

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.430 
example if the max made by entities
value<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.070> 6<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.580> spawn<00:02:34.240> range<00:02:34.540> value<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.080> 10

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
value is 6 and spawn range value is 10

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.390 
value is 6 and spawn range value is 10
if<00:02:35.650> we<00:02:36.490> have<00:02:36.850> 6<00:02:37.240> entities<00:02:37.660> in<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.740> region<00:02:39.310> of

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
if we have 6 entities in the region of

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.860 
if we have 6 entities in the region of
temple<00:02:39.850> ox<00:02:40.000> from<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.510> spawner

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
temple ox from the spawner

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.260 
temple ox from the spawner
then<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:42.040> believe<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.670> won't<00:02:42.880> spawn<00:02:43.120> again

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
then I believe that won't spawn again

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.510 
then I believe that won't spawn again
but<00:02:44.110> if<00:02:44.260> one<00:02:44.470> end<00:02:44.620> still<00:02:44.830> goes<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.040> leave<00:02:45.310> the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
but if one end still goes to leave the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.880 
but if one end still goes to leave the
region<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.720> be<00:02:47.020> more<00:02:47.260> than<00:02:47.440> 10<00:02:47.680> blocks

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
region and to be more than 10 blocks

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.860 
region and to be more than 10 blocks
away<00:02:48.040> then<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.790> spawner<00:02:49.060> will<00:02:49.300> spawn<00:02:49.600> again

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
away then the spawner will spawn again

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.930 
away then the spawner will spawn again
because<00:02:50.380> it's<00:02:50.650> no<00:02:50.860> longer<00:02:51.190> within<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.670> region

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
because it's no longer within the region

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.730 
because it's no longer within the region
and<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.600> will<00:02:52.720> spawn<00:02:52.990> until<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.380> value<00:02:53.620> is

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
and it will spawn until the value is

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.210 
and it will spawn until the value is
satisfied<00:02:54.160> again<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.350> low<00:02:56.590> complicated

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
satisfied again so it is low complicated

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.370 
satisfied again so it is low complicated
but<00:02:57.760> another<00:02:58.030> tag<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.570> can<00:02:58.720> lead<00:02:58.960> on<00:02:59.140> quite

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
but another tag that can lead on quite

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.290 
but another tag that can lead on quite
nicely<00:02:59.620> from<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.100> one<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.670> sperm<00:03:01.000> count

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
nicely from this one is the sperm count

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.710 
nicely from this one is the sperm count
tag<00:03:01.660> now<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.710> fairly<00:03:02.950> self-explanatory

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
tag now this is fairly self-explanatory

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.820 
tag now this is fairly self-explanatory
basically<00:03:04.720> it's<00:03:04.960> the<00:03:05.110> amount<00:03:05.290> of<00:03:05.380> entities

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
basically it's the amount of entities

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.920 
basically it's the amount of entities
that<00:03:06.160> would<00:03:06.280> actually<00:03:06.580> be<00:03:06.700> spawned<00:03:07.150> each<00:03:07.480> time

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
that would actually be spawned each time

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.430 
that would actually be spawned each time
the<00:03:08.230> current<00:03:08.680> delay<00:03:08.920> value<00:03:09.100> reaches<00:03:09.700> 0<00:03:10.410> now<00:03:11.410> I

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
the current delay value reaches 0 now I

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.750 
the current delay value reaches 0 now I
think<00:03:11.740> we<00:03:11.800> should<00:03:11.950> actually<00:03:12.010> have<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.310> look<00:03:12.520> at

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
think we should actually have a look at

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.820 
think we should actually have a look at
how<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.210> get<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.780> all<00:03:13.900> this<00:03:14.050> data<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.500> have<00:03:14.800> a

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
how to get to all this data and have a

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.250 
how to get to all this data and have a
look<00:03:15.070> for<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.370> for<00:03:15.490> yourself<00:03:15.880> but<00:03:16.810> first<00:03:17.080> of

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
look for it for yourself but first of

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.530 
look for it for yourself but first of
all<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:18.130> are<00:03:18.670> gonna<00:03:18.820> have<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:18.970> make<00:03:19.210> a<00:03:19.240> spawner

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
all you are gonna have to make a spawner

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.300 
all you are gonna have to make a spawner
and<00:03:19.780> unfortunately<00:03:20.710> we<00:03:20.890> just<00:03:20.920> don't<00:03:21.220> have

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
and unfortunately we just don't have

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.920 
and unfortunately we just don't have
enough<00:03:21.370> time<00:03:21.580> for<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.180> episode<00:03:22.540> so

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
enough time for that this episode so

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.420 
enough time for that this episode so
stay<00:03:23.170> tuned<00:03:23.410> for<00:03:23.620> part<00:03:23.770> 3<00:03:24.070> where<00:03:24.250> we'll<00:03:24.340> be

stay tuned for part 3 where we'll be

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.040 
stay tuned for part 3 where we'll be
