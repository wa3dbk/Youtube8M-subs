00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 wow welcome to an app spotlight 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.290
 in this spotlight we will see the rigor of 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.510
 the skills of soracÃ¡ and the new 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.160
 karma skin the new skin of karma is 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.900
 the one on the left and I'm going to 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.030
 leave as the spear the skills the back 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.619
 the recall and death the truth is that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.630
 almost have not changed the particles have 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.060
 pretty little thing changed so 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.539
 I suppose its price will be in 1975 rivers 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.539
 points 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.240
 in the Caribbean 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.980
 from cadivi 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.390
 6 the third April 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.670
 the Adrian III 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.730
 Y 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.120
 never plan 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.120
 ah 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.339
 you already the mats 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.220
 terrible 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.909
 Now let's go with the work of our 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.500
 alone removes the passive we get a lot 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.929
 Movement speed when we run 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.759
 towards allies with little life and in addition 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.649
 just here transformed to the armor of 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.659
 magic resistance in power of ability 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.360
 We will not talk about percentage as 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.229
 this rigor that is still very fresh or 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.179
 that will change the percentages 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.640
 possibly totally that they have to 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.590
 test it and other the cv happens to be a 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.600
 skillsoft and it does more damage is in the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.659
 center and we will also recover life by 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.119
 each goal achieved the w we recover 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.159
 life to an ally or minion and stability 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.560
 it will cost us life and if we are in 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.079
 life will not let us use it and the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.939
 we went to silence in the area and also if 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.090
 the enemies are kept in this zone 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.250
 we're going to catch them and the ultimate is going to 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.140
 continue the same in my opinion let's see 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.000
 a single face that will be support yes or 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.979
 yes and it is going to tanker a lot and it's going to 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.450
 look pretty damn to me the truth 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.369
 is that this reboot is going to molar 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.709
 Pretty, although I do not want to have enough 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.329
 almost in the opposite team I hope that 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.670
 if you liked the video , continue like this 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.410
 give it a like to flip it if you want 16 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.829
 of subscribed their children and we see the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.829
 following
