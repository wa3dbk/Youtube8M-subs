00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.130
 each and I press start for the 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.810
 two for those little puffs 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.140
 tutorial let's see you go you have 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.460
 a small button to shoot at the body at 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.740

 you can still still 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.380

 galipettes that makes you invincible so 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.110
 enough shit and you'll see 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.010
 ok + comm is invincible that's what 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.180
 repeat it's a pretty good one when there is 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.350
 really too many shots you make a 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.930
 galipette through it's good it goes 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.790
 and it's for 100 g the character 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.300
 because you can play tag tag 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.260

 aufeminin I do not know any more life nantes

 no more life but against that 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.390
 fact that these themes not only grenades 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.220
 and there you can have an intruder 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.140
 personally it does not deconcentrate 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.180
 wrong i just want to take the normal guy 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.020
 I grant will take him the big 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.530
 manor corner it was a ca t3 alas 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.180
 too favorable to the coastal passes 24.3 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.890
 exact john rambo with oiled torso 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.420
 discovered suddenly we will play in the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.030
 Young handsome and yeah it's easier 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.150
 no it's the thing when you do 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.470
 ase here's another little bonus live 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.410
 I will not like you very much this game 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.530
 people invited the bonus because 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.570
 you're fat there their double drug 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.490
 submachine gun me caesar 10 there are 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.600
 characters are really really 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.580
 different it was double metra is to 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.510
 maybe only 15 grenades 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.220
 I do not know at all what this 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.160
 nahd times there are some that kind of launches 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.750
 flames of other things really 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.980
 really very good and I'm pretty 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.260
 I know that's why he is 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.540
 really very very good at aja in 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.739
 did the announced the course 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.260
 even more rotten than the one I had 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.870
 from before yes it's clear tan by 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.329
 grenade to me I gas balance I the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.069
 gas and a half we had our request 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.019
 so you knew that actually this species 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.069
 of the seven defeats zoom on the neogeo the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.750
 gohelle who jumps 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.700
 in fact it is that even when one fights 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.079
 against these little guys actually they 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.049
 are completely zoom out because the 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.310
 neo geo is unable to zoom 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.450
 true god of true zuma can do that 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.500
 zooms so in fact the 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.150
 characters will be loaded into the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.430
 cartridge directly a resolution 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.329
 completely crazy and that's why 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.829
 suddenly the zooms are impressive 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.359
 neo geo and pixellise pass because in 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.220
 made of basic characters and super 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.720
 big big would take almost all the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.739
 console resolution I was 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.590
 it's pretty dense me I 'll soon 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:35.889
 dead to shit in france to make 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:37.299
 jerks so that your shit I took 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.090
 I had a good show in the war 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.700
 thomas late one thing that crashed into three 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.290
 directions the footsteps of life that drags 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.239
 somewhere suddenly looks looks 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.939
 me this tragic night that I have this 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.299
 he's fine 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:53.950
 bull and cohabit small molds to 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:04:00.040
 but then 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.780
 the arrival of another vulcain there 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.760
 I would love to fuck Ime 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.680
 'm typing it will die tonight 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.090
 surely better life from time to time 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.709
 we gain the strength in this Wednesday 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.170
 credit is good it's not politically 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.099
 the trials going to be ridiculous if 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.859
 I pop in after two minutes it will 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.120
 not do it yeah it's after must 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.510
 everything changes is also a young ariege 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.489
 aveyron 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.200
 it's really a very very good title 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.320
 who is frankly it's a 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:31.840
 helicopter the sirtaki by the whore 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:33.070
 beware of your doubts by 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.150
 against obviously benefit for him 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.070
 swing grenades at the mouth because 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.020
 that in fact I realize that the 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.250
 stocha twisted the neck all over the place and 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.139
 grenade like a big pig final 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.850
 let me die I 'm still doing a 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.540
 time I 'm good but because in 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.440
 first excuse 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.910
 during that time I think we have 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.200
 two lives like that balance weighs everything 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.600
 what you have but I can not do 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.919
 the gap of hers to nine times the joystick 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:00.960
 at the end of a greenhouse like that I 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.960
 physically felt the pain or their 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:13.150
 exit I try but the gas and that's it 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.889
 olala is mortal for tokyo the blade and 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.650
 I am not what I have as gas me 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:21.180
 hurts too much waiting welcomes 15 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.930
 in 38 spawn in the book 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.280
 it reassures me it's almost as 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.650
 bad that me you die life bar 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.810
 it was still far away because I confess 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.490
 that it starts to find what it is 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.539
 really hard this first product towards 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.830
 10am where it's hot there oh shit 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.949
 allowed that by the airs of ja rule 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.240
 for most credit these encounters 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:45.789
 it's really cruel in the saddle it's the 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:48.999
 fast war alienated just where it's 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.039
 get attacked by a wesh wesh game 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.120
 I think it was a dog 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.490
 that she was coming back if you want 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:59.169
 first but the backups to nothing of the 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.219
 everything else if it was going hyrule you 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.379
 can even kill people that they were 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.949
 saving what because a little 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:04.990
 everyone 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:07.960
 that means the war is that of 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.659
 anger what is it that one 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.960
 know what it's like this thing what the 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:15.400
 dude he's over shit and fucking but 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.460
 like you take grenades in the 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.300
 cube what interesting to have played well 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.930
 so there by cons my man 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.930
 do not run out of breath 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.750
 you can get there organ had to leave 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.490
 quietly take a nap 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:36.460
 I still have 20 grenade what I want 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:41.290
 to do better or rather any one that is 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:42.580
 it's hard what web so good it 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.880
 so I do not know how long it took 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.690
 tough 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.400
 but good as what the union does not do 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.370
 necessarily force when we do a 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.950
 union with the streets on Saturday is a good 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.230
