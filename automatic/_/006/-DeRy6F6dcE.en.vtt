I<00:00:12.740> was<00:00:13.740> raised<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.120> thing<00:00:15.389> my<00:00:16.170> parents

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
I was raised with this thing my parents

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.380 
I was raised with this thing my parents
bought<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.710> new<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.279> don't<00:00:18.029> know<00:00:18.119> if<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.300> was

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
bought it new I don't know if it was

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.269 
bought it new I don't know if it was
before<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.810> was<00:00:18.900> born<00:00:18.960> or<00:00:19.380> shortly<00:00:19.680> afterwards

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
before I was born or shortly afterwards

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.230 
before I was born or shortly afterwards
but<00:00:22.039> it's<00:00:23.039> pretty<00:00:23.939> decent<00:00:25.310> better<00:00:26.310> than<00:00:26.550> I'd

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
but it's pretty decent better than I'd

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.730 
but it's pretty decent better than I'd
like<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.660> think<00:00:28.640> it<00:00:29.640> does<00:00:29.849> need<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> couple

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
like to think it does need a couple

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.190 
like to think it does need a couple
minor<00:00:31.740> things<00:00:32.130> here<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.579> there

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
minor things here and there

minor things here and there
for<00:00:34.200> example<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.860> they're<00:00:35.610> supposed<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> be

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
for example this they're supposed to be

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.650 
for example this they're supposed to be
the<00:00:36.329> push<00:00:36.719> button<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.410> release<00:00:37.710> us<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.660> it's

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the push button to release us and it's

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.040 
the push button to release us and it's
broken<00:00:40.020> off<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.550> transmission<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.840> is

getting this thing back to its former

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.609 
getting this thing back to its former
glory<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:12.450> could<00:01:12.600> use<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> polishing<00:01:13.229> there's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619

some<00:01:13.830> little<00:01:14.070> bits<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.460> stuff<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.060> I'm

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
some little bits of stuff there and I'm

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.920 
some little bits of stuff there and I'm
still<00:01:15.360> not<00:01:15.450> sure<00:01:15.540> what<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:17.659> the<00:01:18.659> bag

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
still not sure what that is the bag

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.270

could be cleaned

could be cleaned
that<00:01:23.280> could<00:01:23.549> use<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.210> once-over<00:01:24.600> but

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that could use is just a once-over but

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.270 
that could use is just a once-over but
it<00:01:25.110> would<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.350> perfect<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.640> did<00:01:26.820> so

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
it would be perfect if it did so

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.179 
it would be perfect if it did so
performance<00:01:29.390> huh<00:01:30.450> speaking<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.049> which<00:01:31.200> it's

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189

fourteen model 514 from 1954 and being

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that it's 60 years old it's got a lot of

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.560 
that it's 60 years old it's got a lot of
power<00:01:49.939> this<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> step<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.829> sure<00:01:53.570> so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
power this one is a step up for sure so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.539 
power this one is a step up for sure so
when<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.409> first<00:01:55.770> turn<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.070> on<00:01:56.189> you'll<00:01:56.369> notice

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
when I first turn it on you'll notice

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.050 
when I first turn it on you'll notice
that<00:01:56.969> well<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:58.200> should<00:01:58.409> probably<00:01:58.820> know<00:01:59.820> this

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that well you should probably know this

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.660 
that well you should probably know this
but<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:01.320> first<00:02:01.560> thing<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.799> hear<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:02.250> air

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
but the first thing you hear is just air

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.859 
but the first thing you hear is just air
flow<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.619> massively<00:02:04.619> powerful

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.030 

and<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:10.960> does<00:02:11.110> slow<00:02:11.350> down<00:02:11.380> pretty<00:02:11.860> quick

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
and it does slow down pretty quick

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.950 
and it does slow down pretty quick
because<00:02:12.100> it's<00:02:12.370> got<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:12.520> new<00:02:12.670> belt<00:02:12.850> on<00:02:13.060> but

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
because it's got a new belt on but

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.320 
because it's got a new belt on but
that's<00:02:14.260> unlike<00:02:15.160> any<00:02:15.400> other<00:02:15.610> machine<00:02:16.030> it's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
that's unlike any other machine it's

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.070 
that's unlike any other machine it's
just<00:02:16.720> all<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:17.980> hear<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.490> pure<00:02:19.000> airflow<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
just all you hear is pure airflow the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.830 
just all you hear is pure airflow the
fan<00:02:20.350> is<00:02:20.530> huge<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.630> other<00:02:22.750> thing

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
fan is huge and this is the other thing

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.190 
fan is huge and this is the other thing
the<00:02:23.260> last<00:02:23.290> thing<00:02:23.620> we<00:02:23.709> had<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:23.950> worked<00:02:24.100> on<00:02:24.280> her<00:02:24.459> a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
the last thing we had it worked on her a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.190 
the last thing we had it worked on her a
while<00:02:26.200> back<00:02:26.470> we<00:02:26.830> had<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.820> fill<00:02:28.060> tube<00:02:28.300> system

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
while back we had the fill tube system

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.010 
while back we had the fill tube system
upgraded<00:02:29.650> apparently<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:31.360> think<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:31.840> is

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
upgraded apparently and I think that is

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.699 
upgraded apparently and I think that is
the<00:02:32.230> newest<00:02:32.620> style<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.430> mini<00:02:34.270> mTOR<00:02:34.720> found<00:02:35.560> on

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
the newest style of mini mTOR found on

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.430 
the newest style of mini mTOR found on
the<00:02:35.890> new<00:02:36.040> century<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.640> machines<00:02:37.440> that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
the new century of machines that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.870 
the new century of machines that
definitely<00:02:38.890> makes<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.100> difference<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.520> airflow

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
definitely makes a difference in airflow

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.390 
definitely makes a difference in airflow
and<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.090> bet<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:40.560> having<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.680> fan<00:02:41.920> cleaned

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
and I bet you having the fan cleaned

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.520 
and I bet you having the fan cleaned
during<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.060> once-over<00:02:43.480> or<00:02:43.750> maybe<00:02:43.959> even<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.350> fan

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
during a once-over or maybe even the fan

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.590 
during a once-over or maybe even the fan
replaced<00:02:44.950> would<00:02:45.820> make<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.120> even<00:02:46.239> better

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
replaced would make it even better

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.860 
replaced would make it even better
I<00:02:47.160> do<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.430> an<00:02:48.520> aftermarket<00:02:48.880> bag<00:02:49.390> installed

take<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.380> for<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.560> spin<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:28.019> can't<00:03:29.019> believe<00:03:29.290> how

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
take it for a spin I can't believe how

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.470 
take it for a spin I can't believe how
well<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:30.130> thing<00:03:30.280> works<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.970> don't<00:03:31.239> know<00:03:31.329> what

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
well this thing works I don't know what

00:03:31.480 --> 00:04:44.650 
well this thing works I don't know what
my<00:03:31.630> issue<00:03:31.750> is

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.090 

you'll<00:04:45.660> notice<00:04:45.930> when<00:04:46.080> I<00:04:46.200> shut<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.470> down<00:04:46.590> that's

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
you'll notice when I shut it down that's

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.850 
you'll notice when I shut it down that's
just<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.520> habit<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:47.910> mine<00:04:48.260> ever<00:04:49.260> since<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.650> first

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
just a habit of mine ever since I first

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.650 
just a habit of mine ever since I first
learned<00:04:50.100> how<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.220> use<00:04:50.460> this<00:04:50.670> thing<00:04:50.910> before<00:04:51.450> I

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
learned how to use this thing before I

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.030 
learned how to use this thing before I
shut<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:52.020> off<00:04:52.140> I<00:04:52.290> always<00:04:52.320> shifted<00:04:52.890> it<00:04:53.010> to

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
shut it off I always shifted it to

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.740 
shut it off I always shifted it to
neutral<00:04:53.600> mm-hmm

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
neutral mm-hmm

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.480 
neutral mm-hmm
I<00:04:54.780> guess<00:04:55.380> that's<00:04:55.620> also<00:04:55.950> one<00:04:56.340> of<00:04:56.370> the

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
I guess that's also one of the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.440 
I guess that's also one of the
characteristics<00:04:57.180> of<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.630> stick<00:04:58.350> driver<00:04:59.450> but

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
characteristics of a stick driver but

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.230 
characteristics of a stick driver but
anyways<00:05:01.670> there<00:05:02.670> you<00:05:02.790> go<00:05:04.640> find<00:05:05.640> machine<00:05:06.030> after

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
anyways there you go find machine after

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.760 
anyways there you go find machine after
all<00:05:06.540> I<00:05:06.840> hope<00:05:07.710> to<00:05:07.890> have<00:05:08.010> it<00:05:08.220> back<00:05:08.730> in<00:05:09.410> all<00:05:10.410> its

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
all I hope to have it back in all its

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.670 
all I hope to have it back in all its
radiant<00:05:11.370> chrome<00:05:12.300> glory<00:05:13.400> sometime<00:05:14.400> soon
