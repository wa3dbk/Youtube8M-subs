the<00:01:05.430> zombies<00:01:05.820> franchise<00:01:06.420> I've<00:01:06.960> always<00:01:07.350> wanted

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the zombies franchise I've always wanted

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.889 
the zombies franchise I've always wanted
to<00:01:08.009> see<00:01:08.220> someone<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.270> samurai<00:01:09.780> sword

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
to see someone like have a samurai sword

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.140 
to see someone like have a samurai sword
and<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.350> actually<00:01:10.500> referenced<00:01:11.490> samurais

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and they actually referenced samurais

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.000 
and they actually referenced samurais
during<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> trailer<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.560> think<00:01:13.680> that's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
during the trailer so I think that's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.090 
during the trailer so I think that's
awesome<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:15.000> look<00:01:15.270> at<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.420> that's<00:01:15.689> badass

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
not only is it badass because it's a

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.840 
not only is it badass because it's a
sword<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.740> has<00:01:19.890> these<00:01:20.070> elements<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.760> so
