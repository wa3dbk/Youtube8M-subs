touch<00:00:14.940> what<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> gesture<00:00:16.650> based

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
touch what it is is a gesture based

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.980 
touch what it is is a gesture based
technology<00:00:17.990> that<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.199> transform<00:00:19.619> any<00:00:19.830> screen

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
technology that can transform any screen

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.960 
technology that can transform any screen
here<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> plasma<00:00:22.470> plasma<00:00:23.160> screen<00:00:23.550> we

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
here we have a plasma plasma screen we

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.849 
here we have a plasma plasma screen we
can<00:00:24.119> transform<00:00:24.480> any<00:00:24.689> any<00:00:25.080> screen<00:00:25.680> like<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
can transform any any screen like a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.670 
can transform any any screen like a

into<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.310> touchscreen<00:00:29.840> okay<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.590> have

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
into a touchscreen okay so what we have

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.959 
into a touchscreen okay so what we have
here<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> simple<00:00:32.369> setup<00:00:32.640> wherever<00:00:33.450> any

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
here is a simple setup wherever any

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.330 
here is a simple setup wherever any
connected<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.239> TV<00:00:37.230> through<00:00:38.100> an<00:00:38.190> HDMI

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
connected to this TV through an HDMI

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.729 
connected to this TV through an HDMI
cable<00:00:38.960> we've<00:00:39.960> installed<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.500> small

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
cable we've installed a small

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.650 
cable we've installed a small
application<00:00:41.040> very<00:00:41.579> small<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.320> 3834<00:00:43.320> KB<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
application very small it's 3834 KB and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.490 
application very small it's 3834 KB and
what<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.260> here<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:48.170> two<00:00:49.170> types<00:00:49.350> of

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
what we can do here is two types of

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.560 
what we can do here is two types of
gestures<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> click<00:00:50.670> function

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.480 

right<00:00:56.110> and<00:00:56.710> we<00:00:56.800> also<00:00:56.950> have<00:00:57.100> vertical

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
right and we also have vertical

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.660 
right and we also have vertical
scrolling

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.880 

and<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.019> important<00:01:04.470> because<00:01:04.500> we're

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
and this is important because we're

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.110 
and this is important because we're
trying<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> figure<00:01:05.280> out<00:01:05.400> how<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> take<00:01:05.940> the

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
trying to figure out how to take the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.380 
trying to figure out how to take the
touchscreen<00:01:06.620> experience<00:01:08.120> away<00:01:09.120> from<00:01:09.300> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
touchscreen experience away from the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.780 
touchscreen experience away from the
touchscreen<00:01:09.979> right<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.490> why<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
touchscreen right and why is that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.550 
touchscreen right and why is that
important<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.570> important<00:01:12.960> because<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.260> need

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
important it's important because we need

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.890 
important it's important because we need
to<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:14.550> we<00:01:14.820> see<00:01:14.970> more<00:01:15.000> development<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.750> like

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
to as we see more development and like

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.600 
to as we see more development and like
augmented<00:01:16.409> reality<00:01:17.119> even<00:01:18.119> 3d<00:01:18.420> UI<00:01:18.830> right<00:01:19.830> we're

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
augmented reality even 3d UI right we're

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.920 
augmented reality even 3d UI right we're
gonna<00:01:20.700> need<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.000> figure<00:01:21.240> out<00:01:21.330> how<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.570> leverage

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
gonna need to figure out how to leverage

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.230 
gonna need to figure out how to leverage
the<00:01:22.200> sensors<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> camera<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:24.000> track

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the sensors of the camera to track

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.030 
the sensors of the camera to track
gestures<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.409> interact<00:01:25.680> with

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
gestures so that we can interact with

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.380 
gestures so that we can interact with
the<00:01:26.159> content<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.759> surroundings<00:01:27.270> that

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the content or the surroundings that

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.780 
the content or the surroundings that
we're<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.020> we're<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:29.220> for<00:01:29.490> example

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
we're that we're in so for example

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.200 
we're that we're in so for example
you've<00:01:29.909> seen<00:01:30.119> I'm<00:01:30.590> assuming<00:01:31.590> you've<00:01:31.680> seen<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
you've seen I'm assuming you've seen a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.810 
you've seen I'm assuming you've seen a
Iron<00:01:33.210> Man<00:01:33.420> right<00:01:34.190> you<00:01:35.190> know<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.430> his<00:01:35.550> lab<00:01:35.789> he

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
Iron Man right you know in his lab he

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.910 
Iron Man right you know in his lab he
has<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.330> these<00:01:36.450> 3d<00:01:36.840> things<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.440> he's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
has like these 3d things and he's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.160 
has like these 3d things and he's
interacting<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> air<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.750> day<00:01:39.899> one<00:01:40.140> day

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
interacting in the air one day one day

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.660 
interacting in the air one day one day
I'd<00:01:40.350> love<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.649> see<00:01:40.830> this<00:01:40.979> right<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.550> have<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
I'd love to see this right we have a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.419 
I'd love to see this right we have a
device<00:01:42.710> pops<00:01:43.710> up<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.009> UI<00:01:44.550> in<00:01:45.539> the<00:01:45.630> air<00:01:46.310> that<00:01:47.310> we

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
device pops up a UI in the air that we

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.389 
device pops up a UI in the air that we
can<00:01:47.580> interact<00:01:47.789> with<00:01:49.039> right<00:01:50.039> that<00:01:50.280> would<00:01:50.340> be

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
can interact with right that would be

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.040 
can interact with right that would be
really<00:01:50.640> really<00:01:50.670> cool<00:01:50.850> right<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.660> in<00:01:51.750> order<00:01:51.960> to

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
really really cool right but in order to

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.419 
really really cool right but in order to
do<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.679> to<00:01:52.800> be<00:01:52.920> able<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.100> figure<00:01:53.310> out

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
do that we have to be able to figure out

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.029 
do that we have to be able to figure out
how<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.759> interact<00:01:54.690> with<00:01:54.929> them<00:01:55.200> how<00:01:55.679> can<00:01:55.950> this

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
how to interact with them how can this

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.130 
how to interact with them how can this
device<00:01:56.429> track<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.420> gestures<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.810> were<00:01:58.020> you

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
device track the gestures that were you

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.440 
device track the gestures that were you
that<00:01:58.740> we're<00:01:58.920> doing<00:01:59.060> so<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.179> is<00:02:00.300> very

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that we're doing so this is very

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.210 
that we're doing so this is very
important<00:02:00.929> this<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.050> our<00:02:01.140> first<00:02:01.380> step<00:02:01.619> into

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
important this is our first step into

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.719 
important this is our first step into
getting<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.910> point<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:04.250> guess<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.399> sit<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
getting to that point I guess I sit a

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.270 
getting to that point I guess I sit a
simple<00:02:06.179> way<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.300> explain<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.829> camera

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
simple way to explain is that the camera

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.340 
simple way to explain is that the camera
is<00:02:08.369> trying<00:02:08.579> to<00:02:08.729> sense<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.600> difference<00:02:09.810> of

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
is trying to sense the difference of

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.850 
is trying to sense the difference of
movement<00:02:11.040> from<00:02:11.370> one<00:02:11.610> frame<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:11.940> another<00:02:12.120> frame

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
movement from one frame to another frame

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.580 
movement from one frame to another frame
right<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.730> for<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.940> click<00:02:15.180> function<00:02:15.590> we

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
right and so for the click function we

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.190 
right and so for the click function we
have<00:02:16.829> it<00:02:16.950> we're<00:02:17.160> using<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.459> timeout<00:02:17.700> at<00:02:18.600> 0.5

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
have it we're using a timeout at 0.5

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.800 
have it we're using a timeout at 0.5
seconds<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:20.880> if<00:02:21.030> our<00:02:21.150> finger<00:02:21.510> doesn't

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
seconds and so if our finger doesn't

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.260 
seconds and so if our finger doesn't
move<00:02:21.959> for<00:02:22.260> 0.5<00:02:22.620> seconds

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
move for 0.5 seconds

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.010 
move for 0.5 seconds
it<00:02:24.840> initiates<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:26.040> click<00:02:26.280> function<00:02:26.670> as<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.810> said

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
it initiates a click function as I said

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.140 
it initiates a click function as I said
this<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.320> research<00:02:28.620> prototype<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.850> it's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
this is a research prototype so it's

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.810 
this is a research prototype so it's
going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.390> help<00:02:30.480> us<00:02:30.830> create<00:02:31.830> new<00:02:32.070> experiences

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
going to help us create new experiences

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.050 
going to help us create new experiences
new<00:02:33.570> new<00:02:33.960> new<00:02:33.990> products<00:02:34.650> for<00:02:34.830> future<00:02:35.250> for

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
new new new products for future for

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.720 
new new new products for future for
future<00:02:36.090> gesture<00:02:37.020> gesture<00:02:37.590> based<00:02:37.740> experiences

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
future gesture gesture based experiences

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.570 
future gesture gesture based experiences
right<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.620> but<00:02:40.620> what<00:02:40.830> we<00:02:40.920> see<00:02:41.070> here<00:02:41.280> today<00:02:41.430> is

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
right so but what we see here today is

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.810 
right so but what we see here today is
what<00:02:41.880> what<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.080> far<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.670> but<00:02:44.670> you'll

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
what what we have so far and but you'll

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.570 
what what we have so far and but you'll
probably<00:02:44.910> see<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.510> lot<00:02:46.080> more<00:02:46.280> coming<00:02:47.280> from<00:02:47.370> us

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
probably see a lot more coming from us

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.540 
probably see a lot more coming from us
in<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.300> area
