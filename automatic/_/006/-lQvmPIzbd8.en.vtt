gold<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.550> that's<00:04:28.730> pretty<00:04:29.000> cool<00:04:29.300> but<00:04:30.110> again<00:04:30.770> if

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
gold and that's pretty cool but again if

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.000 
gold and that's pretty cool but again if
you<00:04:30.980> see<00:04:31.190> like<00:04:32.080> my<00:04:33.080> unboxing<00:04:33.320> videos<00:04:33.800> are<00:04:33.950> the

you see like my unboxing videos are the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.560 
you see like my unboxing videos are the
random<00:04:34.160> boosters<00:04:34.730> and<00:04:34.940> stuff<00:04:35.180> you<00:04:35.450> know<00:04:35.540> you

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
random boosters and stuff you know you

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.120 
random boosters and stuff you know you
would<00:04:36.110> understand<00:04:36.500> why<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:36.680> really<00:04:36.980> hate

hate this metal wheel so much here's TR
145<00:04:43.250> I<00:04:43.580> don't<00:04:43.760> know<00:04:43.850> if<00:04:44.150> it's<00:04:44.300> good<00:04:44.540> for<00:04:44.960> the

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
145 I don't know if it's good for the

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.410 
145 I don't know if it's good for the
competitive<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:46.250> I<00:04:46.550> guess<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.300> would<00:04:47.390> be

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
competitive you I guess it would be

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.980 
competitive you I guess it would be
pretty<00:04:47.630> cool<00:04:47.870> because<00:04:48.520> these<00:04:49.520> three<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:50.900> know

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
pretty cool because these three you know

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.310 
pretty cool because these three you know
circular<00:04:51.560> things<00:04:52.040> they<00:04:52.520> move<00:04:52.790> so<00:04:53.390> I<00:04:53.690> guess<00:04:54.170> the

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
circular things they move so I guess the

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.100 
circular things they move so I guess the
defense<00:04:54.710> would<00:04:54.860> be<00:04:55.150> rosin<00:04:56.150> up<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.570> extreme

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
defense would be rosin up to the extreme

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
defense would be rosin up to the extreme
power<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:58.190> no<00:04:58.910> no<00:04:59.150> and<00:04:59.720> here's<00:04:59.960> F<00:05:00.230> be<00:05:00.560> one<00:05:00.950> of<00:05:01.040> my
