 who created sergio massa when he took over as Tiger Intendant 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:18.939
 p a simulation in a company so that that area and in the red zone ricardo 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.679
 in the tiger game 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.890
 where is simulated 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.640
 an escape of a highly dangerous florohydrogen chemical product 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.689
 and from there p good all the necessary protocols so that the 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.130
 security forces act in real time without knowledge of them 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.250
 they are summoned to the police to make the perimeter fence the address of 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.500
 transit 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.190
 cd firefighters 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.020
 is from the detachment Ricardo Red and General Pacheco who come to the place 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.870
 the company that has its own security protocols 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.140
 where the people in charge of security take the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.140
 first measures until it is the security force to ambulances 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.850
 cc do mock wounded and good of all the work to be prepared 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.119
 in the case that a curriculum 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.829
 really an emergency all this training tends to strengthen the 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.550
 citizen protection system 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.000
 that from tiger operations center and constant defense training 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.070
 that depends on the secretariat the articulation with the firefighters and the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.460
 ambulances the traffic direction and the different security forces 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.890
 gendarmerie police prefecture 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.210
 all working with an agile communications system 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.670
 to be prepared for an emergency and protect citizens 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.140
 of general good 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.100
 of any type of insecurity that may occur in this case with accidents 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.660
 The usual practices of this type of situations 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.680
 because although we work a lot of focus on security 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.210
 the most important thing to be really prepared in case we have some day 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.370
 some kind of emergency this guy what we could see was that everything was 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.180
 perfectly well mitigated the ambulances work perfectly well 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.030
 We simulate wounded who were transferred properly and an emergency end with 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.700
 in the reincorporation of the personnel to their work post to homogenize a 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.509
 run 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.109
 where we are going to march opens with the authorities of the company with the 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.669
 different security forces according to cionet endorsement we have taking the times 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:22.259
 desired from the different security forces and all this serves to give 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:26.520
 account and maybe you have to tune in a certain place that is necessary 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.900
 such equipment that we encounter some problem 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.660
 specific so that the day something really happens that we hope will not be 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.940
 but always percent you have to be depleted emergency shovels I've been better 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.770
 trained possible especially the security force that has to act and 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.450
 also constantly auditing through civil defense everything that 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.080
 is the afp the environmental policies of the municipality in conjunction with 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.780
 other governmental bodies auditing that each of the companies 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.960
 the industries that operate the party comply with all the rules of 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.510
 security because you have to prevent any kind of emergency
