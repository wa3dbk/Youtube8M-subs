00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
this is mario oh that's all the stars we

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.890 
this is mario oh that's all the stars we
can<00:04:11.799> get<00:04:12.040> hit<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.670> fourth<00:04:12.910> observatory<00:04:13.629> for

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
can get hit the fourth observatory for

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.069 
can get hit the fourth observatory for
now<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.790> i<00:04:15.819> guess<00:04:16.120> we<00:04:16.329> get<00:04:16.449> to<00:04:16.510> go<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.840> enemy
