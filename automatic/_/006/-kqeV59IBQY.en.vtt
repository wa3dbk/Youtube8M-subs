the Eddie fauna m22 80s so there are
small<00:00:32.960> multimedia<00:00:34.089> speaker<00:00:35.089> as<00:00:35.960> you<00:00:36.019> can<00:00:36.230> see

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
small multimedia speaker as you can see

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.319 
small multimedia speaker as you can see
I<00:00:38.079> do<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:39.290> design<00:00:39.620> I<00:00:39.980> believe<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:40.489> put<00:00:40.910> into

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
I do the design I believe to put into

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.759 
I do the design I believe to put into
something<00:00:42.320> like<00:00:42.409> a<00:00:42.470> PC<00:00:42.979> or<00:00:43.400> Mac<00:00:43.820> computer<00:00:44.769> so

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
something like a PC or Mac computer so

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.500 
something like a PC or Mac computer so
you<00:00:45.830> have<00:00:46.100> your<00:00:46.640> line<00:00:46.909> in<00:00:47.830> your<00:00:48.830> speak<00:00:49.790> at<00:00:50.030> end

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
you have your line in your speak at end

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.689 
you have your line in your speak at end
so<00:00:50.659> this<00:00:50.839> speaker<00:00:51.140> goes<00:00:51.440> into<00:00:51.890> there<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.369> then

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
so this speaker goes into there and then

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.229 
so this speaker goes into there and then
you<00:00:52.790> power<00:00:53.059> it<00:00:53.119> on<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:54.860> side<00:00:55.100> here<00:00:55.129> your<00:00:56.119> the

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
you power it on the side here your the

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.259 
you power it on the side here your the
power<00:00:56.510> button<00:00:56.869> a<00:00:57.080> boil<00:00:57.619> up<00:00:57.769> and<00:00:57.890> down<00:00:58.269> great

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.630 
speaker I like the design design that
faded<00:01:19.310> lights<00:01:19.520> as<00:01:19.730> well

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640

faded lights as well
the<00:01:22.640> funky<00:01:23.150> design<00:01:23.300> really<00:01:25.150> so<00:01:26.230> earlier<00:01:27.230> I

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
the funky design really so earlier I

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.960 
the funky design really so earlier I
took<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.880> bear<00:01:29.510> video<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:30.140> me<00:01:30.500> playing<00:01:30.850> one<00:01:31.850> of

took a bear video of me playing one of
my<00:01:32.120> youtube<00:01:32.420> videos<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:32.840> could<00:01:32.990> hear<00:01:33.110> that

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
my youtube videos I could hear that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.840 
my youtube videos I could hear that
music<00:01:33.320> from<00:01:33.620> that<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:34.190> then<00:01:34.370> a<00:01:34.400> better<00:01:34.580> game

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
music from that and then a better game

00:01:34.850 --> 00:02:42.110 
music from that and then a better game
in<00:01:35.060> Todd's<00:01:35.360> for<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.170> unknown<00:01:36.560> food<00:01:36.770> listen<00:01:37.100> to

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:03:26.660 

to

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.390 

no<00:03:27.670> speaker<00:03:28.440> not<00:03:29.440> very<00:03:29.680> time<00:03:29.890> not<00:03:30.040> very<00:03:30.070> big

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
no speaker not very time not very big

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.320 
no speaker not very time not very big
small<00:03:30.730> footprint

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
small footprint

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.970 
small footprint
although<00:03:32.020> the<00:03:32.670> circle<00:03:33.670> there<00:03:33.850> yeah<00:03:34.980> footprint

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
although the circle there yeah footprint

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.520 
although the circle there yeah footprint
then<00:03:36.420> all<00:03:37.420> increase<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.930> footprint<00:03:38.260> doesn't

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
then all increase the footprint doesn't

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.910 
then all increase the footprint doesn't
say<00:03:39.840> gaming<00:03:40.840> wines<00:03:41.050> I<00:03:41.230> thought<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.560> same<00:03:41.740> was

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
say gaming wines I thought the same was

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.290 
say gaming wines I thought the same was
great<00:03:42.990> music<00:03:43.990> wise<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:44.650> was<00:03:44.770> fine<00:03:45.100> but<00:03:45.520> I<00:03:45.670> for

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
great music wise it was fine but I for

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.020 
great music wise it was fine but I for
me<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.840> sent<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.320> little<00:03:47.440> bit<00:03:47.650> tinny<00:03:47.860> so<00:03:48.730> I

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
me it sent a little bit tinny so I

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.240 
me it sent a little bit tinny so I
wouldn't<00:03:49.330> say<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.740> they're<00:03:50.740> great<00:03:51.010> for

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
wouldn't say that they're great for

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.420 
wouldn't say that they're great for
music<00:03:52.050> but<00:03:53.050> if<00:03:53.770> you<00:03:53.890> want<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.100> use<00:03:54.220> them<00:03:54.400> for

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
music but if you want to use them for

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.330 
music but if you want to use them for
general<00:03:55.270> purpose<00:03:55.660> speaker<00:03:55.989> on<00:03:56.200> your<00:03:56.410> computer

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
general purpose speaker on your computer

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.640 
general purpose speaker on your computer
then<00:03:57.630> burrow<00:03:58.630> means<00:03:58.870> they<00:03:59.020> are<00:03:59.140> definitely<00:03:59.560> a

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
then burrow means they are definitely a

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.430 
then burrow means they are definitely a
good<00:04:00.130> little<00:04:00.370> speaker<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:00.940> they<00:04:01.600> are<00:04:01.900> very

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
good little speaker and they are very

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.350 
good little speaker and they are very
simple<00:04:02.920> there's<00:04:03.340> not<00:04:03.520> a<00:04:03.550> lot<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.850> cable<00:04:04.180> into

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
simple there's not a lot of cable into

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.120 
simple there's not a lot of cable into
them<00:04:04.450> as<00:04:04.570> I<00:04:04.660> say<00:04:04.840> it's<00:04:05.410> just<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.620> power<00:04:05.860> cable

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
them as I say it's just a power cable

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.280 
them as I say it's just a power cable
the<00:04:07.030> cable<00:04:07.239> that<00:04:07.480> goes<00:04:07.540> into<00:04:07.930> your<00:04:08.230> computer

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
the cable that goes into your computer

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.560 
the cable that goes into your computer
and<00:04:08.950> then<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.430> cable<00:04:10.030> attached<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:10.510> the

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
and then the cable attached to the

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.160 
and then the cable attached to the
speakers<00:04:10.930> are<00:04:11.050> very<00:04:11.260> simple<00:04:11.739> no<00:04:12.330> real<00:04:13.330> lots<00:04:14.020> of

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
speakers are very simple no real lots of

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.069 
speakers are very simple no real lots of
cables<00:04:14.680> everywhere<00:04:15.329> but<00:04:16.329> as<00:04:16.480> I<00:04:16.600> say<00:04:16.780> if<00:04:16.930> you're

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
cables everywhere but as I say if you're

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.920 
cables everywhere but as I say if you're
looking<00:04:17.350> for<00:04:17.500> music<00:04:17.799> then<00:04:18.390> maybe<00:04:19.390> not<00:04:19.660> the

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
looking for music then maybe not the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.990 
looking for music then maybe not the
best<00:04:20.459> speakers<00:04:21.459> out<00:04:21.609> there<00:04:21.640> I<00:04:23.700> have<00:04:24.700> reviewed

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
best speakers out there I have reviewed

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.090 
best speakers out there I have reviewed
some<00:04:25.240> speakers<00:04:25.720> recently<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.590> more<00:04:26.890> much

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
some speakers recently that more much

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.710 
some speakers recently that more much
