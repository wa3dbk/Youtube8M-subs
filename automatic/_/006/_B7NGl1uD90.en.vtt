00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:04.819
 nicodemo fariseo and doctor of the Jewish law 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.579
 and it was night to meet with Jesus 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:09.849
 the topic 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.349
 how to get to the holiness necessary to enter the kingdom of heaven and the 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.820
 Jesus answer is very clear 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.270
 it is necessary for the common man to do again 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:27.789
 some Christian preachers usually very literal lists 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.649
 in this case they insist on assigning to that phrase of Jesus a meaning totally and 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:34.560
 figurative 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.600
 giving as meaning 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.070
 a spiritual renewal 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.860
 the problem with this 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.580
 is that the Greek adverb 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.280
 in the gospel of John 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.600
 mean 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.320
 of this one for that 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.950
 a the sense of repetition as the experts explain us 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.960
 like the Jewish sages before him 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.580
 he knew perfectly well that it was possible that he barely said goodbye 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.660
 the king poet of israel spoke already of the spiritual renovation in the same 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.920
 I believe in my hatred his clean heart and renew a spirit challenges within 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.000
 my 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.520
 they return the joy of your salvation and noble spirit in those tempe 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.280
 this was no new revelation for the Aunt prisons they did not know 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.930
 we can 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.510
 although discarding the 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.510
 they ask teacher something 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.789
 how can man go back into it 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.930
 the belly of his mother tub be again 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.470
 and Jesus answers him about how they should be done 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.140
 of water and spirit 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.010
 that clarifying nicodemo 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.330
 that what is born of the flesh meats 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
 it stops symbolically to the water 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.950
 what is born of the dismissal 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.220
 spirit 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.260
 adding 500 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
 both in Hebrew 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.179
 thank you very much 3 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.179
 nobody knows 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:23.419
 in when I'm going to read verses 2 through 4 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:28.339
 it is narrated that the disciples asked jesus if a blind man 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:32.929
 it was at birth because of his own sins or those of his parents 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.109
 and once again Jesus does not contradict and criticizes the belief manifested by the 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.209
 apostles that you can sin before you are born 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:47.689
 and then the dementia of those who fiercely attack the concept of reincarnation 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.709
 it is here to ask 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.609
 in case this belief was wrong 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.779
 because Jesus omits to draw his apostles out of error on all occasions 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:02:59.849
 what 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.409
 uu for it 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.399
 this would have been exceptional 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:06.149
 you have to was a teacher 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:09.589
 state urged 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.779
 curiously Pablo were like a Pharisee 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:17.489
 a fervent believer in the preexistence of the spirit as 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.579
 reveals the following passage in the first chapter contempt 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:26.619
 according to he chose them in him before the foundation of the world 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.230
 we were holy and without spot before him in the hill even 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.140
 flavio josefo the renowned Jewish historian 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.140
 in documents found a few decades ago 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.969
 left written record 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.860
 that the doctrine of reincarnation 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.620
 It was widely accepted in the Jewish people during the time of Jesus the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.100
 Pharisees taught a doctrine included the belief in angels 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.050
 spirits and the migration of the soul other games 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:07.340
 joseph wrote that the Pharisees sect which belonged tarsus taro 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.040
 known as Saint Paul believed that the souls of bad men will be 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.920
 punished after death 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.919
 and that the souls of good men were given the power to rectify and 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.919
 live inside other ports again 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.569
 josefo also records that the Essenes believed intel to the month so much 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:35.520
 immortal as preexisting both principles necessary for belief 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.960
 in reincarnation 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.070
 and there are also current testimonies about reincarnation 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.140
 including taxes
