for<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.150> heavier<00:03:09.420> one<00:03:09.660> because<00:03:10.440> now<00:03:10.829> we<00:03:10.890> have

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
for the heavier one because now we have

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.170 
for the heavier one because now we have
a<00:03:12.200> Minotaur<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.950> half<00:03:17.190> fiend

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
a Minotaur so this is the half fiend

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.920 
a Minotaur so this is the half fiend
Minotaur<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.790> he's<00:03:20.790> actually<00:03:21.060> pretty<00:03:21.360> big<00:03:21.630> so

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
Minotaur and he's actually pretty big so

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.410 
Minotaur and he's actually pretty big so
give<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.040> quick<00:03:23.280> comparison<00:03:23.459> that's<00:03:24.269> a

give you a quick comparison that's a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.330 
give you a quick comparison that's a
human<00:03:24.780> -<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.530> Minotaur<00:03:27.650> that's<00:03:28.650> pretty<00:03:29.010> huge

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340
