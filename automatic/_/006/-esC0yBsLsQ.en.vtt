00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.579 
motion okay now what's important about
this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.190> first<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.360> would<00:00:57.839> suggest<00:00:58.049> for<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.470> to

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
this is first I would suggest for you to

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.479 
this is first I would suggest for you to
take<00:00:58.799> a<00:00:59.040> lower<00:00:59.640> stance<00:01:00.150> than<00:01:00.780> normal<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.739> wider

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.280 
take a lower stance than normal a wider
stance<00:01:02.909> because<00:01:03.269> this<00:01:03.720> is<00:01:03.869> all<00:01:04.019> about

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
stance because this is all about

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.649 
stance because this is all about
structure<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:05.250> since<00:01:06.030> we're<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> be

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
structure we since we're not going to be

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.560 
structure we since we're not going to be
using<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.110> much<00:01:07.260> arm<00:01:07.590> movement<00:01:08.390> okay<00:01:09.390> as

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
using so much arm movement okay as

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.690 
using so much arm movement okay as
compared<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.619> we're<00:01:10.920> holding<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
compared to if we're holding this in the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.690 
compared to if we're holding this in the
standard<00:01:12.119> grip<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.320> had<00:01:13.500> an<00:01:14.310> Escrima

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
standard grip or if we had an Escrima

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.060 
standard grip or if we had an Escrima
stick<00:01:15.320> everything<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.440> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.830> pretty

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
stick everything is going to be pretty

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.310 
stick everything is going to be pretty
compact<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.909> everything<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.200> depend

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
compact so everything is going to depend

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.320 
compact so everything is going to depend
on<00:01:20.130> your<00:01:20.340> structure<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.060> what's<00:01:21.210> going

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
on your structure this is what's going

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.390 
on your structure this is what's going
to<00:01:21.390> give<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.659> your<00:01:21.960> power<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.890> ability<00:01:23.159> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to give you your power is the ability to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700 
to give you your power is the ability to
put<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:23.880> body<00:01:24.150> behind<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.229> strike<00:01:25.530> right

I'm leaning into each strike and a lot
of<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.850> motion<00:02:03.179> comes<00:02:03.390> from<00:02:03.569> the<00:02:03.659> wrist<00:02:03.869> so

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
of the motion comes from the wrist so

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.749 
of the motion comes from the wrist so
it's<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.289> so<00:02:04.499> much<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.920> arms<00:02:05.280> are<00:02:05.429> moving

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
are all steps this is stab involves the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.210 
are all steps this is stab involves the
wrist<00:02:11.910> right<00:02:12.090> here<00:02:12.319> another<00:02:13.319> stab<00:02:13.680> involving

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
wrist right here another stab involving

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.780 
wrist right here another stab involving
the<00:02:14.340> wrist

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
the wrist

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.480 
the wrist
once<00:02:15.510> again<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.780> body<00:02:15.990> comes<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.470> right<00:02:17.100> here

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
once again the body comes in right here

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.059 
once again the body comes in right here
the<00:02:17.970> body<00:02:18.300> comes<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.860> lot<00:02:20.040> of

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
the body comes in and it's a lot of

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.190 
the body comes in and it's a lot of
wrist<00:02:20.370> motion<00:02:20.640> going<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.180> right<00:02:21.330> here<00:02:21.630> then

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
wrist motion going in right here then

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.070 
wrist motion going in right here then
one<00:02:22.700> two<00:02:23.750> three<00:02:24.800> four<00:02:25.880> five<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.230> six

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
one two three four five and six

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.870 
one two three four five and six
okay<00:02:29.710> so<00:02:29.770> now<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.430> little<00:02:30.610> bit<00:02:30.820> more

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
okay so now a little bit more

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.850 
okay so now a little bit more
realistically<00:02:31.600> we're<00:02:31.870> gonna<00:02:31.960> go<00:02:32.170> into<00:02:32.410> single

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
realistically we're gonna go into single

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.840 
realistically we're gonna go into single
blade<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:34.060> form<00:02:34.420> still<00:02:35.140> stays<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.440> same<00:02:35.620> okay

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
blade the form still stays the same okay

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.850 
blade the form still stays the same okay

just go one strike two strike three a
little<00:03:29.530> bit<00:03:29.650> more<00:03:29.830> practical<00:03:30.460> and<00:03:30.670> probably<00:03:31.180> a

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
little bit more practical and probably a

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.870 
little bit more practical and probably a
little<00:03:31.540> bit<00:03:31.720> harder<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.080> do<00:03:32.350> is<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:33.310> transfer

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
little bit harder to do is to transfer

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.650 
little bit harder to do is to transfer
this<00:03:34.239> Tiger<00:03:34.870> Claw<00:03:35.140> into<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.709> grab<00:03:36.220> okay<00:03:36.820> so<00:03:37.540> it's

gonna be one and in right here you're
grabbing<00:03:40.270> them<00:03:40.720> which<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.709> number<00:03:41.860> two<00:03:42.360> -

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
grabbing them which is number two -

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.090 
grabbing them which is number two -
you're<00:03:43.570> number<00:03:43.750> three<00:03:43.900> strike<00:03:44.500> right<00:03:44.709> here
