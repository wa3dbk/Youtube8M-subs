00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.119
 I almost do not remember because I thought of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.169
 study the architecture career 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.360
 I have to make a memory effort 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:14.039
 but the truth is that I liked 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.010
 a lot of mathematics that's true 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.900
 I always loved mathematics 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.400
 I also liked to draw although I do not know 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.190
 I was especially good, huh, but I 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.320
 I liked expressing ideas very much 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.030
 things that occurred to me so I 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.610
 suppose that with those two conditions was 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.699
 a good science person I started my 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.859
 race with some fear because then 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.199
 they all told you it was a very career 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.290
 difficult very difficult the race for me 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.810
 It was a beautiful adventure 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.640
 it is true that it is very hard is true 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.740
 that we studied a lot but we 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.370
 is so nice time ever the 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.560
 race is so exciting in the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.810
 architecture that one always finds 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.790
 great compensations I also had the 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.860
 lucky to have the best teacher who has 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.570
 had this school the immense luck of 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.480
 have the teacher be Indian as iza 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.360
 professor marked my career in this 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.570
 school when the race finishes yes that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.180
 I remember the day I came to see the notes 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.190
 in a list 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.030
 I saw that the race had ended 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.530
 with very good grades and I went back 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.869
 quite 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.000
 sad with that feeling of emptiness that 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.619
 produces having finished a stage and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.869
 not knowing what comes next I had 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.990
 also a huge fortune because the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.360
 professor rafael moneo at very little time 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.729
 to finish offered me the possibility of 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.240
 be a grantee with him in the subject of 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.100
 composition those years that I was with him 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.840
 I learned a lot and this gave me a 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.240
 momentum also to continue 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.060
 thinking what I had thought before 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.729
 with that entity and zaira that teaching 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.580
 I was interested as much as the exercise 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.310
 of the profession when I had the first 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.399
 opportunity to work in a studio 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.810
 launch professional work in Spain 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.300
 Then there was the opportunity to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.039
 enter contests contests 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.659
 anonymous 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:11.220
 that's how I set my studio always 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.530
 with collaborators who work with me and 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.930
 which are fundamental because our 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.400
 work is a team effort 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.459
 architect 's work is a work in 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.840
 team recently some architects 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.330
 american 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.700
 they told me that the presence was not noticeable 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.640
 of the Spanish architects to me 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.519
 This statement was very surprised because 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.170
 we are now very aware of 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.480
 that there are many women architects of 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.330
 made more than 50% of the students of 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.769
 this school are women women 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.660
 Spanish architects had 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.879
 they have a lot to do we have a lot that 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.610
 do we still have to throw ourselves to 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.260
 what we consider that we are 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.510
 trained 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.370
 I got a chair in 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.849
 architectural projects makes very few 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.880
 months and I would like with good from my 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.459
 humble position convince many 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.519
 women many architects that are 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.560
 absolutely capable and that only 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.470
 they need to be believed and that 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.750
 launch it with great force and with 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.200
 a lot of good work one of the keys 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.079
 of the success of this school is the student body 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.480
 and another one of the keys is the teaching staff 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.220
 the students 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.950
 that they access the school as there is a 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.709
 note of very high cut are students with 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.480
 a very high intellectual capacity but 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.940
 They are also students who have a vocation 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.580
 because this career is vocational 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.989
 transmits that vocation for teaching 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.780
 from teachers to disciples for 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.330
 many generations a case for example 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.030
 the one of my generation was that of 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.489
 professor manuel of the houses that we 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.400
 called five or six people from me 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.470
 promotion for us to give class and 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.079
 since then I believe that many of the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.510
 that Manuel de las Casas convened have been 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.430
 become very important teachers 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.900
 not only from this school but from schools 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.450
 like harvard or like princeton because they are 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.069
 not only good teachers at the level 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.900
 national and international 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.810
 they are also excellent professionals 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.780
 this is the other important issue 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.320
 us in general who exercises as 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.030
 professor exercises as a professional and this 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.519
 gives a very important dimension to 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.229
 teaching 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.729
 this is one of the characteristics that 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.770
 they make the school architecture of the 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.669
 Polytechnical University of Madrid is 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.210
 unique and be excellent and one of the 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.210
 World's greatest
