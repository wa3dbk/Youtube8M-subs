00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.270 
the Peace Corps or they may get jobs
directly<00:02:35.780> with<00:02:36.020> agencies<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.680> work<00:02:37.070> in

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
directly with agencies that work in

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.090 
directly with agencies that work in
agriculture<00:02:37.700> development<00:02:38.480> worldwide

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.920 

so<00:02:46.100> in<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.340> area<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.640> biofuels<00:02:47.360> we're<00:02:47.630> looking

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
so in the area of biofuels we're looking

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.990 
so in the area of biofuels we're looking
at<00:02:48.050> biomass<00:02:48.560> production<00:02:49.100> of<00:02:49.430> certain<00:02:49.700> crops

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
at biomass production of certain crops

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.170 
at biomass production of certain crops
so<00:02:50.330> we<00:02:50.780> see<00:02:50.960> how<00:02:51.140> much<00:02:51.610> vegetative<00:02:52.610> biomass

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
so we see how much vegetative biomass

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.550 
so we see how much vegetative biomass
crops<00:02:53.600> can<00:02:53.810> produce<00:02:53.990> under<00:02:54.380> different

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
crops can produce under different

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.970 
crops can produce under different
management<00:02:55.120> conditions<00:02:56.120> under<00:02:56.600> different

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
management conditions under different

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.550 
management conditions under different
environmental<00:02:57.980> conditions<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.960> we<00:02:59.960> also<00:03:00.260> do

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
environmental conditions and we also do

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.560 
environmental conditions and we also do
the<00:03:00.740> process<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.340> help<00:03:01.550> in<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.940> processing

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
the process of help in the processing

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.030 
the process of help in the processing
side<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.990> it<00:03:03.110> about<00:03:03.200> which<00:03:03.500> would<00:03:03.710> be<00:03:03.830> better

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
side of it about which would be better

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.270 
side of it about which would be better
for<00:03:04.450> producing<00:03:05.450> things<00:03:05.630> like<00:03:05.810> ethanol<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:07.070> we

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
for producing things like ethanol and we

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.590 
for producing things like ethanol and we
look<00:03:07.460> at<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.670> also<00:03:07.820> from<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.210> genetic

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
look at it also from the genetic

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.390 
look at it also from the genetic
standpoint<00:03:08.870> as<00:03:09.230> well<00:03:09.410> can<00:03:09.650> we<00:03:09.680> modify<00:03:10.340> the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
standpoint as well can we modify the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.840 
standpoint as well can we modify the
plant<00:03:10.820> via<00:03:11.150> better<00:03:11.750> biomass<00:03:12.440> plan<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.730> the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
plant via better biomass plan and the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.160 
plant via better biomass plan and the
majority<00:03:14.300> of<00:03:14.330> plant<00:03:14.630> breeders<00:03:14.960> in<00:03:15.140> the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
majority of plant breeders in the

majority of plant breeders in the
agronomy<00:03:15.710> Department<00:03:16.160> are<00:03:16.220> going<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.430> be
