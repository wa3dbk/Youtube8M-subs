00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.909 

I<00:00:01.609> always<00:00:02.540> think<00:00:02.750> as<00:00:02.900> a<00:00:02.929> writer<00:00:03.170> my<00:00:03.409> first<00:00:03.679> job

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:03.919 
I always think as a writer my first job

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.089 
I always think as a writer my first job
is<00:00:04.069> to<00:00:04.100> entertain<00:00:05.170> on<00:00:06.170> top<00:00:06.559> of<00:00:06.680> that<00:00:06.830> you<00:00:07.010> know

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.600 
is to entertain on top of that you know

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
I think that good writing is like

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.130 
I think that good writing is like
