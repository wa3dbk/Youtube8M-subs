of<00:02:35.330> up<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.140> downs<00:02:36.410> with<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:37.990> engine<00:02:38.990> hoist

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
of up and downs with the engine hoist

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.230 
of up and downs with the engine hoist
there's<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.640> whole<00:02:40.790> crate<00:02:42.280> I'll<00:02:43.280> cut<00:02:43.820> up<00:02:43.850> and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
there's the whole crate I'll cut up and

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.320 
there's the whole crate I'll cut up and
put<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:46.570> garbage<00:02:47.570> can<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:50.030> here's

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
put in the garbage can and here's

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.420 
put in the garbage can and here's
everything<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:51.050> comes<00:02:51.350> with<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.920> end

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
everything that comes with the end

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.170 
everything that comes with the end
here's<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.090> way<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.330> comes<00:02:53.540> right<00:02:53.780> out<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.959> the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
here's the way it comes right out of the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.430 
here's the way it comes right out of the
crate<00:02:57.160> those<00:02:58.160> are<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.610> pads<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.450> the<00:03:00.140> plates

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
crate those are the pads and the plates

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.040 
crate those are the pads and the plates
that<00:03:01.000> go<00:03:02.000> underneath<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.480> car

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
that go underneath the car

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.699 
that go underneath the car
that's<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:04.280> still<00:03:04.550> in<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.790> bubble<00:03:05.120> wrap<00:03:05.709> the

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
that's is still in a bubble wrap the

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.860 
that's is still in a bubble wrap the
hoses<00:03:07.160> everything<00:03:07.640> that's<00:03:07.820> exactly<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.720> way

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
hoses everything that's exactly the way

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:17.290 
hoses everything that's exactly the way
it<00:03:09.020> came<00:03:09.200> out<00:03:09.440> of<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:11.200> out<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:13.810> crate<00:03:16.300> you

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
it came out of the out of the crate you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.520 
it came out of the out of the crate you
have<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.570> be<00:03:17.720> careful<00:03:18.200> with<00:03:18.350> this<00:03:18.470> thing

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
have to be careful with this thing

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.710 
have to be careful with this thing
because<00:03:18.890> it's<00:03:19.070> got<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.430> come<00:03:19.610> out<00:03:19.820> because<00:03:20.480> it

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
because it's got to come out because it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.180 
because it's got to come out because it
is<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:21.200> scissors<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.030> can't<00:03:23.570> like<00:03:24.440> those

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
is a scissors so you can't like those

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.699 
is a scissors so you can't like those
crossmembers<00:03:26.000> back<00:03:26.239> there<00:03:26.510> can't<00:03:27.260> pick<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.500> up

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
crossmembers back there can't pick it up

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.650 
crossmembers back there can't pick it up
by<00:03:27.890> then<00:03:28.130> because<00:03:28.580> that's<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.030> top<00:03:29.269> it's<00:03:29.570> not

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
by then because that's the top it's not

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.070 
by then because that's the top it's not
the<00:03:29.930> bottom<00:03:30.110> so<00:03:30.820> also<00:03:31.820> it<00:03:31.880> does<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:32.840> top

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
the bottom so also it does is the top

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.460 
the bottom so also it does is the top
comes<00:03:33.410> up<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.860> nothing<00:03:34.280> else<00:03:34.430> moves<00:03:34.760> so<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.470> is

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
comes up and nothing else moves so it is

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.090 
comes up and nothing else moves so it is
a<00:03:37.810> little<00:03:38.810> bit<00:03:39.080> rough<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.530> get<00:03:39.680> out<00:03:39.830> of<00:03:40.010> the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
a little bit rough to get out of the

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.420 
a little bit rough to get out of the
container<00:03:40.720> easily<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:41.900> mean<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.590> comes<00:03:42.800> out<00:03:43.100> but

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
container easily I mean it comes out but

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.210 
container easily I mean it comes out but
you<00:03:43.580> just<00:03:43.610> have<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.000> take<00:03:44.150> your<00:03:44.390> time<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:45.220> get

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
you just have to take your time and get

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.850 
you just have to take your time and get
some<00:03:46.430> two<00:03:46.610> by<00:03:46.760> fours<00:03:46.790> four<00:03:47.420> by<00:03:47.600> fours<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.320> pick

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
some two by fours four by fours and pick

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.160 
some two by fours four by fours and pick
it<00:03:49.010> up<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.280> move<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.550> around<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.930> then

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
it up and move it around and then

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.770 
it up and move it around and then
there's<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.760> box<00:03:52.760> that's<00:03:53.120> going<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.390> get<00:03:53.540> open

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
there's the box that's going to get open

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.250 
there's the box that's going to get open
next<00:03:55.269> so<00:03:56.269> I<00:03:56.330> can<00:03:56.510> get<00:03:56.630> this<00:03:56.780> thing<00:03:56.840> turned

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
next so I can get this thing turned

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.979 
next so I can get this thing turned
around<00:03:57.519> but<00:03:58.519> that's<00:03:58.640> uh<00:03:58.880> that's<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.540> handle

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
around but that's uh that's the handle

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.479 
around but that's uh that's the handle
that<00:04:00.230> comes<00:04:00.530> with<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:01.989> with<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.290> crate<00:04:03.890> not

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
that comes with the with the crate not

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.050 
that comes with the with the crate not
the<00:04:04.730> box<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.720> those<00:04:06.590> five<00:04:06.890> items<00:04:07.160> come<00:04:07.730> packed

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
the box so those five items come packed

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.720 
the box so those five items come packed
with<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.660> N<00:04:09.110> or<00:04:09.290> loose<00:04:09.530> two<00:04:10.010> in<00:04:10.220> there<00:04:10.430> but

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
with the N or loose two in there but

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.539 
with the N or loose two in there but
nothing<00:04:11.239> damaged<00:04:11.930> what<00:04:12.530> even<00:04:12.799> scratched<00:04:13.220> or

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
nothing damaged what even scratched or

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.650 
nothing damaged what even scratched or
anything<00:04:13.790> so<00:04:14.590> it's<00:04:15.590> all<00:04:15.769> done<00:04:16.040> with<00:04:16.250> plywood

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
anything so it's all done with plywood

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.539 
anything so it's all done with plywood
actually<00:04:17.660> I<00:04:17.840> mean<00:04:18.140> I<00:04:18.229> cut<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.890> hell<00:04:19.040> out<00:04:19.250> of<00:04:19.280> it

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
actually I mean I cut the hell out of it

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.960 
actually I mean I cut the hell out of it
but<00:04:19.870> you<00:04:20.870> know<00:04:20.930> it's<00:04:21.080> all<00:04:21.229> like<00:04:21.520> now<00:04:22.520> maybe

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
but you know it's all like now maybe

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.510 
but you know it's all like now maybe
half<00:04:23.270> inch<00:04:23.800> 5/8<00:04:24.800> something

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
half inch 5/8 something

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.330 
half inch 5/8 something
at<00:04:25.639> 9/16<00:04:26.419> I<00:04:26.569> would<00:04:26.750> imagine<00:04:27.039> you<00:04:28.039> know<00:04:28.130> one<00:04:28.310> of

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
at 9/16 I would imagine you know one of

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.860 
at 9/16 I would imagine you know one of
their<00:04:28.610> magic<00:04:29.120> metric<00:04:29.870> numbers<00:04:30.880> but<00:04:31.880> there<00:04:32.750> you

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
their magic metric numbers but there you

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.890 
their magic metric numbers but there you
have<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.280> all<00:04:34.280> right<00:04:34.460> I'm<00:04:35.030> going<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.360> open<00:04:35.780> up

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
have it all right I'm going to open up

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.529 
have it all right I'm going to open up
the<00:04:36.050> box<00:04:36.259> in<00:04:36.650> so<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.669> I<00:04:37.729> can<00:04:37.970> hook<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.270> up<00:04:38.360> to

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
the box in so that I can hook it up to

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:39.939 
the box in so that I can hook it up to
the<00:04:38.660> front<00:04:38.840> there<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:39.199> get<00:04:39.410> it<00:04:39.530> turned<00:04:39.680> round

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
the front there and get it turned round

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.909 
the front there and get it turned round
of<00:04:40.160> course<00:04:40.400> I<00:04:40.699> had<00:04:41.210> a<00:04:41.240> 50-50<00:04:42.020> chance<00:04:42.050> which<00:04:42.680> way

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
of course I had a 50-50 chance which way

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.170 
of course I had a 50-50 chance which way
this<00:04:43.099> thing<00:04:43.310> was<00:04:43.460> going<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.639> come<00:04:43.729> out<00:04:43.910> of<00:04:44.000> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
this thing was going to come out of the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.350 
this thing was going to come out of the
box<00:04:45.099> not<00:04:46.099> it's<00:04:46.280> in<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.490> garage<00:04:46.639> of<00:04:47.090> course

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
box not it's in the garage of course

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.760 
box not it's in the garage of course
it's<00:04:48.520> in<00:04:49.520> here<00:04:50.090> backwards<00:04:50.930> so<00:04:51.199> I<00:04:51.229> got<00:04:51.470> to<00:04:51.590> turn

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
it's in here backwards so I got to turn

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.070
