to do is go ahead and cut some sticks to
length<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.510> come<00:00:51.719> back<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.110> trim<00:00:52.379> them

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
length you can come back and trim them

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.010 
length you can come back and trim them
later<00:00:52.770> with<00:00:53.129> your<00:00:53.250> saw<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.629> want<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> make

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
later with your saw and you want to make

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.099 
later with your saw and you want to make
sure<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.320> these<00:00:56.219> sticks<00:00:56.640> fit<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.930> here

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
sure that these sticks fit up in here

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.580 
sure that these sticks fit up in here
properly<00:00:58.440> where<00:00:58.949> there's<00:00:59.129> no<00:00:59.340> gaps<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.590> once

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
properly where there's no gaps and once

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.070 
properly where there's no gaps and once
you<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.370> you're<00:01:02.609> going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> take

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
you do that then you're going to take

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.530 
you do that then you're going to take
two<00:01:04.080> sticks<00:01:04.440> like<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.370> we're<00:01:06.240> basically

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
two sticks like this and we're basically

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.850 
two sticks like this and we're basically
it's<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.080> essentially<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> same

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
it's going to be essentially the same

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.400 
it's going to be essentially the same
way<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> chozo<00:01:08.730> raft<00:01:09.030> you're<00:01:09.990> basically<00:01:10.350> just

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
way the chozo raft you're basically just

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.050 
way the chozo raft you're basically just
going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.770> lash<00:01:10.980> this<00:01:11.250> together<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
going to lash this together just like a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.930 
going to lash this together just like a
raft<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.690> I<00:01:12.840> talked<00:01:13.110> about<00:01:13.230> and<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
raft like I talked about and this is the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.360 
raft like I talked about and this is the
first<00:01:14.970> side<00:01:15.480> and<00:01:15.870> it<00:01:16.860> doesn't<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.340> be

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
first side and it doesn't have to be

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.670 
first side and it doesn't have to be
just<00:01:17.490> crazy<00:01:17.940> tight<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.140> tighten<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.590> up

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
just crazy tight you can tighten it up

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.370 
just crazy tight you can tighten it up
later<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.450> make<00:01:21.630> sure<00:01:21.660> that<00:01:22.050> this<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
later and just make sure that this is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.890 
later and just make sure that this is
all<00:01:22.530> jammed<00:01:22.920> packed<00:01:23.220> together<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:24.000> then

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
all jammed packed together and then

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.530 
all jammed packed together and then
we're<00:01:25.050> going<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.230> do<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> other<00:01:25.680> side<00:01:26.010> so<00:01:26.540> feed

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
we're going to do the other side so feed

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.350 
we're going to do the other side so feed
that<00:01:27.720> in

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.140 

here's<00:01:32.080> what<00:01:32.350> we're<00:01:32.500> looking<00:01:32.770> for<00:01:33.150> basically

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
here's what we're looking for basically

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.730 
here's what we're looking for basically
you're<00:01:34.840> going<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.020> have<00:01:35.200> one<00:01:35.410> side<00:01:35.680> that's

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
you're going to have one side that's

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.650 
you're going to have one side that's
really<00:01:36.220> crank<00:01:36.520> down<00:01:36.790> and<00:01:37.180> then<00:01:37.450> we're<00:01:37.570> going

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
really crank down and then we're going

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.360 
really crank down and then we're going
to<00:01:37.720> come<00:01:37.960> back<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.380> trim<00:01:38.650> this<00:01:38.830> into<00:01:39.280> the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
to come back and trim this into the

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.950 
to come back and trim this into the
length<00:01:39.610> we<00:01:39.790> need<00:01:40.000> or<00:01:40.180> you<00:01:40.270> can<00:01:40.450> pre<00:01:40.690> measure

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
length we need or you can pre measure

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.690 
length we need or you can pre measure
that<00:01:41.230> you<00:01:41.890> want<00:01:42.100> there's<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.370> lot<00:01:42.550> of<00:01:42.580> different

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
that you want there's a lot of different

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.580 
that you want there's a lot of different
ways<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.120> set<00:01:43.540> this<00:01:43.720> up<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:44.500> don't

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
ways to set this up you don't

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.560 
ways to set this up you don't
necessarily<00:01:44.830> have<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.460> have<00:01:45.610> this<00:01:45.940> bottom<00:01:46.360> bar

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
necessarily have to have this bottom bar

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.350 
necessarily have to have this bottom bar
on<00:01:46.870> here<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:48.010> makes<00:01:48.550> it<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.760> little<00:01:48.940> bit<00:01:49.120> less

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
on here it makes it a little bit less

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.260 
on here it makes it a little bit less
work<00:01:49.690> as<00:01:50.320> far<00:01:50.650> as<00:01:50.890> making<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.460> conform<00:01:51.940> to<00:01:52.150> the

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
work as far as making it conform to the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.480 
work as far as making it conform to the
inner<00:01:52.420> port<00:01:52.780> part<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.560> trap<00:01:53.860> you<00:01:54.220> know<00:01:54.370> as

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
inner port part of the trap you know as

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.620 
inner port part of the trap you know as
far<00:01:54.520> as<00:01:54.790> fitting<00:01:55.150> in<00:01:55.360> so<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:57.450> lot<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.479> different

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
far as fitting in so a lot of different

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.450 
far as fitting in so a lot of different
ways<00:01:58.900> you<00:01:59.020> can<00:01:59.170> set<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.500> up<00:01:59.680> and<00:01:59.860> now<00:02:00.130> all<00:02:00.340> we're

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
ways you can set it up and now all we're

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.359 
ways you can set it up and now all we're
going<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:00.610> do<00:02:00.790> is<00:02:00.910> take<00:02:01.090> this<00:02:01.330> side<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.369> trim

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
going to do is take this side and trim

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.070 
going to do is take this side and trim
it<00:02:03.490> off<00:02:05.670> all<00:02:06.670> right<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.090> here's<00:02:07.119> basically<00:02:07.810> the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
it off all right so here's basically the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.199 
it off all right so here's basically the
finished<00:02:08.410> product<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.700> want<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.000> try<00:02:10.149> to

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
finished product you want to try to

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.860 
finished product you want to try to
custom<00:02:10.720> fit<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.880> base<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.390> some<00:02:13.780> of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
custom fit this to the base and some of

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.390 
custom fit this to the base and some of
this<00:02:13.959> stuff<00:02:14.200> can<00:02:14.410> move<00:02:14.590> around<00:02:14.709> its<00:02:15.130> fine

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
this stuff can move around its fine

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.979 
this stuff can move around its fine
there's<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.760> little<00:02:15.940> bit<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.300> gap<00:02:16.510> on<00:02:16.780> both

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
there's a little bit of a gap on both

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.110 
there's a little bit of a gap on both
sides<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.440> these<00:02:17.560> either<00:02:17.830> way<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.820> all<00:02:18.970> you

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
sides of these either way and all you

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.110 
sides of these either way and all you
all<00:02:19.450> I've<00:02:19.630> done<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:20.170> tied<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.220> off<00:02:21.489> with<00:02:22.090> a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
all I've done is tied this off with a

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.840 
all I've done is tied this off with a
couple<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.540> pieces<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.930> string<00:02:23.290> here<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:24.520> then

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
couple of pieces of string here and then

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.300 
couple of pieces of string here and then
we've<00:02:25.000> got<00:02:25.030> one<00:02:25.420> piece<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.840> string<00:02:26.080> here<00:02:26.590> and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
we've got one piece of string here and

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.740 
we've got one piece of string here and
that<00:02:27.489> will<00:02:27.580> help<00:02:27.760> stretch<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.300> frame<00:02:28.570> of<00:02:28.720> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
that will help stretch the frame of the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.460 
that will help stretch the frame of the
door<00:02:28.810> out<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:30.070> got<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.220> loop<00:02:30.520> on<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.940> end

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
door out and it's got a loop on the end

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.180 
door out and it's got a loop on the end
and<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:33.550> just<00:02:33.760> secure<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:36.040> then

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
and you just secure it to that and then

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.900 
and you just secure it to that and then
basically<00:02:36.450> you've<00:02:37.450> got<00:02:37.690> yourself<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.910> portable

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
basically you've got yourself a portable

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.759 
basically you've got yourself a portable
animal<00:02:40.299> container<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:41.110> know<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.290> catch<00:02:41.590> the

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
animal container you know you catch the

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.430 
animal container you know you catch the
animal<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.640> if<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.720> haven't<00:02:43.900> seen<00:02:44.290> how

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
animal in it and if you haven't seen how

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.990 
animal in it and if you haven't seen how
to<00:02:44.500> construct<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.160> make<00:02:45.459> sure<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:45.760> check

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
to construct this make sure you check

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.880 
to construct this make sure you check
out<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.239> video<00:02:46.630> on<00:02:46.690> how<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.140> build<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.709> live

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
out the video on how to build the live

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.190 
out the video on how to build the live
game<00:02:47.920> box<00:02:48.459> trap<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.120> then<00:02:49.480> also<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.930> trigger

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
game box trap and then also the trigger

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.990 
game box trap and then also the trigger
system<00:02:50.500> involved<00:02:51.040> with<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.340> but<00:02:51.820> now<00:02:51.970> that

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
system involved with it but now that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.150 
system involved with it but now that
this<00:02:52.330> is<00:02:52.510> completed<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.650> know<00:02:53.799> once<00:02:54.040> you

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
this is completed you know once you

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.830 
this is completed you know once you
catch<00:02:54.370> your<00:02:54.549> animal<00:02:55.000> then<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:55.450> can<00:02:55.630> basically

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
catch your animal then you can basically

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.870 
catch your animal then you can basically
just<00:02:56.320> submerge<00:02:56.739> them<00:02:56.920> down<00:02:57.070> in<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.280> water<00:02:57.489> you

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
just submerge them down in the water you

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.580 
just submerge them down in the water you
can<00:02:58.060> keep<00:02:58.239> them<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.540> camp<00:02:58.780> however<00:02:59.320> you<00:02:59.410> want

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
can keep them in camp however you want

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.410 
can keep them in camp however you want
to<00:02:59.680> dispatch<00:03:00.040> them<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.820> is<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.000> good<00:03:01.209> way<00:03:01.390> to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
to dispatch them this is a good way to

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.590 
to dispatch them this is a good way to
keep<00:03:01.660> your<00:03:02.170> game<00:03:02.410> live<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:04.000> then<00:03:04.180> also<00:03:04.360> a

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
keep your game live and then also a

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.110 
keep your game live and then also a
simple<00:03:05.500> way<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.709> deal<00:03:06.370> with<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.730> animal

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
simple way to deal with the animal

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.150 
simple way to deal with the animal
without<00:03:07.269> having<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.840> kill<00:03:08.049> it<00:03:08.200> in<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.590> humane

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
without having to kill it in a humane

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.580 
without having to kill it in a humane
way<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.640> mean<00:03:09.850> drowning<00:03:10.239> is<00:03:10.410> squirrels<00:03:11.410> we're

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
way I mean drowning is squirrels we're

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.259 
way I mean drowning is squirrels we're
literally<00:03:11.830> drowning<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:12.640> less<00:03:12.850> than<00:03:13.030> 30

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
literally drowning in less than 30

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.259 
literally drowning in less than 30
seconds<00:03:13.750> they<00:03:13.900> have<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.049> high<00:03:14.350> really<00:03:15.130> high

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
seconds they have a high really high

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.210 
seconds they have a high really high
metabolism<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:16.540> they're<00:03:16.690> either<00:03:16.920> oxygen<00:03:17.920> gets

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
metabolism so they're either oxygen gets

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.160 
metabolism so they're either oxygen gets
sucked<00:03:18.519> up<00:03:18.640> really<00:03:18.910> quickly<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:19.450> it's<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.019> good

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
sucked up really quickly so it's a good

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.110 
sucked up really quickly so it's a good
way<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.380> dispatch<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.130> animals<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.730> that's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
way to dispatch of animals and that's

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.000 
way to dispatch of animals and that's
just<00:03:22.360> another<00:03:22.630> job<00:03:23.019> you<00:03:23.260> know<00:03:23.350> thing<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.830> can

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
just another job you know thing you can

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.430 
just another job you know thing you can
throw<00:03:24.850> into<00:03:25.060> your<00:03:25.150> survival<00:03:25.690> tool<00:03:25.840> box<00:03:26.170> this

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
throw into your survival tool box this

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.110 
throw into your survival tool box this
is<00:03:26.620> one<00:03:26.799> of<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:27.010> main<00:03:27.370> things<00:03:27.670> that<00:03:27.760> we<00:03:27.910> teach

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
is one of the main things that we teach

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.880 
is one of the main things that we teach
out<00:03:28.360> we're<00:03:28.510> doing<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.750> survival<00:03:29.230> trap<00:03:29.440> in<00:03:29.620> class

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
out we're doing a survival trap in class

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.250 
out we're doing a survival trap in class
