00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.139 

so<00:01:50.869> when<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.469> horse<00:01:51.770> was<00:01:51.859> in<00:01:52.219> the<00:01:52.399> pot<00:01:52.609> I<00:01:52.880> was

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
so when the horse was in the pot I was

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.849 
so when the horse was in the pot I was
applying<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.750> little<00:01:53.990> bit<00:01:54.079> of<00:01:54.170> pressure<00:01:54.409> to

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
applying a little bit of pressure to

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.160 
applying a little bit of pressure to
this<00:01:55.100> area<00:01:55.459> to<00:01:56.030> keep<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.390> horse<00:01:56.600> underneath

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
this area to keep the horse underneath

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.300 
this area to keep the horse underneath
the<00:01:57.350> water<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:58.069> all<00:01:58.909> of<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.149> sudden<00:01:59.179> the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
the water and all of a sudden the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.260 
the water and all of a sudden the
plastic<00:02:01.310> gave<00:02:01.729> in

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
plastic gave in

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.690 
plastic gave in
so<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:03.049> resulted<00:02:03.530> in<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.920> horse<00:02:04.130> becoming

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
so that resulted in the horse becoming

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.830 
so that resulted in the horse becoming
basically<00:02:05.689> flat<00:02:06.319> then<00:02:07.039> I<00:02:07.069> thought<00:02:07.609> I<00:02:07.819> see<00:02:08.660> what

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
basically flat then I thought I see what

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.059 
basically flat then I thought I see what
other<00:02:08.989> areas<00:02:09.610> were<00:02:10.840> bendy<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:11.989> his<00:02:12.769> legs

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
other areas were bendy and his legs

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.850 
other areas were bendy and his legs
started<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.150> bend<00:02:14.299> by<00:02:14.629> themselves<00:02:15.290> these<00:02:15.590> two

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
started to bend by themselves these two

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.020 
started to bend by themselves these two
legs<00:02:16.160> are<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.209> very<00:02:17.510> close<00:02:17.780> together<00:02:19.030> this

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
legs are and I very close together this

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.350 
legs are and I very close together this
leg<00:02:20.299> has<00:02:20.690> completely<00:02:21.170> been<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:22.090> warped<00:02:23.090> out

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
leg has completely been and warped out

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.220 
leg has completely been and warped out
of<00:02:23.660> shape<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.819> has<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.480> leg<00:02:26.870> when<00:02:27.200> I

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
of shape and so has this leg when I

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.990 
of shape and so has this leg when I
applied<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.709> little<00:02:27.980> bit<00:02:28.129> of<00:02:28.280> pressure<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.819> this

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
applied a little bit of pressure to this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.300 
applied a little bit of pressure to this
area<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.629> applied<00:02:30.290> some<00:02:30.319> pressure<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.099> neck

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
area I applied some pressure to the neck

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.970 
area I applied some pressure to the neck
which<00:02:32.299> bent<00:02:32.780> his<00:02:33.260> head<00:02:33.590> sideways<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.980> created

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
which bent his head sideways and created

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.920 
which bent his head sideways and created
this<00:02:37.190> angle<00:02:38.950> then<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.359> wanted<00:02:41.359> to<00:02:41.450> see<00:02:41.599> if<00:02:41.780> the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
this angle then I wanted to see if the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.170 
this angle then I wanted to see if the
face<00:02:42.200> could<00:02:42.709> be<00:02:42.769> distorted<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.970> could

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
face could be distorted and it could

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.610 
face could be distorted and it could
clearly<00:02:46.090> I'm<00:02:47.090> not<00:02:47.630> sure<00:02:47.810> if<00:02:47.900> his<00:02:48.049> ears<00:02:48.319> went

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
clearly I'm not sure if his ears went

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.849 
clearly I'm not sure if his ears went
out<00:02:48.769> of<00:02:48.920> shape<00:02:49.130> by<00:02:49.310> themselves<00:02:50.079> but<00:02:51.079> his<00:02:51.500> ear

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
out of shape by themselves but his ear

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:57.099 
out of shape by themselves but his ear
has<00:02:52.370> been<00:02:52.639> over<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:54.639> his<00:02:55.639> face<00:02:56.079> has<00:02:57.079> been

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
has been over and his face has been

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:07.559 
has been over and his face has been
squished<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:57.980> on<00:02:58.280> itself

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.879 

so<00:03:08.569> now<00:03:08.780> he<00:03:08.840> looks<00:03:09.349> like<00:03:09.469> a<00:03:10.010> demon<00:03:10.640> pony
