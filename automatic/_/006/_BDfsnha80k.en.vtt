00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 yes 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.900
 with giving us a little bit to tell the 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.760
 routine people on the other side 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.230
 where are we that are presenting and 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.270
 how important is this for you 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.599
 launch for us very important 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.050
 because we continue to complete our range 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:31.080
 we the truth that with him with the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.290
 arrival of the pickup that will come to 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.080
 end of the year we are somehow 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.430
 finishing launching a bit the range that 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.720
 they exist in the rest of the countries 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.250
 Latin America 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.260
 nissan was a little behind with the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.879
 products that I had here since 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.540
 we take the 2012 brand our 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.450
 goal was to complete the entire range and 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.090
 be the aggressive at the product level 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.969
 as nissan we have them in all 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.160
 countries of america then this is not a 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.690
 vehicle that has already been launched makes a 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.180
 time in latin america we are 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.129
 doing here again inaugurates a 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.509
 segment where nissan did not participate if 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.640
 well was the chip tee is a 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.800
 little higher than in the segment 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.740
 little above is not to replace 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.630
 a car adds us is a very new car is 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.630
 a new car segment Nissan 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.480
 new that he started noticing he did not have a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.090
 product 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.980
 and we talk a little bit about the nou and also 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.800
 of other products that was given to 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.570
 backwardness and those other products that 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.070
 we are waiting, you can still know 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.510
 something there is some confirmation look 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.380
 we thought to launch the product 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.610
 end of the year but good these things back 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.170
 we were very fair we are 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.150
 come in September 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.640
 Burgos throws note in thought 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.070
 November we did not get to November exam 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.780
 December was coming, the year was coming 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.560
 so we decided to postpone it for more 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.720
 today make a launch already entered the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.420
 year then we promised him for more was 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.480
 a commercial strategy there was no 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.430
 let's say now as to what 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.120
 what comes next is the pick up 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.369
 has pick up is scheduled for the 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.920
 second semester we are talking then 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.550
 in October as November already within 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.140
 those months 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.570
 we are discussing here is a real 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.850
 approval process that newly 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.380
 start and that process took you to 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.170
 you in a few months and good 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.970
 it depends as the whole process advances 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.770
 define 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.260
 the launch and he talks to me about the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.750
 importance of the other at the segment level 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.250
 inaugurated new segments as stress to 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.990
 the conquest this segment where there 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.320
 other participants other other actors 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.700
 that have weight within what is of 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.020
 those of the clients on potential 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.900
 customers 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.120
 that has to do that that influences the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.120
 brand that is a brand that is 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.880
 very well recognized in Argentina 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.950
 It is very well positioned 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.160
 it has to do with what the product is 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.480
 It is a very nice product that people 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.060
 like it a lot since we were already 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.700
 testing it seeing that there is a 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.530
 very big expectation for that 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.820
 launch this product and then 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.410
 obviously it has to do with the prices 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.840
 prices a competitive price will be 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.370
 within competing with those with their 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.130
 competitors in the market or be 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.860
 that will be in price and with those three 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.840
 living things there is much expectation of 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.610
 the brand is a brand that is 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.740
 is rediscovering because nissan here in 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.140
 one more brand of trucks than cars 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.450
 and now nissan is selling a lot of auto 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.090
 then they see that these attributes that 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.220
 They have the mark they have these cars to 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.500
 sea ​​that have not been thomas guys and 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.120
 all the products they have are cars 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.010
 that are manufactured in Mexico is a plant 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.800
 which has the best quality ratios 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.220
 from nissan all over the world is the example 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.870
 mexico plant for the world nissan is 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.580
 the plant the mine this same not that 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.050
 was that it comes here is the same as no 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.800
 It is exported to USA 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.150
 then you have a level of quality 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.670
 true that everyone has no problem 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.700
 never then and the customer just knows 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.500
 the client starts in his very faithful client 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.500
 because he never had a problem with his car 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.480
 then it is very easy to sell the 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.890
 renovation let's say then what we 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.200
 it happened that we did not have to give it 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.700
 renew because he started trying scarce 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.560
 in the product that today you have everything and 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.930
 you have running you have the verse in the 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.549
 center you have one out now and it's going to 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.260
 come the spicy and I think today 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.840
 complete then well talking about out and 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.310
 with the center behind your back and not be able 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.230
 to ask yourself first about the 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.580
 modification of the tax subject if 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.020
 that I suppose is a good 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.639
 news see test and also the other 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.270
 news is the renewal of the agreement with 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.240
 Mexico 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.350
 look at the tax issue obviously 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.540
 we for example launch center and 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.550
 we do not launch the exclusive we throw it 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.430
 It was very expensive because of the tax 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.990
 that we had very little volume and now 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.360
 with the modification of the tax and the 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.860
 exclusive is in career let's say and 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.400
 we are bringing volume to sell 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.810
 now what about the subject of some Mexico 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.000
 but very good news we have 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.220
 all in Mexico therefore to 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.310
 we are fundamental the agreement with 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.010
 Mexico 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.690
 we live in 2012 we spent a year 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.520
 difficult when the agreement was denounced 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.870
 but luckily the relationships between 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.960
 Argentina and Mexico improved a lot 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.140
 with this new Mexican president who 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.190
 understood a bit the Argentine position and 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.770
 I think a good agreement was achieved 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.870
 Argentina managed to lower a bit the quota 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.940
 that was his pretension and mexico managed 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.380
 continue being able to contribute to Argentina and 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.990
 good and argentina obviously also 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.310
 you can port to mexico that I think that 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.930
 this type of agreements but have a 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.940
 Brazil's independence so strong serves 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.070
 good and good the end as always is 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.510
 2015 as the lobelle if you have some 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.410
 Surprises to tell you to anticipate 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.490
 to the people solution no surprise is not 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.410
 launch let's say as always 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.360
 we try to launch cars every year 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.240
 we are throwing one out and we are going to 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.880
 finish pick up a car moving what 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.860
 we see is a year of for 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.710
 we same sales as in 2014 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.350
 we kept the sale of 2014 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.700
 2013 and 2015 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.320
 we think that 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.270
 let's go the same and even a little bit more 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.910
 above that also means growing 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.220
 because the market came falling from these 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.200
 years and keeping us that is 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.380
 grow marketer that is a bit our 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.030
 objective and good this year we think with 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.830
 the quota of mexico all cheese is 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.530
 saved and we have good news 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:21.300
 We estimate to maintain the sale and grow a 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.300
 little good many thanks to you 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.639
 i 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.639
 or not
