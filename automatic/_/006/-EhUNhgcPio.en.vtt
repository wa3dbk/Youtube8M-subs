00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 hi clipes today I'm going to do the first 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.370
 iphone 5 boxing of the world and you 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.440
 you will be thinking and because you have the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.880
 iphone 5 already out 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.470
 Because I'll do a boxing one 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.830
 boxing is to say that I'm going to put the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.890
 iphone 5 in your box that you think that 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.740
 it's easy you've ever seen how 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.369
 they pack the apple products 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.430
 come on let's go first the spots 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.610
 that come in this great box and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.610
 wonderful 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.280
 and we 're going to put it first 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.699
 this does not 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:52.000
 so 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:56.020
 this ace and then if I remember correctly came 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.160
 the one from which the volume control and the 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.160
 rest well then a little bit this 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.690
 finished 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.110
 A) Yes 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.110
 we put the cap 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.030
 the box of the spots of course 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.040
 it also has its particular protection 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.340
 so we put it like that 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.120
 we adjust it well we do not want it 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.120
 this is a fudge 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.640
 we put it here 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.640
 the transformer at the same time we put it in 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.140
 your plastic and very carefully that 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.140
 do not stick to all the sites 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.150
 that sticks 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:00.000
 we do so we adjust 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.150
 and we have it we put it 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.430
 in your online site 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.420
 we have to pick it up this way 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.020
 make it a nice 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.020
 ni putin 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.770
 and once we have it that way 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.950
 we put it in your gel plastic 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.790
 it stays like this and goes directly 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.790
 to the box 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.380
 we already have the bottom part resolved 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.510
 hello and these are the peoples brochures and 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.100
 the famous stickers of the apples of 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.580
 apple that are going here in this box 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.580
 we are going to put it 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.549
 potato 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:58.640
 and this is where it goes because the same is the 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.240
 pinchito that serves to take the hand 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.830
 without 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.730
 we put it 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.700
 and once we have it placed 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.930
 we close 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.209
 and we put it here 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.469
 Be careful with putting the little eyelash on 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.829
 up because if not then it costs us 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:19.120
 so much to take it out once we have 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.700
 this 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.260
 we put this part and we already have 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.390
 practically everything finished in the absence of 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.980
 put the plastics to iphone 5 already 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.620
 we have the iphone 5 we already have the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.370
 plastics and now we just need 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.080
 place them carefully 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.930
 so that it looks as if this mobile does not 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:42.040
 he had never touched 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.040
 well we have the back 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.900
 and this is the other way around 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.300
 is what the first unboxing has to do 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.760
 of the world since you can go wrong 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.760
 so we put this the back 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.100
 there 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.760
 and this is the part of the angel 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.760
 and then there is already 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.210
 and we do not have anything else to put it like that and 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.440
 finally 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.440
 put the lid 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.350
 there's still one step left and there's 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.350
 to put the plastic to the box 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.969
 very carefully so that it fits well 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.179
 This is a step of maximum precision 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:40.479
 any mistake can take us to the 

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:44.459
 repeat and throw us here two days or 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.459
 three to put a plastic 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.380
 patience 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.380
 in a corner 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.390
 they have a little bit of that back 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.390
 did some trap 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.670
 we take the air out 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.840
 and look as new as if never 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.120
 I would have opened before this also what you 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.860
 it seems like a little bit of cousin is what 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.540
 I have to do each and every one of the 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.340
 Sometimes they send me a cache to try 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.260
 because before returning it, of course 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.690
 you have to put in balart in the box 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.920
 such good clients I hope you have 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.820
 liked this first one boxing of the world 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.820
 until the next video mom 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.770
 that is, I'm going to put the iphone5 in its 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.770
 box 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.770
 caritas
