I<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:56.219> recommend<00:00:56.339> using<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> seven<00:00:57.210> six

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.419 
I really recommend using the seven six
really<00:00:58.199> seems<00:00:58.499> to<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.739> lot<00:00:58.889> better<00:00:59.010> action

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
really seems to get a lot better action

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.250 
really seems to get a lot better action
but<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> bigger<00:00:59.940> one<00:01:00.179> it's<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.050> just

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
but the bigger one it's not just

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.899 
but the bigger one it's not just
important<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.649> st.<00:01:01.889> Clyde<00:01:02.069> so<00:01:02.370> easy<00:01:02.579> that

anything from seven six seven six would

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.590 
anything from seven six seven six would
be<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> smallest<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.909> want<00:01:06.120> to<00:01:06.180> go<00:01:06.299> and

and this thing will be coming in seven

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.870 
and this thing will be coming in seven
eight<00:01:34.320> nine<00:01:34.560> even<00:01:34.920> ten<00:01:35.100> flip-down<00:01:35.370> if<00:01:35.760> you're

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
eight nine even ten flip-down if you're

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.640 
eight nine even ten flip-down if you're
working<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.270> thing<00:01:36.420> really<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:37.110> slow<00:01:37.620> I

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
working that thing really really slow I

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.080 
working that thing really really slow I
kind<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.980> use<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.160> white<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.580> here<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:38.970> it's

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
kind of use a white one here so it's

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.970 
kind of use a white one here so it's
easier<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.480> see<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> camera<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.860> can

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
easier to see for the camera but you can

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.560 
easier to see for the camera but you can
see<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.280> things<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.760> know<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.330> first
