00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
 Reviews android games on the site android. 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.850
 tivi 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.639
 all with the coming and coming 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.710
 holidays it happened that today we 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.690
 all three games are pixel-on and 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.880
 the first of them is the third in a row 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.520
 game with a character named T-shirts 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.289
 and the game is called jersey boots this time 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.480
 we will fly and collect coins 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.090
 you need to collect everything and also to reach 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.650
 the end of the level quickly at first I thought 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 that this is something flappy bird giving but 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.730
 it turned out wrong we can fly in two 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.040
 parties and kill so some 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.500
 really dangerous things like spikes there 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480
 or all sorts of enemies are always chips 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.550
 This series of games was a heap 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.920
 costumes for the characters for them can 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.780
 buy 4 types of decorations 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.760
 but the strangest in my opinion from this 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.370
 is that there are a bunch of beards and mustaches 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.020
 which can be put on a character girl 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.180
 another interesting u is switching 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.949
 games in retro mode ie graphics 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.110
 which so pixel becomes still 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.760
 more pixel but it looks like it doesn't 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.989
 finalized because I have a game 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.670
 simply hangs in this mode next 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.830
 the game is still in steampunk 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.600
 style here we play for the boy who 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.860
 fights with various evil and the game is very 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.470
 reminds some moments 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.869
 remake mega exchange with dandy are very 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.970
 similar enemies to those who were there 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.250
 you can choose which boss to leave first 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.860
 what then of each of them yet 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.930
 unique weapon falls out but at the same time 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.119
 you obviously won't see it all at once 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.280
 characters drawn excellent animation 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.960
 much more dynamic than the original we 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.420
 We start on the train and we immediately 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.180
 shows the possibilities of physics blowing us off 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.979
 roofs and not only us but also coins for 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.420
 which by the way then you can imagine 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.970
 buy all sorts of things 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.799
 as a result, we have six different locations with 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.960
 your enemies and bosses 6 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.090
 additional weapons open location 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.909
 with all sorts of shops named missions and 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.159
 a bunch of steampunk control simple-minded 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.320
 you have a button left-right button 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.090
 jump and the shooting button is also our 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.250
 character can bounce off walls 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.140
 the truth made them somehow strange because 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.960
 that on any wall you can climb to 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.299
 please some news 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.130
 you've probably heard of the Canadian film 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.160
 comedians set rogen and james free 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.450
 which is called an interview plot in it 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.069
 is that a duet 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.100
 TV journalists are assigned to kill 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.230
 north korean lady 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.460
 and kim chen yna movie premiere 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.080
 put off due to action 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.700
 North Korean hackers hacked 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.290
 sony pictures server 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.050
 entertainment and threatening 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.000
 acts of terrorism on December 25 in 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.100
 the film still came out it was shown at 300 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.750
 cinemas and online ken service in 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.290
 including those with youtube and google 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.810
 play 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.700
 but only for residents of the United States after which he 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.340
 there was a day wall with torrent trackers 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.780
 about a million times and already 29 numbers in 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.730
 google play virus appeared which 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.190
 downloaded like a movie but really 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.990
 it was the edges of this malware 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.910
 steals from android devices financial 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.320
 user information and use 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.420
 mobile devices to remove 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.740
 information from bank cards to their 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.110
 could be used for theft 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.150
 cash from ATMs all trojan 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.310
 about 20 thousand devices are infected but 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.990
 experts assure that this is not the limit 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.000
 the number of infected devices will grow 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.310
 if users will continue to stand 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.180
 suspicious application so be 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.190

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.020

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.330
 nice and and the effects of which are really 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.430

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.710
 eye 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.570
 the story goes a boy whose 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.300

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.130

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.930
 soaring pixels that you open
