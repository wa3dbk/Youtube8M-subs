great map a great seed just to play and
this<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:45.960> actually<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.500> will<00:01:46.770> probably

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
this is one actually I will probably

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.880 
this is one actually I will probably
play<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.409> survive<00:01:49.680> for

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
play in just to see if I can survive for
