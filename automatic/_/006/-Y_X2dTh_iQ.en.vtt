00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:03.280 
install your engineering or in this case

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.940 
install your engineering or in this case
this<00:00:04.280> kind<00:00:04.670> around<00:00:05.660> your<00:00:06.049> frames<00:00:06.560> and<00:00:06.859> the

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
this kind around your frames and the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.480 
this kind around your frames and the
doors<00:00:07.990> you<00:00:08.990> must<00:00:09.230> cut<00:00:09.530> the<00:00:09.559> casing<00:00:10.160> this<00:00:10.429> is

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
doors you must cut the casing this is

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.030 
doors you must cut the casing this is
the<00:00:10.670> casing<00:00:10.910> and<00:00:11.509> what<00:00:12.170> we<00:00:12.259> want<00:00:12.469> to<00:00:12.530> make<00:00:13.009> sure

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
the casing and what we want to make sure

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.820 
the casing and what we want to make sure
is<00:00:13.969> that<00:00:14.000> it<00:00:14.299> kind<00:00:14.480> of<00:00:14.540> slicing<00:00:15.170> really

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
is that it kind of slicing really

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.240 
is that it kind of slicing really
so<00:00:16.280> you<00:00:16.850> actually<00:00:17.600> use<00:00:17.870> it<00:00:18.110> right<00:00:18.890> on<00:00:19.040> top<00:00:19.220> of

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
so you actually use it right on top of

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.460 
so you actually use it right on top of
the<00:00:19.460> padding<00:00:19.910> that<00:00:20.030> you<00:00:20.180> you<00:00:20.900> are<00:00:20.990> able<00:00:21.110> to<00:00:21.170> use

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
the padding that you you are able to use

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.450 
the padding that you you are able to use
I'm<00:00:21.770> using<00:00:22.010> a<00:00:22.340> Bosch<00:00:23.440> oxalate<00:00:24.440> in<00:00:24.590> so<00:00:24.830> it<00:00:25.280> has

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
I'm using a Bosch oxalate in so it has

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.320 
I'm using a Bosch oxalate in so it has
different<00:00:25.670> speeds<00:00:26.680> 12<00:00:27.680> volt<00:00:27.920> battery<00:00:28.330> really

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.940 
different speeds 12 volt battery really
useful<00:00:29.690> for<00:00:29.870> many<00:00:29.990> things<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:30.470> this<00:00:30.590> one<00:00:30.770> has

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
useful for many things and this one has

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.420 
useful for many things and this one has
actually<00:00:31.160> a<00:00:31.430> metal<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.119> it<00:00:32.900> would<00:00:33.350> saw<00:00:33.950> in

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
actually a metal and it would saw in

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.330 
actually a metal and it would saw in

engineer floor and the has a lip to the
continuation<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:48.070> reason<00:01:48.369> is<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.660> closets

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
continuation the reason is that closets

continuation the reason is that closets
are<00:01:49.899> really<00:01:49.930> tricky<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.770> work<00:01:51.009> with<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.610> you

are really tricky to work with and you

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.530 
are really tricky to work with and you
want<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.740> avoid<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:54.610> long<00:01:54.880> long<00:01:55.180> pieces

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
want to avoid the long long pieces

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.660 
want to avoid the long long pieces
