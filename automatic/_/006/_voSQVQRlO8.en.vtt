we could keep going yeah just keep going
I<00:01:33.690> mean<00:01:33.840> we'll<00:01:34.140> break<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.440> into<00:01:34.590> two<00:01:35.010> parts

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
I mean we'll break it into two parts

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.250 
I mean we'll break it into two parts
that<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.640> need<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.510> also<00:01:36.660> shows<00:01:36.990> new

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
that we need to and it also shows new

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.660 
that we need to and it also shows new
character<00:01:37.770> manuela<00:01:39.980> okay<00:01:40.980> we<00:01:41.190> got<00:01:41.310> some<00:01:41.490> time

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
character manuela okay we got some time

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.580 
character manuela okay we got some time
so<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:44.990> like<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.290> doesn't<00:01:46.440> have

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
so it's going like this it doesn't have

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.440 
so it's going like this it doesn't have
to<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.740> over<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.040> shoulder<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:47.700> so

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
to be over the shoulder and I think so

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.150 
to be over the shoulder and I think so
far<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.810> good<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.350> sure<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.800> isn't<00:01:50.130> a
