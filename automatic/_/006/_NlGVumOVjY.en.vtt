00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.400
 Italy is celebrating its 125th birthday this year, but many of them have 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.429
 Mediterranean state without its typical sports cars 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.419
 the numbers will serve in the lab 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.179
 a pound lie 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.539
 and that 's why in sant' Agata you have a very special surprise for the 2 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.380
 0 25 birthday prepares the staff there simply said the 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.640
 best Lamberto Dini ever 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.289
 because we have started 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.579
 to revolutionize the super sports car world 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.480
 a big goal but the new twelve-cylinder has 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.860
 The stuff might not be for everyone at first glance 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.630
 recognizable 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.950
 the revolution is playing its own 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.320
 the new Lamborghini is after 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.120
 in principle of extreme lightweight construction consulted 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.290
 The engineers have the majority of the car made of carbon fiber 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.490
 This known from the formula 1 material is extremely strong and stable 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.250
 but as light as a feather 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.650
 the workers there left as well as daily 1000 575 TEUR the balance together with 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.410
 its 700 hp v12 engine results in a power to weight ratio 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.670
 from just two point three kilos per horsepower this is exactly on the level 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.670
 a PC end 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.200
 Bubeck Europe 6 2 from 4 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.540
 Twelve-cylinder she wanted he is 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.060
 Maximum speed of 3 50 km / h 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.570
 an acceleration from zero to a hundred in fabulous 2 Kor 9 seconds and the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.310
 despite everything, they managed to reduce co2 emissions by 20 percent 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.210
 the gear is also brand new as very light and very emotional with 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.310
 Switching times of 50 Mileys down here and beyond but also the wheel 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.700
 on the completely rebuilt then namely a derivative from the formula 1 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.880
 we are called Push Roth 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.409
 and we are the first he described the percent of this type of suspensions 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.830
 standard on board 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.590
 So we have already sold a lot of vehicles 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.990
 or that are available in the trade or in the trade 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.080
 We already have pre-sale on the moth 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.920
 and of course that's a sensational success for the brand 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.250
 The end of Geneva in early March already in Shanghai as we are there in mid-April is the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.650
 Car sensational arrived below we will be there in the second half of the year 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.969
 to our trade 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.770
 even if the Aventador is up 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.920
 Racetrack gives off a really good figure Brown's Labor as before
