00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.090
 for a walk 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.979
 pale pink but not important 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.280
 very cool detailing of the leash 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.439
 looks like a real after walk from 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.869

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.570

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.810
 so love to gnaw dogs to feed 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.659

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.689

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:31.569

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.389
 here it is on the left side in a backpack 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.689

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.489
 ordinary life behind her will have to clean up after 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.250
 dogs decided to clean even on the street I 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.370

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.620
 clever and cleans up his animals for 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.650

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.379

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.900
 Tolik for something else drawn 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:19.180
 the bones on the bag hint that 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.000
 the bag is still meant for food 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.829

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.129
 animals 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.019
