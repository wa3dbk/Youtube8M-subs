00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.649
 the musical stacks a kind of 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.890
 music in my life 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.830
 we do not know one thing in our life and the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.420
 scenario because it's like another world and 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.190

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.380
 depression I believe but not only us 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.650
 but everyone because that life 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.180
 without music really 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.740
 and good will be the songs you have 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.570
 the fundamentals in your life in what 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.119

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.610
 very good union we fight very few 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:44.830

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:46.870
 nothing nothing a discussion but yes a 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.970
 flamenco come from families and the 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.100

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.930
 It's fine but let's go back a little bit 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.910
 to the essence you know we have taken the step and 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.220

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.750
 he liked the quality of the album but the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.040
 grime a little more the essence of what 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.480

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.100
